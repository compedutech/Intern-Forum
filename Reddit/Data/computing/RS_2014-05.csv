24ewa5,0,2014-04-30,First Summer Internship. Any Advice?,Quanticks,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/24ewa5/first_summer_internship_any_advice/,"Thought I should post here to get the advice from experienced engineers.

Next week I will be starting my first internship (4 months) in the engineering field. It is a field job (oil and gas), and I have never done anything like this before. 

The internship is with a large known Canadian company, and I would like to secure another internship with them for next year as well. So I am looking for useful advice.

Lots of people tell me to ask lots of questions as it shows interest. Anything else I should actively be doing?"

I mean...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24eko9/this_is_atrak_dj_producer_dude_ask_me_anything/ch6fqm5?context=5)|We just released his EP and he's also part of the Low Pros project.

Do you guys still keep in touch?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24eko9/this_is_atrak_dj_producer_dude_ask_me_anything/ch6cf4z?context=5)|Definitely keep in touch with the gawd.

Brought it back to the funk, and also the history! Teaching young'n's about Nile, Moroder, etc. And I don't expect them to listen to dance music at home. Last time I saw Guy-Man we spoke about Dennis Wilson (humble brag). 
[I just saw you at counterpoint (I had the my parents think I'm at a church retreat sign\) and am counting down the days until I get to see you again at Terminal 5!

[Ghost Producing, have you, would you or do you engage in it? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24eko9/this_is_atrak_dj_producer_dude_ask_me_anything/ch6cgt3?context=5)|The hot topic of the moment!!! Nah it was always important for me to know how to do everything because I'm a control freak. There's been some remixes where I've hired an engineer and it's always credited. I think this ghost-producing thing needs to be defined: the GHOST part is if it's hidden, uncredited. So either I do the whole thing myself (including mixdown), or if I'm in a time crunch I work with an engineer and credit them too. 
[Can we get a Diplo/Dillon Francis/Skrillex/A-trak song?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24eko9/this_is_atrak_dj_producer_dude_ask_me_anything/ch6cue4?context=5)|I'm down.

[I remember you switched to Traktor about a year ago but noticed in some recent pics that you've been using Serato again along with the DDJ-SP1. Why'd you switch?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24eko9/this_is_atrak_dj_producer_dude_ask_me_anything/ch6cgqa?context=5)|I really like both platforms. I'm digging Serato's new DJ software so I wanted to mess with it. Traktor is really powerful, one of the few letdowns is the file management, you kind of have 2 libraries. So right now I'm enjoying the ease of Serato. But I could use both.
[Oh yeah, what's the name of the style of hat you're always wearing? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24eko9/this_is_atrak_dj_producer_dude_ask_me_anything/ch6cgqa?context=5)|Hat: I dunno, I buy it where old folks buy their hats in NY.

[Will you teach me how to YOLO scratch? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24eko9/this_is_atrak_dj_producer_dude_ask_me_anything/ch6chuf?context=5)|You have to sign an NDA first.

 |Freddie Gibbs: we've been talking :) 
[I know you produce some stuff for other Fool's Gold artists, I really dug the production you did on Danny Brown's ""Smokin &amp; Drinkin"", what was it like to work with Danny? did you have creative control  in terms of the production or did he pitch in? Will you be touring with him perhaps anytime soon? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24eko9/this_is_atrak_dj_producer_dude_ask_me_anything/ch6fa2r?context=5)|I played Danny some beats and he picked that one. Then I reworked it around his vocals!

I agree with your hunch that the versace scratch would defeat this FORMIDABLE opponent, because he would be so stunned by the flyness. 
[DJ Craze on an interview said that he was excited to have you on The Allies because he knew that then you will not have to face you... Where you feeling the same?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24eko9/this_is_atrak_dj_producer_dude_ask_me_anything/ch6cvyq?context=5)|Hahah yes EXACTLY.

Heads Will Roll, Sebastien Tellier, Boys Noize, etc. I think the biggest challenge of learning to produce while actively DJing was not having much time to learn the ropes. I always played all my demos to my brother, he gave me great feedback along the way. Still does. 
[Ever had anything go disastrously wrong while performing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24eko9/this_is_atrak_dj_producer_dude_ask_me_anything/ch6cfo5?context=5)|OH YES.

Any cool stories from hanging out backstage or while performing? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24eko9/this_is_atrak_dj_producer_dude_ask_me_anything/ch6hr8k?context=5)|It was actually a hectic day. We were only in NY for a couple hours, we had to fly to Chicago later in the afternoon to play 2 (!!) more shows that night. It was raining so the concert kept getting delayed. We rehearsed with the Roots during sound check literally as the band was learning the songs. It was all on a whim. I wish we could have stuck around to see Dead Prez, Badu etc but we were gone.

Armand and I met and starting going on hiking trips in the wilderness. One time I saw him start a fire using his bare hands. After that we formed a group.

Brother bean Flagstaff, AZ.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24eko9/this_is_atrak_dj_producer_dude_ask_me_anything/ch6dbsz?context=5)|That's so dope man, thank for the continued support over the years.

24exxb,6,2014-04-30,Am I employable yet? How should I be using my time?,browe404,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/24exxb/am_i_employable_yet_how_should_i_be_using_my_time/,"Hello Reddit,

I recently graduated from East Carolina University in December 2013 with a BA in Computer Science. My road to graduation has been long and hard, having been involved in multiple car accidents and surgeries along the way, and it took me 6 years to get my Bachelor's (3 at community college, 3 at University).

I had to work 30-35 hours a week as a 3rd shift delivery driver during college to make ends meet, and as a result, didn't have much opportunity for networking or side projects. I applied to internships and never got a single call-back or interview.

Now, I work part-time doing light front-end development for an e-commerce site ( www.sizzlefish.com ) and attend meetups whenever possible (nice to have a normal work/sleep schedule again!). I started learning Ruby/Ruby on Rails on my own during the summer before my last semester, and built myself a portfolio site, which I later scrapped in favor of a different version.

Since graduating, I've built portfolio sites for myself and my coworker at www.brian-rowe.com and www.reidbeaman.com , both with Ruby on Rails. I wrote a small calculator with AngularJS to help me split up my checks from the e-commerce job into their accounts at contraculator-browe.rhcloud.com , and I'm working on a game for a fellow Redditor using Node/Express/KeystoneJS as the backend and AngularJS as the frontend at guessthefilm.herokuapp.com . I spend almost all of my free time studying web development, coding, or reading books such as ""How to Win Friends and Influence People""

I'm extremely anxious about finding my first ""real"" job and would appreciate some advice on how to best approach it. I'm running out of money since my hours got cut at the part-time webdev job and it'll only be a few months without something better before I end up back at my parent's house, 2.5 hours from the nearest major city with .5M internet.

I feel like my projects aren't really substantial enough to get me noticed. Though I enjoy attending meetups, a meetup relevant to my interests only seems to come along once or twice a month, and the time for networking is very small compared to the time for presentations and driving back and forth to the meetup.

I like working with: HTML/HAML, CSS/SASS, Javascript, JQuery, Bootstrap/Foundation/Gumby, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, AngularJS, KeystoneJS
I'm interested in learning more about NodeJS and Express without Keystone, as well as delving deeper into the above technologies. However, I'm not picky about whether I end up doing front-end or back-end development (or both) at this point, as I'll likely continue to learn both either way. 

Is my portfolio good enough? Should I worry about overhauling my existing projects or trying to come up with more? How does my linkedin look? www.linkedin.com/in/brianrowe42/ 
Is my code decent? www.github.com/brian-rowe

Should I worry more about github commits or meeting people? How can I meet people more efficiently with relevant meetups being few and far between? Is applying online a waste of time or a legit way of landing a job? Should I bother talking to recruiters? I'll edit this if I can think of anything else to ask...

Thanks for reading,
Brian"

The interview was very informal and the head (and only) IT/systems admin pretty much went over what kinda of projects we would be working on over the summer, it was short and sweet. However, he did not mention anything about the pay when he offered me the position. I'm worried that it won't be paid. I know the money isn't everything and that the knowledge I'll gain is much more valuable, but being a college student, money is tight. Later today, I got an email from HR that included a generic employment application. The application does have a spot for desired salary. 

I know it's awkward to ask if it is paid or unpaid, is there a good way of going about this? If it turns out to be unpaid, is it acceptable to ask for it to be paid? I've read in this sub before that engineers should not take unpaid internships. Just want to hear some of your thoughts on this and what experiences you've had."

I have no experience relevant work experience.  My only work experience is 2.5 years as a cashier at a major retail store. I quit my job as a Junior because I got tired of working there and wanted to enjoy some free time. I've enjoyed the free time and now have too much free time and no income.

I am thinking a either getting a Masters in Mechanical Engineering or a second bachelors in Computer Science. The only reason I want to go back to school really is to take advantage of internships so I can get relevant work experience and possibly a internship to full time hire type. Most of my friends/classmates I've kept up with who have no internship experience don't have a job either and my friends that did get internships do.

My thought process is that a Masters in M.E. will get me a higher degree and I can hopefully get an internship as a student to ride it to a full time job. Based on job search experience a CS degree seems to be a good choice and getting a job might be easier. Also, I did take two extra programming courses for fun while I was a student and enjoyed them.

I don't know which decision is better for getting employed. Of course if I do get a job before school starts I'll probably throw my plan away."

Any veterans here who can help?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/24fjm2/frustrated_sde_here_any_veterans_here_who_can_help/,"**TL;DR:** *Fresh graduate with no previous experience; started working on a huge project; finding it hard to understand the large code base; recently had performance assessment and it came out bad. Too ""slow"" at getting things done. What do?*  

I graduated in August and got my dream job in one of the Big Four tech companies. I call it my dream job because the service my team works on is at the bleeding edge of tech, it aligns perfectly with my interests, and I work with *very intelligent* people.  

This is also my first full time job and I had absolutely no previous experience before this - not even an internship.  

1. Before starting this job, all the projects I had worked on were very small and hardly complex.
2. I had been involved in those projects since their inception. I knew the entire code base.
3. If I needed help, I could ask my professors/classmates.

Now, however, I'm working on this *gargantuan* distributed system with a very complex code base. Millions of lines of code with layers over layers *over layers of interleaved classes and interfaces*. Multiple threads running everywhere and *fuck* I have no idea what I'm doing.  
I spend most of my time navigating through code, trying to understand what is happening. I realized that keeping a mental track of every thing is just not possible. I keep forgetting what objects I had where and what objects they were made of... I've resorted to taking notes, but despite that I lose track of things. There are so many layers of function calls and objects, I can never reach the boundary of the code base (if that makes sense). There's always another object I don't know of and when I try to investigate what it's supposed to do, I find that it's made of of 10 other objects I never knew existed. *Ughh...*  

As far as I know, I am the only one in my team without any previous experience and most of my team mates have been working on the project since it began. They just seem to know every thing inside out. Asking for help is ~~kind of looked down upon~~ discouraged.  

So anyway, I had my performance review done recently, and it's not good. I was told that I am slow in delivering results and I seek too much help.  

*Help?*  

**Edit:** Maybe I should have been more clear in my post. I know it sounds like a rant, and it partly is. But to be specific, I'd like to know what experienced developers do to understand the details of code they haven't seen before. Are there tools that I could use (apart from what IDEs usually offer)? Are there any *tricks* to it? Or is this just one of those things that comes with experience and I should just power through?"

 So me and this girl dated for about 2.5 years. Went to same university and live very close back home too. I would say we had a great relationship (at school) during breaks I often took advantage of this time for many internships and work up to 60+ hrs a week. She did not like how I would disappear but I tried very hard  to make her happy. I would say 3 months before we broke up she started getting really friendly with one of her friends who was another female. I felt uncomfortable with the way they were but never said anything. She ends up breaking it off with me and shortly after ends up with her ""friend"". The following months sucked as you can imagine between her trying to hide it and us going to a small school everyone always telling me things, but I tried to focus on me and meet new people. That was a year ago. Last month was the first time I have heard from her since the end of last summer. She said she was confused and still is but this year did not go how she had planned and that many people avoided her. She also said she had told her parents and they were very against the idea of her being with a girl. We starting texting and hanging out again because I still care and would rather be there for her than something happen. I would like to be with her but don't know how to go about anything. She says that she is not with the girl anymore but is best friends with her. Naturally I am against it and we constantly argue about them hanging out. I left the University last semester and have recently found a house. She comes and hangs out but has never stayed has told me she is unsure if she can be with a guy again. I was her first (ever) she was her first (girl). She is also worried about it becoming much like it did over breaks at school. How can I become ok with them being friends when the other girl numerously over stepped lines before? Or more generally what should I do reddit?

TL:DR Ex of 2.5 left me for a girl and hasn't spoken to me in a yr. Just recently coming back and idk what to do."

Have work, hate work, tried to set up my own stuff (quite competent just incredibly shit at pushing myself some days / weeks it goes well for a while but then suddenly everything just drops and I don't seem to be able to finish it or only if there are other people involved who I can not let down).

I can not seem to focus to make certain things happen. Just ever since I turned 18 throughout my early 20's (23 now). Its just utter shit.
But I don't know why, nothing big changed, no structural changes, no big leap in emotional state. I just gradually failed at everything I value. Which leads me to believe that my live isn't worth living because I don't enjoy it more than the hassle I go through to hopefully receive some joy in return. 

It is so much more effort to keep up and keep myself satisfied that I wonder what the point is. Everyone (including me) hop from one goal to another. I can't even seem to complete any I just hop on and get by with the minimal result but it is already so much fucking effort for me to pull that off because I feel like I have to juggle so many things at once. 

When even when I try to rationally look at my situation, I should have nothing to complain about. I pay all my bills, I 'm getting through uni with a good degree. But I guess that isnt enough for me (in my head, chemically or neurologically).

Socially a bit awkward, not that I mind. I do fine on my own ( I do have friends but I meant that I don't mind sit at home watch a series instead of going out.) But I do miss being intimate with someone.

Some days I just want it all to end, or for it all to pause... For me to get some space... Everything seems to work out, but I dont sleep any better, I don't feel any calmer nor any more content.

I do not know where to go from here, I just felt the need to vent and hopefully someone can help me out with some advice.

edit:

Reason I might be so upset or worried is because I tend to think about every aspect a lot. (Different perspectives, different choices, different outcomes and how to respond to all of this.) This means I spend a lot of time overthinking situations that may never occur but could still worry me. It also means that regardless of how much it involves me, I am investing myself into an issue whether I benefit by solving it or not.
I've grown to not care about small stuff and problems that don't involve me but still I seem to worry a lot

**TL;DR**

- No disease, sickness or anything that should make me feel so fucked up

- Friends fight over a girl, funny at first. 3 hours in Kind of annoying. (Girl is insecure, has some issues. Likes one of em alot but they re friends and now the other gave her some attention too and now he is attractive in a 'we could hook up because ur cute and I like the attention kind of way'). **short tl dr of a tldr: I hate social interaction issues because there is no logical solution where all parties are satisfied with the outcome**

- Myself not that social, don't go out too often. Have fun when I do.

- Nothing satisfies me, constantly looking for ways to feel more content.

- Problems (uni, socially, job, anything) keep stacking up and I take a lot of time analyzing and solving them. Driving myself mad over every possibility, factor or person involved

- Take on a lot of stuff as my responsibility

- Bullshit deadlines, no space to do my own stuff and when I finally make some I fail to capitalize on it and rather 'enjoy' the spare time by doing pointless stuff or worrying about why I am not doing something useful (or solve one of the many problems).

- Not been intimate with anyone for couple of years now."

What can I do to gain some real experience with programming, outside of personal projects? I am an experienced python and java programmer and I know a bit of html/css and javascript.

24g5pw,11,2014-05-01,Relationship vs. Education/Career (Moving or staying put) [M23] [F21],remoteplanet,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/24g5pw/relationship_vs_educationcareer_moving_or_staying/,"When I was a Freshman in Uni I decided I wanted to study abroad in Japan and eventually find a job either in Japan or an American company with Japanese ties. My major is accounting with a focus in finance. 
Fast forward to April of my Junior year: I have 5 months left before my study abroad ends. I meet this amazing Japanese girl who I worked with at our school's English Lounge, and we instantly hit it off and start dating in the beginning of May. We both are having the times of our lives and are meeting each almost everyday at school for an hour or two, then hanging out and going places once a weekend. However, both know that I have to go back to the US at the end of August. Then out of the blue, I get an offer to start an internship in Tokyo at a small international finance company (with the intention to eventually hire me full-time) to start from mid-December (which was my original dream). Therefore, she came to stay with me for 3 weeks in the US during her summer vacation, and we decided to go long distance until I return (3 Months). 
When I get back we had a slightly shaky relationship for about two months, then everything cleared up and have had a next to perfect relationship since then. Talked about getting an apartment together once she graduates in almost a year (still lives with her family-which is common due to the price of housing) and even marriage. 
Fast-forward to 6 months to present day: Now that I have been here for almost six months and the company I interned with offered me a permanent job, but the salary was less almost one third what I would be making if I worked in New York City and less than half in Alabama. I tried to negotiated a higher salary but they wouldn't budge. Plus they change my role in the company so that I am no longer doing accounting work but something completely different than my previously intended career path. Lastly, they expect everybody to work 11-12 hours a day, which would be about $10/hr for my new salary. I would want to change jobs, but I have yet to gain enough work experience nor past the language examination to qualify for any jobs other than teaching English (a resume killer). 
Because of this my parents want me to come home and start graduate school (which they will pay for) in NYC or DC so that I can take the CPA exam and get a high paying accounting job. In the past, my girlfriend said she would move with me to the states if I had to but when I brought this new issue up and told her if I do this it will be a minimum of 5 years before I can come back to Japan to live, she started to cry. I don't know what to do because if I go back to the states and she decides to come that means we would have to get married and I would be with very little income until I graduate one year from starting. But if I don't take her we will most definitely have to breakup losing all of our hard work we have put into our relationship. If I decide to stay, I am either an English teacher with no hope of advancement or working at a sweatshop of a company for next to nothing in the most expensive city to live in the world. 
Be both really love each other and there hasn't been a week that has passed were we having seen each other for less than three times. Please provide me on some guidance for what I should do. Thanks"
24g6oi,6,2014-05-01,"Multiple unique CS/EE job offers, don't know which to choose!",omgitsbud,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/24g6oi/multiple_unique_csee_job_offers_dont_know_which/,"Hi everyone. I have a problem. A pretty big problem, but a really good problem.

So, I just graduated with a BS in Electromechanical engineering with a minor in computer science and a breadth of personal projects involving embedded computer systems and firmware development. I've applied to a number of positions and have been getting deep into the interview process for 3 positions simultaneously and I'm getting to the point where I don't know which to choose. My degree allows me to be a fully functional electrical or mechanical engineer but I love developing software and working with electrical engineering on the digital hardware side of things (developing firmware, etc). 

The first position is at a company that develops x-ray contraband detection equipment for border control, airports, etc. This job is pretty cool and I did a couple of internships there. The pay is good but it's a pretty standard electrical engineering job. The facilities are nice and the work they do is really neat and it would be challenging but I fear that I'd grow bored.

The second job, is at Bose. I'd be picking up a software engineering position developing software for fine tuning the sound systems in luxury automobiles. This is cool because again, I love software. Also, I'm a big music lover and love DSP stuff. I've built a couple of my own analog synthesizers for fun so I could definitely see myself getting into this job.

The third job is a startup. This is the primary hangup I've been having. I've interviewed a number of times with this startup (they have a cool idea for home automation). There are only 3 people currently at the company. The CEO sold an app to amazon two years ago, perhaps you've heard of it, called ""Yap"" for like 7 million dollars. The CFO is a business guy with an engineering degree who has a good background in product release. The third guy is a former apple engineer who is the first guy to ever listen to music on an ipod. Definitely a good crowd and I'd learn a LOT of stuff. The pay might be lower at first, but if this job takes off it could be really great.

Basically I'm stuck because the stability and higher pay associated with the more established positions, especially Bose are very tempting. I feel that I'd learn more with the startup (I'm basically going in having to learn a whole new component of computer programming. I know Java really well but this will involve using Java to program an embedded computer system, communicate with a cloud database that I'd develop, and talk to mobile apps that I'd develop). It's a very high risk/high reward kind of situation. I think that even if the company failed, I'd come out with a killer resume boost. That only works out if I can hack the work they are dishing at me.

I need some insight! I feel like I can do all of these jobs, but I need to decide soon because all three are going to throw offers at me at any time. I don't know what to say to one about the other.

TLDR: I basically have 3 girlfriends and none of them know about one another. I can't choose which one I want to stay with. [Girlfriends = potential employers]

Also, I can't really say much about the start up as I signed a non-disclosure agreement."

At some point I'd like to go to HR and inquire about interning for the the school's IT department, but I'm not sure whether to do that before I am A+ certified or after.

If I didn't work there already I would just wait until after I was certified, but since I do work there and HR knows me my hope is that they will let me intern before I am certified. 

This is probably a situation where I should just go in and ask, but I thought I'd get some opinions here first. Thanks."

:--|:--
[How much would it cost for reddit to pay for the services of a lobbyist? How could we go about doing that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6ucqg?context=5)|In this economy? I am sure people would lobby for reddit for 40k a year.  But if you want a skilled lobbyist with good connections to offices and great relationships in DC to help give its users a real footprint? 70k-100k.
[So everyone on Reddit should donate a dollar and then we can start lobbying for what we want in congress ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6v8r9?context=5)|Hah. Sure! But how does a place like reddit come up with a unified platform?  What if certain members don't support it?  Should they go elsewhere? Maybe reddit users should unionize!!
[Good on you for not lobby for deregulation of air pollution. It's true that people need jobs, stuff like building pavements, but at what point do we wake up in a world covered in pavements and AstroTurf and decide that profit driven society is kind of a pollution machine itself? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6wzh7?context=5)|Do we want more jobs at the risk of the proven negative health risks from boilers - like increased cases of cancer, increases in miscarriages, asthma rates in children...?
 |It's a balance.  The thing is, those employers can often times foot the bill for new infrastructure.  They just don't want to because it affects their bottom line.  Fuck their bottom line though.  The health and safety of children &gt; your shitty paper factory.  
[What percentage of lobbyists would you say hold your same ideals and balk away from high dollars to merc for the ""bad guys""?  How do you pitch for more sidewalks if they are unnecessary outside of passing along a $25,000 ""contribution"" to a member of Congress? How is lobbying for ""bridges to nowhere"" (honestly\) better for the citizenry of the United States?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6y7av?context=5)|Well a few things. You can't give a member $25,000 dollars. But earmarks have also been banned for 6 years now?  So the last transportation bill had zero.  And there were THOUSANDS of earmarks in SAFETEA-LU (the last bill with earmarks).  *Most* of them were not for bridges to nowhere. 
[As a lobbyist, do you have any idea what caused the intense vilification of earmarks?  As I understand it, they were some of the only ways to get politicians to support a bill for the good of all, by satisfying their need to bring personal money to their district to appease voters.  My own views have also led me to believe that Republicans abused these far, far more than Democrats did, which further leads to my misunderstanding of why Republicans spearhead and support the ban.  Do you have any opinion on this?  It's not as if selfish vying for money has stopped in any way, so why did they single out earmarks?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch7b77z?context=5)|Things like the big dig and bridges to nowhere. While there were bad examples, getting rid of them has essentially broken congress. Such a minimal portion of federal spending too.
[Alright, so you don't make any sort of recommendation as to how one goes about steering money to one member of congress over another, who you address in the process of pushing for one cause over another bearing this in mind, in your official capacity as a lobbyist? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6ywck?context=5)|We don't steer money in my organization, so (not so) sadly I cant tell you much about strategy there. But let's say you are a manufacturer of...i dunno...sewer inspecting robots?  Lets say the current process is an infrastructure bill provides money to communities to do inventories of their water infrastructure but there's no specific mention in the bill of funding new technology like remote controlled sewer inspecting robots.  Lets say a firm with the money to blow on such a thing knows they need to influence the committee to include that language in the next bill, but the committee is reluctant to do it on its merits alone.  So you probably want to throw some money towards the committee leadership's PACs (on both sides of the isle), and maybe some of the more influential members on the committee or subcommittee of jurisdiction for that issue, and maybe some money towards party leadership in general to try and pressure them from the top down.  But, really, I don't know.  I've never worked in campaign finance.  
[How accurate is the portrayal of lobbyists in House of Cards?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6u1g9?context=5)|House of Cards is not a political drama. It is a drama set in a political backdrop, which is an important distinction, I think.  Watch the first 3 episodes of VEEP.  The plot line with clean jobs/plastics is far, far more accurate.   
[Even all the swearing and imcompetence?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6z3tn?context=5)|Gotta be able to shrug it off.  It's not personal.  People are right to be frustrated.  I'd prefer they learn something about me before telling me to die though!
[Have you personally seen what you considered to be unethical behavior by any elected officials, and if so, what action did you take, if any?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6u4t5?context=5)|Unethical as in illegal or just shitty and awful?  I have not witnessed outright illegal activity.  
[Shitty and awful, though?   Can you offer an example?  Follow up - What influence have you seen the everyday (non-wealthy\) individual voter have on their representative, or would you say almost every interest is co-opted by an organization?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6uglq?context=5)|I have to be a little careful about specific examples, but members vote all the time because a group asks them to even though it does not benefit their constituents in anyway, and may be contrary to what the bulk of their constituents want. that's why so many democrats have started supporting keystone. Labor pushes them to support it so that a few workers in the Midwest can get temporary jobs and labor can claim a win as ""job creators"".
[That is certainly disappointing.  Do you think that the recent supreme court rulings have had any effect on lobbyist/official relationships?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6vkkh?context=5)|I don't really have a good answer for you, unfortunately.  Not my area of expertise.  
[Do you think most members are actually well versed in the laws they vote on? I feel like most of them are ignorant about their policies.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch723t8?context=5)|Depends. Generally no, but thats what their staff is for. To pretend they know on the member's behalf!
[Very disappointing, would you say that the members do this for personal gain(IE: kickbacks\), or do they really believe it's in the best interests of the nation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6w7s1?context=5)|If members are literally getting kickbacks, they go to prison.  That's 100% illegal.  Some members do things because their campaigns will get cash infusions. That doesn't always mean they don't also believe its in the best interest of the nation.  I think often times they just don't think much about it, occasionally they probably vote in shitty ways for cash.  There's a lot of members. They all have varying levels of ethical sturdiness!  
[I love how getting a 'kickback' would result in prison time, but getting a 'cash infusion' to their campaign in return for voting a certain way is legal and ethical.  Up until 1989 they could just pocket any cash leftover from their campaign fund.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch71nqi?context=5)|I don't think most people feel to good about it. I don't!
[What is the pay like? At what level are you? Entry? Mid? Executive?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6u6qb?context=5)|Mid. Pay is better than working on the hill.  Because we are a non-profit organization, the pay is less than if I went and lobbied on behalf of corporate interests.  But I get to sleep very comfortably at night knowing I don't do that!
[To elaborate on this, Hill staffers are not paid well at all unless they're very senior (Legislative Director of Chief of Staff for example\).  Staff Assistants usually start at around $25k.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6xezi?context=5)|I'd say 28-30k, but yeah. the pay is shit!
[What is your take on paid lobbyists who do offer kickbacks whether intentional or not? And why isn't there a reddit PA?  edit: spelling, words, grammar...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6u1b9?context=5)|Many organizations now have PACs that allow them to contribute to member's campaigns, so the money flows from the PAC to the reelection committee and, by law, never goes through the member office.  Of course, members and their senior staff are generally aware of who their supporters are and it does grant them some access.  As a former staffer, I'd meet with anyone who requested a meeting under my issue areas, but I would agree that our big donors generally got meetings with the boss.
 |How do I feel about it?  I don't know. I don't know how to change it when we have a shitty activist court that keeps overturning finance laws.  
[*I don't know how to change it when we have a shitty activist court that keeps overturning finance laws.*  What do you mean by that? I'm curious.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6ysn6?context=5)|Well McCain Feingold put a lot of reforms into place, and so far the Supreme Court, particularly led by Republican Appointees, have effectively been overturning those reforms.  
[What specific reforms are you referring to?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6zu3x?context=5)|Google: McCain Feingold Supreme Court.
[Do you feel like certain interest groups have too much influence over politics in America, or that since there is such a large number of interest groups that all viewpoints are equal representation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6umka?context=5)|I do feel that certain interest groups have too much influence.  It's an undeniable fact.  Watch the comcast merger happen (hopefully not!) and you will understand exactly where the interplay between money, lobbying, and politics comes into play.
[Also, how true to life is the 'corrupt politican' stereotype?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6umka?context=5)|I don't think *most* politicians are corrupt in the sense that they are shadowy figures.  I do think leadership in both parties is super, super corrupt.  An individual member of congress has almost no power unless they chair a committee or are in leadership, and that's where the money flows.
[This is interesting. Are there are a lot of reps who are just taking blatant quid pro quos? Are there a lot of reps who are completely incorruptible? I'm guessing most are somewhere on the continuum.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch77awf?context=5)|I think your rank and file members are generally ethical/well intentioned people, that are playing a really shitty game 
[As a follow up.  What would be the blue collar entry-level position to work for a lobbyist group? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6ubwk?context=5)|Work on the hill. Grad school. Some sort of technical expertise within a field.  It really depends on what you are lobbying for.  Science? Plenty of scientists come and lobby.  Working for Podesta? Former senior staffer to a member.  
[ also, many non profits, universities, associations, etc hire government relations staff.  Many of these people begin by simply following what happens in the federal government but don't do much of what you would consider ""lobbying"".  This is also a good start.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6wyox?context=5)|I'm sure you can get jobs as low-level researchers and support staff at lobbying firms right out of college, but I do think there's a bit of glass ceiling there. 
[Do many non-American's work as lobbyists or for their firms? I currently do communications for a Canadian Lobbyist group but would love to think I could migrate to the US.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch7494m?context=5)|Lots of non Americans. 
[Do you travel outside of the DC area enough to see the seething hatred most of the rest of the country has for all things Washington?   If so... do you think Congress knows what low regard the public holds for them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6u2ty?context=5)|Everyone here knows how frustrated the country is with the institution of Congress. But MOST people really like their own members.  Check out the polling on that.
 |The institution is pretty broken.  I don't really know how to fix it - but that's not really my job (thank god). 
[The idea that people like their Member of Congress but dislike Congress as a whole is called Fenno's Paradox, and is a recognized and measured phenomenon in American politics.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6xnsx?context=5)|In general, it has a lot to do with the fact that there's a lot of good representatives out there!  The *process* is more broken than the people who work within the process!
[Shouldn't it be all of our jobs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch70twh?context=5)|It should be all of our jobs to be engaged. We should all be fired for that.  
[I'm not sure how to feel about the fact that you are making a distinction between *process* and *people who work within the process*. It seems to me, and I'm just spitballin' here, that the people are the ones driving the process. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch72toz?context=5)|One member of congress has no power over the process. Even a gaggle of members can only do so much!
[I heard lobbying is just taking guys out for beers and being friends who suggest certain things to members of congress etc.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6vwzu?context=5)|That's explicitly illegal.  Like, federal ass-rape prison illegal.
[Is that what happens? Whats your average day like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6vwzu?context=5)|If I am lobbying, I will send out an email to the office I want to meet with (generally targeted based on committee assignments).  Once I know I am meeting with them, I will aggregate district data, do background research on the member's past support for our issues, and go sit with them and make our case.  Usually some follow up - if they need more research from us or seem like they might be supportive.
[*federal ass-rape prison illegal.*  This is now my favorite descriptor of all time.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch71x1k?context=5)|I hope never to visit!
[Can you name some of the most corrupt politicians you know, since you're anonymous?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6vt68?context=5)|Not my area of expertise at all.  But here: [Link to www.crewsmostcorrupt.org](http://www.crewsmostcorrupt.org/mostcorrupt)  They do pretty good analysis! 
[In a free market, wouldn't the fair shot be either a better product worth the extra cost or a lower price?  I think you actually supported my statement with yours. You were lobbying to shut out the opportunity of others in favor of a particular group or company.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch708h7?context=5)|We are not in a free market.

These are two very different things and you stated one of them above.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch743t0?context=5)|I don't lobby for either. It was an example.
[*And why isn't there a reddit PA?*  Assuming you meant to say ""PAC"": There was one. Doesn't seem to be active anymore, but they actively campaigned against Lamar Smith in the 2012 election.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6u6a4?context=5)|If reddit is looking for a lobbyist to work on behalf of their PAC, I know just the guy! 
[Assuming you're a somewhat frequent reddit user, what is it like? Your profession is *constantly* the scapegoat for every political discussion. ""Those evil lobbyists, doing their job and getting paid for it. Why I oughtta..."" Even when reddit scapegoats do show up and do AMAs, they're either jumped on for some semantic issue in a reply or they're exonerated as ""One of the few, few, good ones,"" without disrupting the circlejerk scapegoat flow. So mad props for doing this.  **Q:** If you had to pick the top 3 misconceptions about your job, (as it relates to the field, not necessarily to you specifically\), what would they be and what is *really* going on there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6vzde?context=5)|I wrestle with it.  Part of me doesn't want to blame people for not understanding - but at the same time, it's suuuper fucking frustrating watching something like the Comcast - Time Warner merger and seeing how easily the administration and many members of congress will bend over for a company that is in the business of monopolization.  So I get the anger. I am angry too.  But people should learn what the universe is beyond those examples.  Nearly every law is shaped by lobbyists.  Did a seatbelt save your life? Lobbying.  Did you drive in a car that you are exponentially safer in than you would have been 20 years ago? Lobbying.  Did your house or office withstand a significant disaster like an earthquake or hurricane? Lobbying.  Did you breath cleaner air in your office? Lobbying. Greater labor protections? Lobbying.  So, you know, hate it, but know that literally every positive aspect of your life is ALSO touched by it. 
[But do elected officials really need someone with deep pockets chirping in their ear to understand what's good for the country? Can't an intelligent person figure out what's good or bad for the people without being lobbied?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch7440c?context=5)|I don't know if you're familiar with the sheer volume of public law that's addressed every year but no human could be an expert on even a 50th of it.
[What is the process for getting sit-down time with policy makers? Have you ever been bumped for a lobbyist from a big-money company?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6uv7w?context=5)|As a former hill staffer, I took meetings daily with lobbyists from ""big-money companies"" and labor.
 |The process is really simple.  MOST staffers will meet with just about anyone who requests a meeting.  I know a lot of the folks who cover the issue I work on, but even when I don't, a simple email usually gets me in the door.
 |Try it! If you want to talk with your member, email your district office and set up a meeting.  
[Follow up - Is there a general format to a meeting? Are you just stating a case or do you bring in presentation materials or even better source materials? If the staffer is of a different opinion is there a back and forth discussion or are you just stating the case and leaving?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6zotj?context=5)|I bring a bunch of district specific research.  Bring them up to speed on where things are at with my issue, what we anticipate the future will be, show them how its affecting their constituents, and then generally put forward our policy asks to close. 
[What do you think about the Koch Brothers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6ul53?context=5)|I think they are everything that's wrong with the country.  But they aren't lobbyists.  They are primarily involved in PAC financing.  
[What do you think about George Soros?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6wsyz?context=5)|I don't really have any thoughts.  I do think its hypocritical of D's to shit on big money/PACs, but then to play the game.  But the flipside is, if they don't, the tea party takes over? So...
 |Public financing! 
[Would not most companies be better off simply paying to fix what they are fighting against or for instead of paying a lobbyist to fight the cause?  Are they not spending about the same amount of money on both sides?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6vvst?context=5)|It's not just companies lobbying.  Particularly for issues like transportation, there are a *lot* of non-corporate special interests who represent grassroots interests.  I've never worked in corporate lobbying, but I'd have to assume the answer is no.  I can't imagine that there isn't someone doing cost/benefit analysis there.  
[Do you think Verizon will hold monopoly in getting cell service in metro or will this change in the near future?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6zwor?context=5)|Not my field of knowledge at all.
[You say you're hoping to clear up some misconceptions about lobbying.  What is the biggest misconception you've heard?  Also, are there politicians who look at it strictly as an incoming bribe, don't care what you're lobbying for and strictly want to know how much will go into their coffers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6von3?context=5)|Biggest misconception is how the process works.
 |[Link to www.youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAC2xeT2yOg)
 |I think most people still think it happens like this. Lobbyists walk down on the house floor, hand out checks, and say ""vote for x"".  I don't think *most* lobbyists operate that way.  I don't think most of them represent groups with PACs or hand out money to politicians. There are people lobbying for almost literally every single issue under the sun.  As a former staffer I took meetings with people who wanted more astroturf on school football fields.  They had nothing to offer but data showing the cost effectiveness to our district.
 |That being said, certain groups do donate to members.  That's all relatively transparent unless it goes through PACs.  And those groups most definitely get greater access.  I would argue that for any given member, things aren't so shady.  It's mostly party and committee leadership where the big dollars fall.  
[So would you say a big part of the solution of ""getting money out of politics"" is getting rid of PACs? Because honestly, I was under the impression this was almost as crucial an issue as the entire economy. Lobbyists like yourself that seem to steer clear of handing out checks are far from the problem and probably help the american people, but I have no doubt there are PACs and individual lobbyists that would see entire communities go poor just to take that Mercedes SLS for a ride.  Maybe a follow-up question: do you see ""getting money out of politics"" as a big problem? And if so, how do we fix it? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch70vo9?context=5)|Public financing.  You can't really get rid of PACs because of our shitty supreme court.  But at least we can limit their control of politicians!
[This may be a bad question but I don't really understand politics, so what is lobbying? Also, what do you do on a normal day?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6ud9a?context=5)|Let me come back to this in an hour or so! This is a great question but I am running out the door!
[Do you see any ways to fix the dysfunctional and broken political system here in America that doesn't involve outright revolution?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6vaj6?context=5)|Not really.  Public financing of campaigns, redistricting reform, election reform.  But will that happen? Nah.  
[Do you truly believe that the freedom to lobby enhances our democracy? If so is there any example where it doesn't?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6wg2i?context=5)|You can't prevent lobbying. Lobbying is the byproduct of a representative democracy.  If we want to have direct democracy, then there'd be no reason for lobbyists, but that's never going to be the case for obvious reasons.
 |I think the problem is how money flows.  We need to help separate representation from cash! 
[So my question. If you were hiring an entry level worker to your firm, what type of qualities, skills and experiences do you look for? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6uu6w?context=5)|After that, the last of art of writing is important.  The ability to form relationships.  Wonky knowledge of issues.  
[Well I'm a writer in the NYS legislature so I got that going for me.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6wmbn?context=5)|That's a great leg up!
[Do you receive a lot of hate from stangers for being in that job position?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6w9lt?context=5)|Only on reddit! People who know what I lobby on behalf of are generally super into it! 
[Well, this is the Internet; a festering cesspool of unbridled rage coupled with anonymity masking the true face of the socially awkward.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6xebw?context=5)|Fact.
[Hello, sir! Thank you so much for doing this AMA!! I always wanted to hear from a lobbyist.  Could you please tell us how much international lobbying is there in our Congress? I have heard many times about how some countries invest a lot to get some support from the US, but I never knew how usual/powerful that was. Also, do you happen to know which countries have the most power when it comes to lobbying and influencing our politics?  Once again, thanks for doing this!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6wnr4?context=5)|I was lobbied by a few international energy firms (clean energy manufacturers from Israel and Germany, high speed rail from Japan), but other than that, I didn't see much of it.  My issues were pretty domestic though!  Can't really answer your other question in a meaningful way. I just don't know.
[House of Cards has been mentioned already, but does that show accurately portray a lot of things that happens on the Hill?  Also, what (not who\) do you lobby for?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6wfo2?context=5)|I lobby for equity and safety in our transportation system (I know, pretty evil!).  No. That show is not a political drama.  It is a drama that takes place on capitol hill.  Literally nothing about it is accurate. ESPECIALLY not the part where there's a dunkin donuts in the house cafeteria!!  
[Currently,  I am studying public relations and I really want to be a lobbyist. What kind of work experience and education should I go into? I'm thinking law school, but I've heard of people who skip over that bit.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6vvg4?context=5)|Federal lobbying - go work on capitol hill for a few years.  As I said elsewhere, being able to navigate the U.S. Code of Laws is really important so law school cant hurt. But it really depends on what you want to do.  If you want to work at a high-power law firm like Patton Boggs, law school and being a chief of staff to a member will be helpful.  If you want to lobby on behalf of an smaller organization it's totally not necessary.  
[Could you give us an example of what a ""brilliant"" piece of lobbying looks like? Like that one time that, when you look back at it, you think ""Damn, that was really well done.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6x7oq?context=5)|Sure.  MAP-21, the last long-term bill that authorizes our nation's transportation programs was going to gut ALL dedicated funding for bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure - which came from various pots of funding. Both the House and Senate versions of the bill cut the funding before it even reached committee. Boxer threw it out as a compromise to get Republicans on board.  Super frustrating for people who value things like safe places to cross the street.
 |So a lot of lobbyists for transpo groups, health groups, childhood safety advocates, etc, got together and struck a compromise in an amendment known as the Cardin-Cochran Amendment ([Link to www.cardin.senate.gov](http://www.cardin.senate.gov/newsroom/news/cardin-cochran-amendment-would-boost-local-control-of-bike-ped-funding))  Basically, it was a compromise that allowed states the opportunity to transfer bike/pedestrian funding to other priorities *cough* highways *cough* if they chose, but ensured that a portion of the funding would go directly to local control for cities and towns that actually value things like ensuring bus stops have safe crossings next to them.  It was not a solution *any* of the advocates wanted, but it kept funding in the bill (at about a third less overall). It was bipartisan. It passed on the floor by voice vote without objection.  That was a brilliant last-ditch effort to compromise and save a program.
[Thank you! That was very interesting.  A follow-up question: How much of your time is spent lobbying other lobbying groups so that you build a coalition so that you can all lobby politicians together?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6y66v?context=5)|50/50.  We don't lobby them so much as just work closely with them to stay on the same page.  We all generally come at this issue with the same mind-set. 
[Do you think it would be possible for someone from a professional field (not politics, but medicine/computers/engineering/etc.\) to run purely online for a senator/congressman?  Personally I feel like that's the only way to get an honest politician at this point in US.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6vucx?context=5)|Well. That happens a lot with the teaparty.  Lots of restaurant owners. Construction company owners. Farmers.  But they have a lot of ""astroturf-roots"" dollars behind them!
[I like the lobbyist guy.staying calm AND responding to dumb, half-assed comments/?'s.thanks and well done ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6z43e?context=5)|I get the anger.  Like I said to someone else.  I wish people would take the time to ask questions instead of telling me to die, but what can you do?
[How did you get into the field?  Where would somebody start if interested in lobbying?  What is a typical day for you?  Has your lobbying accomplished anything substantial (anything we may have heard about\)?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6xlnr?context=5)|I've answered the typical day part a couple of times.  Worked for members of congress. Some national service before that.  My lobbying has not yet, but that's mostly a timing issue. Transportation bills are long-term authorizations and it will be another 6 months to a year before the next one is out.  Ill let you know! =P.
[What's the transport bill you're working on now?  I'm a driver down here for a news agency, curious as to whether or not it'll affect me.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6znaa?context=5)|It's the transportation bill that authorizes *all* of our nations surface transportation programs.  If you move on the ground it absolutely affects you. 
[Do Congressmen realize how much we hate their guts for using issues, committee hearings, and voting on bills as a platform for their party to get re-elected, instead of doing their fucking jobs and representing the interests of the people?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch70exe?context=5)|I ask myself that a lot.  I don't think most of them are real people?  So no.  Some probably do, but they are generally the ones actually standing up to the machine.  Don't hear much in the press about them. Rosa De Lauro. Al Franken (sometimes). Thems kinda folks.
[Who are some of the politicians that are the hardest to work with?  The easiest?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6wujh?context=5)|You know, it's totally random for me.  I've met with offices that I thought would be a total nightmare and their staffs were great! I am reluctant to name names, as my effectiveness is really dependent upon those relationships.  Sorry I can't be much clearer than that. 
[If we read about politicians in China or India accepting tens of thousands of dollars from corporations, and then making policy that effects those corporations, we'd label it as corruption.What is the difference between lobbying and corruption? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6wcm4?context=5)|A campaign contribution and a personal bribe are two different things.  If I gave a politicians *anything* personally, and they accepted, we'd both go to prison.  Read: Jack Abermoff.
 |But I don't disagree that our campaign financing system is shitty and breads really awful legislating! 
[In your experience how out of touch is Congress with the majority of lower (&gt; 40,000k\) income Americans?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6wiju?context=5)|Republicans? Super.  Democrats, I think most of them are generally in favor of supporting lower income brackets, BUT, their leadership is fucking awful and holds meaningless votes on things like food stamps and fair wages that they HOPE will not pass because it allows them to beat up republicans.  That's so fucked up.  
[Thanks for the great response, that is twisted, trying something you know will fail to throw it back pigeon holing Republicans as evil fat backs. What's something you can suggest to make my single voice heard?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch71d2t?context=5)|No single voice is ever heard.  Make your voice collective. 
[Can you give a breakdown of the proposed Transportation Bill and how it differs from the last multi-year bill? Also does it have a chance of passing this year?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6we8r?context=5)|There are no bills in the Senate or House yet.  The administration has put forward a bill which differs in that it has greater focus on equity, interconnectedness, multi-modalism, performance from state DOTs and MPOs, performance and outcome based funding.  The major difference now is that there are no earmarks for transportation bills - which is HUGE.  The last bill was the first earmarkless bill and so all projects were formula funded except for one discretionary grant program which isn't nearly large enough to feed our backlog of transportation needs. The problem with that is you end up with silos of funding that don't coordinate well with each other and tend to lead to silos of infrastructure.  What incentive does a state have to connect sidewalks with transit with highways when they are all individual, formula funded pots of cash?
[Thanks for the reply.  I have not dug into the Bill, but what is meant by 'outcome based funding' on Transportation projects? Good to see more funding for inter-connectivity and multi-modal projects.  How do the local public agencies fare in the administrations bill? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch746gq?context=5)|Setting performance measures for states to follow and providing funding based on their success.

Also, how much do legislative staff get to work on policy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch701j0?context=5)|Interned.  Makes perfect sense!  They hire *good* interns to be paid staff.  You have to strike the balance of working your ass off without being an ass kissing sycophant.  Not many people can strike that well.  
[Thanks for doing this.  I'm a biomedical researcher.  Funding cuts have been devastating.  Is there any hope to waking up congress?  What can we do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc1o/iama_lobbyist_ama/ch6zyqt?context=5)|Not next Congress unfortunately.  You NEED to go to your representatives with evidence in hand showing how appropriations cuts are harming people on the ground in their district. Harming jobs. Putting us at a competitive disadvantage with the rest of the world.  They HAVE to hear from you or they wont stand up for you.

I am so close to being an ex FA. Have a good job, actually have some friends, a couple of hobbies. And to top it all off I just got a new BF, and not just a guy who wants to use me for sex, he legit likes me. 

So what has gone wrong?

Almost all of my friends are from my job. I don't think there's anything wrong with that. I have 2 groups of friends here, I went out to lunch with one of them yesterday, and one girl is going away for an internship next week. And another girl (who I do my hobbies with and consider my closest friend) said her husband wants to move them 2 hours up north! I started panicking because I will be so lonely if she moves away. My other group of friends from work and I have been drifting apart a bit lately, and I don't know what to do (they all work together in the same dept and I don't get to talk to them as much).

I live in a college town. And I'm still young enough (26) that most people I meet are in college. But when they graduate, they move back home. So every spring I lose friends and I'm lonely. Even my new BF is graduating in a year, and who knows what will happen then. 

Sure, I could meet people through my hobbies. My 2 hobbies are going to the gym and I also take a hip hop dance class. But I wouldn't want to talk to people at the gym and the hip hop class is pretty small. Sometimes it's only me and my friend who might move away. And I do get along with other people there but it would be weird to ask them to do other stuff when most of them are older than me, and have families and stuff like that. And there's not much to do in this shitty town so I'm not sure where to find other things to do (no Meetup groups here).

Sorry for the rant, but I just feel like what's the point when everyone I meet will move away in a year? I want to not be FA so badly, but I feel like I am constantly starting over and it makes me depressed. "

I'm currently researching the topic of getting into freelance but I figured people on this subreddit would have better advice personally tailored to my situation. 

My top concern with freelancing is I know that I won't be the fast at the start and I don't want to charge customers for the time I spent learning what I need to complete their request. At the same time I assume if I'm willing to put in 40-50+ hours/week it would be an acceptable finishing time frame for the work. (I'm just spit-balling thoughts that come into my head now).

[I served for 8 years in the military but don't want to keep doing what I did in the service out in the civilian world. Aside from the military training and certifications I received I have very little in the way of experience in a traditional workplace and have been stuck working dead end jobs while I try to make a switch to a career that I might enjoy. Do you have any advice on things I should highlight that would make me stand out from the crowd? How best to highlight the things I learned in the military that might serve me in the current job market?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6xary?context=5)|This is a great question and one we'll both be at risk of going too deep on.  Jenny is getting back from lunch in just a few minutes, and I'd like for her to take first dibs on this.  I'll (Peter) chime in shortly thereafter.  So hang tight for just a few more minutes.
 |Just spoke to Jenny and she's back from lunch.  Reply coming soon.
 |I'm here!  GREAT question, and first let me say, don't discount yourself or your skills.  Your military experience is absolutely enticing to most employers...in fact, I can't think of a single HR professional or CEO, Plant Manager, President or Hiring Manager who wouldn't want to look at you very closely.
 |So...here's what I propose: take a blank sheet of paper and draw 6 big boxes: Logistics, Management, Communications, IT, Certifications/Awards and Other   Within each box, write several brief entries of the work that you had done while enlisted.  Think in specific terms, and don't worry if you use jargon that's unrecognizable to the rest of us (What the hell is a CB1015A Certification???)  Just jot it down.  This should take an hour or more - don't be shy, and gather any discharge info you need to do it thoroughly.
 |Next, have someone who you admire that works in a professional capacity - especially in the line of work you WANT to be in (have you decided what that is?  Totally separate conversation, but important.  Crucial.)  Have that person (or people, maybe 2-3) look at your ""boxes"".  Have them identify which of these entries are similar enough to the civilian world to be useful, and which are simply too military (ask them to help you re-phrase these if possible.  If you were a sharpshooter, first of all, remind me not to tick you off.  Secondly, unless you're aiming [ha, ha, little career humor there] for a Secret Service position, that's not going to be re-worked into a skill most offices need...EXCEPT it could be used as ""attention to detail"".  Not a lie - you were very attentive to every detail!!
 |Finally, once your entries have been extrapolated to your new intended career target, you can begin the work of crafting a resume that's practical for many applications in the civilian world.  I have no doubt that you have plenty of background to fill an entire resume, you simply need to decide which of your skill areas you want to highlight - if you want to get into marketing, emphasize communication.  If warehousing is a good fit (great career, excellent money) your logistics training and the structure you served under is priceless.  See how it works?  You just need to approach this as someone with YEARS of successful employment and skills that are portable to all kinds of sectors.  BEST WISHES - and thank you, sincerely, for keeping my family and me safe.  You guys and girls do the things I'm too afraid to even consider, and you do it every day with little pay and a whole lot of challenges.  Thank you for writing!!  You've got a bright future ahead - let me know how it turns out!
 |This is Peter - I'll add some thoughts here too.
 |We had a NCAA D1 Athlete below ask a similar question, and my approach is similar to that.  In addition to what Jenny wrote above, let's also think outside of the technical aspects.  What else are you good at?  Handling stress, chaos, teams, leadership, problem solving, high work loads, discipline, and a whole, whole lot more.
 |How you organize this info depends greatly on the amount and type of info, and the job opp at hand.  Maybe chronological, maybe skills - there again is where your friends might help.

 |You're in a better position than most career switchers, in that you have a highly respected, diverse, and proven background backing you up.  The hard part, though, is crafting that into civilian terms.

[Why jenny, why must you be 15 minutes late to people on the INTERNET!? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch70bkt?context=5)|It was my 15 minutes of fame...now I'm just a regular Jenny again. *sigh*
[Do you ever feel like you are helping incompetent people get jobs they are not qualified for?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6vxwt?context=5)|Ha, well, sometimes.  I'm (Peter) a pretty candid guy though, so I tend to be honest with the person.  When we start looking at what I call ""Work impacts"" (aka - what did you do to benifit the last place) we often come to the ""mutual"" realization that they might be aiming a bit high.  We also talk about honesty and ensure what they're putting down is true.
 |There's also a degree of separation too - a good resume will get you an interview, not a job.  They'd have to bluff the interview process to actually get hired.
 |The gray zone is when we're helping folks with stretch goals - those they aren't necessarily 100% ready for but want to go for it anyhow.
 |I love that question.  This is Jenny now - I can pretty honestly assess how well someone who comes to me for help on a resume might do during an interview - and I try to share that information when appropriate.  For instance, if their soft skills (speech patterns, comfort with strangers, ability to make small talk, handshake, eye contact) are poor, I'll try to give them a few tips and recommend a longer meeting to practice, as in a mock interview format.  If they're stellar and really personable, I share that as well.  But I echo what Peter said, too - if they're truly not ready for a job that they want to write a resume for, it's clear.  I'm NEVER going to help someone lie or puff themselves up - it's wrong and simply a waste of time for them and the company.
[Benefit.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch70tqy?context=5)|Good catch.  SEE PEOPLE - HAVE SOMEONE ELSE PROOF YOUR STUFF! Guess who edits Peter???  :)  Sorry, man, you opened that door. Couldn't help myself.

[What is the worst error someone can make on their resume? (besides the obvious, like outright lying\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6vtrv?context=5)|Worst error: not proofreading effectively, or not asking someone with a really strong grasp of spelling, grammar, tone, etc. to read it through and be honest.  It's got to be error-free and it's got to read smoothly.  You want to ensure your margins are aligned, it's ""clean"" and ""crisp"" and it shows an accurate reflection of who you are.  The other worst error that immediately destines the doc for File 13:  forgetting to change something that was tailored for another company.  Company name is the usual WTF moment.
[What is the most common error you see?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6vtrv?context=5)|Most common: Not personalizing (or making specific, since it's not human!) to each job at each company where you apply.  Too many people use the same resume for every job...this is bad juju!!
[What if I am not ""clean"" and ""crisp""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6z7su?context=5)|Serious answer?
 |Even if you're not C&amp;C, you can still create an excellent resume though, right?  (if they don't need to ""see"" you when you submit the resume).  Then, come interview time, you can sacrifice for one day and clean yourself up.  Then, see if the job is right for you.  Boring answer, I know, but it's mostly reality.
 |Now, we could get into a whole discussion about what's the right job for you here.  C&amp;C isn't for everyone, and not every job needs C&amp;C.  It becomes a question to you of which is most important to you - your lifestyle or your future earning potential.
 |Not Serious Answer?  Join a rock band or crew.  Any other suggestions for this person?
[How do I make my .docx files smell like smoke??](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6y0zx?context=5)|Just type really, really fast!
[I have been out of work for over a year. Is there anything I can do to still be considered for a job?

 |Look into a Skills base resume - it's great for covering employment gaps.  I'll post a quick sample and template in our [Reddit dropbox stash](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/7zl0bz32u9oxwz3/os-IQq1GW-)
 |Also, have someone you trust, but that's honest, look at your resumes.  20/day is a huge # and there's more to the story.  
[When you are young, you tend to get glossed over. Everybody wants 4 years min of experience in a specialty trade. How am I supposed to obtain the experience if you won't hire me!? I have easily sent 10 resumes a day 3 times a week for the past 4 months, so it is definitely possible.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch71grw?context=5)|Absolutely - spend more time customizing your resume so it's not general and speaks to the person reviewing it that you created it just for this opportunity.  Also consider volunteering or finding an internship in your field (unpaid is far more common) and networking: who do you know that does what you'd like to and you could ask some questions, get some real ideas on where to begin?
 |Networking gives some opportunity here.  Get in front of the people that either make or influence the decision.  This can include LinkedIn (where references are easy to have).
 |Also, remember that ""experience"" can be somewhat relative.  While staying honest, consider things you did in school that might have given you some experience.  Experience also doesn't have to be paid experience.  If you're a programmer and have been programming for fun since you were 13, you have experience my friend!
[I have a Master's, and I need to hide it from my job history to get interviews where I live. (Yes, it's a MFA; as seen in my username\) How can I do this and not be a total pants-burning liar?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6wm4b?context=5)|As in Liar, liar, pants on fire?  Love it.  Yeah, you definitely don't want that.  On an application you're normally obligated to list ALL experience, educational pursuits, etc. so they've got you there...but on the resume, you choose what you want to highlight.  Just put ""Related Education"" and leave that MFA off there. 
[I am a 5th year chemical engineering student with a substantial amount of experience and  I used to have ""home brewing"" as an interest on my resume.  I had a chief engineer at company tell me that people might get the wrong idea from that.  However, every interview I had the people seemed to really get excited about it and start asking me tons of questions.  What are your thoughts on including interests/hobbies on a resume, no matter how professional it is?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6yb5z?context=5)|They key phrase in your question is ""no matter how professional it is"".
 |MY thoughts (this is Peter): I like a little personality in a resume.  It helps you stand out.  When you call me to follow up, or you come into an interview, I'll say ""Oh hey, that's Gary, the homebrew guy.""
 |It's a tough call, especially over Reddit, as to which way you go there.  Is the HR person super conservative and totally against alcohol?  Or are they super down to earth and share that common interest with you?
 |Look to the culture of the business, if possible.  You might find out pretty quickly if it's a place where that'd be cool vs. taboo.
 |**TL;DR:** Personality is great in a resume, it helps you stand out.  It's also a fine line.  Avoid controversial topics until you meet the interviewer face to face.
 |Most folks will be fine with it, if it relates somewhat and fleshes you out as a human being with verve.  I agree with Peter...and as for folks who would be offended, would you want to work with teetotalers?  Maybe not.  Of course, that could just be the hiring person whom you'd never have to deal with, but...
[I have been a stay at home mom for the last few years, but am now looking for a job,  what is a positive spin I can put on that so they don't focus on the fact that I haven't had a job in 4 years? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6zl7s?context=5)|This is Peter - and Jenny may have more to offer here soon.
 |First, look to a Skills resume.  Chronological might not be the best fit (but you be the judge based on your situation).
 |SAH moms usually do a lot of volunteer work and have other projects on the side.  Be sure to remember these.  Also, think about some things you could do at home, such as contribute articles to some blogs or websites, persue education, etc.  (all that said, trust me that I know SAH does NOT equal ""home on the couch!""
 |[Here's an article](http://www.sheknows.com/living/articles/834877/resume-tips-for-the-stay-at-home-mom) you might find interesting.  Anything to add here Jenny?
 |Congratulations!!!  That's one of the hardest jobs you'll ever love :)  I stayed home with my 4 girls for many years, and I wouldn't trade it for the world.  The good news is, many working mothers and fathers nowadays (including me!) have an appreciation for staying home to raise children; it's not an automatic detriment to your career.  You are correct to be aware that you need to be careful with your resume.  I would offer that you want it to be very professional with a great amount of detail - specific detail.  Break down the tasks you have been responsible for just as you would in a paid position: Managed household finances; prepared taxes independently; created meals based on principals of nutrition; reviewed school assignments daily; performed housecleaning daily while directing family members' chores.  This seems like a micro approach, but you can put these tasks into measurable, meaningful categories that reflect your expertise.  Finally, I'd advise using your network (which is large, I've no doubt!) to get the word out that you're looking for a position.  People who know you - your character, your dedication, your work ethic - can be your best champions.  Good luck!!   
[After I got out of the military I had about 4 crappy jobs that lasted about 4 to 6 months each, then I started the career I wanted to be in and am now looking a different job.  I have been in my current job for 3 years and the one before that for 5 years.  I want the military listed on my resume plus the 2 good jobs but I hate listing the 4 useless jobs on there because they are irrelevant, but I don't want gaps either.  How should I format it? Is ok to list relevant jobs and length of time you had them and not use dates?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6y8m5?context=5)|Honestly, if you're currently employed and there won't be a gap before your next job, I'd just leave the irrelevant ones out completely.  That gap will be in the past and shouldn't (shouldn't!) affect you.
 |Unfortunately, dates are usually ""required"".  Sends up a red flag if dates are omitted.
 |*edit* - remember, the purpose of a resume isn't to get you the job, it's to get you the interview.  The interview is your opportunity to explain the gap.  As an employer, I'd be fine with that gap for the reasons you listed, especially given that you have 8 years SINCE then of steady employment.
 |Using relevant jobs, definitely.  Leaving off dates/lengths is not a good idea (you're usually going to have to complete an application separately which will ask for those dates...for all positions, so they've got you). With that being said, your resume is what you want to highlight - what you're showing them as your best foot forward to fit with this job opening.  Title that section ""Related Experience"" and put the jobs you feel speak to that there.  In the interview you can cover how the two other positions prepared you for the next role that you loved (don't criticize any job during an interview - just make it about what you learned and the positive take-aways). 
[How do you feel about the 1 page rule for resumes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6vuzt?context=5)|I personally like a one-pager.  No more than 2, ever, for sure.  Mine is only one page and I've been working for a while.
[What's a common mistake made when creating curriculum vitaes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6vuzt?context=5)|Common mistake for CV's?  Too verbose, too lengthy and too much bragging.  People want to know what you've done, but leave enough mystery so they actually want to meet you.
[What do you use to make resumes?  Do you use latex at all?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6vuzt?context=5)|I use my keyboard :)
[You should play with LaTeX. Make your stuff look like it came out of the Oval Office. Also - nerd cred.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6wkc7?context=5)|Re: Latex question - I'm not 100% versed on it, but I do know of it.  It comes down to knowing the job opportunity, and ensure that the recipient can view it as intended.  If it comes out even the slightest bit garbled, most people would look at it and say ""WTF is this?!"".  If it's an opportunity that would ""get it"" w/o hesitation, sure.
 |Which is why PDF is the preferred way to deliver docs.  Formatting essentially can't change and isn't up for interpretation by the recipients version of word (doc vs docx, for example)
 |Sadly, though, most industries require pretty standard, boring resumes.  Exceptions include high tech/development jobs, and artys opps like marketing/etc.
[Customizing resumes for each interview is very time consuming. Do you have any tips on how to streamline the process? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6ydrf?context=5)|Sure - let's take a Chronological resume for example here: 
 |Have two Word docs.  One is your resume, the other is for ""Scrap""
 |Preformat all of your jobs to the same format, so each could be pasted into the resume as needed.
 |Cut and paste into the resume as needed.  If it doesnt' apply, cut from teh resume and put over in your scrap doc.  Chances are you've hand fewer than 5-6 jobs in the past 5 years, so you won't have a lot of moving to do.
 |Next approach - say you're looking for something in either Management OR finanance.  You're applying to 10 jobs, 5 in each.  So, you'd need 2 resumes - one that focuses on Management, one on Finanace.  Right?
 |Last, you SHOULD take the time to research each company to which you are applying, if only for 5 minutes.  Then, do a touch of tailoring to your resume to fit their company.  Some terms, some acronyms, some specific topics you know will catch there eye.
 |WHY?  Simple - invest 8-10 minutes into a job that you might be with for YEARS.  It's a good payoff.  
[I feel this will be more as sort of a consultancy than an actual AMA, but you stated that you are here to help. I am assuming that you are the founders of you business since you created a book on it that is widely used. Did you guys start off as HR oriented professionals and then found a gap in the market and decided to cater to that?  Secondly, I am struggling to land my dream job in the finance industry, and have never seen a truly successful formula for such a CV. Do you have a link to template that would satisfy most HR professionals?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6vroj?context=5)|This is Peter, and I'll let Jenny reply separately.  I wrote 20 Minute Resume because I knew there had to be a more systemized way to craft a resume.  So I did a bunch of research, worked with several HR people, found the ""best practices"" of what I call ""winning"" resumes, and filtered that info down to a framework.  So, that's how I got into this.  Then, I found it fun and fascinating, so that's why I stayed around!  Jenny here - I LOVE helping people achieve their dreams - that brings me great satisfaction.  I'll never build medical devices that save lives, but I can have honest conversations about folks' goals and how to get from here to here - that's my finest hour.  I actually began my career in counseling but soon found that I wanted to help people before they faced the kinds of challenges I saw...I wanted to give them hope through obtaining a career they could excel in.
 |As for your question, I concur with Peter - a CV is generally advisable for Education and Literature/Journalism sectors.  Unless you've published or taught extensively, I would go with a traditional resume.  And the template he shared should be a real help.  Good luck to you!
[Point of order. In the UK, we usually use CV and almost never use resume, so the academic distinction is likely only true in the US.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6yhx4?context=5)|Fair enough.  One reason we put ""US"" in the title.  There are cultural differences anywhere we look, so thanks to TTTaToo for bringing that one up.
 |The best way to keep this right is to look at the job description.  Does it say ""Submit a Resume"" or ""Submit a CV""?  Here's your sign ;-).  
[1.My  first name is slightly long tricky to pronounce... I saw on the Freakonomics documentary that CVs with ethnic names statistically have lower odds of getting picked.  In my day to day life I use a  similar, shorter and more common version of my own name, because its just more practical and easier for people to remember. Can I use this name on my CV instead?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6yyr0?context=5)|Use the shorter name.  It's a shame, but that's reality.  Same reason that overseas tech support folks have very western names.
[2.I'm an Architect. Is there a specific format for architectural CVs?, should I just mention the Studios I've work on, or should I include the buildings I've been involved with? The jobs I've found in the past I just kind of landed on account of recommendations, so I'm kind of a CV virgin.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6yyr0?context=5)|An architect resume is going to be a mix of a standard resume and a design portfolio.  1-2 page resume, and a portfolio of whatever length and format that works for you.  
[What is the easiest way to cut down a resume that is too long? Is it advisable to leave short term 'filler' jobs out? (for example, I lost my job and worked fast food for two months to have an income while searching for something more worthwhile\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6wsol?context=5)|Yes, only include relevant and positive job entries on the resume.  You'll have to list all jobs on the application, but most folks understand and will admire that when times were tough, you took work that was available - hopefully that's the case here.  Be honest, but don't give them a reason to wonder if you're a job hopper!!
[So is ok to leave dates off the resume or is it ok to have gaps listed?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch70zd1?context=5)|That's a tough situation, because it's not ok to leave dates off, nor is it advisable to have gaps.  Rock and a hard place, right?
 |Look into what is called a ""Skills"" resume - it gets rid of all that stuff.  
[Is it different for different situations? (Say, responding to an online posting vs. sending a resume to someone you have already met.\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6y87b?context=5)|You have to go with each situation differently obivisouly.  In general:   Not all resume reviews are HR people.  Some are small business folks that wear 15 different hats, so a little followup goes a long way.  It's fine to attempt to contact the hiring manager, though most places make it difficult and your email won't be responded to or your phone call demoted to a message for the admin. assistant...however, you have every right to try to contact the company so long as you're not being a jerk.  If you've not heard back in 2-3 weeks, consider trying to contact and asking if there is any feedback the company might be able to provide about your application materials.  Some places will do so, especially if they're smaller.   I don't see a difference for different situations, except that you might have better luck if you attempt phone contact.  Email is really easy to ignore. 
[I am having an extremely hard time getting interviews in new positions that feature jobs I am completely qualified for or even jobs I currently do.  Most of my applications have been through applying online.  I feel that my resume is solid and my CLs are good.. Do you know if there is more of an inherent difficulty to getting an interview from an online application as opposed to in person?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6vtqg?context=5)|If it's online, think like a search engine - keywords.  Most online submissions will get dumped to a database, and then automatically scanned for keywords.  Those that rank high will get passed to a human.
 |For example, say you're looking to be an inventory control manager for a manufacturing firm.  Be sure to include lots of keywords and jargon to ""Show"" the computer you're legit.  JIT, FIFO, FILO, QC, Efficiency, etc etc.  (just examples, I'm not a manuf inventory person)
 |Next, and this isn't a plug, but I would suggest that you find some HR folks that will give you some candid feedback - and just have them give it a quick look.  
[My boyfriend is concerned about listing our address on my resume, and I keep telling him he's nuts, and it should be on there.  Thoughts?  Thank you!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6xapf?context=5)|If he's applying to the mobb, might be cautious.
 |Kidding aside, and saying that I don't know anything about your situation, it IS standard practice, so I'd side with your ""nuts"" comment.  Hiding it could raise all sorts of speculation from the HR person.  
[My question is - how do you guys feel about including an objective? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6z6uo?context=5)| 
[I'm a former NCAA D1 athlete, how can I utilize that on my resume?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6w769?context=5)|This depends on your goal - are you looking to apply for a job that would connect with collegiate-level athletics in some way?  If not, I would include it for sure but push it down a bit, to the sections you've reserved for ""Activities"".  If the job you're applying for is, say, coaching or as an Athletic Director, I'd include it more prominently in your ""Related Experience"" section.  It might not have been paid, but all relevant experience can go there, if it's legitimately connected.
 |This is Peter - Being an athlete is a demanding job!  Think about how that'll translate to your goal.  Schedule, team work, demands, goals, pressure, competition, etc.
 |Another great use for your cover letter.
 |I'll also add that, depending on your sport, how important the people skills are, and that's likely something you've worked on more than most.  Working with a team in a stressful situation, motivation, leadership - all that will really help you stand out.  I think it's a great advantage for you.  That help?  If not, give us some specifics and we'll try to dig deeper.  
[I'm looking to get a job in a different state.  What's the best way to approach this so a hiring manager doesn't just think, ""this guy is two states away. Not worth my time.""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6ygi0?context=5)|Mention in your cover letter that you'll be visiting the area on ___date, and you'd like to set up a meeting to discuss your interest in the position.  Follow up with a personal phone call a few days after the Hiring Manager has reviewed your resume.  Be tenacious, not whiny.  It works! 
[How would you tailor a resume for a job in government versus private sector? Also, what is your experience with Wonderlic? Any tips?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6wqnd?context=5)|For the government, I would use a more structured resume with distinct categories and wording that relates my responsibilities in former roles to what this position is likely to include.  Also definitely put in your volunteer experience or civic organization stuff - anything that screams ""responsible citizen"".  I've not used Wonderlic...Peter, have you??  
[I forget the official name of it, but I was once told that, if you needed some resume filler, to put in a section under your contact info with certain ""power words"" like ""Independent • Dependable • Initiative • Leadership"".  Is this a viable tactic, or will it be seen as the filler that it is?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6u4w1?context=5)|Call it what you want (Highlights?) but this **is** used effectively if you need some filler.  I'd suggest avoiding cliche phrases though, and instead, highlight your key skills.  [Here's a sample chronological resume](https://www.dropbox.com/s/e1u1qa8w86uogeb/Sample%20Chrono%20Resume.pdf) that uses something almost exactly like you mentioned.  Notice, though, that she highlighted her key value propositions.  Things like ""Independent, etc"" are on 99.9% of resumes out there already, right?  So, take that opportunity to stand out a bit.   
[What's the minimum GPA before its in your best interest to not put GPA on your resume? I'm about to finish up engineering degree from one of the best programs for my degree in the country but my GPA is hovering at around a 2.4. I have experience from an internship that I try to emphasize but what do I do about my GPA? Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6zj64?context=5)|As many have said, 3.0-3.5 = list it; otherwise, don't - regarless of school.
 |Pump up that internship experience, talk about WHAT you did in the classes, and that's your best bet.  Some firms MUST know your GPA, in which case, you have to face reality that you'll have some 'splaining to do (if you get the chance).
 |Here, too, networking is your friend.  A quick referral from a buddy of the hiring person can go a long way toward overlooking GPA.  
[Hey, I am a kid and do not have that much experience, could I put that I worked at an ambiguous store or would I rather be honest and say I do not have that much experience. PS for a job at Starbucks Do volunteer things count and if yes should I put it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6w551?context=5)|Hello!  The good news is, ALL ""kids"" as you describe yourself have little to no experience.  Don't be discouraged!  Yes, you absolutely need to list your job at Starbucks, and it should be detailed with the job responsibilities you had: order fulfillment, financial transactions, operation of automated equipment.  Don't gloss over your time there, and DEFINITELY list the employer's name.  Also, you should always list relevant volunteer experience...this goes a long way with most employers, but it goes even further if you don't have a ton of paid jobs to include.  Good luck!!
 |As someone that's hired a lot of ""kids"", show me that you're worth taking a risk on.  100% DO include volunteer work.  Also, Boy or Girl Scouts, church groups, sports teams, events you've helped run, etc.  Anything that took even a bit of responsibility.  All that stuff gives you points.  
 |Your cover letter will be key here.  Professionally demonstrate your desire to work, to excel, and to be valuable to the company.  Don't hide your lack of experience, but rather, show how your personality sets you up for success with them.  (and by personality, I mean work ethic, desire, friendliness, etc).  That help?  Ask more if not.  
[I work trades, is a cover letter still important for me to have with my resume? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6woxs?context=5)|It's not as often used in the trades, for sure - but if you include one it will be impressive...with one exception.  If you're interviewing with a die-hard, crusty SOB who values hard work above all, I wouldn't hand him (stereotyping here - it's a him) a crisp clean cover letter.  Save that for the front office staff if the company is large enough that they have a professional office.   
[What about languages where you can't avoid this? In Spanish using first or third person will invariably change the verb, you just can't get passed that.  If you HAD to choose, which one would be your choice? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch7119u?context=5)|If someone held a gun on me, I'd say first person.  How creepy is it to say, ""Jenny raised profits 45%"".  Ever see the Jimmy episode on Seinfeld?  If you're old enough, you know exactly what I'm saying!!
[How about the typo in the post title?  ""...that specialize in perfecting resumes to *land* people interviews.""  No offense, but that is a kick in the credibility testicles. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch73dqn?context=5)|Yeah, I saw that too after it was too late.  We had trouble getting the AMA posted and this was the 6th time we'd typed the title.  
[Comma splice!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch72hih?context=5)|I really, really, totally love the comma splice.  It's such a cute little way to make people halt, then halt again!  Thanks for your comment - I smiled.  Favorite book: Eats, Shoots and Leaves.  Genius!! I would have titled it Eats, Shoots, and Leaves, however.  And there goes the whole joke!!
[Overqualified...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6yhrx?context=5)|Yep, resumes need to be tailored to the job at hand.  Sometimes, life's turns require seeking a job that might be a departure from your history.  (this is sometimes a great thing, BTW).
 |So, don't ""forget"" about your experience, just spin it differently.
 |I will caution you though - that when you leave something off but it comes up in an interview, be prepared to back up why you left it off, ya know?  ""So you say you have a MFA, but you don't list it here.  What else are you hiding?""  Don't act cornered, act confident.  ""If I listed everything I've done in my life, I'd fill up 5 pages, and I know you don't have time for that!""  (Then, quickly change the subject).  Sound fair?
[If I'm hiring a new admin assistant and some Joe with 6 years in the local orchestra and an MFA applies, I'm not hiring him because he's going to leave as soon as his next audition lands him a gig.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gc91/iama_we_are_professional_and_published_resume/ch6zps4?context=5)|Ryken brings up a great point, and something that speaks to ""put yourself in the shoes of the job"".  This is a total real, and very legit concern.
 |So speak to that in the interview.  Since you tailored your resume for the job, you'll get the interview, right?  RIGHT?!

24gzxc,1,2014-05-01,Career Advice: Help,GoingWestASAP,marketing,https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/24gzxc/career_advice_help/,"So I know this is a long shot but here goes:

I need help finding a job in Marketing and Advertising.  I don't know where else to go so I thought someone here might be able to help.  I am trying to find a job in a marketing or advertising capacity.  I am going to graduate from my university this month and I believe I am having so much trouble finding a job in this field because:

1.  I am not a Business school major (double major in Economics and International Affairs)
2.  I only have taken a few classes in marketing or business (which have been my favorite classes at school hands down)
3.  I have a **LOT** of internship experience, but I feel like not enough is relevant for this field
4.  I am trying to get a job in a big city, especially on the West Coast (California, Denver, Seattle, etc), or even in NYC.  I am of course looking everywhere, but location is important too.  Pickers can't be choosers I suppose but it doesn't mean I can't try I suppose...

Maybe someone here can even give me a better lead on where to apply or more specific things to look into.  My motivation for marketing is sort of like this, as I explained in an email to my friend:

""I chose my other major in International Affairs because I love everything International, and I love everything International because I love everything that is ""different"" i.e. cultures, societies, and **especially** people.  And I love different people because I love seeing and trying to understand how people think and what makes us similar and different.  There is such a vast world out there that it is impossible to know if what you are thinking is similar or different from the norm.  Figuring out what people want and desire through all of the thick diversity around the world is incredible, and finding those needs and wants is what I believe lies at the heart of Marketing and Advertising.  It is a way to take both a creative and scientific approach to understanding how the world and people work.""

Marketing, advertising, market research methodology: All of it is incredibly fascinating to me but it is so hard to get a job.  I've applied to many but, as you could imagine, I have not been successful in my search.  I don't want to settle for a job I don't want because I know this field is where my passions (and happiness) lie.  If ANYONE can give me advice on how to better go about my search or would like to PM me, it would mean the world to this redditor :)"
24h4d6,2,2014-05-01,Interview at Nasdaq OMX - In need of some tips,Pellebelle,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/24h4d6/interview_at_nasdaq_omx_in_need_of_some_tips/,"Howdy! 

I have been invited to an interview at Nasdaq OMX for a summer internship position. It's a technology internship where most of the job will consist of programming in Java, according to the description.

The interview is scheduled for the entire day, so I guess there will be more than one interview, perhaps even some problem cases? They didn't reveal much when I asked, so I can only assume.

I'm majoring in Financial Engineering and have focused my studies towards stochastic calculus, so I'm not from the computer science area, but I guess they think my resume is ok any way?

My question to you is, what kind of questions can I expect? What should I prepare extra thoroughly? Have any of you been to an interview at Nasdaq? How was it?

Thanks in advance."
24h5v3,8,2014-05-01,I need to get this off my chest (long),ouibonjourmadame,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/24h5v3/i_need_to_get_this_off_my_chest_long/,"I came across this subreddit a long time ago reading a post someone had x-posted from another subreddit I'm active into. Sorry if my English is not the best, it's my second language. Anyways I remember I thought: maybe I had a Nmom reading the stories here. Then a few days ago I decided to read all the trait list and omg did I recognize my mom. 

My parents are separated. They never got along. Dad is an introvert and kind of.. Living in his head. My mom is a psychologist. I have an older sister, a younger brother. I'm 21 years old. I got pregnant last year with my current SO. He's a student. I was a waitress. It was a surprise pregnancy. I was living with my dad with my SO and brother. We were living in the basement. My dad and brother were smoking inside, cleaning nothing. The house looked like the TV show: hoarding: buried alive. My dad offered to let us stay there with the baby. We kept the pregnancy secret from my mom until it was too late for abortion because I knew she would talk about it ALL the time. When we announced the pregnancy, she got mad, insulted us and called me that night to tell me I HAD to get an abortion. We left for 10 days in a country house my dad had rented. When we came, she was all excited about the baby and offered to us to come stay with her. She was living alone in her big 5 bedroom house. Really nice from her. We accepted. At first she was so nice my SO couldn't understand why I had problems with her in the past. Everyone always believes her. She's a psychologist. She knows best. When I was 16 she tried to intern me in the hospital. She was a psychologist. And as no one would listen to me, I'd get more mad. And she would say: you can see, she's getting mad at me and I just want the best for her, I'm a psychologist. Anyways.

So we came to live with her. She decided we'd pay a part of the groceries by giving her a certain amount of money on the first of each month. We also pay rent but a not much, but she has the right to walk in our room at anytime of day and night and to use us pretty much as her slaves. She even walked in while we had intercourse once, and decided she'd stay until we stopped, ""in case we were thinking about getting pregnant again"". She would never do the groceries. We would do it (with our money). She works a lot and eats out but still ate at home. She'd ask for more money for the groceries. We refused has she almost never bought anything. She got mad and told everyone we were so ungrateful. My SO has student loans. He received money from the government because he has now a child. He decided not to use it since he'd have to pay it back. When she heard, she was mad because she said we should have gave that money to her and be in debt. We need to hide all our money and everything we buy. If we buy things, we have money that we should have given her. She's making so much damn money herself, her house is almost all paid and she wants to take everything we have. Every dollar she knows we have, she finds a way to get it. We can't buy anything for our daughter. She wants to control everything.

I never do anything right concerning taking care of our daughter. One day I'm the best mom in the world (if there's people around). The next day, I do EVERYTHING wrong. We are also the only ones cleaning the house. It's never enough. We have a 2 month old. My SO is in finals. We don't do enough. She says what my SO is doing is easy and he should study less and spend more time cleaning or do any chore she'd like him to do.(he does engineering)

We're supposed to move out in January of next year. My SO's parents have an apartment but it's being renovated right now (it's basicly their house's second floor they used to rent before).They want to rent it to us for a reduced price. It's really nice and we could not afford something else this nice. When we told his dad that we could not stand to stay with my mom until January he said it could be ready this fall. We were satisfied with that.

But now, my mom won't work this month. She has ""professional burnout"" (her boss told her to stop being late every single day, she continued because she won't listen to anyone, she's always late, it's her way to control people, so she told her doctor she was having a burnout) and then she won't be working this summer either because she's working in schools. Since she has stopped working our life is a total nightmare. She's always at home. She's really intrusive. Follows us everywhere. Comments everything we do. Nothing we do is okay. And also everytime we talk about moving out or any dream we have (go back to school for me, eventually buying a house, our future life with our daughter and future other children) she just criticizes us and keeps repeating we will fail. I can't take it anymore. Being told I won't have in success in life is really bringing me down. Also, she constantly screams, in front of the baby. She tries to hit me. She said our daughter was ""an error"". She tries to manipulate us and everyone around us. She lies to all our family and friends. We're tired and depressed because of her. I tried telling her that her criticizing us is making me sad. She just responds: it's not my problem if you have not self-esteem. She says I have paranoia. She always diagnoses people (especially her children) with mental illness. Also, she says she has EVERY right (even to scream and be violent) because we live at her house. I told her no one has the right to scream and be violent and that it brings nothing positive. Also, she does like she didn't hear what I said if I say something she don't like. I repeat. Try to get her attention. She just leaves the room. 

My SO's parents offered to us to come stay at their place until the apartment is ready. The house is smaller. His sister tends to smoke weed inside the house (but probably her mom would make her stop if we'd come live there). I'm scared to go live with his family. They have a huge dog and the house is covered in hair. I guess I'm just shy. Also I'm scared of my mom's reaction. I don't know if she'll try to take revenge and try to make us lose custody of our child (because she knows his family smoke pot). Or that she'll do something horrible. She's so manipulative. My dad is sick with lung cancer. I don't want to completly screw my relationship with her. She hurts me really bad all the time and makes me feel ridiculous if I show her any feelings (sadness especially). I want the best for us and for my daughter. Sorry that was long."

:--|:--
[Hello Imran, I really appreciate your website and the way BoF sticks to its values of balanced journalism, which is really rare in fashion industry. You have seen many personalities of fashion and the way the industry works. From there, what is your take on racism in fashion industry? Do you think it still exists?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gu7k/i_am_imran_amed_founder_of_the_business_of/ch6yz18?context=5)|I think, unfortunately, racism still exists everywhere, not just in fashion. We've still got a long way to go before we live in a world truly free of racism.
 |As for fashion in particular, one of the things I appreciate most of all is that most people in fashion truly celebrate and appreciate diversity.
 |Hopefully over time, we can play a part in sparking discussions within the the fashion world about why we all need to be conscious of how the actions we take and the decisions we make (say for example within fashion editorials, or runway shows, or in store service) need to be sensitive to everyone. Fashion is a global business and must reflect this.
[How did you grow BOF into the business it is, and how did you get taken seriously when first starting out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gu7k/i_am_imran_amed_founder_of_the_business_of/ch6zfs2?context=5)|BoF started as a passion project, not as a business. This enabled me to focus on creating the best content possible, and focusing on the things that were interesting to me. The content acted as viral social objects that people would share, and then spread on social media, which further built the BoF community and the BoF brand.
 |Regarding getting taken seriously, this was a real challenge. I was a former McKinsey consultant with no previous experience in fashion, so I tried as hard as I could to learn as much about fashion as possible. I am very lucky that I had good teachers (my fashion friends) and an insatiable appetite for learning about fashion and the people who work in the industry. I built my knowledge base one conversation at a time, and this helped me build a mental map of the fashion world and how 'the business of fashion' really works.
[I work in marketing at ANN INC. but am interested in foraying into luxury marketing.  Is an MBA necessary?  Or are MBA's useless in the fashion world since it's all about whom you know?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gu7k/i_am_imran_amed_founder_of_the_business_of/ch6zezz?context=5)|An MBA can be very useful for two reasons.
 |1) To accelerate your exisiting career path by helping you to develop general management skills (which can also enable you to demand a higher salary)
 |OR.
 |2) To pivot from your existing career path and do something completely different.
 |I went and did my MBA wanting to pivot, but ended up going back into management consulting. It was only years later that I managed to make the switch.
 |In your case, you will need to think about what additional skills you need to move into luxury marketing and decide whether an MBA can help you get there. Increasingly, I believe MBAs are seen as valuable in fashion, as long as you can understand the unique dynamics and culture of the fashion industry.
 |And to your point about knowing people -- yes that can always helps you to get a meeting, but at the end of the day it is going to come down to your skillset and resume to get the job.
[What is the biggest set back you have faced in your career and how did you respond to it?  What lessons did you learn that have helped you reach where you are today?  Thank you!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gu7k/i_am_imran_amed_founder_of_the_business_of/ch6zgsl?context=5)|My first risky venture post-McKinsey, a fashion incubator, only lasted 9 months. It taught me a lot about picking the right business partner, about how important timing can be in setting up a successful business, and how you can always bounce back if you really know what your own talents are and believe in yourself. I also learned so much about fashion in those 9 months that helped build a foundation for a knowledge base about fashion.
[Which (if any\) of the old cliches/rules of thumb should no longer apply?  (e.g. no white after labor day\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gu7k/i_am_imran_amed_founder_of_the_business_of/ch6z2g3?context=5)|I don't believe in fashion rules, except that you should always be yourself and dress in a way that is appropriate to the context and culture. Be yourself and don't worry about old-fashioned rules!
[, fellow Canadian! Secondly, I love that you would do something like this. Very smart and inspiring. I don't know that I have a question so much as a need for advice. I have a fashion design concept, a plan to implement it and (most\) of the skills needed to see it through. I've been reading/watching tons on 99u, TED, and BOF and there is a lot of info and strategy for getting over that fear of failure. Its not so much the fear of failure for me, its the fear of becoming broke after quitting a day job to follow a dream that might fail. Any advice or strategies for overcoming this? Do you think having a year long break and a failed business looks better on a resume than not trying at all? How would you have proceeded if BOF had not been such a success?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gu7k/i_am_imran_amed_founder_of_the_business_of/ch705hz?context=5)|My first entrepreneurial venture failed, and making the decision to leave a secure job was one of the hardest decisions I have ever made because I too was afraid of failure -- sometimes I am still afraid of failing! But, in all honesty, that initial decision to set up my own company, while not ultimately successful, was the best decision I have ever made, and now, when presented with a safe path or a risky, exciting path, I almost always choose the risky path. Taking risks is like anything else in life...the more you do it, the easier it becomes. 
[Hi Imran, simple question...what are you wearing right now?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gu7k/i_am_imran_amed_founder_of_the_business_of/ch6zmns?context=5)|Phillip Lim trousers, Phillip Lim shirt and my favourite blazer from a small Japanese brand called ICHO, along with some TODS Recode Boots.
[Hello, I love BoF! I've been following for a while now.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gu7k/i_am_imran_amed_founder_of_the_business_of/ch6zom8?context=5)|As for department stores, they are in a very challenging position and will need to reinvent themselves to maintain their relevance in the digital age, when everything is available online.
[I am an incoming buying intern for Saks. Any advice for getting the full time offer?  What is your opinion on the future of Saks and Neiman Marcus as luxury power players in the fashion market? Especially now that saks Has new leadership?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gu7k/i_am_imran_amed_founder_of_the_business_of/ch6zom8?context=5)|As an intern, if you can make yourself indispensable, they will keep you. Work as hard as you can and show initiative and dedication to your work. And, always be a nice person. That counts too.
[I was wondering as to what is your specific take on fashion blogging? I know that BoF prides itself on being analytical and objective about portraying business news, so what are the pros and cons of fashion blogging as a form of media? Is fashion blogging a sustainable part of the fashion industry or is it merely a trend?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gu7k/i_am_imran_amed_founder_of_the_business_of/ch6zqkq?context=5)|I think fashion blogging is here to stay, but as so many people are now launching fashion blogs, it is harder and harder to create something that stands out amidst all the noise.
[Hi Imran! Powerpoint slides can be very creative. I am currently an analyst working at McKinsey and searching for a secondment in fashion. Any advice on how to break into the industry? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gu7k/i_am_imran_amed_founder_of_the_business_of/ch6zmpj?context=5)|Get to know the industry and how it works, and especially understand the culture, the creativity and the various functions of fashion so you can see where you might best fit in. Get to know as many people as possible, ask lots of questions.
 |Check out this article that I wrote on this very topic: [Link to www.businessoffashion.com](http://www.businessoffashion.com/2014/01/6-pieces-of-advice-for-mbas-trying-to-break-into-the-fashion-business.html)
[Hello Imran, As you have interviewed and met many of the successful forces behind the worlds most revered fashion houses. In your opinion what skills make a good leader within a fashion house, and who has been the most inspiring person you have met during your career?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gu7k/i_am_imran_amed_founder_of_the_business_of/ch6zg3b?context=5)|Good leaders within fashion must have an appreciation of both the commercial and creative aspects of the industry, and increasingly, an understanding of how technology is transforming the way the industry works.
 |One of the most inspiring people I have been lucky to get to know is Natalie Massenet, the founder of Net a Porter. She has always encouraged me to pursue BoF as a business, not just a hobby. It took me a few years to build up the confidence and courage to this, but Natalie played a key role in helping me to get there. She is wonderful and amazing.
[Hi Imran. BOF is great, I read it almost daily! I am kind of new to the sector, just finished an MBA in fashion. My question is how do you see the evolution of Brick &amp; Mortar Retail? And are you bored like me with seeing the same store concept repeated ""ad infinitum"" the world over? Thanks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gu7k/i_am_imran_amed_founder_of_the_business_of/ch6zq3z?context=5)|Yes, I am totally bored with identikit stores with the same product everywhere. I travel all over the world, and everyone has the same stuff. That's why novel retail concepts, with a unique point of view, and experiential elements are becoming more and more important on the retail landscape. I do most of my shopping online...
[Hi Imran,I have noticed your focus on China ,Australia ,Brazil and emerging markets.I was wondering if you have any comments on Africa and it's growth barring South Africa?In terms of its importance to luxury market retailors in the next decade or so?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gu7k/i_am_imran_amed_founder_of_the_business_of/ch70t27?context=5)|Funny you should mention that!

[I would like to know what did you think BOF would become? Did you see it at first as a media company or did you just want to share the business side of fashion and it just took off from there? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gu7k/i_am_imran_amed_founder_of_the_business_of/ch6zivg?context=5)|BoF started as a little passion project from my sofa, once a week or so. I had no idea about the journey it would take me on, and I am enjoying every minute! Start with your passion, align it with your career, and magical things can happen.
[My question is about your advice for building awareness for a startup brand - have you seen any really smart examples of how a designer / brand has generated the requisite ""buzz"" without investing thousands in a PR agency?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gu7k/i_am_imran_amed_founder_of_the_business_of/ch6zpv0?context=5)|I live in Notting Hill too!

You don't need millions of followers for this to be effective. It is more about the quality of your followers and fans, than the quantity.
[Finally, do you see BoF as having a role in the discovery / showcasing of new and emerging designers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gu7k/i_am_imran_amed_founder_of_the_business_of/ch6zpv0?context=5)|And yes, showcasing new designers/brands have been part of our BoF DNA from the very beginning via our series of Spotlight article showcasing brands and designers that are showing creative and commercial promise.

[I love your newest launch BoF Careers, I think its a great idea! However, when I was checking it out I was disappointed to see you don't really have any partner in the west coast and don't have ANY job posting in Los Angeles - are you planning to expand your partner group?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gu7k/i_am_imran_amed_founder_of_the_business_of/ch6zr25?context=5)|Yes, stay tuned. We will have more job opportunities from all over the world. Our first set of launch partners is only the beginning.
[Hello Imran In your opinion are the fashion schools able to answer to industry demands? And what do you think about the young generation's preference on getting head office jobs on buying or marketing instead of evaluating a start for their careers on retail/sales where there are opportunities?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gu7k/i_am_imran_amed_founder_of_the_business_of/ch6zs06?context=5)|1) Some are often sorely lacking in business training, focused solely on the creative elements of fashion, operating in vacuum from all of the other elements that make the fashion industry tick.
 |2) Others are too commercial and don't give designers enough time to develop a creative point of view...
 |The right balance between commerce and creativity is key! Plus, there needs to be more education on how technology is changing fashion and how these tools can be used to streamline the industry and amplify and aid in the creative process.
[Imran, I am one of the founders of Lola Getts Active, think Lululemon but for plus size. Although some of your articles do not pertain to our demographic there are many that are technically based towards E-Commerce.  Are you planning on doing a segment on the plus size community and the enormous opportunity it offers manufacturers and retailers? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gu7k/i_am_imran_amed_founder_of_the_business_of/ch6zvy7?context=5)|Last November we featured an op-ed on the opportunity in the market for plus-size fashion. Check it out here: [Link to www.businessoffashion.com](http://www.businessoffashion.com/2013/11/op-ed-fashion-should-take-plus-sizes-seriously.html)
[Why are starting salaries still so low in the fashion industry, even in luxury brands, when there is so much emphasis on employees dressing well and looking fashion-forward?  There seems to be a disconnect. Will this ever change in the future?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gu7k/i_am_imran_amed_founder_of_the_business_of/ch6zx1r?context=5)|I think it might be a question of supply and demand. With so many people who want to work in fashion, and few opportunities, companies don't need to pay high salaries to attract good talent? That is just a hypothesis...but I don't know for sure.
 |As for dressing fashion forward, being fashionable doesnt necessarily require a lot of money -- it requires a good sense of style and the ability to put together a good look from what you have.
[What did you think about what Lawrence Lenihan said in his op-ed about the end of $1 billion fashion brands?  What do you think the dominant business structure for fashion designers going forward will be?  Link here for the article. Link to www.businessoffashion.com.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gu7k/i_am_imran_amed_founder_of_the_business_of/ch700wf?context=5)|Lawrence is an amazing Op-Ed writer because he takes a very strong position on everything related to entrepreneurship in the fashion sector. I do think that we need to spend less time focusing on building huge businesses, and more time focusing on building great, sustainable businesses!
[In all of your research and interviews, have you met any designers that particularly stand out to you in terms of they way they run their business and/or maintain their personal lives? How do you think they manage to be successful on both fronts?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gu7k/i_am_imran_amed_founder_of_the_business_of/ch6zy2m?context=5)|Tory Burch has a great balance between her personal and professional lives, and leaves the office at 6pm everyday to spend time with her three sons. This is admirable.
 |Setting clear professional/personal boundaries is important...
[What was the catalyst for you to quit the corporate path at 30 and switch to a less conventional and less secure job in a newly emerging fashion blogging community?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gu7k/i_am_imran_amed_founder_of_the_business_of/ch6zlcf?context=5)|I was feeling unfulfilled by my work, and knew somewhere inside of me that if I combined my analytical skills within a creative context, I might be able to find a career path that was more up my alley. I had reached the end of my tether and felt like I had no other option but to try. I am really glad that I did.
[Hi Imran, In relation to BOF why is it, considering you've created such an amazing space for intelligent fashion journalism, that you don't pay for the freelance pieces you commission and publish? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gu7k/i_am_imran_amed_founder_of_the_business_of/ch704ic?context=5)|For a long time, I was not able to pay freelancers as BoF was not run as a business. People contributed from all over the world because they shared my passion for the business of fashion. Today, we do pay our freelancers.
[Hello Imran, I had the opportunity to meet you once and really admire your work. It seems that fashion still has a long way to go when it comes to embracing technology and vice-versa. Apple hired former YSL CEO Paul Deneve and Burberry's historic now ex-CEO Angela Ahrendts sending a strong message to both industries. Many people seem to think that their plan is to only launch an i-watch but Apple is known for redefining paradigms and being a trendsetter, not a follower... I truly believe it will be much more than a device: they are most likely aiming for the whole wardrobe. Do you believe that may be the case? If there is a radical shift in the way people dress in the next following years which brands do you see striving and thriving? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gu7k/i_am_imran_amed_founder_of_the_business_of/ch713gv?context=5)|I have no idea what Apple has up its sleeves, but certainly the recent moves make this a company to watch! (no pun intended)
[Hello Imran,  I am soon moving to NYC from the Midwest and getting my first job out of college. How would you suggest breaking into the fashion and PR world to start building out contacts and network?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gu7k/i_am_imran_amed_founder_of_the_business_of/ch6zkyp?context=5)|I answered a similar question here, hope that is helpful: [Link to www.reddit.com](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gu7k/i_am_imran_amed_founder_of_the_business_of/ch6zqn1)
[Hello Imran, and thanks so much for doing this AMA. You mentioned that BOF started as a passion project. How did you pivot to running it as business, and what was the catalyst?  BOF has become my daily and it's honestly indispensable since I decided to change careers and start a luxury label.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gu7k/i_am_imran_amed_founder_of_the_business_of/ch70rsc?context=5)|My decision to focus on BoF full time came as a natural extension of the growth of BoF -- I simply couldn't manage it any more on the very lean infrastructure that I had in place. In order to continue down the journey I had started, I had to dedicate myself to it full time and find the team of people and investors who could help me. I am very lucky and grateful that I have found people who believe in my vision for BoF.
 |Thank you for reading BoF everyday!
[Long time follower. Super excited about the merging of two loves bof and reddit! What fashion business do you think is in trouble? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gu7k/i_am_imran_amed_founder_of_the_business_of/ch6zzp2?context=5)|I am watching Mulberry very carefully. They seem to have let a very successful business strategy unravel disastrously. The share price is down over 60% since the arrival (and departure) of the CEO Bruno Guillon who attempted to position the brand higher...it's a cautionary tale.
[Will Apple's technocratic culture have the patience for Angela Ahrendts?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gu7k/i_am_imran_amed_founder_of_the_business_of/ch6zukc?context=5)|Only time will tell on this. I am keen to see how Angela's contributions at Apple will help to bring a new point of view to what is a very strong culture, with a very 'Jobsian' way of dealing with things. Let's see!
[Hi, Imran. How did you navigate forging relationships in the fashion industry? I'm a current economics student looking to bridge that gap.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24gu7k/i_am_imran_amed_founder_of_the_business_of/ch6zv0s?context=5)|Network, cold call, tell everyone you know you are interested in meeting people who work in fashion. And then ask every person you meet to introduce you to someone else. It's like a snowball!

24h9tq,2,2014-05-01,"[Deck] Holistic Medical Solutions, a Division of Jinteki",boardgamehoarder,Netrunner,https://www.reddit.com/r/Netrunner/comments/24h9tq/deck_holistic_medical_solutions_a_division_of/,"This is an H&amp;P revision of a deck that's been fairly successful in the past few weeks.  The main thrust is to make running as expensive and unprofitable as possible.  There's lots of asset economy and taxing ice, with Ash and Caprice to protect my agendas in play.

I've just added a bunch of H&amp;P cards, and I'm not sure if I've improved or hampered the deck.  I pulled Jackson and Encryption Protocol to make room for Interns and Reclamation Order and replaced Celebrity Gift with Medical Research Fundraiser.  I'm tempted to replace Reclamation Order with more assets and Bastion with Hive, but I won't be able to pull much out of archives after that.

Any advice you have would be greatly appreciated!

24hjry,1,2014-05-01,I'm just not any good at living,tatahtoh,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/24hjry/im_just_not_any_good_at_living/,"Hate my current position, not have any disease, ongoing trouble or something tearing me down.

I just can't seem to get through it all. I'm not depressed or suicidal, I just don't see the point. I had a great time going out last night with some friends. Today there was some bs amongst 2 of my friends over a girl. I was temporarily amused and now I am annoyed by the entire situation.

University is easy, whatever clicks with me is easy, whatever doesn't is a hell. Aced all but one class so far, but now I have to get an internship. No clue what to do, can't postpone and deadline is coming up.

Have work, hate work, tried to set up my own stuff (quite competent just incredibly shit at pushing myself some days / weeks it goes well for a while but then suddenly everything just drops and I don't seem to be able to finish it or only if there are other people involved who I can not let down).

I can not seem to focus to make certain things happen. Just ever since I turned 18 throughout my early 20's (23 now). Its just utter shit.
But I don't know why, nothing big changed, no structural changes, no big leap in emotional state. I just gradually failed at everything I value. Which leads me to believe that my live isn't worth living because I don't enjoy it more than the hassle I go through to hopefully receive some joy in return. 

It is so much more effort to keep up and keep myself satisfied that I wonder what the point is. Everyone (including me) hop from one goal to another. I can't even seem to complete any I just hop on and get by with the minimal result but it is already so much fucking effort for me to pull that off because I feel like I have to juggle so many things at once. 

When even when I try to rationally look at my situation, I should have nothing to complain about. I pay all my bills, I 'm getting through uni with a good degree. But I guess that isnt enough for me (in my head, chemically or neurologically).

Socially a bit awkward, not that I mind. I do fine on my own ( I do have friends but I meant that I don't mind sit at home watch a series instead of going out.) But I do miss being intimate with someone.

Some days I just want it all to end, or for it all to pause... For me to get some space... Everything seems to work out, but I dont sleep any better, I don't feel any calmer nor any more content.

I do not know where to go from here, I just felt the need to vent and hopefully someone can help me out with some advice.

edit:

Reason I might be so upset or worried is because I tend to think about every aspect a lot. (Different perspectives, different choices, different outcomes and how to respond to all of this.) This means I spend a lot of time overthinking situations that may never occur but could still worry me. It also means that regardless of how much it involves me, I am investing myself into an issue whether I benefit by solving it or not.
I've grown to not care about small stuff and problems that don't involve me but still I seem to worry a lot

**TL;DR**

- No disease, sickness or anything that should make me feel so fucked up

- Friends fight over a girl, funny at first. 3 hours in Kind of annoying. (Girl is insecure, has some issues. Likes one of em alot but they re friends and now the other gave her some attention too and now he is attractive in a 'we could hook up because ur cute and I like the attention kind of way'). **short tl dr of a tldr: I hate social interaction issues because there is no logical solution where all parties are satisfied with the outcome**

- Myself not that social, don't go out too often. Have fun when I do.

- Nothing satisfies me, constantly looking for ways to feel more content.

- Problems (uni, socially, job, anything) keep stacking up and I take a lot of time analyzing and solving them. Driving myself mad over every possibility, factor or person involved

- Take on a lot of stuff as my responsibility

- Bullshit deadlines, no space to do my own stuff and when I finally make some I fail to capitalize on it and rather 'enjoy' the spare time by doing pointless stuff or worrying about why I am not doing something useful (or solve one of the many problems).

- Not been intimate with anyone for couple of years now."
24hl36,16,2014-05-01,"Not sure this is the right subreddit, but I thought I'd share my experience with homosexuality ...",[deleted],lgbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/24hl36/not_sure_this_is_the_right_subreddit_but_i/,"So here goes.  I hope that someone can read this and be helped.  I wish I had someone, when I was young, that could have helped me out.

I grew up in a very conservative part of Oklahoma on a farm in the middle of no where.  I didn't have Internet until I was 14...cable TV until I was 20.  All i knew was my small little sheltered world.  Just some context.

My first homosexual experience happened at age 6.  I was in first grade and I sacked the class bully's dick on the playground at school.  I did this everyday at recess to avoid getting hurt.  When I was young I was very slight and non confrontational (still am this one.)  Needless to say, Bully was held back and I advanced.  My ""innocence"" returned for a few years.

At age 9 I hit puberty...my first public hair.  I thought this was odd, as no one else had them in the bathroom.  It started to feel good when I touched myself and I began to realize what I had done a few years prior.  I began to experiment.  First by myself, but slowly I began trying things with a friend.  That didn't go far and i kept my thoughts, which wholly surrounded men, to myself.

I began masterbating and cumming at 11.  It was amazing.  My first time to reach orgasm i swear i saw stars.  Unbeknownst to me, my cousin began feeling what I had felt at 9...the curiosity.  He was 2 weeks younger than me.  He came over one weekend, as was typical, and asked me if I'd ever wanked (not typical).  What followed was three years (12-15) of gay experimentation and sex.  We blew each other, jerked each other and fucked each other, getting off several times each day.

I was in heaven.  He was my best friend.  That he was my cousin was inconsequential.  I loved him.  I was gay.

Turns out, he wasn't.   He began having issues with what we did at 15.  It stopped without notice...He no longer cared to visit, to even talk comic books or video games with me.  It was as if he didn't know me.

This was when the lectures began from my verbally abusive stepfather.  Fags this and queers that.  Things I didn't understand.  I had no exposure to what gay was until 15.  All I knew before that, was that I liked having a penis in me...especially my best friend's.  It was just another thing we shared; like we had shared everything else growing up.  

Anyway, I digress.  Along with the constant gay bashing from my step dad came the lectures at church.  I had never heard a sermon on the abomination of gays until 15.  I was scared shitless.  However, I couldn't get enough cock.  My sex drive was at the max.  I needed the release,  but hated myself with each and every act.  I resorted to blowing guys in locker rooms, at the city pool, where ever I could find it.  

Word began to travel that I was exceptionally talented at sex.   This didn't change how I felt..how I thought that the devil had poisoned me at such a young age, and that I couldn't change.  At 16 I begin driving and get an invitation from an older guy I had serviced to meet him at a truck stop.  This began my whoring.  Truckers would pay 20 to 50 per visit, depending on what they wanted.  I saw none of this money, of course, as I knew nothing until it was over.  I was a simple eager-to-please farm boy who liked a penis in me.  By this time I was well and truly depressed and suicidal.  I hated being an abomination in the eyes of God.  However, I was too chickenshit to take my own life.  I heard stories of how this queer or that queer was picked up and beaten to death.  I wanted this.  I thought that if I couldn't take my own life, then I'd at least put myself in a situation for someone else to.  I'd go on weekend runs with truckers hoping to not come back.  I knew nothing but wanting the pain inside to end.

I did this until the truck stop closed when I graduated high school.  At this point I'd had many dicks and a few hands in me.  I decided to see if I could actually live with being gay.  I got my first real boyfriend the summer after graduation.  He was 19, I was 18.  He was an army brat who was still living on his parents dime and had just returned from a year of school in France or some place.  It was  true love...for a whole month.  

I continued to build a chain of serial relationships over the next few years.  I was out to a few friends, but no one else.  I had actually began to enjoy life, even though I still hated being gay; being a disappointment to my family, even though they didn't know.  I dated a few really good guys...and it was the last one that I regret fucking up the most.

I was 20, he was 23.  Proper gentleman, never asked for sex.  We went on real dates and he showered me with attention and love.  I was in heaven again.  I had finally found my new best friend.  We dated for several months and had even planned our ""first time together"" for New Years Eve 2005.  Now, I had a friend at the time that was pregnant.  The babydaddy was an awful person so she had asked me to help her out...yaknow, doctors visits and what not.  Well, my family mistook these actions for us being together--they didn't believe the bullshit that we were just friends.   They knew I wasn't the dad, but didn't care.  They were excited that I may be a step in father.  Anyway, my goddaughter was born on 12/27/2005.  She was beautiful and I loved her very much.  

New Years Eve is here.  My fella and I are enjoying the night; having drinks, listening to music, kissing and what not. We are getting hot and heavy and all of a sudden, I had a panic attack.  I don't know why, I had been with more guys than I could remember, but something hit me. I KNEW that I couldn't be gay.  I had to be straight.  I had to live the life acceptable to my parents.  I left without speaking to him again...

Now, I know this was a horrible move.  Absolutely dick on my part and I accept all recriminations.  

I was straight.  Gay?  Fuck no, never.

I had one of my friends introduce me to one of hers.  A lady with the curse of the pink wand (her first husband was gay...)

We hit it off well because we had sitar interests.   Never mind that her vagina absolutely repulsed me.  Hey, beer was an acquired taste and I had learned to like it...pussy can't be that different.  And I'm straight, anyhow so it doesn't matter. *flexes muscles and scratches chest hair*

Well, she and I date for a year.  It's now the summer of 2007.  I have an internship in a city an hours drive away from home, she goes home (an hour in the opposite direction).  We begin to drift apart.  We both contemplate leaving each other.  I begin moving my stuff back to my old farm house (I had began staying with her at her apartment).  The summer ends, it's August and we are both gearing up for good bye...it's evident.  I wasn't happy being straight as i hated myself even more.  Anyway, I get drunk on my 22nd birthday (8/8) and pass out in bed.  Well, she has other plans and gets me going downstairs.  Now, we had always practiced safe sex but for this one time...I know cliché.  The next thing I remember, I'm sitting on the side of the tube, smoking a cigarette, with cum leaking out of my dick.  

Our plans continue...

Fast forward a few weeks...she's late.  She is pregnant. 

Well fuck.  Now I have to do the good thing.  I have to marry her.  I have to provide for this child.  It's not his fault his dad's stupid.  So, we stay together for the child.   He becomes my life and I still love him very much.  He was born in may of 2008 and mommy and I finally marry in October of that year.  We do all the typical stuff.

However, I'm miserable.  I can't help that I look at guys.  I stay true to her and never once do I step out.  The years go on and now it's the summer of 2011.  I've gained a lot of weight, am constantly depressed.  We are always fighting...she's not working, I'm working full time and in an MBA program AND being the housekeeper and full parent while she struggles part time going to college.   

I go to a FFDP concert that July and something clicks in one of their songs, I can't remember which.  I'm tired of being someone I'm not.  I'm tired of lieing to everyone, myself included.  I make the decision then...I have to get a divorce.

I go leave on 8/15/11.  I tell my family in the following months the truth.  

And guess what....the world didn't end.  I wasn't disowned.  My fears were for nothing.  

Now I'm with a guy that I love totally and completely.   This 8/8 will be 2 years.  




That's it...

If you're reading this and you're scared or worried please reach out.  At the very least, I'm here to listen...it may not help, but don't do what I did.

On that same line, if you know someone you think may be hurting inside, reach out to them, help them.  All they want is for someone to have a care for them.  This isn't restricted to gay youth...

Thank you for reading."

24hlsw,1,2014-05-01,Should I drop university? Please read my story.,[deleted],asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/24hlsw/should_i_drop_university_please_read_my_story/,"Currently I am a beta. I might have the mind of an alpha, but what does that matter?
I want to change desperately. So here is my story:

I am 20 and currently sutdying CS and starting my 4th semester.
But I fucked it up. I never really cared about getting good grades or paying attention.
I have really bad grades and I am probably 2 semester behind.
Yeah, I know I fucked it up hard.
However to be honest, I really don't like CS. It's pretty boring and feels pretty useless.
Also my profs and university sucks even though this doesn't concern me that much.

I knew right after my first semester that this is nothing for me. I should stop. I was about to drop out... almost did not write any exam at all.
But I don't know somehow my environment started attacking me: 
""No, what are you doing!"", ""When you drop out you will always stay poor"", ""You are a total looser if you drop out"", ""Just continue and everything will be fine"", ""You will earn $70.000 by the time you graduate""...
And all shit like that. I don't know why though but I continued.

But this thought never got out of me. I always somehow wanted to quit. But I was a pussy and just went with the flow.
Yet this thought is getting bigger from time to time. And I am getting more depressed. Sometimes I am just paralyzed by the situation.

So here is what I am thinking about doing:
Stop university right now. Just put an end to my hell finally.

And focus 100% on these things:
- fitness and get the most out of me
- create a business
- expand my skills in some languages where I already have a very good, above basic, knowledge
- create some social life (join some sport club)
- other things: waking up at 4, volunteer, try getting an internships
- improve my math skills especially getting better at mental calculation where I currently suck even though I am good at math
- plus some other things which I desperately want/have to learn

When I say create a business I am mainly talking about an internet based business.
Before university started when I was about 17-19 I generated about $1-2k/month through the internet.
I know how create an internet business. I know how the things work there.
Not that this is something special, it really isn't.., but I can (almost) build sites like facebook from the scratch.
I have already some genuine business ideas. But no, I am not talking about shit like ""I am going to be rich I will build facebook!!..""

After these 6 month I will either:

1) continue doing what I am doing for another 6 months depends how for example my business etc. goes
2) or join the military for one year
3) or start over with another subject which I will choose more carefully
4) or (most probably) everything from 1 to 3

If I don't have already something going for myself I will go to university.
There I will choose some major like mechanical engineering (because well STEM... and I am acutally interested in these kind of subjects).
This time I will kick some serious ass and spend my time at university very wisely. And I will try to choose a university which focuses more on the practical side.

By the time I graduate with a bachelor I will be about 24 to 26.
I probably won't have a lot of internships to list on my CV. But at least I will have a life and maybe some successful business, who knows?

If I continue my current path I will probably be about 24 to 25 and probably miserable. I will always convince myself why didn't I just try it?
My thoughts, my body where crying for me to stop. But I didn't listen.

It's really serious. I had suicidal thoughts from time to time. I am so stressed that I am losing some hairs even though I started meditating and doing sports etc.
By the way cold showers do help a lot against depression...

I tried to to the things which I listed above whilst continue with my study.
But I can't. Either I do this then I get frustrated why I didn't do that enough or I do that and I am depressed that I didn't do this enough.
I don't know but I can't do multiple things at once. I either do that 100% or this 100%. I just can't do both.

Guys, this is not just some post on the internet. This is about my life. I need some serious advice. Please honestly think about it."

It's time to swallow and not gargle.


I discovered TRP about a week ago and literally spent 6 hours reading top posts of it and the RPN, and have since been reading more every day. Its like the Matrix where I'm vomiting trying to deny it, but the evidence is infallible: we live in a feminist world where men are expected to be weak emotional pussies. In order to rip my dick from the gaping hole that is between my legs I must 


- get ripped 
- get confident 
- get social


A little about me: I grew up in ultra-Christian deep south, everyone who believes evolution is going to hell, yadda yadda. I lost my faith about 14 years old listening to hiphop and from there things progressed pretty quickly. Being rebellious to the Christian girls was like the most attractive quality you could have so I had a lot of flings and STR's til I met a unicorn when I was 16. For two long years she had me as her lapdog literally willing to do anything as long as she would fuck me nonstop. Of course she eventually got tired of me beta ways and dumped me for my best friend, who, coincidentally, now drives a Benz and lives in Hawaii with unlimited pussy access. Instead of realizing he, while flawed, was definitely taking life by the horns I inserted my tampon and became bitter, victimized etc. I tried to date fellow college girls before I graduated but I was so bitter against women in general and I couldn't figure out why so many of them were literally willing to fuck ANYTHING WITH A COCK. Instead of joining a frat and learning social skills, I spent my first three years of college with beta friends all putting pussy on pedestals. Then I got an internship so my final year was spent working, studying, and dealing with video game addiction (it was bad). All the while any girl that batted an eye I immediately would assume my place in the line of orbiters. Oh, did I mention I also managed to white-knight on multiple occasions? Everything you can do wrong I HAVE DONE.


Which brings me to this last two years. My internship turned into a full time position but I was overconfident and lazy and managed to get myself fired, rightly so. Then I got a job in sales because, like women, the first job that came my way I opened wide and took. Making all commission my finances dropped pretty quick, especiallysince the girl I was orbiting at the time offered my her sweet 20+ partner-having pussy in exchange for free rent and lap dog services. I gleefully accepted thinking about how having sex again would solve all my problems. Wrong. I got into severe credit card debt, got evicted, had to sleep in my fucking car some nights until I finally waved the white flag and moved into my parents house. This was one year ago. Since then, I have talked to zero women, have no friends, and can't even discipline myself enough to profit consistently at 10NL online poker, which is literally the only thing in life I feel like I could do if I could just get my head out of my ass and get motivated.


Enter the red pill. Holy shit omfg. I am a vacuum and the content is rushing into me and its so damn obvious and simple. The solution to all my problems: become a man. It has been building all week until tonight, when I finally throw down the gauntlet and resolve I WILL: 

- get my fat white whale ass in the gym 
- stop eating shit food (I'm looking at you, McDonald's) 
- Exercise every day, gym or not.  Take a walk, do some pushups, etc. 
- Post results consistently (once a month, maybe?)


See ya at the gym, guys."

Is it possible?,FkingLurker,consulting,https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/24hu24/advice_for_recent_graduate_seeking_a_consulting/,"I'm a recent grad from a good undergraduate business program (late top ten) and target school for many of the top firms, including MBB. Last summer I interned with a smaller consulting firm, and ended up getting a F/T offer. I had originally decided to take it, but am now feeling remorseful for not having done campus recruiting right and seeing what I could have gotten. 

I have a fairly strong resume: two successful academic (but real-client consulting projects) and a strong case competition, two non-consulting internships, speak four languages, have recommendations from two consulting professors, strong leadership positions in extracurriculars, minus a low GPA (3.3).

How hard would it be to apply come the fall as a graduate? I'm seeking for Deloitte or Accenture type entry-level analyst position... Should I wait for campus recruiting to come around or just start reaching out as soon as possible? I do have some good network connections but am afraid of the timing of all this...

What would your advice be?

Okay, so I'm not really a romantic person at all. I'm kinda sporty/tough. I've had guys ask me out on dates, but I usually turn them down (as nicely as I can) because I honestly don't want to date anyone?
I'm very ambitious and pretty booksmart. I want to major in MIS/have a good summer internship at a big tech firm set up which is rare for a freshman. This is usually it's a turn off to most dudes for one reason or another. (overshadowing? don't like smart girls? who knows, I'm not going to put words in anyone's mouth)

I'm super witty. Which sounds pretentious, but for my own sake just trust me on this that I am wittier than the average bear. Read: humor is important to me and is a large part of my personality.

So I met this dude --tall super lanky, kinda dorky guy with black hair and a scruffy beard, dressed... passable for a white dude (jeans, not terrible tennis shoes. neutral colored shirts)-- on the first day of spring classes. 

We were one of a handfull of kids who showed up to the first lab, which no one was sure if it was canceled or not, which is common for the first week of school at my college. We sat next to each other and small talked while we waited for 10 minutes before leaving. 

I thought he was cute but I'm *very* cautious because most of the boys I like are the ones I don't know well enough.

from then on we've sat next to each other every lab session and I learned he's an engineer student. And he didn't seem intimidated at all by my major which was refreshing.

so naturally I facebook stalked the hell out of him so I could find ways to dislike him to get this unproductive dumb crush out of my system.

my findings:

-his posts are sometimes kinda dumb. let's just say he likes Mountain Dew.

-he eats really shitty shit. So many pictures of gummy candies. I mean he's thin, but I don't know if I can handle the unhealthyness of not exercising (he mentioned to me that in 2 years he's never used the school's gym because he's too buisy (??)) and the unhealthy food. I'm not up for changing people.

-I dig geeky guys, but his friends look totally weird and embarrassing. I don't know my threshold of nerdyness. I secretly read comic books and am the geekiest of my friends, but this might be more than I can do comfortably.

-these posts did range back to 2009, so maybe development has been made??

honestly not terrible results. Also what??? he's from my home town???

He compliments me on things other than my appearance, like my skill with maths, my art that I brought in one day (I needed it for the class after) and we share interest in photography, but I have to say he's more into it than I am. One red flag for me personally was that he said he's spent more money on a single camera lens than he has on his car. But I don't know exactly how passionate he is about it, so it's unfair for me to use that to judge him impulsive-money-spending-smartness-wise. He likes hiking like me too.

Just two weeks ago he started seeking me out in our big lecture class to sit next to, and we talk about stuff. 

The thing is, while in labs I spend most of the time helping him code, (I'm definitely better at it than he is, but I don't mind helping. I'm a prospective MIS major after all)

but in lecture we have more time before/after class to just talk. And god, guys --he's not funny. He gives good attempts, but I don't know if he just doesn't have the skill or if he's nervous (he talks very quietly all the time too), but having a good sense of humor would have been the selling point in this situation. but it just isn't there (so far as i can tell)!

But, he's so genuinely nice. And I'm so genuinely unexperienced in this type of thing and don't know what to do. 
And I hate thinking about his stupid cute face all the time!!"

24idix,1,2014-05-01,"So you brought 500 Win 7 machines, and downgraded them to XP?",[deleted],talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/24idix/so_you_brought_500_win_7_machines_and_downgraded/,"Recently, I have gotten an internship at my schools IT department. There is 4 full time IT guys there, and myself being an after school intern. I have no idea what ""skill level"" these ITs are at, because I haven't troubleshooted any issues yet. But from this tale, I don't think of them too highly. 


The main reason I was brought on was to help with the new computer rollout. These Core i5 machines were going to replace aging pentium 4's. Now we setup all the computers in their labs, 500 desktops across 20 labs and 3 schools. Now, the senior IT hands me a hard drive and says here image all of these computers. 


At first, it seems like a standard imaging process. So I start imaging hard drives and notice that Windows XP pops out.. funny these say Windows 7 on the stickers. Thinking he somehow gave me the wrong hard drive, I go back to him and tell him. I'm still face palming over this conversation...
     Nyy8: Hey Boss, I think you might have given me the wrong hard drive? This image is of Windows XP. 
     Senior IT: That's the right image alright.
     Nyy8: So... when are we upgrading to Windows 7? 
     Senior IT: But nothing is wrong with XP? 
     Nyy8: (At this point, I was confused and face palming) Yeah, your right! How could I be so silly. 


In the end, every machine got installed with Windows XP Pro and 6 months later they still are running XP. With no plans to upgrade them...

TL;DR: Boss wants every hard drive wiped of Windows 7 to load Windows XP onto. "

I am a Junior student with 3.67/4.00 GPA from Turkey. Biggest problem is I am the laziest and least competitive person I've ever known. I always hated school, homework etc. Somehow, I managed my way through them and got accepted to the best university in my country with full scholarship.

I chose CS major because it is only thing I can slightly enjoy. I'm good with computers since I was 5-6 years old, started by playing games at my dad's shop computer by writing their names to the Dos screen without even knowing how to read/write. I simply loved them and decided to work with them as I grow up. However, I never been a geek, and started to learn programming only when I was almost 18(I am 22). I chose to learn C++ because I wanted to pursue a career at game development and thought learning C++ would be more realistic.

Due to my limited knowledge of C++, I never had any trouble in college. First two programming courses, I didn't do anything related to school and got the highest grades of my program. For all other courses, I barely attended the lectures, only, stayed up all night before the exams studying and got really great grades.

Last summer I did an internship in Netherlands, at a University. I learnt Django and JavaScript, but I can say my 3 months internship consisted 2 months of smoking pot and drinking.

My biggest project and the first step of start realizing my dreams was a game project I did with my roommate for the opengl course. At first I was really hyped, but after figure out and coded the basic network/gameplay mechanics, I was done, I lost my interest, hated opengl, game development and my roommate who kept adding the futures no one really cares, like the game was the most important thing in his life.

I realized, I only care about 'how it's made'. I'm curious about how something is achieved, learn about it, try it out a little and it's gone for me.

Right now, I am desperately looking for an internship because its compulsory, that roommate(who has much lower gpa then me and same side experience) got accepted from the only place I'd like to work in Turkey. I still don't know if they'd accept me as well but this situation is eating me out slowly. Please don't get me wrong, this is not about him but he is the only example in front of me. I got rejected from couple of companies around Europe due to my scope and or enthusiasm.

Currently I live in a Europe country as an exchange student and still doing great at school here as well. However, my days are only about go out drinking or sit in my room in depression spending 8-9 hours in front of the computer literally doing nothing, can't even enjoy a movie. Because I know I have to do something for improving and feel guilty.

I don't like this situation, everybody is keep telling me that I am 'wasting my potential'. I know I can do much better, but the thing is, what if I don't want to? That's the question I'm most afraid to answer, because I have no other option.

Thank you for reading.

There were a lot of things that piled up and began to weigh on me, including someone I know dying as well as my girlfriend cheating on me and flippantly disregarding our entire relationship. After that there were a few financial troubles, and amongst it all I learned who cared about me and who didn't.

For 491 days I woke up every morning with suicide in the back of my mind. Life went on. I shuffled forward. First was anger, then sadness. I broke things, then I spent a while crying most mornings. After that wore off, I just spent each day existing. 

I changed my number, then later my address. I deleted all traces of myself from the internet. I stopped doing well in school. I went through a few different jobs, a few of which I got fired from for being too argumentative and hostile. 

I began drinking more and spending days not talking to anyone. I ceased to think about life in terms of what was possible for me. Meeting new people, having new experiences, reaching new insights, that was no longer going to happen ever again. Once my emotions wore off there was this unbearable sort of weariness that set in, and though I knew that rationally my situation wasn't too dismal, I was no longer capable of thinking clearly. 

On April 17 at approximately 5:04 PM that changed, and a switch in my brain flipped on. I was driving down the road listening to some inconsequential song, having my inconsequential day, and I began feeling a dawning sort of awareness set in. If I wasn't an atheist, I would call it divine intervention. A voice, my own but also foreign to myself, chimed in. I thought to myself, ""Well, that's it. I was that person, and now I'm another person. It's over."" 

There was no event that sparked it. I'd spent the last month or so drunk out of my mind most nights. I often laid in my bed drinking beer until I fell asleep. Over the last two months I had drunkenly tried to connect with some girls I knew, only to be rejected by each and every one of them. This wasn't a new low, it was just another few months of my life. I'd suffered worse rejections over the past year or so, most of my attempts to connect with others made more in desperation and weakness. Because for 491 days, I felt I didn't have the personal strength to keep getting through my days alone. 

The girls smelled the desperation on me, too. Pathetic has a stench. 

I spent days drinking and walking around my apartment with the lights off. I lost friends due to petty arguments. Every little thing was cause for argument when it came to me. I'd bicker over anything and not budge an inch. My mind was fogged and cluttered with senselessness. Overloaded with banality. 

Now, on April 17 it began changing. This wasn't some unexpected cheerful song on a radio. Some unoriginal quote on a social media site. It wasn't some catharsis, and I wasn't magically happy. It was a slow wind-up, first one piston and then another, slowly at first and then rhythmically speeding up in unison and working on all of my cylinders. It wasn't happiness, it was a robotic detachment and icy sense of clarity. Emotions have no place in discipline. Leave that to the warm and fuzzy types who need their iPods tuned to the happy station so they can get their work done. This wasn't that. This was logic. 

Since then I've moved back into my head and seen what a mess the previous tenant has left behind. My body I'm viewing as some run down contraption, its parts long ago worn out. My joints pop and ache.

Little things here and there: on December 12 of 2012 I could grip a bar and do ten dead-hang pull-ups. Now, not one. I could run three miles easy. Now I had a stitch in my side after ten minutes at a brisk pace. 

I dusted off my keyboard. Rusty, can't remember a single thing on the piano. That will have to change. 

It's been two weeks since I've drank. After the switch flipped on, the desire left me. We'll see if I need to quit outright or if I'm fine with drinking every now and then. I'll have to observe myself. Right now I'm still on my training wheels. I'm currently working towards a paid internship and waking myself back up to the idea of a stable career after I graduate college. 

Arguments and conflicts, they're necessary, but they're not everywhere. Some battles are worth fighting and others aren't. I can keep silent on some issues, or stay neutral if the issue isn't important enough to spend energy on. 

It's still an uphill climb. A lot of people have moved on and forgot about me. Many of them have lost respect and affection for me, and I don't have anyone serving as my cheerleaders. But I've procured a sense of detachment I used to cherish in myself. And what's more is I feel as if I'm rebuilding myself into a better version than I was before. As if this rejuvenated mind is something that can withstand more beatings than I could before the 491 days. 

For the first time in over a year, being alone and sober doesn't feel too painful to bear. My mind feels sharp again. 

The best I can sum it up is probably this. There are other ways to struggle. Ways that are no less easy, but much more productive. 

Just thought I'd share. "
24ivxs,1,2014-05-02,I have never been this depressed in my life and the reality of it just has me demotivated. Just want to get it off my chest. Thanks,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/24ivxs/i_have_never_been_this_depressed_in_my_life_and/,"I know this is going to sound petty and a lot of people are going to tell me ""it's really not that bad, some people have it much worse!"" I really can't help feeling this way.

To preface, I've always been a doer in life. I've always been ahead of the curve to a degree, not by too much, but definitely enough to make me personally comfortable with what I was doing with life. 

But mostly, I've always wanted to have ""purpose"" in life. A reason to wake up in the morning. Running a business where my effort rewarded me, and I was building my dream, not someone else's. When I woke up and got to the office, it would be a new day filled with challenges and rewards. Where there was always change and big things going on.

But unfortunately that's not  happening, nor do I see that capacity in sight. I'm 27 years old and I make 15 dollars an hour. I hate my job. I fucking loath it. Sure, it's a fun company with good people and is actually a great company as a whole, but how my role makes me feel just kills me. I went to school for a dumb degree in retrospect, a liberal art. So right of out of college I had to take whatever job I could get in a terrible economy. It was a sales gig, and at the time I had to take it because I had no experience.

Now fast forward several years later and I""m still in sales. I fucking hate sales. The only reason I still do it is because it's the only experience I've been able to get, and I naturally excel in it so people think it's a good fit. It's not. It's redundant and obnoxious. I want a job that has growth. I want something that makes me a critical asset to a company. Something when someone asks what I can offer their company, it's more than just fucking selling shit for them. 

But that's my fucking path. I go to work everyday doing the same exact shit, while my bosses are always trying to push everyone non stop to keep performing more and more. I just make fucking calls, talk to people, convince them, and do it again. What's supposed to be the motivation? In a year I'll be a sales manager if I'm good enough? Yeah... Now I go from 15 an hour to 22! Now I get to do the same level of monetany, but now it's me motivating people every single day for the next several years until I can hopefully... Just hopefully, get another promotion where I can make 55k a year. 

I'm still going to be stuck in lower middle income. I wont have the disposable income for a while to actually afford having a large enough cushion to try something else and break me out of this cycle. And the truth is it MUST be my own venture. Again, companies aren't going to hire someone beyond entry level that just has sales experience.

And you know what really rubs it in? I have friends who I used to work with who are now making 6 figures at my age. Some who was just really incompetent (I'm not trying to be mean, just real) but lucked out via his dad and got some operations internship, which fast tracked them to middle management. Now when they decide to go to another company, and the company asks, ""What can you offer us?"" They have a huge list of experience that they can offer the company. And it's not just those in the corporate world. Just today my buddy was talking to me about how exiting it was starting his own venture with his co-founders. How exiting the whole process is of raising capital, travelling all over South America, meeting really smart people, getting great insights, and actually starting his company...

And again, here I fucking am. Stuck in this shitty fucking cycle. I feel like I've so severally failed to live up to my potential I just don't know what to do. I look around and see my friends having exiting lives, while I am forced to admit that I am likely going to have an unfilled life of mediocrity. It's just not what I envisioned for myself. It's not the life I want.

I don't care if anyone reads this, typing it out -- albeit terribly -- was enough. "
24iz39,9,2014-05-02,Reddit AMA vom 1.Mai - Zusammenfassung Übersetzung (german translation),Lumartist,elderscrollsonline,https://www.reddit.com/r/elderscrollsonline/comments/24iz39/reddit_ama_vom_1mai_zusammenfassung_übersetzung/,"Hallo zusammen,

am gestrigen Tag fand ein weiteres [Reddit AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/elderscrollsonline/comments/24h8dv/welcome_to_the_zos_aua/) mit verschiedenen Entwicklern statt, bei welchem sie diverse Fragen der Spielerschaft beantwortet haben. Der Nutzer [Dulfy](http://www.reddit.com/user/dulfy) hat daraus ein [Transcript](http://www.reddit.com/r/elderscrollsonline/comments/24hrc8/may_1_reddit_ama_qa_transcriptsummary/), bzw. eine Zusammenfassung erstellt. Auf dieser basiert die folgende deutsche Übersetzung:

**Neue Inhalte / Features**

- Es wird alle 4-6 Wochen ein Update geben, mit wöchentlichen Patches dazwischen um die aktuellen Probleme zu beheben und das Angebot zu stabilisieren.
- Diese Updates werden nicht alle die Größe von Kargstein (mit einer kompletten Zone und einer Menge anderen Zeugs) haben, aber sie werden jeweils eine Mischung aus neue Inhalten und Lösungen von Problemen, als auch Anpassungen enthalten.
- Erfolge (Achievements) werden neue Farben freischalten, wenn das Färbesystem eingeführt wird.
- Sprechblasen für den Chat werden schon bald vorgestellt.
- Die Suchfunktion für den Gildenladen kann aktuell umständlich sein, aber es gibt Pläne diese zu verbessern.
- Verkaufsstände für Gilden werden in großen Städten verfügbar sein, wobei sie von einem NPC betrieben werden. Gilden werden danach für einen Verkaufsstand bieten können, und das höchste Gebot wird dann den Zuschlag erhalten. Danach wird jeder Spieler auf den Gildenladen zugreifen können. Verkaufsstände gelten jeweils für eine Woche.
- Es wird mehr Gildenränge und Anpassungen noch in diesem Jahr geben.
- Das Rechtssystem wird Spieler betreffen, welche von NPCs stehlen, oder diese gar töten, wobei ein Kopfgeld auf den Spieler ausgesetzt wird. Wachen werden dem Spieler die Chance geben ihre Strafe zu zahlen, oder diese bei Sichtkontakt angreifen und töten, wenn das Kopfgeld zu hoch ist. Spieler können zusätzlich selbst Wachen werden.
- Die Diebesgilde und Dunkle Bruderschaft werden jeweils eigene Fertigkeitslinien haben.
- Aktuell gibt es keine Pläne für Inhalte unter Wasser.
- Zauberweben – Man kann die traditionelle Art der Elder Scrolls Magie entdecken – Anpassung, Zerstörung, usw.
- Das Guar-Reittier wird es geben, aber es gibt hierfür keinen Zeitplan.
- Weitere Infos zu den Konsolenversionen wird es in Zukunft geben.
- Housing ist durchaus angedacht, aber es soll richtig umgesetzt werden, weswegen es hierfür keinen Zeitplan gibt.
- Aktuell gibt es keinen Termin für die Gilden-Wappenröcke, aber sie kommen eher früher als später.

**Quests / Endgame**

- Die Erfolge für Quests werden mit Kargstein behoben, und sie werden Spielern rückwirkend verliehen.
- Es gibt Pläne bestehenden Zonen neue Quests hinzuzufügen.
- Die Idee alle Zonen auf VR10 anzuheben, sobald man VR10 erreicht hat ist eine interessante Idee, und wird aktuell geprüft.
- Bezüglich der Veteranen-Inhalte, dachten die Entwickler, dass es Spielern besser gefällt alle Inhalte mit einem Charakter erleben zu können, anstatt Twinks zu starten.
- Kargstein kann durchaus mit VR1 betreten werden, was aber sehr hart wird, da die Gegner VR11 und VR12 sein werden.
- Bezüglich der Updates werden diese für unterschiedliche Arten von Inhalten sein.
- Es gibt Gedankenspiele bezüglich verschiedener Regeln für bestimmte Kampagnen im PvP, als auch für einen Dungeon mit PvP-Anteil.
- Aktuell gibt es für das Anheben der VR-Stufe auf 11 und 12 neue Ausrüstung, welche hergestellt werden kann, welche aber keine zusätzlichen Skillpunkte benötigen.

**Verschiedenes**

- Es wird Änderungen bei den schweren Rüstungen geben, welche es erlauben ultimative Fertigkeiten schneller aufzuladen, wenn der Spieler defensiv spielt.
- Aktuell geht man davon aus, dass der Werwolf nicht die volle Leistung bringt. Daher wird es in Zukunft ein paar Anpassungen geben. Zeitnah werden hierzu die ultimativen Kosten für das Aktivieren der Transformation gesenkt.
- Aktuell gibt es keine Pläne die Zeit zwischen den Stufen der Vampire zu erhöhen.
- Der Fledermausschwarm für Vampire wird in der nahen Zukunft angepasst.
- Die Standarte der Macht des Drachenritters wird eventuell angepasst (nerf). Dafür gibt es keinen Termin.
- Für Patch 1.2 soll die Vielseitigkeit der Builds vorangetrieben werden, weswegen Fertigkeiten, die wenig genutzt werden entsprechend angepasst werden. Für Nachtklingen umfasst das z.B. Assassinenmacht, Pfad der Dunkelheit, oder Todesstoss, und einige mehr.
- Der Rassenstil soll bei Rüstungen mit in den Tooltip.
- Das Phasing von Gruppen ist aktuell eine der Top-Prioritäten.
- Neue Inhalte sollen als Gruppe deutlich leichter zu meistern sein.
- Eine Phase nur für Rollenspieler ist aktuell wegen der Serverleistung nicht umsetzbar, aber es wird geprüft das Ziel anders umzusetzen.
- Die Beschädigung von Ausrüstung ist aktuell in Gruppen ein wenig höher als geplant, z.B. in Dungeons, der neuen Kargstein-Zone, und den Prüfungen. Mit Patch 1.1, wird man merklich weniger Beschädigung erfahren.
- Für neue Inhalte und das Beheben von Bugs sind unterschiedliche Teams verantwortlich.
- SLI-Support sollte mit Kargstein verfügbar sein.
- Die Vollbild-Ansicht sollte ebenfalls mit Kargstein kommen.
- Sobald das Problem der Gold-Farmer behoben wurde, und die Stabilität des Servers gewährleistet ist, wird der europäische Server nach Europa transferiert. Es gibt hierzu keinen unmittelbaren Termin, aber es findet statt, wenn sich die Dinge normalisieren.
- Aktuell gibt es keine Pläne die gewonnene Erfahrung im PvE anzuheben, allerdings wird jene für das PvP geprüft.
- Für das offizielle Forum wird eine allgemeine Kategorie für Diskussionen geprüft, und es wird intern darüber diskutiert.
- Für das offizielle Forum wird zudem eine Funktion zum Ignorieren geprüft, wobei diese so schnell wie möglich verfügbar sein soll.

**PvP**

- Bessere Markierungen für Anführer im PvP sollen mit Patch 1.2 kommen.
- Das Vampir-Problem im PvP ist bekannt und es wird bereits nächste Woche Anpassungen geben:
- Ein Fehler wird behoben, bei dem mehrere Fledermausschwärme auf einem Vampir gestapelt werden konnten.
- Die Bewegungsgeschwindigkeit innerhalb der Nebelform wurde auf 30% gesenkt.
- Die Kosten für Vampirfertigkeiten je nach Vampirstufe wurden auf 7% reduziert.
- Die Geschwindigkeit innerhalb der Kampagnen ist in einigen dieser wie erwartet, und in anderen nicht. Das Problem der Bevölkerung ist bekannt und es wird in Zukunft Anpassungen geben. Das gesagt, Festungen werden eine Anhebung der Schwierigkeit erhalten, was die Rate der individuellen Eroberungen senken kann.
- In den Staaten nutzen viele Spieler die Möglichkeit der Gastkampagnen, um so an den gut bevölkerten Kampagnen teilzuhaben. In der EU im Gegenzug bleiben die Spieler meist ihrer Heimatkampagne treu. Die Zeit und Kosten um eine Kampagne zu wechseln wird täglich geprüft, um zu verhindern, dass sich diese negativ auf das Spielverhalten von Spielern auswirken.
- Im ersten Patch werden wir die Erfahrung verdoppeln, welche Spieler wert sind. Das wird genau beobachtet und es wird geprüft ob eine weitere Anpassung notwendig ist.
- Die Veteranenpunkte für Aufgaben in Cyrodiil könnten ebenfalls erhöht werden.
- Im ersten Patch wird es einen Bonus für Fraktionen mit geringer Bevölkerung geben, welcher der Fraktion mit der geringsten Bevölkerung in der Kampagne das dreifache an Punkten für besetzte Einrichtungen und Festungen gewährt, und 10 Prozent mehr Allianzpunkte. Es werden außerdem verschiedene Laufzeiten für Kampagnen geprüft, und auch Regeln die den Zugang zu Kampagnen je nach Stufe beschränken.
- Dunkle Krallen (Drachenritter) ist aktuell verbuggt und kann mehr Ziele treffen als angedacht.
- Die Elder Scrolls werden zudem so angepasst, dass Funkenschlag (Magier) durch den Träger nicht verwendet werden kann um zu entkommen.
- Aktuell gibt es keine Pläne für neue Belagerungswaffen oder neue Munitionstypen.
- Keine Pläne für Modi mit weniger Spielern im PvP, Duelle, oder Schlachtfelder. Der Fokus gilt klar Cyrodiil.
- Unendliche Ladebildschirme und das Einfrieren/Ruckeln in großen Gruppen wird geprüft."
24izmn,1,2014-05-02,Can't seem to turn off my brain and just do... Constantly worrying,tatahtoh,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/24izmn/cant_seem_to_turn_off_my_brain_and_just_do/,"Hate my current position, not have any disease, ongoing trouble or something tearing me down.

I just can't seem to get through it all. I'm not depressed or suicidal, I just don't see the point. I had a great time going out last night with some friends. Today there was some bs amongst 2 of my friends over a girl. I was temporarily amused and now I am annoyed by the entire situation.

University is easy, whatever clicks with me is easy, whatever doesn't is a hell. Aced all but one class so far, but now I have to get an internship. No clue what to do, can't postpone and deadline is coming up.

Have work, hate work, tried to set up my own stuff (quite competent just incredibly shit at pushing myself some days / weeks it goes well for a while but then suddenly everything just drops and I don't seem to be able to finish it or only if there are other people involved who I can not let down).

I can not seem to focus to make certain things happen. Just ever since I turned 18 throughout my early 20's (23 now). Its just utter shit.
But I don't know why, nothing big changed, no structural changes, no big leap in emotional state. I just gradually failed at everything I value. Which leads me to believe that my live isn't worth living because I don't enjoy it more than the hassle I go through to hopefully receive some joy in return. 

It is so much more effort to keep up and keep myself satisfied that I wonder what the point is. Everyone (including me) hop from one goal to another. I can't even seem to complete any I just hop on and get by with the minimal result but it is already so much fucking effort for me to pull that off because I feel like I have to juggle so many things at once. 

When even when I try to rationally look at my situation, I should have nothing to complain about. I pay all my bills, I 'm getting through uni with a good degree. But I guess that isnt enough for me (in my head, chemically or neurologically).

Socially a bit awkward, not that I mind. I do fine on my own ( I do have friends but I meant that I don't mind sit at home watch a series instead of going out.) But I do miss being intimate with someone.

Some days I just want it all to end, or for it all to pause... For me to get some space... Everything seems to work out, but I dont sleep any better, I don't feel any calmer nor any more content.

I do not know where to go from here, I just felt the need to vent and hopefully someone can help me out with some advice.

edit:

Reason I might be so upset or worried is because I tend to think about every aspect a lot. (Different perspectives, different choices, different outcomes and how to respond to all of this.) This means I spend a lot of time overthinking situations that may never occur but could still worry me. It also means that regardless of how much it involves me, I am investing myself into an issue whether I benefit by solving it or not.
I've grown to not care about small stuff and problems that don't involve me but still I seem to worry a lot

**TL;DR**

- No disease, sickness or anything that should make me feel so fucked up

- Friends fight over a girl, funny at first. 3 hours in Kind of annoying. (Girl is insecure, has some issues. Likes one of em alot but they re friends and now the other gave her some attention too and now he is attractive in a 'we could hook up because ur cute and I like the attention kind of way'). **short tl dr of a tldr: I hate social interaction issues because there is no logical solution where all parties are satisfied with the outcome**

- Myself not that social, don't go out too often. Have fun when I do.

- Nothing satisfies me, constantly looking for ways to feel more content.

- Problems (uni, socially, job, anything) keep stacking up and I take a lot of time analyzing and solving them. Driving myself mad over every possibility, factor or person involved

- Take on a lot of stuff as my responsibility

- Bullshit deadlines, no space to do my own stuff and when I finally make some I fail to capitalize on it and rather 'enjoy' the spare time by doing pointless stuff or worrying about why I am not doing something useful (or solve one of the many problems).

- Not been intimate with anyone for couple of years now."
24j023,4,2014-05-02,Here I am...,[deleted],loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/24j023/here_i_am/,"Hello friends (or soon to be friends).

I am starting my weight loss journey again! Let me tell you a bit about my journey thus far -

I have always been the ""chubby kid"" growing up. My siblings seemed to be able to eat whatever they wanted without gaining and there I was putting on five pounds if I had an off day. I had major depression about my weight growing up and I always used it as a mechanism to make fun of myself - better to make fun of myself first before anyone else had the opportunity, right? Wrong. When I was 16 I got my first job at a Jamba Juice where I had unlimited access to some of the sugariest smoothies available. It didn't take long for my weight to skyrocket. By the time I was 21 I hit 295 pounds and had enough, so I signed up for a gym and decided it was time for a change. I saw results instantly, five pounds here, five pounds there - before I knew it I was down forty pounds and counting! I started training harder, faster, I was finally turning into the person I wanted to be. I would hike/run 8 miles a day, sometimes twice, thus my caloric intake had to be higher. I couldn't help but boost the intake once I started running up mountains on a daily basis! Things started slowing down. Two pounds here, one pound there, but I was still losing. Last year I left for school at 245 pounds, down 50 pounds from where I started. I was comfortable in my skin, not where I wanted to be physically, but happy enough to not constantly be checking myself in the mirror, or be afraid to take a photo and worry about someone putting it on the internet for everyone to criticize. I was happy. I left for college and the freshman 15 (or in my case Junior fifteen) hit, except I lose fifteen pounds instead of gaining. It was great! I lived on campus and regularly hit the gym, my roommate was an avid racquetball player so we constantly kept each other on track. I hit 225lbs before this last winter, in total losing 70lbs to date. Winter came, I put on the usual 5 pounds I do during the holiday (I'm a sucker for Christmas cookies, what can I say?) and was ready to work it off once school started again. However with an internship lined up, a full time job, and school - I didn't work it off. It stayed with me, but I wasn't gaining because my diet had been pretty solid.

About two months ago while I was hiking I took a fall and fractured my tibia as well as sprained my knee. I haven't been able to do any physical exercise for two months and my diet has gone south. I have put on 10 more pounds bringing my weight back to 240lbs. I am disgusted with myself again and I feel like that kid who hid behind giant sweaters because he didn't want anyone to see what was hiding underneath.

Today I stumbled upon this lovely subreddit to find a community of people who want to help each other. I graduate from university in two weeks and I don't want to feel like I do today. I want to be proud of my accomplishment and feel good in my own skin again.

Some days my knee is totally fine, some days it irritates, and some days it is excruciating. I want to start exercising again but I am afraid of hurting my knee even more. 

Tomorrow is a new day and the beginning of the continuation of my weight loss journey. It is now or never, and I am not going to be the person hiding behind everyone in photographs to cover myself up any longer.

Thank you for reading this and I can't wait to start learning about you all individually. "
24j1hz,1,2014-05-02,I and the rest of our friends fucking hate who you've become,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/24j1hz/i_and_the_rest_of_our_friends_fucking_hate_who/,"What the fuck happened to you, man?
  
We used to be so close. We used to hang out all the time, talking about girls we liked, sports, our favorite bands and TV shows, smoking weed, anything and everything was on the table until you started dating her. After that, you became somebody I don't even recognize; somebody who has swallowed up my good-natured, happy, fun and social friend and turned him into an angry, dull, and bitter recluse who only interacts with his girlfriend and who only emerges from her room and interact with the rest of our friends and me on the rare occasion you decide to play 2K14.

Don't think that I don't understand the reasons behind your withdrawal from our social circle. It's not like I'm here to cast aspersions upon your affection for your girlfriend (which is obviously very real) or your decision to stop smoking weed with our friends and me (I probably need to cut down a bit myself).  

I've had girlfriends before too, dude. I sympathize with and fully understand your desire to spend quality time alone with the girl you love, but the thing you just can't seem to grasp is that a significant other is supposed to *enhance* your enjoyment of life, not manipulate you into avoiding your friends altogether and cause you to cease most of what used to be your favorite activities. You have allowed her to manipulate and mold your personality into a bitter shell of your former self who cringes at the idea of having independent thoughts so that she'll like you.

Although that stuff irks me, what really makes me genuinely scared for you is the fact that you seem to be completely ignoring the obvious fact that she has been manipulating your behavior. The last time you hung out independently with me and the rest of our friends who smoke, you didn't partake because your girlfriend didn't want you to. That's fine, I can understand that. What I can't understand is that *even while knowing you weren't partaking*, she refused to hold a conversation with you until you left the area we were in and avoided us altogether for the rest of the night. 

That is *by far* not the only thing that concerns me. The rest of my friends that are in serious relationships haven't completely changed their personalities as a result of their significant others. You seem to be the only one showing genuine affection in this relationship and it is incredibly unhealthy. If I have to watch you try to kiss or embrace her in public only to have her turn away and ignore you one more time, I may snap. If I have to hear one more time about how you'd willingly give up the high paying internship you had last summer in a hospital by your house to flip burgers at a fast food joint in the city where your girlfriend (OF SIX MONTHS) lives just so you could be close to her, I'm going to scream. If I have to hear you repeatedly ask ""What's the matter, babe? You sad?"" only to have her respond with ""Nothing. No."" one more goddamn time, I'm going to have a psychotic break.

Back when you were my friend and hadn't grown distant and cold, you told me that you hated the fact that one of our other close friends had been spending all his time with his girlfriend and completely forgotten about the rest of us, and you talked to him on multiple occasions about why you were upset. In a similar fashion, after you started dating her, you avoided the rest of us altogether. After the fifth time you told me at the last minute that you were actually going to hang out with your girlfriend after we'd specifically made plans to hang out that night, I told you that I was upset due to your fairly obvious ditching habits. You told me: ""I'm sorry, I just care about her feelings....and stuff"" and that you'd make amends and hang out with me and the rest of our friends soon, but you never did. You only grew more distant with time, and the two times I brought up the subject afterwards, you responded less and less to my concerns until your responses weren't even verbal. You'd just clam up, ignore what I'd said and walk away. The worst part is that I know this isn't just me receiving this treatment: some of our other friends have talked to you about the exact same thing (the fact that you don't hang out with us anymore) only to have it result in the same aloof treatment and your further withdrawal from a healthy social life into your girlfriend's room, never to emerge again. On the rare occasions that we do see you playing 2K14 or relaxing in the common room with her, you're distant, angry, and highly critical of everything we do and say. You just seem to sit there seething until you've had enough and proceed to retire back to her room.

Over these past few months you have readily proven to all of us that she is not only the most important person in your life, she is the *only* important person in your life. You have chosen her over your relationships with your friends. You have chosen her over your favorite activities. You have chosen her companionship over being happy. I miss the friend that I used to know and I fear above all else that he may be gone forever."
24j1l8,7,2014-05-02,next Stretch Goal; “THE WRITER COMETH” has been announced,Merketh,CamelotUnchained,https://www.reddit.com/r/CamelotUnchained/comments/24j1l8/next_stretch_goal_the_writer_cometh_has_been/,"http://camelotunchained.com/en/builders-tiers/



The Writer Cometh

Wow, two stretch goals knocked down pretty quick! As mentioned in my latest Foundational Principle (#15, here), know that I am going to be very careful with our stretch goals. Upcoming goals cannot unduly burden the CSE team, or betray the trust shown to us by our Backers.

Over the last year, I’ve written a lot of stories and lore for this world. However, because I need to focus on the game design and business side of things, my ability to keep that momentum will decrease. We need to add a full-time writer to our team.

We have fantastically exciting lore, and the writer will create even more epic stories and flavor as our universe of tales expands. He will focus on editing my stories, creating his own stories, and will become the Keeper of The Lore for this game.

We are fortunate that over the last two months we have had a published novelist intern for us: Max Porter. He’s been a great fit, and I would like to hire him full-time. This stretch goal will pay for his work for us and open up very cool things in the future.

As a bonus, if we are able to put together a novel based on the Becoming™ tales, all our current Backers will receive a free PDF of the book!

So, to sum it up, “Do it for the lore!”"
24jhwb,4,2014-05-02,What's the best way to prepare myself for graduating college?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/24jhwb/whats_the_best_way_to_prepare_myself_for/,"I am currently an undergrad studying computer science at a university (4-6 quarters left), and am wondering what some steps are that I should take to give myself the best opportunity to get a decent/good job out of college.

Some things I have done already: Have a published extended abstract (hopefully will make it into a full paper) Started a club with over 500 members Am a paid research assistant for an ICSCI project Have been doing as many projects in my spare time as possible (game making, random development, etc)

I still have a big bulk of classes to take, parallel computing, unix development, database systems, etc. so I still have a lot to learn.

I'm wondering how to get myself out there as much as possible for internships over the summer (I know the period for this summer has passed) but I just don't know where to get started, and where to apply to other than big companies where I have less of a chance.

How much of a difference does having internships make over not having any?

Please, let me know of anything that I can do to up my chances of being able to get a good/decent job after I graduate.

What kind of pages should I have? What should I have on those pages to have the best chances of getting noticed? I have a github and a linkedin but I don't think they are setup to give me the best results. Any pages/resources/etc. you can link me to would be very helpful.

24jqnc,14,2014-05-02,"Me [21F] with my boyfriend of ten months [20M], getting over jealousy after he sexted another girl",pleathernubbins,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/24jqnc/me_21f_with_my_boyfriend_of_ten_months_20m/,"About seven weeks ago I discovered that my LDR boyfriend had been sexting another girl for about a week and a half. He'd stopped by the time I found it, though he didn't tell her to stop--he just stopped responding. She'd sent him photos of her in lingerie, her bare boobs, close up of her ass, etc. He responded by telling her he'd always thought she was gorgeous, that he wouldn't even be able to control himself if she were there, her curves were amazing, etc etc. (And it sucks because I'm not an especially curvy girl.) This is a girl he'd known back home, which is clear across the country. He told me he'd never been interested in her romantically because she's generally very selfish and immature. 

For backstory, I met my boyfriend last summer when I was in the area for an internship. He's in the military and we hit it off and decided to continue the relationship after my internship ended. For the most part, our relationship has been wonderful. Anyway, after we'd known each other for about two weeks, he showed me pictures of his childhood home on his computer when some pictures popped up of her. Two were somewhat innocent, and one was her in her bikini or something like that. He was very flustered, and told me she'd sent that to a bunch of her friends. He still says that today, so I believe him. But he obviously saved it on his computer, because his phone doesn't automatically upload photos sent to him. But that was in the past--we didn't know each other then, and he'd forgotten they were there so probably wasn't using them with any frequency. A few months later we were talking and I asked if he still had the photos. He said he wasn't sure, so I asked him to look and then delete them. I think he did (but the fact that I asked him to delete the pictures and then later they sext and somehow he didn't think it was -that- bad. Now he does, obviously.)

After finding the sexts, I was heartbroken and almost broke up with him more than once. We've steadily been working past it, and honestly I've never seen anyone as hurt or as sorry as he is, which is why I feel like if anyone deserves a second chance, it's him. I don't think he honestly saw it as cheating. He knew it was wrong, but I guess having a screen between them made it seem more innocent. He's been saying now how much he sees how important it is to put me at the center of all his decisions and how much he wants me in his life. I really do believe he's deeply in love with me, as does everyone around us. I also don't believe he would have ever physically cheated on me, and especially not after this happened. I don't think it'll happen again--we communicate so much better now and have put a huge emphasis on it, especially as I try to get over this. We also realized how much we hadn't been communicating about sexting and pictures in our own relationship--this was something I'd always wanted, but never felt attractive enough to him (which is why it especially hurt seeing him respond to her that way).

He's said that she's not even that attractive and that it was literally a response of like, ""Oh, boobs. Oh, ass. Oh, female body. I like that."" But I'm having a hard time getting over the jealousy and feeling attractive I guess. Like, sometimes I think maybe he'd prefer a different body type over mine, or hers in particular. My insecurities have just increased tenfold, and I get angry sometimes thinking how she gets to leave with an ego boost and I'm left hating my body. I know it had nothing to do with me, but I still feel ugly. My boyfriend consistently tells me now that he's infinitely more attracted to me, and that there's no other girl he's more attracted to than me. Which makes sense to me, from an emotional standpoint--I prefer his body more than anybody else's, not because he's some god, but because it's his. But I keep thinking of her, and keep thinking that he's saying these things because he knows that's what I need to hear, etc. That maybe she is prettier or he does think that and it's just her less-than-stellar personality that makes him not pursue her. 

I guess I just need help getting over the jealousy. I want her out of my head. I want to be proud of my body (and honestly, I'm really not that unattractive. But because I'm not especially curvy I feel like I'm not his ideal and I can't seem to reconcile the fact that I'm not with the fact that he can still desire me sexually or even just romantically).

I guess..just..any advice? I'm not really sure where to go from here. Every time I do get a sincere compliment from him and feel somewhat proud or sexy I'll remember how he spoke to her and doubt myself. I don't want to compare myself to her, and I know what he did has nothing to do with how attractive I am or not, and especially in relation to her. But emotions and logic don't always coincide. Any advice? :/

---   
**tl;dr**: My LDR boyfriend sexted another girl for about a week and a half. I found the texts after they'd stopped to see photos of her half-naked body. We're working through our relationship and I know he's truly, deeply sorry. I just need help getting through my new insecurities and not feeling attractive enough, despite his constant reassurances. :("

For moderate feminist talking heads it is an easy way to stay in the spotlights by uttering some statements about the problem of boys being diagnosed with ADHD and being less likely to graduate college than girls.

The suggestion now offered is that male role patterns make it difficult for men to adapt to modern society. One [Ms. Buchmann](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/29/upshot/a-link-between-fidgety-boys-and-a-sputtering-economy.html) was recorded in the New York Times as saying that ""Boys are getting the wrong message about what you need to do to be successful"". According to Ms. Buchmann, ""Traditional gender roles are misguiding boys. In today’s economy, being tough and being strong are not what leads to success.""

It does not seem to occur to Ms. Buchmann or anyone outside of sheltered upper-middle class college educated liberal circles that when forced to choose between strength and success, the vast majority of young men would rather choose for strength. If your ideal society requires of men to abandon strength and toughness, then it requires of you to eradicate masculinity and you should be forthright about the fact that you would rather grow your nation's GDP by another few percent than you would wish to preserve the dignity of its men.

Young men are not stupid. They recognize that to rise to the higher echelons of our society and stay there requires of a man to continually degrade and humiliate himself. The road to success is in our society is paved with group projects, participation grades, job interviews, silly uniforms with nametags, unpaid internships, sensitivity training and most importantly, dishonesty.

As an example, consider Jeremy Clarkson, who had to grovel before the political correctness police for supposedly mumbling the word ""nigger"" under his breath. It is clearly a dishonest apology, because no man could genuinely feel sorry for an offense so petty. He apologized to save his career. Other men see this and lose respect for someone they previously admired.

Men consider dishonesty to be an expression of weakness, and studies show that men exposed to higher testosterone become [more honest](http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/251411.php). Modern society however requires of men to be continually dishonest for them to achieve anything. Men are required to lie to customers about the quality of products. They are forced to lie at job interviews about their personality and motivations for the job. 

This is degrading to men and the entire modern workplace culture makes men feel degraded. A 19th century coal miner did not have to pretend he got the job because he likes working in a team. It was accepted that he hates his boss and his job and merely carries it out because his family depends on him. It is more dignified than the situation of modern men of whom continual dishonesty and narcissism is expected, feigning qualities on resumes that they do not have.

When young black boys die at age nineteen in shootouts over drug deals, it is not because they can not afford to go to college. Rather, it is because they consider dying in a ditch to be more dignified than stocking shelves in a supermarket while wearing a [ridiculous uniform](http://imgur.com/a/PPekc). The fact that growing numbers of young white and Asian boys now lock themselves up in their rooms and play video games is because society has changed in such a manner that there are no dignified alternatives available to them. In video games, the boys can at least feel as if they are strong, because they depend on one another's unique skills in virtual worlds. 

Society attempts to fix the confidence of young women by indoctrinating them with the message that they are all beautiful, but young men already understand themselves as being strong and tough. As an example, although my best friend can lift heavier weights, I can walk for longer consecutive periods before suffering exhaustion. Similarly every man has his own strengths. One man has strong legs, the other strong arms. One man has a high tolerance of physical pain, another man laughs in the face of overwhelming odds. One man is good at hunting, another at fishing. A society that has no place for those talents is a society that men have no desire to participate in."

24kjmh,1,2014-05-02,Husband. Married Six years. Wife wants to leave me. Is this a good letter to give her?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/24kjmh/husband_married_six_years_wife_wants_to_leave_me/,"**TL;DR** Love letter read request.

Ages 28M &amp; 27F. 

My wife and I have been married 6 years. We married following an accidental pregnancy. Our lives’ have been high-stress ever since we've met: planning shotgun wedding, planning an unexpected pregnancy, both of us graduating from a demanding college with a new baby, unable to find employment after graduation, me study for law school entrance exams, me enter law school for 3-years of intense study nonstop, new baby #2, us moving every summer for a different internship, me landing a top job far away from family, etc.

I have a high tolerance for stress and challenge, but these past 6 years have been relentless. Now it's over. I graduate in a few days and we move to a new city and start a normally-paced life. We'll hire a nanny and she can work if she wants, or she can go back to school for graduate work, or she can get a job, whatever she wants.

The issue is she says she's not moving with me to the new city. She says she is taking our kids and moving in with her parents. She says she has always felt that I married her just to do the right thing because of the unexpected pregnancy and I don't really love her. The thing is, I do love her. I just grew up in a family where nobody hugged and nobody said things like ""I love you,"" to each other; so when I try to say lovey stuff or make romantic gestures, I feel like a huge cheese-ball and feel dumb. That's what she wants, though. I think she interprets my lack of physical touching and my lack of loving words as disinterest, which is not how I feel.

So my idea is that maybe I can ease into things by writing her letters and poems. That way I can kind of ease in to the romantic stuff. I think if I try to say these things to her face-to-face I'll feel dumb and she'll interpret it as insincerity. I'm really certain that writing her some things is a good way to tell her how I feel.

With that in mind, I drafted the following note which I am considering giving to her. If what the note says is true, am I expressing it well and sincerely?

&gt;When a reader finishes a long, difficult, twisting novel he sometimes thinks, “There was a great fifty-page story hidden somewhere in those thousand pages.” Similarly, I think there is a great love story hidden somewhere in the past six-years of our marriage. Stress, transitions, and setbacks obscure our story and make its plot difficult to trace. I’ve let our story become so obscure that, sadly, you may now believe no such story exists. It does. I am going to tell it and I ask that you stay and listen.

&gt;Over the next few weeks I am going to write you a series of letters and poems that are my sincerest attempt to tell you our love story. What I write will be my own, not plundered from other sources. If my words are corny, style mediocre, or expressions dull, my pen has fallen short of my affection, not my affection fallen short of you.

&gt;Your husband,

24kmrg,1,2014-05-02,"help please. letter to my ex, letter will never be sent.",[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/24kmrg/help_please_letter_to_my_ex_letter_will_never_be/,"Dear x,
here are my thoughts. 

That Saturday when I came home from the dog's missed lesson and I was upset about missing the lesson, that the teacher was a bully, and then I was upset then about my job, then about our relationship?  And then I said to you something to the effect of ""maybe I don't want this relationship anymore""?  Then you said something like ""you don't need to decide this now, you just need some ""You-time"", and then you went home that night?  I think that was the beginning of the whole thing.

You went home that night (unusual for you), and then the next morning I saw that you were in touch (online) with your ex.   

You said that she had sought YOU out, but I think that YOU sought-out  HER.   You RAN straight to her in order to inflict a little spite and revenge on me.  That's what I think.  

Then, when you refused to talk about it AT ALL, you put me in the position of HAVING to make a choice.  You decided that you didn't care what I thought, you were going to let your ex send you inappropriate emails, and if I didn't like it, fuck ME.   You refused to even CONSIDER stopping contact with her even temporarily so we could talk things out.  You dug your heels in.    I've never seen you like this; it tells me that you really have serious ties to this person.

That's when I hacked into your emails FOR THE FIRST TIME IN OUR RELATIONSHIP.  Never did I do that before.  That's when I saw how duplicitous and deceitful, not to mention batshit crazy, your ""friend"" actually is.  

Was I wrong for doing this?  Absolutely.  Did I apologize for it?  Many, many times.  You didn't change your passwords immediately, either, which makes me think that there were things there that you WANTED me to see, like the fact that you have no problem flirting with your ex and encouraging her behavior -- which she keeps secret from her troubled / medicated husband.   

This whole thing reminded me of when you smoked crack with your once-patient,  even though it was a clear boundary violation because you were once his counselor;  it reminded me of when you took photos of your one patient so she could have headshots (also a mild boundary violation);  and many more incidents in general which further illustrate your lack of awareness of boundaries in general.  This is not your fault, that you have boundary issues, but by 46 years old, and being a psychotherapist intern (a nonworking one), one would conclude that you would at least notice these tendencies in yourSELF and try to solve them.   But this thing with your ex seems to illustrate that this is not the case, that you LIKE messy boundaries for some reason (obviously because they allow you to wield psychological power over those who care about you, and you feel chronically helpless to use any weapon BUT that).    And now, your boundary bullshit has hit ME square in the face.   AND THIS HAPPENED BEFORE I TOLD YOU ABOUT MY CHEATING ""CRIME"" -- so what's UP with that?  

So, in reaction / retaliation to that, I then confessed that I'd been with someone else earlier on in our relationship.   Why did I tell you?  Three reasons:  1) I wanted to get your attention, and it appeared that the only way to do it was to slap you in the face.  2), when it happened, it happened at a time when you were emotionally and physically pushing me away and I thought ""well, let's see what happens, since my current relationship isn't going anywhere""; afterwards, I realized that I'd made a big mistake, regretted it, and 3) I felt like if we didn't get a fresh start with the truth, we'd never have a real relationship again (I've been told by several counselors that I was wrong about that too.  So, I'm not too skilled in relationships, I guess we've all figured that out).  

Once I confessed that, it seemed it took you a week or two to let that register, and then you FRIGGIN SNAPPED.  You LOST it, and got as crazy or crazier than I have EVER been, telling me to fuck off, threatening me with the police, actually calling them on 3 separate occasions (maybe 4), threatening me with restraining orders, and threatening to file lawsuits against me for destruction of your property.  I was never more FLOORED to see you act this way.   That's when I had my locks changed; I became afraid of you.  

Later, when things calmed down, you texted me some nice things about how you feel about me.  I did the same.  

Then a few days later, we spun out again.  Police again, I blocked your phone number again, you called a go-between to contact me regarding your things.    

I relented and unblocked you, saying I wouldn't throw out your stuff as I didn't want to risk you filing a lawsuit against me, and that I didn't care anymore when or if you got your things, that I couldn't let your possessions keep me from doing what I need to do for myself.  

Things have cooled down, texts have been less hostile, and less frequent.   I apologized to you, told you that I loved you and missed you, told you that I wanted to work things out if it was possible, but that at the moment I couldn't get over the thing with your ex.   

It's still difficult.  You wanted to talk, I told you I couldn't get over the thing with your ex, and at the moment I still cant.   

I see on your facebook page that you talk to your ex in ways that encourage her to stay in contact with you, and that you talk to people about hot girls or hot pics of girls, whatever.  I guess you're ready to move on. 

You tell me its difficult for you but you could stop all of this right now, just by dealing with the thing with your ex and showing me that you are willing to make a ""sacrifice"" at least temporarily, in the name of fixing things between us.   But you simply will not do it.  We can't even talk about it without you calling me a bitch, telling me to fuck off, screaming at me, hanging up on me, and calling the police repeatedly.  

My thoughts now are that if you really wanted to talk to me, you'd just do it.  But you don't.    So, what am I to conclude??


Tomorrow is your birthday.  I can't help thinking about how when we first met, it was also almost your birthday.  Are we to end on exactly a 5-year trajectory, right near your birthday, each time???  Am I to disappear from your life, are you to disappear from mine, just as quickly as you came into it?    Did we meet just so we could hold onto eachother like we were eachother's rebound-liferafts for awhile?  Is that all we were to eachother?

Five years.  Now what?  Is this what you want, ultimately?  To be away from me, to be chronically busy, so that you don't have to deal with your feelings, ever?  Then what?  

Your birthday is tomorrow.  I don't know what to do. 


I don't want to let you go, but it appears that I have no other choice.  You won't talk, you won't contact me.  I CANT contact you. 


Is this it?

24krgb,243,2014-05-02,The server rack from hell,Mo3,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/24krgb/the_server_rack_from_hell/,"I'm so glad I found this subreddit. I need to vent. Really fucking bad. 

I'm a 20 year old backend engineer with a strong server administration and networking background. I'm running a small business and rented office space 9 months ago. My office is hidden away in a seperate part of the main owner's building. The owner is a Microsoft fanatic who looks like a pathetic wanna-be small version of Bill Gates, so I'll refer to him as PGATES from now on.

PGATES runs a ""multi-location"" business, consisting of aforementioned  main office and 5 other phantom locations with mail forwarding. He employs a secretary and a few freelancers. 

As soon as I moved in, he started pondering me with requests. Sure, no problem man. He helped me out big time by letting me have the office rent-free for 4 months, I'd gladly return the favor. What was unknown to me at the time was that the favor turned out to be a huge-ass enterprise website (to ""show the world what we can do and make them think we're a enterprise"") and 2 different iPhone/Android apps for a whopping $500 total, but that's a different story for now.

Nevertheless, I enjoyed my life. I liked work, I liked the people in the office and everything was totally fine. I was the ""go-to IT guy"" for everyone and processed maybe 2-3 tickets a week. 

Then, 1st of April came around. I finally convinced PGATES to employ me part-time. I came through the front door and immediately noticed a buzzing noise that seemed to come from the ceiling. Upstairs, I was greeted by a VERY pissed off looking secretary and a pretty annoyed looking intern. The buzzing noise was now very notable. 

&gt; Mo3: What's going on here?

&gt; Secretary: Check the kitchen.

Outside the kitchen, the humming noise was now incredibly loud. Hesitant I opened the door to find PGATES running around like a kid on christmas. Then I noticed it. The server rack from hell.

In the 40ft² kitchen sat a huge 19"" server rack filled up to the top with Intel Modular servers. The air in the tiny kitchen was so hot and stuffy that I couldn't breathe. 

&gt; Mo3: What the FUCK!

&gt; PGATES: I knew you'd appreciate it! Just take a look at this beauty, I got it for a great price. 

&gt; Mo3: ............................... what is this for?!

&gt; PGATES: You know, Exchange and stuff! Every big business has to have one of these data centers. I know you have a server background and we can tell clients that we have our own Cloud! 

&gt; Mo3: ............... that's cool.. let me have a cigarette real quick

&gt; (5 minutes later)

&gt; PGATES: Ah good, Mo3! I want this set up until tomorrow evening. That shouldn't be hard for a IT person of your caliber, right? Just install THE cloud on it!

&gt; Mo3: Okay, first of all, there is no such thing as ""THE clou""--

&gt; PGATES: OF COURSE THERE IS! Microsoft has one, Apple has one, even Dropbox has one! We are trying to expand as quickly as possible so we need the best of the best in terms of infrastructure. 

&gt; Mo3: We can use XenServer for virtualization yeah, combine all of these servers into a pool and..--

&gt; PGATES: NO I don't want virtual ZenServers! I want THE CLOUD!

&gt; Mo3: ... Got it. But first I have a couple of questions regarding this.. setup here. How do you plan on cooling it? And do you have any idea how much power this consumes? Frankly this is a little bit overkill for your requireme..--

&gt; PGATES: YOU DON'T GET IT DO YOU? I want this business to play in the master league with the big players! Microsoft! Apple! Intel! I've already found a great solution for cooling *points to a tilted small window in the corner with a fan in front of it* and I don't care about power! Look, I even got a APC for it *points to a huge 20kVA APC behind the rack*


2 weeks later, the pool was fully operational ([Xen resource overview](http://i.imgur.com/3LgvgWD.png)). But that wasn't the end of it. Far from it. 

A few days later my phone rings. It's PGATES.

&gt; PGATES: Hey Mo3 there's a guy from the call center above for you.

&gt; Mo3: Okay..

&gt; BEEP BEEP

&gt; Mo3: IT at (PGATES' mental ward)?

&gt; CG: HEY IT'S CG. Could you please turn down the volume of your fucking servers down there?

&gt; Mo3: I'm very sorry but there's no way to turn do..--

&gt; CG: BULLSHIT! You're just incompetent. Go figure out how to turn down the god damn volume, our callers can hear 
it buzzing through the fucking phone. Now. And don't make me call again.

&gt; Mo3: Alright sir, I'll try. *click*

&gt; BEEP BEEP

&gt; Mo3: He wants us to turn down the.. volume.. of our servers.

&gt; PGATES: Then do it! There must be a volume control switch somewhere. It's a Intel server after all! You're a IT legend, that shouldn't be too hard for you.

&gt; *click*

At this point I'm like, fuck it. I'm gonna turn off every unused server. So I do that, the volume level goes down drastically and CG congratulates me on ""using my brain"".

2 hours later, PGATES bursts through my office door, his head red like a lobster. 

&gt; PGATES: What the hell Mo3! I told you, we need all of these servers turned on for the best possible performance!

&gt; Mo3: NO! Why the fuck would we need 30 running physical servers with 960GB of RAM for 2 VMs with Windows Server that use 16GB RAM combined?!

&gt; PGATES: DON'T TALK TO ME LIKE THAT! I know what I'm talking about. Turn on these servers and distribute them in THE CLOUD!


Keeping emotionally unstable callcenter guy in mind, I solved that problem by having a Raspberry Pi hit the Modular control panel's ""indicate position"" feature every 200ms for each component which made almost every LED blink constantly, essentially faking activity. PGATES was happy again, rejoicing over the ""beautiful symphony of blinking data"", and peace returned.

For 2 days. Today he noticed that the blinking LEDs didn't blink like the ones of the 2 active servers did, so he made me turn on all servers again. An hour later callcenter guy called again in pure rage and told me to ""fucking turn down the volume or he'll smash the servers to pieces"". PGATES told me to turn down the volume again. Sure you fucking dumbass nutjob I thought as I turned off as much fans as possible, lowering the volume to acceptable levels once again.

Lunchtime comes around. I just finished setting up the Raspberry Pi to ping all servers and services, check their health and send out alerts to my handheld radio/pager as a consequence of permanent hard disk failures (PGATES bought 180 used 6-8 year old HDDs). I'm behind the building smoking weed with PGATES' new cute redhead intern when all hell breaks loose. 

&gt; Radio: BEEEEEEEEP --- CRITICAL ALERT. APC ACTIVE. 

&gt; Radio: CRITICAL ALERT. SERVER 1 UNRESPONSIVE.

&gt; Radio: CRITICAL ALERT. SERVER 2 UNRESPONSIVE.

This continues for pretty much every server in the rack while I'm running up the stairs as fast as possible. Upstairs I'm greeted by the pleasant smell of burned technology. The thermometer in the tiny kitchen showed 126°F.

24ku63,1,2014-05-02,[Academic] Master's vs. PhD programs without an official Geology B.S. - what are my chances?,[deleted],geologycareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/geologycareers/comments/24ku63/academic_masters_vs_phd_programs_without_an/,"Hello. I am a girl who, at a young age, repressed her math skills and inclination toward the sciences by going to liberal arts school and studying subjective/social things. This certainly helped me develop certain cognitive skills, for better or for worse. Since moving to the west coast, I have embraced the earth sciences more and have been pursuing an academic path that is fully geology-oriented.

I am considering applying for graduate programs that begin fall 2015, but really have no clue if I stand a chance of being offered admission. Would be incredibly grateful to anyone that can take the time to hear me out and offer their wisdom. 

In return, I can offer dogecoin, personalized comics, um, beer if you live in the Bay Area, eternal gratitude, etc.

Anyways, here's what I've got...

**Academic history:**
* BA (2010) from a top school in American Studies &amp; Environmental Studies, with minimal upper-level enviro courses (those liberal arts schools really let you get away with a lot as far as major requirements go). Did an ecology field camp when studying abroad. 
* GIS mentorship after graduation in an archaeological field camp in Serbia (got a grant)
* a whole lot of undergraduate credits from a city college over the past few years which include
    * completion of a GIS certificate program
    * 17 credits of earth science/geo courses including labs, A's in all of 'em 
    * one year of calc
    * one year of physics w/ lab
    * one semester of chem w/ lab
* good GPA at all schools, though my calc and chem grades are less than stellar :/
* good GRE scores
* have NOT taken what seem to be the upper-level geology requirements for undergrads (sedimentology, petrology, mineralogy)
* zero published papers but plenty of writing samples (including scientific)

**Non-academic:**
* current internship with NPS geologist studying mineral resources in park, includes GIS work and fieldwork 
* will be interning at Columbia University this summer to work with researchers studying carbon transport, will include weeks of fieldwork both abroad and in NYC
* have an artfully crafted resume that includes various editing/detail-oriented/skill-requiring gigs, leadership positions, getting chosen for cool things by important people
* thanks to the liberal arts background, possibly decent writing skills? (I can apparently write a mean grant or application essay)
* secret crippling sense of self-doubt and lack of worth (probably will not reveal this to potential research advisors)


As soon as this semester's finals are over, I was planning on reaching out to faculty/researchers about their work; I am hoping to apply to grad school this winter. Over the past few years, many people have told me that I should apply for PhD programs instead of Master's, both for funding reasons and because it's much easier to ""step down"" than ""step up"" (to/from a Master's). 

However, a recent conversation with a Stanford researcher whom I met while doing fieldwork has got me doubting everything. He gave me the impression that PhD students almost always have received their Bachelor's degree in the same field. Now I fear that if I apply to PhD geology programs, the committee will take one look at my application and laugh. 

I don't know what to do! Not eligible for financial aid for those upper-level undergrad courses because I already have a degree. Feel like I have done everything that I can.

Will I prove myself worthy? What steps should I take? Should I suck it up and just apply for a Master's instead, and will that put me in debt? Can I even get into a Master's geology program with my background? Should I try find a grad program that specifically embraces science-loving, post-liberal arts identity crisis-having, cliched snowflakes like myself? Help!

(Your two cents of wisdom is my life force. If you've read this far, you know way too much about my situation to not say *something*. Any comments or messages will be very much appreciated. Thank you!)"

Here's a rough list of what has to go:


A tall square dining table,


A coffee table,


A couch,

A bed frame / mattress,


And two cheap ass target lamps.

Message me if you're at all interested, I'll send pics and we could negotiate prices. Everything's less than a year old, as I bought it all new last fall.

Also, if you want to move into a beautiful 2/2 on Archer and 34th (Stoneridge), I'm subleasing my apartment. I currently live here alone and use the extra bedroom as an office; you get a lot of bang for your buck! Rent is 725/mo, plus utilities Let me know if you're at all interested and I'll give you details. Ideally, I'd like to sublease it before the end of May.

If you want to sublease with all the furniture, I'll sell the furniture really cheaply. I'm really trying to get rid of this place/my stuff, as I secured an internship down south.

So I'm graduating in about a month, and I just got an official job offer: I'll be starting in an agency mailroom (one of the majors) in the fall. 

I'm really pumped to get in there and learn about the industry at the ground level. I know what to expect as far as work environment goes (I did an internship there last summer) but I was hoping to get some advice from you all. 

If you're a signed writer who's spent some time in an agency, a mailroom person/alum, or anybody who knows what it's like working in a similar environment.... how do I make the most of the experience as an aspiring writer?

Repped writers, what is your relationship with agency assistants?

The ultimate goal is to work the desk for an agent repping an up-and-coming writer I respect, and sign on as that writer's assistant, and hopefully start a writing career that way... I'm sure there will be other possible routes to take though... any advice on that front?

I don't want to get fired for sneaking my scripts into an agent's mailbox, but I figure there might be a chance to get read by somebody while I'm there. Hints on how to play this kind of relationship?

Any other general advice/tips would be much appreciated.

I've been in a relationship for almost 2 years with a Chinese woman 7 years older than me.

We met when I was doing a year long internship before I finished the final year of my university which I'm currently doing. We met in London while I was working at a prestigious company and we spent a lot of time together soon after we met, and ended up moving in together fast.

She was emotionally unstable and manipulative and I realised this straight away, but stayed with her, I convince myself out-manipulating eachother is part of a game we each play with eachother knowingly - not all the time, far from it, but sometimes.

She had problems with her visa to stay in England and this caused a lot of problems, we had a lot of fights as she didn't feel enough commitment from me and I, to be honest, was unsure of my intentions with her, and as she's older she wants commitment.

Anyway, long story short, we stay with eachother for almost 2 years and then she has to go to China. I make the decision to go and stay with her after i graduate.

Strange things in our relationship - she was obsessive about me cheating on her constantly, she would always check my phone, work phone - but this is common for Chinese girls and question me constantly - this was our biggest and main problem and made us fight.

After about 6 months of this getting worse, as i traveled for work during that time, i cheated on her with a transexual prostitute.

She found out, as she was able to re-dial the last number on my phone and googled the number.
She confronted me and we broke up for about a 2 weeks as i moved back to my parents - she never mentioned it was a transexual, even though she confronted me with the ts' blog and told me she showed one of her friends. - My gf knows I only got a blowjob, she asked if i licked the hookers pussy (I said no, even though i really sucked the TS' cock), but i don't know if she was provoking me to come clean or was genuinely curious - given that her English isnt native level and the ts' was passable and didn't show a cock and only had the word 'TS' mid-paragraph it would be difficult to know.

I travelled to go and see her and apologised and we got back together.. things were good for a few months, around 4, then things got worse.

I ended up moving out, and she came to visit me at my parents asking me to come back, I ended up getting my own place in London again - while I was alone i posted endlessly on CL and browsed it - i wanted a hung guy to suck. never found any partners, but i paid £20 to stroke a guys cock. i didnt want to have to commit to doing anything to a real person. i chose the guy because the pic was like 8.5""x6 big.... it was fake, his cock was shorter than mine but at least 50% fatter..

While we are apart my gf was begging me to be together but i said no, and she started going out to clubs - she claims to make me jealous, but i thought she was meeting guys, she sent me some pics with guys at the club, but made sure to always take pictures returning to her friends house after the club.
During this time - as my girlfriend had told me i have a small cock when we get in arguments (despite her telling me its long other times, i take that to mean a thin cock as i am above average in length and below in girth), i developed a fetish of being cuckolded.. and masturbated thinking of her fucking guys in her pictures (only 2 pics)... this led me to discover the hotwife community on reddit, which i then checked endlessly.
My girlfriend keeps asking me to move back together and I said no, although we ended up spending a lot of time together and she moved to my new place with me - we still had seperate places. Then when my lease was up (short term) i moved back with her for 3 weeks before i returned to uni...

Some reasons Im pretty sure she cheated on me to some degree - when we first got back together she stood on her tip toes to kiss me - she never used to do that as she doesnt need to.. and one of the times we had sex she wrapped her hand around my cock.. seemingly measuring its thickness.
but my thought process was that i cheated on her first, so she was allowed one in return - i've asked her this and she denied it.

When i went back to uni we went through a lot of indecision of whether or not to stay together... again.. she went out to clubs a few times. Again. I had the same thoughts of her cheating on me and was turned on (a mixture of rage/sadness/horny). I don't know what her intentions were of going to clubs - she claims to dance, and her and her nerdy friends do like to dance. But part of me is suspicious.

Anyway, after a month of me being at uni her work contract runs out (visa issues) and she asks to move in with me, i say yes, (i should say she's financially dependent) and we move in together again.
Again, things go great, then go terrible, due to the fact i had to do group work with other women and one of them, who admittedly I liked and she liked me invited me to her house for coffee.


we argue about this a lot, as i had a running project with the woman.
Around Christmas time with things flipping between great and shitty, I have been continuing to browse reddit's hotwife forum and eventually made a post one night when i couldn't sleep - responding to a guy about sharing his fantasy of someone fucking his wife and that I was nearby and would be able to help him out. I did not message the guy because I was really willing, it was the first time i messaged anyone and just fantasy.
My girlfriend saw the message when we were at my parents house staying for christmas... again.. we broke up.... again, she confronts me, talks about the pic on the site with a woman being taken by two guys - says its disgusting, accuses me of wanting to fuck other women.

Heart in hand I tell her the truth, because my family was asleep downstairs and i didnt want her to tell them, that i fantasize about her having sex with other guys, she doesnt believe me, we talk for a few hours, and eventually leaves apologising to my family that we have to break up.

She goes to stay with friends while I stay at my parents, I rejoin her on new days eve and we spend the new year together, i apologise, we agree to try to make things work out for the next few months as she leaves the country soon and we go back to my uni house together. Before we go back together, we have some serious arguements and she says hurtful things - during which time i stopped seeing her and then she came to me to beg me to come back- such as, she shouldn't be with me because i'm poor (she's rich, im not white (Chinese girls worship white guys), im not tall, not funny, have a small cock, she never mentions that im socially awkward though I am.
We talked once about my cuckold fetish very briefly and she said i spend too much time on the internet and don't spend enough time in reality. she didnt seem to give it much consideration, but she went to London a few more times and went to clubs, again, she says to dance (again, she went with some of her nerdy friends) - she didnt have a job and frequently got bored at home as I was busy studying a lot. Again, this turned me on a lot though I never told her - i never told her the full truth - that i want a hung guy to fuck her, because i think it would make her not respect me - she treats me like shit sometimes, but i feel she still respects me)

Another time during sex she asks me if i think have a big cock, i avoid the question by saying its the only one ive ever had so i don't know if its big or not, or average, or say it doesnt matter i cant change it.... once when she asked she said she had once been with a guy this thick.. and put her hand around her wrist... at the time i wasn't super-excited, but i have thought about it many times since... we didnt really talk too much as we were mid-fuck.
The past few months we spend a lot of time together and its good, she then leaves the country and i'm due to visit her at the end of march and stay with her in China - i'm happy to relocate there - or at least see how things go.
We have a very good sex life, she cums 99% of the time and we have sex 5-7 times a week, she offers blowjobs, she cooks, share bills etc.
Since she left I was with a trans girl with a hugely thick cock once."
24lpa8,5,2014-05-03,How do I become a better programmer?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/24lpa8/how_do_i_become_a_better_programmer/,"Sorry for the vague title, but I will explain. I am currently a CS major and junior at a state college. I recently completed a data structures course (A-) and I would say that I have intermediate level knowledge of Java and beginning level knowledge of C. About a few weeks ago, my school hosted a programming competition so I thought I would participate to assess my skill level and have fun at the same time. The problem is that I was only able to solve one out of six problems in the given time frame. My solution, although correct, was marked down heavily by the automated grader for being time intensive. This was very concerning for me since I realize how competitive computer science majors are both in my local area and nationally. 

I know that the obvious solution would be to just practice more. I did try practicing with past Google Code Jam problems and ACM contests but I always got stuck in the middle of implementing a solution and ended up having to look at the answer. Whenever I did correctly solve a problem, I noticed that my code was way too inefficient (too many loops / unnecessary checks / using an unsuited data structure) compared to the standard solution. I experience the same problems with inefficiency in my programming classes as well.

I feel like I have gaps in my knowledge of thinking algorithmically but I can't exactly pinpoint where it is. I want to be able to reach the level where I can at least solve 3-5 out of 6 problems in a competition, just like my peers, and I also don't want to be the stereotypical bad programmer that everyone has to clean up afterwards at my future internships. Do you have any recommendations for web resources or physical books that will allow me to refine my programming techniques (algorithms, data structures, and problem solving skills)? Also are there any solid resources for practicing for programming competitions other than the ones I mentioned? Thanks for reading this post."
24lw2j,4,2014-05-03,Me [26F] is concerned with mother-in-law's [43F] and sister-in-law [8F] living situation. They may be without a place to live.,helpwiththeinlaws,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/24lw2j/me_26f_is_concerned_with_motherinlaws_43f_and/,"This will a long post and I sincerely apologize but please bear with me. I have also given fake names for everyone involved as the post is too complicated to read with just age and genders. I [26F] and my SO [26M] have been together for almost ten years. We are getting married later this year, so it’s not like I don’t know my in-laws. I have known them since I was seventeen. I love all of them very much. However, his family situation has always been complicated and tumultuous. Please allow me to explain the general background to his behavior and then explain the problem at hand. 

My SO (Jason) has always been somewhat detached and aloof from his family. His parents divorced when he was a small child. It was not an amicable separation and his mother (Gloria) and father (Joe) had very limited contact with each other despite sharing custody of my SO and his sister (Michelle) who is now 23. For the most part Jason and Michelle lived with their mother. They were very poor, and I am inclined to think that his mother had many rough (possibly wayward) years. I remember once that Jason said he never really thought of Gloria as a “parental figure”. Likewise, as a teenager Jason also had a strained relationship with his father who lives out of state. All this culminated with Jason moving out of his mother’s house just a few days after he turned 17.  From then on Jason lived with a relative until he went to college, and would stay at this relative’s house or at my house during the summer breaks. As soon as he was ‘on his own’ so to speak Jason’s relationships with both his parents improved greatly, BUT even though his family has always been a part of our lives, and us in theirs contact has been mainly focused on short visits and holiday interactions. Like I said, Jason prefers to remain somewhat distanced. He is very insular in regards to this distance, and has said repeatedly that only the “three of us” (meaning him, me, and our son [1yr]) is what truly matters to him. 

So Jason also has another sister. His baby sister Emma (now 8) was born after he moved out of his mother’s house. Since Jason had moved out, it was just Gloria, Michelle, and baby Emma. This was a difficult time for the three of them. Gloria had to rely on Michelle for childcare help so that she could work and support her daughters. (Emma’s father was not in the picture at this point, and generally remains uninvolved in their lives). Gloria has chronic back pain, as she was in an accident when she was younger, and through the years her health has noticeably declined. This has made it extremely difficult for her to maintain steady employment. The situation became more complicated when Michelle had a baby right out of high school, and her boyfriend Mike moved in with them. Michelle and Mike’s son (Jacob) is now 4 years old. 

This is the problem. The relationship between SO’s mother Gloria [43F] and his sister Michelle [23F] has turned to shit. This is what is going on. After Michelle’s and Mike’s relationship fell apart (Mike was often drunk and abusive towards Michelle) Gloria  stayed home to take care of the children (Emma and Jacob) while Michelle worked and attended university. However, both women are absolutely terrible at managing money. When I say absolutely terrible I mean it. Both women ended up maxing out Michelle’s credit cards of which she had many. After Mike left, Michelle also had a very wild phase. She went out partying and clubbing, ignored her son, and started becoming increasingly hostile towards Gloria. Then Michelle found religion, started attending church, and focused more on school. 

However, Michelle’s attitude towards Gloria is simply horrible. Every time Jason and I are around his family, it is so hurtful to see Michelle’s thinly veiled contempt for her mother. I know they have issues, but I have not heard Michelle speak to her mother in a civil tone in ages. Plus, Gloria is basically a slave to Michelle’s childcare needs. Gloria spends so much time with Jacob that he calls Gloria “Nana-Momma”.  Recently Gloria has had some serious health issues, and all Michelle can do is complain about how it’s such an inconvenience. That being said, things have recently come to a head. 

Michelle is leaving for a summer internship in a few weeks. She has refused to let Gloria keep Jacob for the duration of her time away. At first Michelle said that she was going to leave Jacob with this couple from her church. Yeah, she is friends with them, but they are essentially strangers. Michelle was then dissuaded from doing this. Then Mike came back into the picture. (He had been absent for the past two years, with only a few phone calls to his son in that time.) Anyway, Mike has temporarily moved back in with them, even though he and Michelle are ‘not together’.  Gloria recently confided that Michelle and Mike have been fighting, and it’s gotten physical. Gloria is scared of Mike and sleeps with a knife under her pillow. So then instead Michelle has said that Mike will keep Jacob for the summer. NO ONE in our family thinks this is a good idea because there is a very likely chance that Mike will take off with Jacob and take him abroad. Finally, Michelle has terminated the lease on their apartment, saying that Gloria and Emma have two weeks to find a place to live. Essentially my mother-in-law and 8 year old sister-in-law will be homeless! When I asked Gloria what she was going to do, she said that she has applied for housing assistance in two nearby communities, and if that falls through she and Emma will stay in a Motel. (The last one seems improbable since Gloria has no source of income). 

For the past several weeks, Gloria has been calling to speak to Jason, but because of Jason’s work schedule he is usually not home. I have told him to please call his mother, but he has yet to do so. He is avoiding it. I believe he is simply exasperated with all the drama that’s been going on over the last several years. After I learned about everything that has been recently going on, I immediately told Jason everything. I urged him to try to help his family in some way. First, he said that he no longer wishes to have any real relationship with his sister Michelle. He has basically said that she is being extremely selfish, and is alienating those who would help her. He considers her a bad mother to Jacob, and that if Mike takes Jacob out of the country because of Michelle’s bad decisions, then he is completely disowning her as a sister. In regards to his mother, Jason remains at a loss. I suggested that maybe Gloria and Emma could stay with us for a little while. Jason was not keen on this idea. We live in a very tiny 2 bedroom rental and there is very little room for Jason, myself and our son. Jason also voiced concern that his mother and his baby sister would end up staying with us “permanently”. He went on to add that if they did indeed stay with us, he would have to sit down with his mother and have an earnest talk, being very clear in expectations. Likewise, we are living on a single income. (Jason is currently working, and I am currently a grad student/stay-at-home-mom) What money we do have is the result of frugal living. Right away Jason said we would not be providing any monetary support. At first I disagreed but then conceded, given Gloria’s history with money. He knows his mother better than I do. We have not revisited this discussion, even though it’s been several days. 

I feel awful as there isn’t much that either Jason or I can do to help. I do love Gloria and Emma very much. At 17 Jason and I were just kids when we starting dating. Gloria has always made me feel welcome in her family. I cannot say the same of my family in regards to Jason. Even though she has a checkered past, Gloria fiercely loves her children and owns up to her mistakes.  

Is it wrong to not offer to let Gloria and Emma stay with us? I feel so incredibly bad about it, but Jason has valid concerns about them overextending our resources. I keep trying to tell Jason that I am concerned for his mother’s mental health as well as her physical health. She is so depressed about the whole situation, and has a history with painkillers. I also suggested that maybe Emma could stay with us for the remainder of the school year so that she wouldn’t have to switch schools. As far as Jacob is concerned I have no earthly idea what to do. I feel so badly for him. He is such a bright and caring child and soon he will be without his primary caretaker, his mother, and his “sister” as he calls Emma--to be put in the hands of a man he barely even knows. Finally, I know that right now Jason is incredibly upset with Michelle; however, her life hasn’t been easy. She is a vivacious and high-spirited young woman with very big dreams, but she has a lot of unresolved issues. Plus, it’s not easy to break out of an abusive relationship. She is also selfish, and bitter, and I agree with Jason that she isn’t necessarily a good mom, but she is also very much a child, and in so many ways she is so naïve. Very soon her decisions are going to catch up with her. I feel awful about questioning Jason’s wishes in severing a relationship with his sister because it makes him feel guilty and callous.  What to do? Any advice on this mess is greatly appreciated. Are there any resources or organizations that I can look into to help out Gloria and Emma? 

TL;DR--Basically I want to know how to help my SO’s mother [43F], and little sister [8F] who may be homeless in a few weeks.

24m2fg,6,2014-05-03,My thoughts on relapsing after being clean 21 days,No_Fappert,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/24m2fg/my_thoughts_on_relapsing_after_being_clean_21_days/,"I relapsed last night because of horniness and inability to sleep. When I got into the third week of my streak I started having trouble sleeping. Most of the time I would just lay in my bed, being half awake. This started taking a toll on me.

I'm not mad at myself for relapsing. I didn't relapse in a bad way, it was fast without any pron. I've also gone an enormous way out of my comfort zone (going to the gym, new job, internship, cold showers) this time. I guess my willpower had to be at a low point sometime. 

I'm still a bit lost in how I'm going to improve myself this time. I will at least keep up on my new healthy habits and maybe try to approach some girls some time. I will also try to go out of my comfort zone ever further, by aiming for a month (and beyond).

Well this was it. I don't really have an advice for you fapstronauts on how to prevent this. I guess I was just worn out by all the effort it took, and now I can restart without the pressure on me."
24m3py,2,2014-05-03,Never told anyone what really went down(Long Read),[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/24m3py/never_told_anyone_what_really_went_downlong_read/,"Some back story about myself, I tend to be very introverted but I have a network of close friends and family that keep me sane. I'm writing this here because well, it's tough to say but plain and simple I feel too ashamed to let anyone close to me know the details of my last relationship. I dated a girl for quite some time, lets call her Lisa. and that ended 2 years ago, and it's not like I want her back but more of the fact how amazed I am at how people can be. We started dating our Senior years and it was always something that we wanted to happen. Years prior we always knew we enjoyed eachothers company but me being me I never wanted to ask her out because I was already anticipating the no, and she had a family friend who she was really fond of(I'm talking they were friends in diapers, had sleepovers as kids,  you get the point) in our grade also he's Jeff, he'll be important later. It was like the cliche' movie setting, I finally grew a pair and asked Lisa to prom, had a great night and the coming weeks we spent an insane amount of time together. I had finally asked her to become my girlfriend it finally happened, we were together and it seemed like everything was falling into place. We both graduated and attended community college, (I'm still here I swear this place is like vortex from transfer lol.) and now that I look at it, that first semester seemed so great because we were essentially playing house. Study in the library, grab lunch, my house/her house, don't leave until late sometimes sleeping over. The whole first year of the relationship was something I had imagined time and time again back in high school. I was getting good grades, see I never really focused on school in high school(due to personal/family problems), and when I graduated I told myself high school wasn't going to define who I was so when I started college I faked it hard but it paid off with the grades and time with Lisa; I felt like I had it all figured out. A year and a half in I noticed she was texting a guy from class a lot, let's call him Vince, and at first I just assumed it was for the homework but the way she sounded whenever he called, I knew something wasn't right. Eventually it got to the point where I would meet up with her after I got out of class and during small talk just asking how her day was going she would mention she was just with the guy at the cafe. That's when she started making excuses, Lisa all of a sudden stopped being there for me, I would call her and she wouldn't answer, sometimes she would answer and I would be convinced that I heard Vince in the back. We argued about him and she swore to never be alone with him ever because she didn't want to ruin our relationship. Fast forward to two years in, things were actually okay again, Lisa started singing and I would drop her off at her vocal lessons since at this point we carpooled everywhere. See this had been my longest relationship and with how things were going at school and the job I had gained through an internship, it was easy to feel grown up. Couple weeks after we hit the 2 Year mark, I got a call and voice mail from who turned out to be Vince(got my cell through facebook), confronting me saying that he and Lisa had been talking for the last 6 months and that me being her ex, I should just back off. Her ex, I had been dating her for 2 years, how was I her ex? She wouldn't cheat would she? She wouldn't lie right in my face would she? I more I listened to the messaged I was outraged, I couldn't recited the details but all of it was throwing me into a loop. I confronted Lisa and she denies what Vince had left me in the message, from then on we watched each other with keen eyes. Things changed I wasn't sure if Lisa was a cheat or if Vince was just a guy infatuated with a taken girl. Now, during the span of dating Lisa I had become friends with her best friend Joann, and to this day I'm still friends with her because of marriages in our family. Joann became the mediator between us both when things changed and I'm thankful that she never had a biased opinion when trying to help us out. After the voicemail we never recovered, the arguing never stopped it was like we kept each other around to see who would fold first. And it drove us insane, and everyone could see it in our eyes, hear it in our voices. During this time we started finding comfort in other place, I buried myself in classes and well, remember Jeff? He makes a return. Jeff joined the Navy and had gotten stationed back home, during the time of accusation and arguing Lisa could not have been happier. Time passes and Lisa and I break up. I couldn't tell you exactly how it built up to it but we just broke up, I couldn't take it anymore and I don't know if you're suppose to pre determine this thing but one day when I was sitting in the evening thinking, I just told myself I didn't want to be with her anymore. So the next morning I asked her to talk and I told her it was over. It was a lot to take in, but I got through it thanks to Joann. Not long after we broke up she started dating Jeff and who could blame em? They were really good childhood friends, if anything he was exactly who she needed with all the craziness in the air. A couple months go by and I haven't seen Lisa around anywhere, she stopped going to school and started working full time. Joann who at this point is my family because of said marriages, we started hanging out a lot on Sundays(church, bbq's, family time). We were hanging out in the backyard one Sunday and me and Joann had a few beers. The topic of Lisa came up when Joann asked how I was holding up, I on the other hand wanted to know every dirty detail Lisa never told me. And well the girl was a dirty cheat, remember we got together couple weeks after Prom. Joann explained how after graduating high school Lisa fucked Jeff before he went off to boot camp, but she stayed with me because she knew we'd both be at the same college. That Vince guy? Well turns out he wasn't lying either, Lisa told him we had broken up but the reason why we spent so much time together was because we were too comfortable. She fucked him too, more than once. I spent a lot of time after the break up feeling bad for myself but all of a sudden, I was relieved, sure I got cheated on more than once but in my Sunday buzz it hit me. Jeff had been parading Lisa since he got back from overseas but he I doubt he knew the details, who know what story he had been told by Lisa, I wonder if he knows about Vince? Joann never told me any of this back then because she was Lisa's friend first, and to be honest I respect that, it's actually because of this that we get along so well, her loyalty to her friend stayed even though she didn't quite agree with the actions. And now that we're friends I know that I have that I have a great friend by my side now, the two haven't hung out since Lisa got with her new guy. And that was what went down, nowadays I focus primarily on my school work. This story is something that I never told friends, family, or therapist, but I suppose you could say Joann know's the story by association. I'm 21 now and as much as I don't want to say it, Lisa was a big part of my life, it sucks that a girl like that was a big part of my life, but in the grand scheme of things, I learned a lot from her. It's no point now to try and call her out personally on these things because quite frankly it's no use. The only thing I could do now is focus on my maths and hope the future will be bright. I appreciate whoever took the time to read this monster I honestly feel like I needed to let this out somewhere and putting it in words was the best choice for me due to the fact that I still don't like talking to my friends and family about the things that have hurt me because I want to show them I can be strong on my own two feet. Have a great day everyone. "
24m60s,1,2014-05-03,"Me [26 M] with my fiancee [23 F] for 2.5 years, long distance troubles and worried it could cost us our relationship",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/24m60s/me_26_m_with_my_fiancee_23_f_for_25_years_long/,"I have been with my fiancee for two and a half years now. Last August we decided she was to take a job that was 700 miles away from me. I had to complete a yearlong internship (which just ended) back home so the plan was for her to move away and I would find a job where she is when my internship was ended.

Over the course of the last 8 months, she visited home twice (once for Christmas break, she's a teacher) and I have visited her 5 times. Now, despite the distance, we got engaged this past February. I drove down and proposed to her. It was something that we had been talking about doing (and wanting to do) for a while now and so we did it. Awesome right?

Well, right after the engagement, we had to go two months apart; the longest we'd ever gone without seeing each other. It was hard and I personally did okay with it (a minor bit of sadness here and there but fine nonetheless) but when I visited her in early April, she essentially said she wasn't sure if she still wanted to marry me. I'm sure I don't have to tell you guys that was a very difficult thing to hear.

We talked all of our issues out at that time and we mostly widdled it down to the stress of her job (first year teacher in a very crappy school district) and my internship (a teaching one) that were weighing on both of us. The fact that were live 700 miles apart and could not be there for one another is tough when going through stress and it may disguise itself as other issues in the relationship.

During our talk at the beginning of April, it was revealed that a guy in her group of friends down there had kissed her at the bar one night. She told me that she immediately pulled away and didn't talk to him for a while since (yay for me?) My fiancee is a very outgoing person who draws people to her because she is so likable, so it was no surprise that this guy wanted to kiss her (I can't blame him!) I was not mad at her at all and we even ended up going to the bar with the group of friends that included him. I was nice to him the whole time, not giving a hint I knew because I didn't think it was an issue.

Fast-forward to this past week when I visited. It is clear that she doesn't feel *right* about our relationship at the moment. It seems like it's hard for us to communicate when we're in person. Sometimes even thinking about what to say, which is clearly not something we are used to with one another. I keep assuring her that the distance is what's making it so hard. I'm going back down there in June when her school year ends and we are driving home together. I then move in with her in July.

She agrees about the distance and the stress-factor but she also told me how she still finds herself drawn to this guy whenever they all go out. She told me that seemingly no matter what, she ends up talking more with him than with anyone else in the group. She has assured me that it's not a romantic thing but that she just misses the companionship that I usually give her (but obviously cannot right now). This wouldn't worry me so much if this guy hadn't already kissed her, despite knowing she was engaged. I trust her 100% so I have no reason to doubt her, but I just don't feel particularly good about the situation.

So I just really wanted to vent a bit and see if you all have any advice. It's been a very difficult year because of the distance and I really don't want to lose her. I love her more than anything and know that once we can finally be together full-time that it will all be okay. How can I assure myself that I am right about this and that she just hasn't changed her mind about us? I really would take any advice on this because as you can see, it's a pretty tough scenario.

---   
**tl;dr**: Fiancee and I have had to spend this year 700 miles apart despite being inseparable beforehand. She doesn't feel *right* with our relationship right now but I think its about the stress of her job and the distance moreso than us changing. Also there's a guy in the mix who she swears is no threat to us. How can I assure myself that I am right about this and that she just hasn't fallen out of love with me?"
24m7fn,34,2014-05-03,"Little Credit Experience, Stable income want to lease a car",sylzarra,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/24m7fn/little_credit_experience_stable_income_want_to/,"I'm a 22 year old who moved out from my controlling parents house a year ago. Since then I've been living in Austin, I've held down two steady jobs and make about 1500 a month. Unfortunately I'm forced to live in the most expensive part of town because I have no car, and I need to be close to work. 

Despite this I've saved enough to go to community college this semester. I have an internship lined up in the industry too at the company I work at that will support me during the school year.

The issue is that I can't work half time and go to school if I have to use public transit. There are also a lot of job opportunities that I miss out on since they aren't close to the center of town. If I move to a more peripheral location, with less public transit, it would save me about 300$ a month. 

To remedy this I wanted to lease a Smart car. I enjoy driving them, I've rented them many times and they are pretty perfect for Austin.

If I lease it directly from the dealer it would cost 139 a month but they denied me due to my lack of credit experience. 

I wanted to take over someone's lease with a lease trading site. I have enough money socked away that I could pay the remaining amount of the lease for some of the cars as one payment today and still have enough for school. Is that feasible or would my credit history still be important? 

Does anyone have any experience with trading leases? 

I have no one who will cosign, parents pretty much disowned me when I left. "

So I don't know the real reason why I didn't get an offer (I think my boss didn't like me personally, but have no proof of that just a gut feeling) despite getting better than expectations on all my reviews (on par or better than the other interns) and even having my employment extended (was originally only suppose to work until March, but was extended after my review for another 6 weeks). 



Well I received a letter from the company asking for me to sign it so if another employer contacts them they can say more than the current company policy of employment time and job title.


I'm not sure if I should sign this paper. While I didn't plan on using my main boss as a reference anyways, I do plan on using coworkers and another boss who I also worked for (on the same level as my main boss, but worked with him when his team fell behind) who loved me and is actually trying to get me back at this company to work for him. My fear is somehow a company down the road will find out who my main boss was and talk to them and I have no idea what will be said. So signing the paper will help with that, but hurt with my other references. What should I do?"

I posted to /r/GNV and they redirected me here.  I'm selling a lot of year-old furniture that needs to leave ASAP. I'm also going to post on Craigslist but obviously I'll give a better price to Reddit people. Here's a rough list of what has to go:

A tall square dining table,

A coffee table,

A couch,

A bed frame / mattress,

And two cheap ass target lamps.

Message me if you're at all interested, I'll send pics and we could negotiate prices. Everything's less than a year old, as I bought it all new last fall.

Also, if you want to move into a beautiful 2/2 on Archer and 34th (Stoneridge), I'm subleasing my apartment. I currently live here alone and use the extra bedroom as an office; you get a lot of bang for your buck! Rent is 725/mo, plus utilities Let me know if you're at all interested and I'll give you details. Ideally, I'd like to sublease it before the end of May.

If you want to sublease with all the furniture, I'll sell the furniture really cheaply. I'm really trying to get rid of this place/my stuff, as I secured an internship down south.

Thanks r/GNV!

24mwf5,0,2014-05-03,Career and Grad School Advice/Rant for soon to be Senior Math major,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/24mwf5/career_and_grad_school_advicerant_for_soon_to_be/,"
Hi!

So I'm posting because I need some advice. I'm currently a Junior Math major at a top 30 public school and currently at a crossroads about where I want to take my math major and want I want to study in my life. (This is going to be a long post, so sorry in advance! There is TL;DR at the end.)


I was premed when I first entered school. (My high school had a CNA program that I went through). After my first semester I realized this wasn't the path I wanted to take. I then started taking astronomy classes because astronomy and cosmology was always something that I was interested in. After taking those and really enjoying them I decided to try and major in physics (my school doesn't really have a separate major for Astronomy; we just have an astronomy and astrophysics option within the physics major.) And then introductory mechanics happened. I passed the class (D+), but it left me scarred. I had never taken a physics class before and I put many, many hours of studying (a lot of all-nighters) in because I wanted to do well. I was meeting with one professor twice a week and still did terribly. It didn't help that a majority of the people in the class had taken physics before and the class was more application based, so as a result I had to really learn the concepts on my own.


After those I decided to take some summer classes, one of which was differential equations. It has without a doubt been one of my favorite classes that I have taken in college. The instructor was awesome and I really liked the material. After that I decided to become a math major. I then took electromagnetism because it was required and while the class was better I only passed with a C.


At this point I was completely turned off from school and grad school. I just wanted to get my degree and start my career. The issue with that is I don't really know what that career would look like so I decided to add a major or minor in Statistics and Operations Research to help out with job prospects. As time passed and I got closer to becoming a senior, I started to really freak out because I didn't really know what I wanted to do after college. 


I know I want to pursue something math/astronomy related, but the problem is that I'm not involved with anything really involving math/astronomy at my school. One of my regrets in coming to college is not deciding to major in math sooner so I could get involved with things like research. I'm involved with a lot of groups around campus, but none of them are math or astronomy focused. I have a job in a social justice leadership program that lasts all 4 years of college, I'm a tour guide for my university, I have participated in a couple of medical service trips abroad, and I even got to study abroad on a scholarship the summer after my first year. I am also beginning to solve this issue as well. I have been talking to various advisers and professors in our math and stats departments. Another one of my interests is dynamics and chaos theory so I have been talking to professors about that as well. One of the professors in the physics department is a theoretical cosmologist, so I have been in contact with advisers about doing research in the fall for academic credit under potentially in the summer and the fall. Either way, I will be doing some type of research in the fall either as a volunteer, as a job, or for academic credit.


Another one of my regrets is that I didn’t know how to adequately study for my classes. I have ADHD and this mixed with being terrible at time management my first few years caused my GPA to take some hits. I have begun to rectify this by meeting with a counselor, so this semester is the first one in which I actually feel like I know how to study for my classes and prioritize my schedule. But I have been freaking out about this lately and it has been distracting me from my academics. This is a big problem because my school is currently in the middle of finals and I have my real analysis exam on Monday followed by my linear algebra exam on Tuesday.


I have narrowed down the possibilities to 3 possible options. I will be in my universities town over the summer, taking classes, having at least two flexible part time jobs, and ready books to prepare myself for senior year


* The first is to double major in Math and Statistics and Operations Research, so I can find a job after I graduate and I don’t need to go to grad school. The stats department offers an internship that can give you academic credit, so I would definitely do that spring of my senior year. I like this option because I think it is the best one to prepare to find a job right after college. I like the idea of working a 9 to 5 job and then being able to relax once I get off. I don’t have to worry about school, and I’ll have time for my hobbies like reading or learning a programming language. The major issue with this option is that I still don’t know what that job would be or what I would be applying for. I’m keeping the option of becoming an actuary, so I’ll probably be studying for the first exam over the summer for this option.


* The second option is to major in just math and have a minor in stats. This option is most geared towards graduate school in math (for something in dynamics or chaos theory). Over the summer I would be preparing to take the GRE and the math subject test in the fall. For the option I would completely immerse myself in math to prepare for research and my classes in the fall. This way I would be able to figure if I like an environment in which I eat, breath, and sleep math. 


* The third option is basically the same as the second, but instead of math I would focus on physics to try and get into graduate school for theoretical cosmology. It is too late for me to major in physics, so I’ll be reading numerous books to try and catch up. I like and dislike this option at the same time because while I love cosmology, I don’t know if I like physics. The astronomy classes I have taken in which cosmology was a topic that was discussed have been some of my favorite classes. While I really like math, I have never been giddy with excitement about what I was learning. That has only happened once, and it was when I was learning about inflation and the potential for multiple universes. That was the only time in which I felt like I could shout to the world how much I loved the material. So if I follow this option I would eat, breath, and sleep physics to see if I could do this for the rest of my life.


If you’ve made it this far, then you are a freaking saint! So my actual question is what is the job market and the day to day life for each one of these? For the 3rd option, what math courses should I take to prepare myself for cosmology and what books should I read to catch up on. I have more upcoming meetings and emails to send to research and pre-graduate advisers. My course schedule for my last year looks drastically different for each one of these so any and all advice y’all have is welcome. To the people who read all of this, y’all are champs! Like I said I have two exams coming up so I’m blocking all distracting websites, but I will be checking this on my phone. Thanks in advance! Please excuse any formatting errors, I'm pretty new to reddit.

**TL;DR**
Math Major not sure what option to do heading into my senior year of college. Schedule looks drastically different for the 3 below options

* Math and Stats so I can find a job after college
* Just Math and then math grad school for dynamics or chaos theory
* Just math and prepare for physics grad school for theoretical cosmology

I'm a first-year student and I'm just starting research in SAT/SMT solvers and pointer analysis. My advisor mentioned that she used to work at the Cambridge office of Microsoft Research, and that she might be able to get me an internship there next summer. I've heard that their interviews are really tough, so I'm kind of worried.

What should I read to be a better theoretical CS student? In particular, I'm interested in existing literature, since I'm getting a lot of recent (2005+) papers from my advisor as it is, so textbooks and the like would be appreciated. So far, the only theoretical CS course I've taken is Discrete Math (which is basically normal discrete with a lot of program analysis and decidability thrown in).

I've taken a lot of math (I took ODE/PDE, linear algebra, MVC, and complex analysis in high school and matrix theory in college), so I'm looking for more CS-heavy things. Anything would be appreciated, though. Thanks!"

Finishing my coffee, you grab my briefcase and head to the door as I follow. We pull out of the driveway, heading towards to the freeway. ""This feel on a great day honey.

[Week 1: ""Please Allow Me To Introduce Myself""](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/242hz3/wp_a_drunken_stranger_in_a_bar_is_actually_the/ch313cm)

The positive response to the first installment and the many requests for it to become a weekly feature inspired me to continue and flesh out the cosmology of this world. This is part 2, and puts a lot of pieces in place for what will probably end up being a 5- or 6- week series, depending on the response I get. Thanks for reading!

***

I had gotten to the bar fairly early, around seven. After last week’s experience, I was sort of taking it on faith that Satan would show up again. Because if he didn’t, I didn’t want to know what that said about my mental health. Besides, where else was I gonna go on a Saturday night?

After the football game on the main screens finished, I moved from the bar to a recently-vacated booth, where I had a clear view of Spike showing one of their biweekly Star Wars marathons. Of course, it was more commercials than movie. I nursed my beer as the clock ticked later and later. The noise of the bar died down to a consistent buzz, accompanied by the staccato clinks of glassware.

“So I guess I was crazy after all. And I just wasted a Saturday night,” I said to myself, pulling out my phone to look up what ‘prolonged audiovisual hallucinations of Satan’ might be a symptom of. 

“But I promise you, you won’t have wasted your Sunday morning,” said a familiar voice across from me. I jolted to attention, startled, and fumbled my phone. It clattered loudly to the table.

I looked up and saw a pointed face, vaguely middle-eastern looking in a three-day beard, intense eyes staring into mine. I couldn’t tell if he was wearing the same look he had last time - I’m terrible at faces even when sober.

“Come on, you’ve got to stop doing that shit,” I said, secretly breathing a sigh of relief that I hadn’t just imagined last week. Or that if I had, at least my psychoses were consistent.

Satan laughed, and it couldn’t help but sound like an evil chuckle. “Sorry man. I was drinking before I came here,” he said, holding up the same glass filled with the same red liquid. “Your stuff doesn’t quite cut it for me.”

“Why the fuck are you so late?” I asked indignantly.

Satan looked at me quizzically. “Late? Didn’t you… fuck man, I didn’t know what year it was, but even I knew it was Sunday by the time we met last week.”

“Well I didn’t know when you said ‘next week’ you meant a hundred and however the fuck many hours exactly, I assumed that it was still counting as… know what? Whatever. This is stupid. We’ve got bigger fish to fry.”

“A hundred and sixty eight hours,” Satan said.

“What?”

“A hundred and sixty eight hours in a week. Multiply twenty-five times seven, subtract seven. It’s simple mental math.”

“Yeah, well, I’m on my seventh beer, so…”

“Not entirely true. Like three of them have entirely passed through your system already.”

“What, so you can see into my liver now?”

“What do you mean now?” Satan laughed. “I can see a lot of shit. Try not to get freaked out by it. There’s enough real stuff to freak you out.”

“Yeah, yeah, sure. Listen, thanks for bothering to show up again anyway. I’m sure you’re a busy guy,” I said, sensing that my initial indignance had been taken poorly. I was really feeling pretty lonely - new transfer to the school, older than most of the other students thanks to two years of sitting on my ass in the army. I had talked to one new person in my entire time in this bar, and it had turned out to be Satan. I didn’t want to fuck up the only relationship I’d formed, however weird and metaphysical it might be. Plus, he might turn me into a leech or something if he got angry.

“Oh, it’s… it’s not a problem, man. I don’t experience time the same way you do. Well, I mean, I do, but I also experience it several other ways. But you’re not interested in that, are you? What was it you asked me about last week?”

“Oh, it was… fuuuuck. I forget,” I said, rubbing my eyes.

“Doesn’t matter, you probably wouldn’t have understood my explanation without more groundwork anyway,” Satan said matter-of-factly. He seemed less drunk that he had been last week, while I was decidedly more hammered. I wasn’t sure I liked the new power balance that resulted.

“You sound like my fuckin math professor. What, have you got a… a curriculum for me? Is this an independent study in… whatever the fuck the opposite of Divinity is?” I pulled up my phone’s thesaurus app.

Satan gave me an appraising look. “Actually, that’s not a bad way of thinking of it.”

“Huh, opposite of Divinity is given as ‘devil’. I guess I was righter than I thought,” I said, putting the phone back in my pocket. Satan gave another smile, this one tighter, more strained.

“Anyway, the Godset,” he said. There was no way to transition smoothly into the topics he wanted to talk about. They were too big, too weird.

“The Godset,” I parroted.

“And I say the Godset to differentiate from an individual God that you or your Jewish Aunt or that Muslim dude over there believes in. They’re all elements of the Godset, but they’re nowhere near its totality.”

“Okay, I’m with you on that, but… okay, formulating a question. You sort of skipped over the steps between God and Godset. Like, what the fuck happened? How does the Roman Empire suddenly make an infinite being?”

“A good question. It’s… tough to explain. There’s a finite amount of belief provided by humans, and it only increases with population - but… okay, think of the belief as volume. The volume can occupy different shapes, and as the gods take different forms, the belief sort of bubbles around like waves. God, before he became the Godset, was like a rogue wave, a monotheistic force with a lot of belief behind him that rose up and dominated the rest of the pantheons around him, and when the Romans turned their belief from their pantheon to Him, it was another rogue wave rising up and joining, constructive interference, a Wintermute/Neuromancer kinda deal - he became the Sum Total. It’s that fucking thing from Calculus - the, the… what’s it called? Gabriel’s Trumpet! Ha, appropriate name. Still a finite volume of belief, but the shape it forms now has an infinite surface area. It is fundamentally changed. But instead of conversing with another of his kind in the Alpha Centauri system, he reached out and found…”

“Okay, wait, slow down, geez, I need to google like half the shit you just referenced,” I said, typing frantically. “You just folded in fluid dynamics, an obscure calculus shape, and a fuckin… cyberpunk novel? You’re like a Wikipedia of nerdy shit over here. Last week it was Vision this, Star Trek that… can’t you just use sports metaphors? Those stick with me even when I’m drunk.”

“No!” Satan said, with surprising intensity, his fist impacting the table in a way that seemed to mostly reverberate in ethereal dimensions. “Sports metaphors are for human-sized things. We’re talking about shit way beyond sports metaphors. There’s deeper truths to the universe, and it’s your science-fiction writers, your mathematicians, your comics artists - they’ve explored a little bit of the shallow end, whether they know it or not, whether they think it’s imaginary or not, and they’re doing their level best to tell you a little bit about how it feels to get your toes wet. A few hundred years ago I couldn’t talk to anybody but the best fucking philosophers about anything, and it was filled with these stultified Latin terms that even they didn’t quite understand. Your culture is providing a fucking gold mine of ways to talk about this shit, and I’m gonna fucking use it whether you’re willing to put in the effort to understand it or not. Do you want to keep going, or should I go find some other sadsack to unload my soul to? It only took a decade last time…” he trailed off, and for the first time I felt I saw in him an experience I recognized.

I’ve always fancied myself pretty smart. There’s a burden to being the smartest guy in the room, and I fucking wallowed in it when I was thirteen and thought I was hot shit for being in Algebra 2 and Civics Honors. Then I moved on to high school, and met the kids who were way smarter than me, and sorta-kinda made friends with the one who was smarter even than them - Dana, the girl who sat silently in almost every class, while quietly going to the national science fair and getting short stories published and working at internships designed for Phd candidates during the summer. Satan reminded me a lot of her, actually - the way she talked in metaphors, abruptly brought up topics that most people would want a semester to prepare to discuss… and the loneliness behind her eyes. She had made peace with the fact that she would find nobody on her intellectual level, at least not in high school. Last I heard, Dana had gone to work for NASA - her best hope for finding like minds. Even she hadn’t had an excuse to feel that loneliness, not in the long run.

Satan did, though, I realized. Satan was the only one who really did. He wasn’t just the smartest person in the room, he was the smartest person in the universe. Looking into his eyes, the utter solitude of that position hit me like a ton of bricks.

Anyway, I am graduating in a few days and have 6 internships under my belt, but I still don't really know what I want to do regarding a career/additional schooling (Masters, Ph.D., etc.). I have experience with High Performance Computing and like that sort of thing, so Computational Fluid Dynamics seems like a natural choice, but I don't have any direct experience in that field. I also don't really see that many job posts for that field. 

My interests include High Performance Computing, computational physical engineering problems, finite-element problems, space applications, control systems, and signal processing.

I also find when being asked interview questions like, ""why is it that you want to work in 'x' field,"" interviewers often feel my answers are convoluted or lacking real direction. I was actually told once that, because I have three degrees, I obviously must not know what I want to do. I suppose this is true . . .

Any ideas on what types of jobs would encompass both my interests and educational background?"

24nw1h,2,2014-05-03,Research over summer or internship?,tetraphenylphenyldia,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/24nw1h/research_over_summer_or_internship/,"I'm a junior, MatSci major. Money's not an issue as I would be earning money either way.

If I were to do research, I would get to finish what I've been working on and quite likely get a paper published. Since my goal is to go to PhD, it would be greatly helpful. Not to mention that it would look good to the PI for sticking around to see the project to the end. The grad student that's heading this project is also trying to wrap up the work by this September as well.

However, doing the internship also seems pretty good, since the field of the internship is what I want to work on with my PhD and the rest of my life, and it's quite different from the research I'm doing now.

I could do both, by doing the internship for the first half of the summer and research for the latter half. However, doing the internship for 8 weeks would leave too little time to do the research, while doing the internship for just 4 weeks is, well, too short to get anything meaningful done.

I presume that this company (plus others) would be willing to hire next year as well, but since it's also a pretty good opportunity, I don't want to miss it either. And it's dat dere industry experience, the thing that makes the difference between an employed person and a neckbeard living in his parents' basement (this point is especially important should I decide not to do a PhD or do it much later).

What do you think?"

I understand that Computer Science ! = Programming and anyone, anywhere can be a programmer with the amount of resources available online and in paper format.

Although, I do want to ask how big of an impact do the CS concepts actually affect a competant developer, things such as Big-Omnicron, Algorithms, Data Structures, Semnatics, et al vs. a self-taught one.

* One example I read somewhere was how a team of self-taught's program took 8 hours to run vs. a CS intern's 7 mins because he/she knew all the Big-O complexity stuff.

24nxno,2,2014-05-03,Questions about computational linguistics jobs,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/24nxno/questions_about_computational_linguistics_jobs/,"I am a current funded graduate student studying sociolinguistics. My program is extremely heavy in digital methods, and although I did not have a very technical background coming in, the graduate students that are finishing their degrees have a lot of technical experience in corpus management, speech synthesis, speech analysis, and programming. I have completely fallen in love with these areas of study.

Before this program, I never would have dreamed that I would be interested in a CS career. Now I am very interested specifically in computational linguistics and I am wondering how I can find a position working in natural language processing or linguistic data management.

As I am just now starting the program, I have two years to mold myself into this new-found and unexpected passion for computational linguistics. I already have the opportunity to intern doing exactly this kind of work, so that can be crossed off on my to-do list. I also teach robotics and a technology course currently. Is there anything else I can do within the next two years that will allow me to get a job in this field?

I am afraid that even with two years to prepare, I will still not be able to find anything because my degree name says 'linguistics' instead of 'computer science.' Are computational linguistics positions extremely difficult to get? There seems to be a wide variety of them available when I search for them, but I do not know what the competition is like.

**tldr: I have two years to prepare for a job in computational linguistics. I am specifically interested in NLP or speech data management. I am not coming from a CS or even a technical background. What can I do to prepare?**"

I'm currently a Software Developer II for a Fortune-500 company in the South.


I graduated last May with a just under a 3.0 overall in Computer Engineering, and had very minor internship experience. I knew I'd have to work my way up to begin with job-wise.


I was hired on as a Software Developer making around 52k base salary, and after receivng a lot of praise, was quickly offered a raise 4 months later, putting me at 56k.

Year reviews came around recently, I was reviewed as a ""5/5 - Role Model"" in the top 5% of Software Developer I's in the company. I was given bump to 62k base a year, and a promotion to Software Developer II.


The company is leading me in the direction of project management, and is offering to pay 100% of costs for me to start working on my EMBA in the fall at a top 20 business college.

----


My question/concerns are this:

I like the actual work enough, but if I start on my EMBA, I'll be here another 3-5 years. (You must stay 3 years after completion to not owe money.)

I was considering look elsewhere throughout the country now, but my parents have expressed concerns that I'll be viewed as a ""job hopper"", and that I should really wait till I've acquired 3-5 years of work experience.

Thing is, I don't necessarily want a long-term career at this current company, I have no wife/chidren, and frankly feel a bit underpaid in this area in general.

Should I look elsewhere? What advice is there in terms of the length of time one remains in one job?"

Some specific things I'm worried about, though I'd appreciate any advice at all.

Should I even include a relevant coursework section? Stuff like organic chemistry, instrumental analysis, etc. 

What should I put down for ""Skills and Techniques"" besides my instrumental experience? 

Edit: Through my undergrad experience I'm very skilled in using Excel for analysis of data. Should I put this under 'skills' phrased as ""Performed linear regression analysis utilizing gathered data to receive workable information"" or something, or should I omit it entirely given that usage of excel is a baseline skill?

24o9xm,2,2014-05-04,Me [20 M] with my GF [20 F] for 15 months. Tonight she called me in tears about feeling like she didn't have enough time for the relationship.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/24o9xm/me_20_m_with_my_gf_20_f_for_15_months_tonight_she/,"We have been together for 15 months, and she has changed a lot since she started dating me. She was a very innocent conservative girl before she met me, but I brought out a slightly more wild and honest side of her after a while. She called me because she is working a managing job at the school newspaper, an internship with a company and taking classes and feels like she won't have enough time for everything. She seriously considered the idea of breaking up because she felt like she didn't have time for the relationship, but she couldn't do it because she said she probably wouldn't make it a day without me.

I'm not sure how to feel about all of this. She has been in relationships basically since 8th grade with different guys. She is older now and hasn't really had any freedom, although I'm not sure what she would be doing even if she had more freedom, she doesn't drink or smoke or even like having sex. I'm not really sure what I am keeping her from. 

I'm just not sure what to do. I think she called with the intention of breaking up with me, I really do, but as we talked she changed her mind. I wasn't trying to change her mind, I love her to death but if she wants out I'm not going to stand in her way, if it's what she really wants. 

This is my first relationship like this, and I am in over my head. I don;t know what to do, or how I should take this, or what. I wasn't exactly over the moon when I heard her say she didn;t feel like she could give the relationship 100% and then said she couldn't go on without me. We live an hour away, so in the summer it can be difficult I know, I offered to loo kat apartments so we could move in together and she said she didn't think we would be compatible living together.

I just don't even know. And it might be a smaller thing but hearing she really hasn't been having fun or enjoying sex that much is really a blow (before me she  had never even had her pants off in front of a guy, even though she had dated some of them for 2-3 years). All this time I thought we were having fun and getting close or whatever and then she tells me that she still isn't really enjoying it much or into it. 

I don't know.

I just want to be happy again.",[deleted],gaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/24omay/i_know_this_sounds_childish_but_how_do_you_move/,"I used to be so fucking happy.  It was the summer after high school and all of my friendships were at an all time high.  I had a great summer internship and every day after work I'd go swimming with friends and laugh until the sun went down.  

That was the best summer of my life and the highlight of it was the first love.  He hit me by surprise and came out of nowhere. We'd drive for hours with nowhere to go and lay out in my field counting shooting stars under the light of the fireflies and the milky way.  He slowly stole my heart and I slowly stole his.  Between him, my friends, and the job I loved, it was the best summer of my life.  The fall was great with him too.  Then came the winter. 

In the winter everything went to shit.  One cold winter night we were busted and his parents gave him an ultimatum.  He could have me or lose everything.  In the end he chose to have life back over me which is perfectly understandable. We tried to make it work in secret but it couldn't work out after what happened.  One day he asked me if I would be his again and I said no. I wanted him to have a normal senior year of high school and actually enjoy his time with his friends.  It was the toughest decision I made in my entire life and it still keeps me up at night.  

He graduated after having a great senior year, went to one of the biggest colleges in Arkansas, joined a fraternity, and seems to be living a happy life.  All of his dreams seem to be coming true and I'm so happy for that, I just wish I could be a part of his dreams again. 

My life has went downhill since that happened.  I go to a different and much smaller college and feel like there is nobody for me here.  My old friends and I don't talk anymore.  I also am a member of a fraternity and my brothers are one of the bright spots of life right now, but I don't want to bother them with my petty problems.  I feel like I'm slipping at work and also my grades are falling.  

I'm feeling trapped.  I'm stuck here in Arkansas in a culture that's brutal towards me.  My grades are falling and I'm slipping at work.  I'm lonely.  Extremely lonely and when I'm lonely all I can think of is how happy I used to be.  


I'm sorry for the rant guys but I just don't know where else to go to vent so I went here.  Most of you are probably in better places than me, but I'm sure at least one of you understands how hard it can be to be in a small town.  I just feel lonely and isolated.    Does anyone know what I mean?"
24on3j,1,2014-05-04,Looking for advice about possibly joining US military,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/24on3j/looking_for_advice_about_possibly_joining_us/,"Not sure if this breaks any rules so I'm sorry if I did. To be honest I just read something about depression awareness week or something on another subreddit and I figured I go to reddit for a lot of things maybe a subreddit for this exists and would help?

I'm also sorry that this is probably all things I should tell to a therapist but I've tried therapists and had some bad experiences. One therapist I told that I was trying to get back to college and part of the terms for coming back from medical leave is to prove that I am receiving help so when I asked him to write a letter or email to my school he flat out refused after I had paid him in cash because my insurance didn't cover the Boston area. I also know that I shouldn't feel this way as I've been told it's a chemical imbalance in the brain, but I can't help but feel embarrassed and ashamed to tell anyone that I am depressed. I'm also a little suspicious that they're just telling depressed people that to make them feel better. I do feel a little better doing this over the internet where I'm (kind of) anonymous. 

Also I realize my post is a ridiculous wall of text and the TL:DR isn't much better but I felt like some details may provide better insight to my situation and I really would like as much advice as I can get since I'm potentially signing a few years of my life away. 

Anyway the TL:DR for this is I suffer from depression and have taken medicine for it in the past. I ended up taking medical leave twice in college, haven't managed to go back and try to finish again, but am out of money to continue trying. I'm not sure if I'm ready to go back to school (actually I'm pretty sure I'm not) but regardless I need help to try to pay off some college loans. Knowing that I may not be in a great state of mind but have financial woes, would joining the military (would like to go Air Force) be a good idea? Would they even accept me knowing about the depression?

Here are full details. 

I started going to college for electrical engineering in 2007. After a very bad breakup freshman year I started smoking a lot of pot and drinking to help me get over the breakup. Once the next semester began I stopped drinking so much but didn't slow down on the pot. Throughout that semester I would go to classes high and gave a very half-assed effort on anything. By the time finals rolled around I told myself to stop smoking so that I could study and just finish out the semester. 

Then I got a call from my family telling me my grandmother was in the hospital and they weren't sure how much time she had left. I drove home to see her and she died 2 hours after I arrived. 

After all this I went back to school and somehow scraped by although I lost half my scholarship and was put on academic probation because of poor grades. 

Then I did an internship at an engineering firm. With no more need to study I quickly went back to weed. 

After that internship break from school, the next semester I had to go back to classes but I stayed part-time at the internship on days I was free. I handled classes the same way as before (going in high) and on days that I worked I would immediately smoke when I got home from work. This is when I started becoming reliant on pot to get sleep. 

Then I got a call again. This time one of my coworkers who I had grown very close to had died in a car accident. He was one of two people that I had ever met through a job and continued to be close friends with outside of work. He was also just a few years older than me and used to be in the air force (partially why that's where I want to go). He was my mentor and everything I aspired to be. He was 29 at the time and I always thought to myself if I was anything like him at 29 I could consider myself a success. I was completely devastated.

After his funeral I tried to continue the job as normal but lost any enjoyment I had out of that company. I started not showing up for work without calling in. Those days I would hear my alarm clock go off and know it was time to go to work but I just couldn't find the motivation to get out of bed. I would just lie there and to be honest I don't remember what was going through my head. I would just lay there and hours would go by without me realizing it. Eventually I got enough calls from my old job about people being worried about me so I would show up to work once in a while. Then they told me they didn't have the funds to keep paying me on the days I did show up so I was laid off. I think it's pretty obvious that funds had nothing to do with it but that I was just becoming useless.

As finals got closer I found myself trying desperately to study but since I hadn't been going to classes I was basically trying to learn the semester courses all at once in a very short time period. With my friend's death in the back of my mind I just couldn't focus. Come finals day I remember going to my final, looking down at the piece of paper, 2 hours passing, then me handing in a completely blank final exam. 

I was raised by immigrants who came here from another country. Their reason for coming was to seek better opportunities here in the states where in their homeland would have been impossible. In that regard I was always taught that failure was unacceptable. My dad came here without speaking a lick of English, graduated second in his class with an engineering degree. Me being his son and being born here, that was the bar that I had always felt I needed to surpass. Having just handing in a blank final exam, I just felt like that was it. I just failed. I didn't know what else to do so I ended up climbing to the roof of the school's parking garage. I don't know how close I was to jumping but my sister called to check in on me. I don't remember how the conversation went but she convinced me that I needed to see someone. 

I talked with a school counselor and they decided I qualified for medical leave and could take the semester off to seek medical help. I went home and found a psychiatrist/psychologist (I always forget the difference but whichever one prescribes the medicine). She told me she thinks I am depressed and I was self medicating myself with the weed as it is an antidepressant and that's why I would break down after taking breaks from smoking a lot. She prescribed me an antidepressant and something to help me sleep. 

After trying this a while, I lost my appetite and any motivation to go to the gym. I would feel sick if I tried to eat more than 1 meal a day. Also the sleep aid knocked me out for 12+ hours and when I woke up I'd be groggy unable to function. My doctor prescribed me new medication that was supposed to help me sleep but not knock me out and help with my appetite as well as the anti depressant. 

This sleep aid did nothing for me nor did it help my appetite. My parents of Asian descent suggested I try an herbologist and acupuncture as they knew one that was supposed to be reputable. I tried that for a while and saw no results. I know eastern medicinal practices tend to take longer to see improvement but it was getting expensive and I couldn't justify continuing to pay without seeing any results. 

Admittedly I went back to weed. My justification was that I knew it helped me sleep and the munchies I get while high would help my appetite. As long as I only used it to help me sleep and I continued to take the anti depressants I'd be fine.

After a school year had passed since I took medical leave I hadn't had any suicidal thoughts or anything so I thought I was prepared to resume school. After dealing with therapists and medical leave coordinators, I finally got enrolled back to school although a few weeks late. I figured I was retaking all these classes so even though I started a little late I'd be fine. Since I was coming back from medical leave I wanted to start school again fresh and ready to learn the right way so I stopped smoking. As classes started I found myself just completely unable to focus. I thought I'd give it time. But without smoking or a sleep aid, I found myself lying in bed for hours trying to sleep. 

By the time I would actually get to sleep it would be time for classes so mornings started becoming a decision of should I go to class or should I skip just this one time so I can get some sleep and be able to get to class tomorrow? I got to the day of the first exam of the semester and slept right through it. 

My school advisor found out quickly and asked me about it and she determined that I wasn't ready to be back in school yet. 

Now I'm employed as a security officer working overnight shifts. I haven't touched any of my school loans and I'm making just enough money to cover rent, utilities, cable, and sadly weed. I've lost more than 35 lbs as I haven't been able to eat more than 2 very small meals a day and don't go to the weight room anymore. 

I just feel like a complete waste of life. I've always hated my kind of people. I know I'm not a complete dumbass. I know I'm good at some things. I just no longer see a point to any of it. I used to play basketball and go to the gym 3-4 hours a day. Basketball used to take my mind off things and be fun. Now it just seems pointless. The simplest way to describe me is ""wasted potential"". 

Which brought me to this decision. I am obviously very unhappy with my life. I'm 25 and have absolutely nothing to show for it. I don't know if I'm capable of having a family or having a significant other or even just finishing school. At this point in my life I've done nothing but leech off my parents. I don't know if I'll ever be able to repay them. 

This is why I think joining the Air Force could be good for me. I clearly lack discipline as I've repeatedly gone back to smoking weed despite knowing that I start becoming reliant on it if nothing else but mentally (I don't think there's anything physically addictive in weed but I don't know). I need help paying college loans which I hear the Air Force could help with. 

I just feel like my life has been a waste so far. If I serve for the military, at the very least I could say I did my best to serve my country. Probably not the best mentality but with suicide not being a legitimate option, going out while fighting for your country would be a pretty good way to go in my eyes. 

Right now my options are to keep living like a piece of shit, paycheck to paycheck, won't ever climb out of debt. Or I could move back in with my parents and mooch off them more like a piece of shit. Or I can actually do something with my life and serve for my country. 

I am wondering though if I would even make it to the military? Do they care about depression? Would they not take me if they knew? Should I try to lie about it? 

I just really want to be able to say I had at least one positive influence on this world before I die and as of now I've got nothing. 

If you read this far I am impressed by your stamina and (hopefully) willingness to help. Any advice is greatly appreciated. I do have some time before I have to make a decision so I'd like to make sure I think it completely through before I make a decision but every time I wake up I just feel like another day of me being a waste and wasting away my life. I've been doing this long enough I need to try something. 

Thanks again. "
24onbt,2,2014-05-04,Resume critique + Advice?,truthseeker1990,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/24onbt/resume_critique_advice/,"Hi,

I was wondering if you guys could give me some advice. I am a junior in CS. My resume in all honesty, is not that great. I really am aware of this. I am trying to make the most of it since I am applying for internships. My lack of experience definitely shines right through. My GPA is not on there because it is not particularly great, I mean, it is downright ugly (2.7). To be fair to myself, a large part of my grades has been due to a bad work ethic from high school, it was not the lack of understanding or being overwhelmed by the difficulty of the content, but in fact the sheer boredom of doing regular home work that led me to my bad grades. I obviously was wrong, and have been trying hard not to make the same mistakes anymore. 

In all honesty, I am not exactly going for the Big 4, a simple internship at a mid to big company would be what I am aiming for. To gain experience of how development is done in the industry.

Sorry for the long post, I figured knowing my situation might help you advice me better. So, what do you think of my resume? 
Thank you again, for all the things you guys have helped me learn here on this subreddit.

I’ve been absent from /r/longdistance for a while now. Unfortunately my relationship ended after 3 and a half years, and after moving countries and living together for almost 2 years. 

But now I’m back!

Recently connected with an old friend who lives.. well, **900 miles** away from me now. 

He told me a few weeks back about his feelings towards me, an we did talk about the possibility of a LDR. Now, I for one know that a LDR can be so rewarding, the heart really does grow fonder, but he’s never had this type of relationship before. Not really sure if he’d be able to cope?

At the moment, we are talking every day on Skype for a few hours, and fall asleep together on it. He’s extremely sweet to me, and he makes me feel happy, which isn’t something I’ve felt for a long time now.

We’re both in university, and I know that if we did get into a LDR, it would realistically be about 4 years until there would be an end date. Whilst not impossible, I know that it would be difficult. 

My family know him, and his family know about me, and I am good friends with his brother too. Everyone appears to be happy with the situation. 

However, every summer he comes to the UK to do internships, so I know that for at least 3 months a year, we would be able to be together. 

My head really is all over the place. We both have strong feelings for one another, and are both happy to be in a LDR. My friends are saying it’s not something I should get into again. One of my brothers says the same thing. I see their reasoning, but surely it is better to give it a chance than to never know what could happen? 

We’re on the **same page** in the book. We want similar things in our lives now, and in our lives 5 years and 10 years down the line. I don’t want him to be the one who got away and live in regret. 

Any advice or help would be appreciated. 

*Edit: I forgot to mention that he will be coming to see me in a few months, and we're going to have a super in depth chat about what is the right decision. Eeep.*"
24p2yz,21,2014-05-04,"I [20 M] am not sure if I should stay with my girlfriend [21 F] of two years. We are constantly under stress and argue a lot, but have the occasional good time.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/24p2yz/i_20_m_am_not_sure_if_i_should_stay_with_my/,"Sorry for all of the text, I tried to make it as concise as possible.


My girlfriend and I have been dating for two years now, and I basically went from one long relationship straight into this one. For the most part, everything in our relationship has always been great. However, she has some serious emotional problems, is extremely focused on academics, and wants to spend more time together than I do.


The emotional problems: She has extremely high stress and anxiety about doing well in school and getting into medical school after graduating from undergrad. I occasionally will help her with her homework (mostly just looking up research articles, etc...) and she will get mad at me often. Usually she is just mad at herself and taking it out on me, saying things like ""I can't do this,"" ""I should just leave campus,"" etc... Because she goes to school several states away from her home, going home would mean failing the semester. There have been many times that I have to keep her from getting into her car and leaving, which often results in her saying that she hates me or something of the like.


Academic focus: As I stated earlier, her absolute goal is to go to medical school, so all of her free time is spent doing class work and preparing. This has resulted in her not really having any hobbies or doing anything for fun (which I don't think helps with the emotional problems). I try to help her out with her work as much as I can so that she can have some time to relax, but it doesn't always work (as stated above).


Time with her: She likes to spend as much free time together as possible. Which would be different if it didn't mean her working and me either helping or just sitting around bored. Sometimes spending time with her means I have to abandon my friends, which has begun to take a toll on those relationships.


But: We have so many good memories and get along well when there isn't the additional stress. Next semester she will only be working an internship full time and will live further from me on campus, so I believe I will have some more space and she will have fewer academic stressors, but I don't know if that is true. She might just make more mountains out of molehills.


Finally: I have been thinking about ending it, and I have talked to her about it. We've gone through a similar situation in the past where we thought about ending it but instead tried to step up our game in the hopes that we could make it work. We made it work for a while, but here we are again. She has told me that she will do anything to make it work, will fight for me, that I'm the only one for her, etc... But I just don't know if it is a good idea to stay together. Especially if it means we will go through this again and continue to hurt each other.


/r/relationships: Let me know your thoughts or ask me questions, I really need your help.

**tl;dr**: I still love her as a person, but I'm not sure if I love use as a couple."
24p8bf,2,2014-05-04,Coming to Beirut,[deleted],lebanon,https://www.reddit.com/r/lebanon/comments/24p8bf/coming_to_beirut/,"Hey redditors,

I'm aware that this type of posts have appeared on this board and I've read all of them, but I'll still add another one.

This summer (september onward) I want to come to Beirut to learn Arabic and visit the city, country and culture.
I'll stay for 3 months and then probably start an internship.

I have a couple of questions to both Lebanese redditors and foreign redditors living in Beirut.

How high are the average costs of living if one is not particularly interested in clubbing or american style restaurants, as I've seen these two frequently being mentioned as the costliest things to do?
What are the average costs for a single-bed room or small apartment? Are some places actually unsafe to live in or is it just something foreign tourists are told in case they flaunt their ipods and pads around?
I've lived in S.E. Asia for half of my life and i've discovered that so called ""dangerous"" or ""sketchy"" parts of town only pose a threat to the rich and oblivious tourist who don't know how to keep a low profile.

Since my arabic is barely there at this moment, what other languages are in use that I can use in the beginning? (English, French, etc?)
How big is cycling in Beirut, how easy is it to get a bike and would you advise me against doing that?
What are some of the things one should do and see, what neighborhoods are not to miss? And i'm not asking what's the most exiting, but what do you guys like, where do you hang out,where do you spend your time?
I'm probably dropping by Beirut for 5, 6 Days in July to take a first look and check in at the language center I will have probably decided on by then, so I'd like to know for what to keep my eyes open.

I hope you don't think ""Oh, another one. Just read the previous stuff."" and I thank you for your help.

regards

24pbwm,5,2014-05-04,22 [F4M] NW Ohio - Looking for friends or maybe more,[deleted],r4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/24pbwm/22_f4m_nw_ohio_looking_for_friends_or_maybe_more/,"I'm a 22 year old female with a year left in my Computer Science degree. After exams this upcoming week, I will be working full time as an IT Intern. I'm kind of your generic CS friend, who loves video games and movies, but seriously, those things are awesome. I'm pretty big into League of Legends, so if you want to play with me, we should totally play (but I am low elo, as a warning). I also just saw the new Spider-Man, so we could talk about that.

What am I looking for? I just want to talk to people. And, admittedly, I am kind of growing jealous of my two best friends. Recently, they've been asked out and I feel a little left behind. So, really, I'm looking for friends to talk to but maybe a little flirting too. 

So, what's the catch? I can be described as demisexual. Not the biggest fan of labels, but it does describe why I struggle pretty well. And for the lazy, demisexual can be defined as: ""characterized by a lack of sexual attraction toward any person unless they become deeply emotionally or romantically connected with a specific person or persons."" What this means is that I am friendly with everyone but I don't flirt well because I want to be friends first.

What this means for you, dear reader, is that if you are looking for a FWB or someone to swap pics with, you're not in luck. In fact, I will ignore you as soon as you start asking for that stuff. (I don't like it when people ignore what someone is saying.)

If you're looking for a friendly chat and a (digital)shoulder to lean on, I'm the (wo)man for the job. I love talking to people and learning about their lives and interests. 

To conclude in the words of anyone giving an oral presentation in school: So... yeah."

In June, I'll be going over to London for a month, for an internship. While I'm over there, I'll also be meeting my girlfriend's mom, to ask her permission to marry her daughter. My girlfriend has already told her mom that I'm planning to ask, and her mom is quite happy with this, and is totally fine with saying yes.

However, while I'm over there, I'll also be meeting my girlfriend's best friend's parents. They're like a second set of parents to my girlfriend, and they're very protective of her, and a little more conservative. The first time she flew over to see me (we're in a long-distance relationship; I'll be moving over there next year), they didn't seem to keen on me, because they had no way to verify that I am an Actual Person, and not an African prince with a lot of money to invest.

My girlfriend really wants me to meet them, so that they'll have the chance to realize that I'm not a scam or anything like that... but from the questions they've already asked her about me, I'm starting to get a little bit nervous. She says that no matter what they say, she isn't going to change her mind about me, and I appreciate that...

...but I am so in love with her, and I want things to go smoothly for her sake, so I'd really like it if they ended up liking me enough to be like, ""Okay, you're good enough for her.""

I know what they think probably doesn't matter to her as much as her mother's opinion of me (and her mother loves me), but her best friend is like a sister to her, and her best friend's parents are pretty much like her second set of parents -- she's over at their house every weekend, etc., so I'm pretty sure that what they think will have a bearing on her best friend, and inadvertently, have a bearing on my girl.

So... ladies of AL, what are some rules that I should apply when I meet them?"
24pgma,25,2014-05-04,"Abuse of Power in the Church and ""Introverts Can't be Pastors."" A Rant About the Last Six Months of My Life...",[deleted],brokehugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/brokehugs/comments/24pgma/abuse_of_power_in_the_church_and_introverts_cant/,"I think many folks here know me (or knew me.) I've been off reddit for the last six months, interning in a Methodist Church with the hope of getting approved to go into the probationary pastor phase. So that no one is sitting around in suspense, I didn't get the recommendation from the charge conference. Hence the need to rant a bit. 

(For those not ""in the know,"" a ""charge"" is a church or group of churches under the oversight of one pastor/pastoral team. In this case I had two congregations and one lead pastor.)

So I'd been working in this church for six months, pouring out well overe 100% of my time and energy to put on the best impression and really support the congregations. And I know it was over 100% because my lead pastor at one point demanded that I keep track of my hours (because he didn't believe I was putting in enough time.) My average week was at least 50 hours, sometimes fluctuating as high as 70 hours. For six months straight. With my lead pastor continually and sometimes passive-aggressively claiming that I wasn't working enough. As he claimed this, he continued to foist more and more of his duties onto me, so that at the end I'm not entirely sure what he actually did as far as pastoral work other than the occasional worship service.

I liked the congregations. One of them immediately seemed to take me to heart and embrace me. The other one was a bit more distant at first, but we warmed up after a bit. I thought of these folks as friends and I was deeply grateful to many of them. I worked as hard as I could to go out of my shell and meet with other people. I know I'm introverted. I always have been. That's just who I am. But I know that I have to get out of my shell for much pastoral work. I thought I was accomplishing this to a decent extent. In fact, I thought I was accomplishing this in a surprisingly quick amount of time. Six months is nothing timewise in getting me to really try and change something. 

And all the feedback that I got from the parishioners was always positive. A retired District Superintendent in my congregation was always helpful and supportive. Church members would come up to me and tell me that they thought certain sermons were really great, or something was really neat. Only my lead pastor really had a fly in the ointment when it came to feedback, and then he would beat me over the head with what he thought I did wrong. But he'd never send me into anything new with any kind of clear directions or suggestions. So I never knew if I was doing things wrong or not. I always had to figure shit out on my own. Then afterwards he would tell me how I did it wrong.

The stress towards the beginning of Lent was so bad that I decided to fast ""hating my body."" I have gender-identity... hmm... differences. So having body image problems has been the norm for me. But that, coupled with working 70-hour weeks, really put me in a place where I found out that I had come to hate my body. I was eating maybe one meal a day. I only weighed 118 lbs. to begin with (5'9 tall). That's fully normal for me. Underweight, but normal with the normal amount of caloric intake. I just have one of those metabolisms. But then by the time of Lent I had lost something like 5-10 lbs. Way too much for someone as skinny as I am. I had one day where I had to run up four flights of stairs to catch my train for a worship service and I sat on the train for half an hour pouring sweat, shaking and almost vomiting because my body had been so weakened. That was when I realized that my internship work was not playing well into my existing body-image problems. That was when I tried to fast ""hating my body,"" which basically meant eating at least three meals a day. And, to be honest, I felt ambivalent about skipping the meals at the beginning because of my image problems. You think male-sexed people can't develop eating disorders? I may well have, or have gotten pretty close to getting there.

Anyway, towards the end of these past six months, I thought I had reached a decent equilibrium with my lead pastor at least. We still had communication issues, but I figured that we both knew I'd only be around for another four months or so and we could just deal with it. Then the Charge Conference came along...

I was to present my report on my work, then go out while they discussed me, then come back to await their judgment. Oh boy was it judgment. I came back in to find that they had decided that introverted people can't be pastors. They said I'm too introverted and (here's the kicker) *I can't change or develop that.* No chance to defend myself. The vote was done. I just got to sit there as they judged my personality and their perceptions of my ability to change. I just sat there as I heard that they voted 2-to-1 against recommending me, in spite of the fact that I had not a single inkling that things were this bad before. My lead pastor and I had problems, yes, but he never so much as hinted to me that they might be bad enough to KO my recommendation. But what burns me up more right now is this idea that I find fucking ridiculous: I can't change myself. How can any charge conference, let alone any Christian believe that? How can we believe that a person *can't change?* 

But, also, how can two entire congregations just let me sail on blissfully unaware that they're torpedoeing my future. Or, at the least, blissfully unaware that they have concerns? If someone had come to me with concerns I could have worked harder to address them. I could have tried to do *something.* Nope, just let me work in ignorance until you drop the hammer on my head. What bullshit. And who the hell thinks that introverts can't be pastors? What's up with that? Does that mean that only extroverts can be pastors? Does that mean that we profess a theology that God can only call one *kind* of person? What a weak and limited view of pastoral work. I think we need pastors of all stripes. Introverts, extroverts, sci-fi fans, fantasy fans, who cares? Seriously, I think without pastoral diversity a church can get really skewed. You might as well just say that we don't think bearded people can be pastors or some other ridiculous bullshit criterion.

Luckily my District Superintendent and even the Bishop agreed that the charge conference decision was bullshit. However, they have no power to override the charge conference. So I'm out. No more ordination track. It's over. Except that the higher-ups were at least able to offer me work as a ""trained theologian in congregational life."" In another congregation. Which basically means non-ordained pastor-like work. There *may,* conceivably be a possible future route around this charge conference decision to get me onto an ordination track through the backdoor as it were, but who knows?

They gave me so little time for a decision, so I said yes. But at the moment I just have no fucking clue. Some days I think, ""I can do this."" Other days I think there's no way I can do that. I feel like the well has dried up. And so I'm left with a shattered future, a weakened body and little/unclear faith to start again with something... It's fucked, it was betrayal, it was abuse, it's poor theology and I'm totally burned out...

End rant.

Need advice on my next year work,lungu9,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/24pi9r/complicated_background_need_advice_on_my_next/,"Hi guys! I have a rather complicated background and I would like some advice on what should I do next in order to get an internship after freshman year (I know there are some post about this, but my situation is rather different then those out there).

I am an international student (from a non-English speaking country in Europe) and I will be a freshman in the fall at Illinois Institute of Technology (if it matters). I discovered programming in hs. My teacher is one of the best in algorithms, but every time I wanted to develop an application of some kind he advised me against it and said that I should focus on algorithm. The other problem that I encountered (but found out about it just a few weeks ago) is that I have been using a rather basic programming technique (I code C++, but I mainly work with basic loops and variables, rarely with lists, structures or predefined functions and definitely not OOP). After my admission to college I was approached by a professor and he offered me a research opportunity in distributed systems (which I know nothing about) and I accepted it (why not?).

So to sum up: I have a strong algorithm knowledge, but code them in a primitive way, I have no apps and honestly no idea of how to build one, but I will be doing research in Distributed Systems and have a lot of free time and will. 

I would want you to help me figure out what should I do in the near future to ensure that I get an internship in the summer after my freshman year (2015) because I really need it to pay for my living expenses. Should I modernize my coding and if yes, how? Should I start building apps and if yes can you give me some further advice? Should I focus on my DS research?

Basically until a few weeks ago (when I began to browse the internet a lot about programming) I thought I had strong chances of getting a job, but now I don't and I'm freaked out!

Thank you so much for your help and sorry for asking these stupid questions!"

During my interviews I am always professionally dressed, I always bring a list of questions to ask, and I always bring examples of things I did during my student teaching internships (lesson plans, classroom management techniques, schedules, etc.). The interviews always seem to go really well and always go the full time (I have been told that if they don't like you they can cut your interview short, so it is always good if it goes the full time) and they always tell me they are really impressed afterwards. However, I never get picked for the job in the end and I end up checking the mail to see that I have received another rejection letter.

What could I be doing wrong? Am I even doing anything wrong? If they are so impressed with me and really like my credentials why do I keep getting rejected? I know the teaching market isn't doing so great (it was when I first started my degree) but I am hoping something gives soon!

Even if it's not possible, it's cool I guess I can learn a lot of other stuff online. A lot of free online courses available these days!

Also, since I'll be graduating in a year, I suppose I'll be looking out for a full-time job anyway. I understand Dubai is not really the place for Computer Engineers, especially not those fresh out of college, but I've got family here so it would be neat if it were possible. Anyone know of any tech companies hiring interns or fresh grads?"

I am contemplating attending CMU as an MS ECE student, starting this fall.

I was a bit curious about the internship/full time position scenario at CMU, specifically in the semiconductor/chip design industry. I plan to take course work in Computer Architecture and digital logic design.

Is there a career fair during the fall term for internships ? If so, then which month is it in ?
Do all folks in ECE end up with calls ?

I am aware that CMU is quite systems heavy. I do have offers from other top-10 ECE schools, would you suggest I choose other schools for my areas of interest ?

Cheers!

24q63y,0,2014-05-04,Graduate Admission Decision (MSCS) : Should I choose SJSU or SFSU?,epochElipse,GradSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/GradSchool/comments/24q63y/graduate_admission_decision_mscs_should_i_choose/,"My Background:
Non-CS Undergrad (Architecture)
Fairly new to CS - began taking fundamentals courses at my local CC 1.5 years ago
Non-Traditional student (35 years old)

My Dilemma:
I have conditional admits to both bay area schools. SFSU is requiring 2 foundation courses, but SJSU is requiring 7!  This means that it would take roughly 1 year longer to complete the degree from SJSU than from SFSU.

The pragmatic side of me says to choose SFSU because I would finish 1 year sooner, and because the concentrations in SE or Business offered seem to fit my situation (links below).  The program description seems to market them as a more practical program that actually ""prepares you for the software industry,""  I mention this because I am aware of the debate regarding CS majors that come into the SE industry with ""too much theoretical knowledge"" and ""too little programming skills"".

SFSU MSCS - General
Computer Science

SFSU MSCS - Software Engineering
Computer Science

SFSU MSCS - Computing &amp; Business
Computer Science

That said, I recognize that SJSU is probably a more complete CS education and a more respected degree.  In my situation, however, that extra year is a major factor as I am already ""late to the game.""  Purists will cringe, but I am a little wary of ""theoretical overkill.""  Ideally, 100% of what I learn would actually be applicable to my new career.  Ideally.  

SJSU MSCS - General
Department of Computer Science

I also think that SJSU may offer better internship &amp; recruitment opportunities due to it's adjacency to SV.  Is SFSU at a clear disadvantage here?  Or am I wrong to assume that?  

My Anticipated Future Role in CS / SE:
I am a competent programmer and do enjoy problem solving a great deal.  However, I know I will never be a ""superstar hacker"", nor do I aspire to be one.  I am more than willing to pay dues and get the experience needed, but I am hoping to eventually leverage my experience in project management and design from my architecture background into areas like PM, HCI, UX in the software industry.  I feel like I have the ""soft people skills"" that might go unused in the wrong role.

Are there any SFSU grads or those familiar with the program that can comment?  I'd really like to know if any have suffered from or noticed the SFSU degree being disrespected??"

The longest we've ever been apart is a few weeks, so 3 months seems like forever.

There is no question of cheating, we plan to get married within the next year or two. What I think I'm upset about is just the fact that he won't be around in person, and his internship will keep him away from his phone and online during the day (we text all day long normally). 

I know I'll be okay once he's gone and we're like a month in, but in the meantime, I'm just so upset all of the time. When I'm not busy, I can't stop thinking about him leaving. It doesn't help that I just graduated and am stuck at home until I get a job, and none of my friends are here. I have an internship and a part-time job but they haven't started yet. All I can think about is him leaving and how little time we have left. Even though he has about 2 weeks still, we're about an hour away and I don't have a car, plus he works all week. 

I hate that I'm being like this, I feel so clingy. I know the separation will be good for us and it will help me get over this thing (I tend to cry whenever we have to be away from each other for more than a week), but in the meantime this is killing me. It hurts to think about him leaving, and it bothers me that I get so upset. 

I don't know what to do, what to think about instead. I just don't want to get so upset in anticipation of him leaving. And, when I go out to visit him this summer, I don't want to spend the whole week upset that I'd have to leave shortly. I appreciate your help in advance!

I'm a university student (male) in my 20s and I'm looking to get back in the gym. I haven't really been working out since October. I used to hit the gym 3 times a week with my good friend, workout and bar buddy. However, last October during our fall break, he was driving on I-40, had a seizure and was killed in a car crash. I took it pretty goddamned hard, stopped going to our gym and our bar etc. because I was super upset. 

However the summer has rolled around and I need to move on and get my life back in order. I'm moving out of town for the summer for an internship with a great company. I'm using this opportunity to make a number of positive changes in my life: First, I've quit smoking (tobacco). I'm currently five days smoke free and I've switched to vaping and it's going great. My lungs and my heart are already feeling so much better for it. Plus, I don't smell like cigs all the time. Second, I'm improving my diet. I've cut down a ton on soda, energy drinks, etc. and continuing to improve my eating habits. Since March I've lost about 20 lbs. I'm 5'11"" and I'm down from 200 even to about 180. 

The last step is to begin hitting the gym. I've been doing situps, pushups, etc. in my room to start off. Since I quit smoking, I can now run a mile and my endurance is only getting better every day. Could a few of you experts on /r/fitness hook me up with an easy routine I can do for a few weeks to get back into the habit of lifting? I don't want to overdo it and be so sore I can't move for days because I'm moving out of my apartment and into my new place this friday and I'll need to walk about a mile/day at my internship. Also, does anyone know of any good upper back exercises? My posture has been declining lately and I want to get a few exercises to help with strength in my back and to improve  posture.

Thanks in advance for your help."

24qk4e,2,2014-05-04,I'm [21M] seriously conflicted about how to move forward with long term/long distance ex-gf [19F] Do I come home and spend the summer or move on with my life?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/24qk4e/im_21m_seriously_conflicted_about_how_to_move/,"I'm 21 years old and a college student, currently a Junior. My ex-gf is 19 , a senior in high school and a soon to be Freshman in college at a school across the country (3+ hour plane ride). We met 3 years ago when she was 15 and I was 17. We started hooking up for a few months and slowly developed a relationship. In the beginning of the relationship I was not very enthusiastic about her and went through the motions. After about a year I fell head over heels for her and she changed my life completely and utterly, she grew on me. 


I consider her my best friend and we have intense compatibility. We have been through a lot together, we've had several breakups - most lasting a day or two but one lasting 2 weeks and the most recent lasting a whole month. In addition, very very early on in our relationship she kissed another guy. At one point I also cheated on her. I ended things and we didn't speak for a while. We went our separate ways for a few weeks. During this time I was with several different women. When we decided to get back together I ended giving her an STD that we both now still have. It was a traumatic experience for both of us (moreso her). Although it was a difficult time the whole dynamic of our relationship changed. We went from having a standard teenage relationship to a very passionate and intimate relationship. We spent all of our time together and in some ways had began to speak our own language. 

The relationship was perfect. We never fought, had good sex, and had lots of fun. For both of us this was a period of growth. I should also mention that throughout the relationship I felt as if she was always a little bit more invested than I was. After about a year I got accepted into my dream school across the country. (15 hour car drive, 2-3 hour plane ride). We took a short break in our relationship as I got acclimated to my new environment. We began a long distance relationship and began to see each other on breaks and at east once during the semester. Things could not have been better. We were both excited about the relationship. Never fought. I was focused on my health and on school and she was doing her own thing.

 I spent a month and a half with her during winter break and it was the happiest time of my life. I went back to school this January and the semester was rather shitty. I missed her a lot and had trouble readjusting to being away from her. I saw her for a total of about 15 days over the course of 2.5 months (not bad). Still, when I got back from break about a month ago I felt it in my heart that I could no longer continue the relationship. I was feeling depressed and 'held back' for having a long distance relationship, and I also knew that she was going to college and moving farther away in the future. So long story short, I ended an otherwise perfect relationship because I felt 'held back'. A month has gone by. Both of us in this time have been working on ourselves and seeing therapists. 


In the past month I feel like I have gotten my independence back and am overall much happier. Still, I felt miserable sometimes because I missed her and felt like she resented me for ending things. We were 'no contact' until about a week ago. We've been talking every few days. Every conversation we have has been absolutely amazing and nothing like we ever had before. I'm taking steps to be a happier person and so is she. We have both agreed to focus on ourselves and be less co-dependent. Since we started talking I am even happier than I was because I know that she is 'ok' and doesn't hate me. I'm also happier because I just simply have a blast talking to her.


 Now this is where I am conflicted. I know without a doubt that me and her could start things back up if I proposed it (at this point I wouldn't consider us broken up, more like 'it's complicated'). After breaking up with her, I decided to keep my job down here at school and classes for the summer instead of getting an internship back home where I would spend about 2.5 months with her. Things are going really well and I feel like if we got back together with this newfound optimism we would be successful. 

We've broken up before and upon getting back together the relationship was typically much better. Or, should I just let this girl go and move on with my life? 

tl;dr 3 yr Longterm/Longdistance relationship, broken up for one month. Considering restarting it, need perspective"

While I was there I wrote them a windows form application using Visual Studio, which parses through XML files and places data in specific places.

About 20 minutes ago, I fell in the line of duty. Today was a rough day; for context let me explain why:

Today is my roommate's bachelor party. He had asked me to be in the wedding over the summer, but because I did not know my plans at the time, he and the best man (another roommate) thought it wise to not include me in the wedding plans. I come to find out later that I did not get the internship I had hoped for and was planning to attend the wedding. By this time, however, plans were made and it would be bad to change them again. So here I am, with only me and another roommate (he had similar circumstances) being in town but not able to participate in the wedding ceremony as originally intended. Basically because of this I was not allowed to come to the bachelor party tonight though everyone else was.

I felt very lonely, hurt, and angry. Today and days in the recent past I have felt people have abandoned me. 

I was edging a lot today. I came up with stupid excuses, and in so doing fanned the already growing flame. 

Yes, my heart is sad that I felt it best to give in once again to an enemy I knew was not for my good. I have fought this enemy so many times, and I thought I knew the dangers. But alas here I am.

I may have given in and stumbled, but I am not giving up. I am standing back up to face the enemy again, because *I have learned some valuable information in this last successful attack*:

* Loneliness is a trigger for me.
I can now add it to the list of other root triggers such as Stress and Boredom. Discovering this weakness has revealed to me that for so long in my past I have used porn and masturbation to help me through my loneliness (there has been a lot), just as I have done with stress and boredom. The strange thing however is that porn creates loneliness and stress, thus creating a  vicious cycle. I can now address my loneliness head on, now that I know it exists to the point where I have to self-medicate.

* Edging will lead to no good. Ever. 
In this fight, I must... Keep. My. Hands. Off. No excuses. No reasons.

It is my desire that I this post will  motivate you all to continue in your own battle, to see where your own personal weakness lies so you can address them. The last thing I want is for this post to cause one of my fellow soldiers to fall. 

Like I said in the beginning, I am sad, but also excited. I'm sure you all know why I am sad, but I am excited because I am getting back up and applying what I now know of my enemy. Hopefully, my counter will sky rocket, as will my self esteem, and self-love, leaving this failure on earth, but remembering what I have learned from it.

Love you all."

* Academia. The relationship between student and teacher is fraught with temptation - especially when they're your partner's graduate student.

Started off as once a day, into a few times. Then, i'd only stay with friends that would smoke during times i wasn't at school. During summer, i'd smoke all week, then started buying for myself and smoking while i was home too ( Took the dog for a walk 3 times after school, he sure enjoyed that :P). Then i basically only hung out with 2 or 3 friends, talk about life; This is when i felt like i got an extremely analytical view towards life. Every little bit of information i read or saw on a screen was scrutinized. It made me very mature for my age according to the majority of the new people i met between 19 and 21. At 19 i quit college and enrolled in a professional degree in IT. The teacher saw that i was very different than the other in the way i processed information; Not saying i'm a genius, i flunked most of highschool, redoubled grade 8 and graduated with a C average. I was in 426/526 ( level 2?) math and science and excelled with B+ averages up until grade 12, where i failed science so i went into a business program in college ( Passed Cal 1 in my first semester without studying :S). Back to my IT school, i would smoke before class most days, not a single classmate knew unless i told them. After school i'd smoke until 1am most days ( Started class at 1PM). Then, i graduated after a 2 month internship and am now 1 year in at my first corporate job ( I actually really like it...) About 3 or 4 months in, my 1 friend i'd still see regularly got a gf ( No gf at all during these times for me...)Started staying home more often, then...I just stopped answering a lot of calls...ignoring people because i just want to stay home after work. Weekends feel like hours and weeks like a few sleep cycles. My first year at work honestly feels like it was 3 or 4 months at most..I see a friend maybe 2 or 3 times in a month, usually to smoke a joint with, or buy weed from. I stay home, smoke my bong, browse reddit,  jack off and eat after works and on the weekends.

If i quit smoking weed now, i might lose the anxiety,but i won't forget what i learned either, that's what gives my anxiety too...Knowing or trying to figure out things most people don't fathom at all...I can't listen to or talk about music with people, talk about women with the guys ( I'm straight, a virgin, but straight. I've had experiences with girls before, but not for about 3 years because i stopped seeing people groups of friends who include the girls i knew or other i might have met.), movies are meaningless to me...And it feels that it's all people want to talk about, so i avoid that all together.

This is a mix of depression and anxiety from what i feel...The jailing at home is a result from fear of my friends seeing me, knowing i smoke so much weed ( Pretty conservative jewish community; Yes some other friends smoke, but only do it to ""party"")...My personality has changed 10 fold since the time my friends would regularly hang out with me. I'm not the same anymore as a result of weed making think way out the ""box""; Feels like I'm staring at a warehouse with pallets of boxes sometimes. When confronted with anyone or any new place ( I live a very small radius, 2 or 3 KM at most), my heart starts beating, i'm usually high if not at work, so fear of getting caught by cops or seen by someone i know is always there.

So again, i don't want to quit weed because i'm scared that my personality will be the same, that i still won't have any friends and that i'll just get more depressed...I'm very willing to quit, though, i can't seem to think of any possible scenarios i can walk forth to. I have so many options in terms of long term achievements to enroll in such as academics, but those just mark time with barriers where i am not myself. I want to change, but i don't know what to change to, so i don't do anything. I still do my very best at everything i currently do."

After all of that, I decided to take a walk on the wild side (heh) and had sex with multiple people-- lots of FWB situations. No feelings, just fun.


However, I realized around January that the line between what I wanted to do with others and what I felt I had to do was blurring. I felt that I had to go down on a girl, give blow jobs to men, and have sex with both regardless of how I felt. I also realized that I wanted to get into dating (REAL dating) and not just fucking around. So I decided to not have sex (oral, vaginal, anal-- anything that's not making out and heavy petting) before monogamy.


But then this guy who is pretty awesome comes along. We do the whole cutesy holding hands and cuddling thing that I've never done before... Then we make out one night, which leads to another night of heavy making out, and then finally last night where I was like I WANT TO HAVE SEX WITH YOU. But I didn't. Because, at the end of the night, we were post-cuddling and having a conversation about DTR and he said ""wait-- you don't think we're dating, right?"" Me, ""no, friends... with benefits right?"" Sounding relieved, he said ""Yeah, I'm just not looking for a relationship right now.""


Yeah, ouch, whatever, I would like to maybe date him because only three weeks into this I'm really impressed with him. And I like him. However, next week he goes off for the summer for some internship-- we'd be a couple hours away. It makes sense, but naturally (because I am plus size and a little bit insecure) I think it's because of my weight that he does not want to date me-- good enough to fuck around with, but not date. Of course, that's neither here or there.


I would like to know what you all think about the no sex before monogamy thing. If having sex with him before the summer hurts my chances of maybe having something romantic in the fall. I don't want to get stuck in the whole ""why buy the cow (heh) when you get the milk for free"" deal. I don't think he'd think of me less as a person (we've talked about slut shaming, etc.), but I want to present myself as someone to DATE not just FWB it with. Make sense? 

side note: It's only been 3/4 weeks. We get along really well. Conversation flows wonderfully and have been to dinner together and watched a couple of movies-- but nothing like dinner or public since the physical shit started. We've just hung out, and this is not a ""omg he's perfect and I'm in love thing"" at all. I just seem some potential maybe.


---   
**tl;dr**: I like this guy and we've made out three times and I really want to go further. But I'm trying not to do sex before monogamy. He says he's not looking for a relationship right now. I'm interested in a relationship maybe at some point. I really want to have sex with him, but I want to still make myself as ""datable"" and not just ""fuckable."" Would having sex with him in any form make me appear undateable? "

As if to underscore the comment her supple fingers shift, switching positions and ascending from your hip slowly upward, lifting the edge of your shirt slowly as they rise. She is warm behind you, warm and willing and alive with full breasts pressed to your back, pressed tightly enough you can feel her heart beat quicken as her fingers climb.

The perfume is new. It’s always new you realize as a fingernail traces along the skin of your abdomen while a second hand stirs gently on your shoulder. That hand moves ever so slightly as she shifts her balance to kiss then lightly bite your earlobe, a nearly silent moan slipping from behind the soft pink lips teasing your flesh. She’s never worn the same perfume twice, and as she suddenly tenses and removes your shirt and spins you around in a flash of motion you realize you never make love the same way twice, either. 
	
You smile at the realization, the epiphany striking just as your eyes meet. The bright emeralds are alive with mischief, as if she knows what you’re thinking and is ready to prove you right. The lighting is soft, and the only sound is that of her dress falling to the floor to form a puddle of pale silk around her smooth legs. Your eyes travel up her stockings to the delicate garters and whispers of lace that shield the objects of your desire from your view, and she moves under your eye, presenting herself if not actually posing. 
	
Your eyes leave hers, traveling along with her curls down to her full mouth and to the tops of her breasts, slowly rising and falling as a single drop of sweat beads up between the pale, lightly freckled mounds. Her shoulders shift, and her eyes dance along with her breasts as your eyes move down, enjoying her curves, the pierced navel and the tiny panties clinging to her full hips. 
	
Your eyes drift toward the slight damp of her excitement, and the semi-rigid arousal that makes her unlike any other girl you’ve been with extends a bit more, straining against the thin film of French lace, growing to meet your gaze.

1- I’m transgender. Looks like a girl, feels like a girl, still has a penis. Don’t call me shemale or tranny, please and thanks. 

2- I want to get into some detailed and ongoing roleplays, not chats, in interesting settings. I want scene setting and exploring and foreplay and perhaps even character development. If you like stories, let’s play. 

3- I like guys and girls and everything in between but have, almost, ZERO interest in penetrating anyone. Period. 

4- I may have played with some of you in the past before I sort of vanished for reasons I won’t get into. Sorry about that, and don’t take that leave-taking as a reason not to message me. 

5- I prefer quality to quantity and may not respond for hours or even days. I’d like the stories to go on and on and hope to find others who prefer the more pen pal style exchange rather than an erotic chat. I am in bed but plan to be awake for a few hours, but I am hoping more to set things up tonight rather than finish them off if that makes sense. 

6- If you have questions about transwomen I will answer, but I have a strong distaste for the fetish-level curiousity some people exhibit online, so if you have a “OMG Am I gay for liking transwomen and what does that mean about me?!” hangup you want to explore then I am not the gal to chat up. 

In previous posts I presented some sample scenarios. I don’t necessarily want to do these, but this is the kind of thing I’d like to do. I’d love to hear you pitch an idea for a scene or roleplay. 

IDEAS:

We are two friends traveling the world. We were part of a larger group of college students or 30-somethings or whatever, but we did our paperwork by hand and everyone else let the travel agency do theirs. There was some snafu at a border and they couldn't carry on. We'd prepaid, and now it's just you and me on a series of foreign stops. We fall for each other as the trip progresses.

The other is, maybe you'll think it's silly, but about intrigue. I'd like to be spies, or ideally members of a resistance movement in an occupied country. Maybe court members Game of Thrones style. But mainly I'm thinking a sort of Noir' early '40s occupied Paris and beyond. I'm a young German-American girl with a flawless accent and memory sent to help the resistance infiltrate German communications in Paris and if successful, beyond. My local, bodyguard or military escort or teacher spy or fellow German infiltrator or whomever you'd like to be, and I fall for each other.

Another is to be on a boat. I'd prefer something like a research vessel or small yacht tour of an area to something big like a cruise ship. But just an extended dynamic at sea. Whether that's coworkers on a small but cozy research boat or teacher and student on an internship class studying Greek mythology on the Mediterranean or whatever or even performers on a luxury cruise ship... It's all groovy, just as long as we are on a boat and its warm.

Fourthly, we are on-air TV journalists at rival networks in a big market, New York, LA, Chicago or the like. We are seated at the same table at an annual awards banquet. The table is empty except us due to a series of events that don’t matter, and we hit it off and sleep together. This kicks off a very carefully kept secret romance. We aren’t rivals, but our stations are and our job is to beat the competition.

You are a world renowned actor/actress rock star or something similar, and since you are hopelessly disorganized and far too famous for details, you have a personal assistant follow you everywhere. I am reserved and shy but beautiful, and eventually you decide to pursue me, try to warm up the cool, professional exterior.

But I still did it anyways because I'm the big boss man!,dr1nfinite,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/24rccf/hackers_4_accounting_told_me_lighting_piles_of/,"I am one tech of many in a sea of users. There are many places where skills overlap, inefficiencies occur, and blame is difficult to determine. Perhaps once in a life time, a tech will be able to irrefutably place blame on a user. My once in a lifetime event happened somewhat recently.

&gt;Boss's boss's boss (Or BBB): Dr1nfinite, we have our bandwidth being maxed out on location, all of our information is going to a chinese IP address.

&gt;Me: WHAT!? I'm on my way.

At this point I hop in to my car and get on the phone with a few of my older, more experience tech friends and ask them all to come out to my office. As its a weekend, some of them are not happy, but agree when I tell them what happened. When I arrive, BBB is waiting outside.

&gt;Me: When did this start? How much did we lose?

&gt;BBB: I don't know when it started, there were no alerts. One of our interns was watching the traffic and noticed it was already going nuts. We don't know how much we lost *because it's still happening*.

&gt;Me: Are you kidding me? You didn't unplug the servers?

&gt;BBB: We can't afford the website going down, we'd lose trust with our customers.

&gt;Me: I actually can't deal with you right now.

One of my friends arrive at this point, and I explain this person is a security expert who works for a reputable company that's coming to help. When we get inside, the first thing I do is try to get to our specialized intrusion detection system machine. An overpowered workstation that dictates traffic and runs an enormous amount of custom scripts. Beside it should be an intrusion prevention machine, another overpowered workstation that should be our traffic watch dog. Except, that machine is missing and our IDS box is turned off.

&gt;BBB: Is something wrong?

&gt;Me: Someone stole our IPS box and turned off our IDS box. Whatever is happening is definitely internal. Someone \*\*\*\*ed us and \*\*\*\*ed us hard. Honestly, please turn off the servers. If they have an open connection to our computers they can delete practically everything and take us offline for days or weeks.

&gt;BBB: You stupid IT people, how could you let this happen? 

&gt;Me: I actually can't deal with you still. As well, this guy is just getting introduced to our situation and couldn't have been part of this.

&gt;BBB: How do we know? You said this was an inside job! What if it was you?

&gt;Me: I'm trying to fix this. Excuse me but I have to call the police about the missing machine here.

&gt;BBB: Wait! The machine isn't missing, its in my office. Don't call the police, I own these computers anyways, I can't steal them.

&gt;Me: I seriously can't believe you right now. Prove it.

After a short walk and a bit more explaining of the IT situation to my friend in the elevator, we make it to the BBB office. The machine is inexplicably on his desk, cords going no where.

&gt;Me: Why is that there?

&gt;BBB: I wasn't able to recieve a dot ek-zee in a zip file, and I asked one of our techs why I couldn't. He said its your custom stuff that locks me down. I am starting to think I might have made a tiny mistake here if this is actually related to the hackers.

&gt;Friend: HAHAHAHAHA! Oh my God are you serious?

&gt;BBB (Still angry): What exactly are you contributing here?

&gt;Me: The joke here is that its not 'related'. It's entirely your fault. If that machine is turned off, all our techs get sent messages instantly because its so important for that to be up 100% of the time. You unplugged the machine that sends those messages before taking this box to your room. 

&gt;BBB: How much are you going to charge me for you not putting this in the documentation?

&gt;Me: Look, I'm just going to handle this myself. We don't have to hire any security company. Let's just bring that computer down and see if the traffic to China stops.

&gt;Friend: This is going to be a mistake.

&gt;BBB: Good. Get working, and fix the documentation when you're done.

After another elevator trip with the machine in hand, I just had to think about how BBB functions as a human being. I showed my friend out the door after plugging everything back in. I took a look at the outgoing traffic after everything booted back up and took out my phone.

&gt;Phone: Police Cyber Crime Division, if this is an emergency hang up and call 911. How may I take your call?

&gt;Me: I have a situation..."

My internship starts on Thursday and I'm going to live together with my workmate in another city.
I'm a bit anxious... for the first time I will live on my own. Apart from doing daily duties all alone, I also have to be responsive to my colleague.

This may sound whiny to some of you but this whole new situation really burdens me.

Please pray, that I am able to put the Lord first during this time, because He is more important than 1000 of internships. Please pray, that He will stand on my side, because I feel so weak right now, I will fail on my own.

I hope, that I can be a good friend for my co-worker and that he won't get sick of me. I hope, that I will do a good job. Please pray, that I may not be proud of myself if everything goes well, but give God the glory.

But even if I fail hard and everyone is going to hate me, it's ok as long as I don't lose God. So out of all requests, please pray, that my Lord may guide me and that I stay on His path, because I want to love him and feel so distant from Him right now...

As if to underscore the comment her supple fingers shift, switching positions and ascending from your hip slowly upward, lifting the edge of your shirt slowly as they rise. She is warm behind you, warm and willing and alive with full breasts pressed to your back, pressed tightly enough you can feel her heart beat quicken as her fingers climb.

The perfume is new. It’s always new you realize as a fingernail traces along the skin of your abdomen while a second hand stirs gently on your shoulder. That hand moves ever so slightly as she shifts her balance to kiss then lightly bite your earlobe, a nearly silent moan slipping from behind the soft pink lips teasing your flesh. She’s never worn the same perfume twice, and as she suddenly tenses and removes your shirt and spins you around in a flash of motion you realize you never make love the same way twice, either.

You smile at the realization, the epiphany striking just as your eyes meet. The bright emeralds are alive with mischief, as if she knows what you’re thinking and is ready to prove you right. The lighting is soft, and the only sound is that of her dress falling to the floor to form a puddle of pale silk around her smooth legs. Your eyes travel up her stockings to the delicate garters and whispers of lace that shield the objects of your desire from your view, and she moves under your eye, presenting herself if not actually posing.

Your eyes leave hers, traveling along with her curls down to her full mouth and to the tops of her breasts, slowly rising and falling as a single drop of sweat beads up between the pale, lightly freckled mounds. Her shoulders shift, and her eyes dance along with her breasts as your eyes move down, enjoying her curves, the pierced navel and the tiny panties clinging to her full hips.

24s9g9,582,2014-05-05,Has anyone else found university thoroughly disappointing and almost a step-backwards in life?,Fwub,unitedkingdom,https://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/24s9g9/has_anyone_else_found_university_thoroughly/,"I'd like to preface this message by saying I am a first year student at a top 20 UK university, currently studying a course involving computing and business. These are my experiences but I know these incidents are not isolated to my university or course. 

I would like to give you a somewhat brief summary of the nitty gritty of what has happened to me this year at university, and explain why I've been left with a sour taste in my mouth. 

Maybe it can help a few of you influence your decisions and future choices, or just give you an excuse to rant with me.

**Accomodation**


* Today, somebody just **pissed up the wall** outside my block after exclaiming, 'ha, he's doing work' whilst walking past my window.
* Near enough every Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday night I get **woken up** by drunk people **screaming** outside my window at **2,3,4 o'clock in the morning**. I've had to **buy earplugs**.
* **Food goes missing** out my cupboard regularly. My squash drank itself. I had one drink out of it and then it just mysteriously gradually evaporated. Should've filled it with laxatives.
* Somebody **cracked the fridge** slightly at the bottom. **Cosmetic damage only**. It was still fully functional. A **new fridge** was bought. We were **each charged £21** for the replacement. I knew nothing of the damage until an email about the charge came through.
* The **new fridge didn't even have a freezer** compartment. I complained. **One and a half months later** we got a fridge-freezer. I looked up the model number. Found it for sale by John Lewis. Worked out we were **over charged by £50** on this price.
* Somebody else managed to smoke out the whole block - all 3 floors - by **leaving garlic bread in the microwave for 15 mins** on a microwave setting instead of oven setting.
* I'm catered 5 days a week. **I don't have an oven** for the weekend. 
* Catered menu consists of about **20 dishes** for the whole year.
* Someone **broke down their door with a hockey stick** as they were drunk and couldn't get in to it.
* **Common room was smashed to pieces one night,** broken glass everywhere, walls damaged, pool table ruined.
* Common room damage was done by people living in the same halls.
* Had to pay out another **£20 in damages for things I had no knowledge of** as someone kicked the toilet door, and damaged surface in the kitchen.

There are many more incidents that I've had the pleasure of witnessing, but that's enough to get started on. Now for the lectures, teaching and pricing... Jesus, this really makes me annoyed.

**Teaching**

* £9000 split between 2 semesters, with 12 weeks in each, and around 13 lectures each week lasting 50 minutes each equates to **£34.62 per hour of teaching.** 
* One module this year consisted of **95% GCSE maths**. I'm talking y=mx+c kind of stuff. It's a joke. Having achieved a - by no means special - B grade in A-level Maths I found this unbelievably trivial. So trivial in fact that **I gave the first couple of worksheets to my niece in Year 9 who could do them without difficulty**. 
* I must have **answered at least 95/100 questions correctly** in 'tutorials' for this subject and **answered many in-class questions**, as well as did **way over my fair share of group work**... **I got 63/100 for the tutorials**. I enquired as to why. I got a meeting with the head of the module. He said according to my tutor I hadn't answered all the questions. I had. He asked if I could prove it, assuming I hadn't kept all the work. I had kept all my work. I showed him. He remarked it. **Bumped it up to 70/100**. Said nothing more could be done as **other marks were due to 'in class contributions'** which couldn't be remarked. 
* **Peers with other tutors** who had come to me for help numerous times got **80-90/100** on this coursework.
* I got 92% on the actual proper test as if that's any consolation.
* Other subjects include **programming**, taught by a **lecturer** who is **so inanimate and robotic it is impossible to follow him**. I'm sorry, I've had bad teachers in the past, but this is beyond a joke. After researching the material after the useless lectures **I could turn around and teach them better than him.** In fact, **as a group we often had to go and learn everything off YouTube ourselves** and teach ourselves and each other. 
* **Awful teaching is passed off with the excuse that, 'you should be doing independent learning'**, yet they provide no resources except for textbooks with no illustrations or anything of even the slightest hint of engagement or excitement. These books are quite frankly, **shit**.
* **Lecturers often plug their own books** which **cost £40+** and are no use anyway.
* **The programming coursework was nigh on impossible given the teaching we had been given.** The only way our class scraped through was via the help of a student who had done this stuff in his spare time for the past 3 years and could give advice as to what to do. **Teachers weren't allowed to assist** in this coursework. **No unmarked related practice work was given previous to this coursework.** We were literally thrown in at the deep end with no help available.
* We had a Chinese lecturer who's **English was so bad that 80% of the class left halfway** **through** due to a lack of understanding of what she was saying. 
* Had a **computing lecturer who's demos failed near enough every week** and had to be **corrected by the class**. In one class **I even solved a problem** after the teacher was scratching his head for 30 seconds looking at the code. **I am utterly shit at programming** and don't even know what I'm doing and still managed to do this.

These are just isolated incidents, and there are many more, but this is getting long-winded by now so I'll leave it at that. 

Besides, I've got to go and revise for my tests now and make sure I get my £27,000 certificate that says, 'yep, he can do stuff that he could do at the end of sixth form anyway', at the end of this joke that is a university education.

Any incidents or comments regarding your university experiences would be much appreciated, thanks.

**TL;DR My university is overpriced, full of drunk idiots who are costing me money and keeping me up at night, and it isn't teaching me anything I couldn't learn for free anyway at a much faster rate online from YouTube.**

 EDIT: This is really blowing up. Thanks for all the comments. As a thank you, here's a couple of pics of the fridge that needed replacing. [WARNING: Very badly damaged fridge pics inside NSFW.](http://imgur.com/a/nmCdS)

EDIT2: Someone just smashed a bottle of beer off a lampost outside my window putting glass on the grass as some bank holiday party thing is going on on the green behind my block. Fuck me, this is a joke. 

EDIT3: There are some absolutely amazing responses in this thread and I've learnt a fair bit today about what I need to do to make it all worthwhile. Now I've got my angry rant out the way, here's an amalgamation of what others have taught me today: 

**Top Tips**

* Regarding accommodation, it's a lottery. Some halls are quiet, some are rowdy. It's down to chance what hand you get dealt, just make the most of it and try and be as care-free as possible. There is pretty much sod all you can do about it for the first year... Just find some like-minded mates and make it to your second year intact!

* The library is infinitely better to revise in than your room. I personally need to get off my lazy arse, make the walk to it and get my work done. 3 hours in the library smashing out work is better than 12 hours half working, half redditing and half getting distracted by flat-mates and neighbours. 

* Lecturers may appear half-arsed and crappy at face value, but that's because they have a lot more on their plate than what meets the eye. I had no idea they were so involved in research and PHD studies previous to this thread, so before you get angry at their piss poor performance send them some emails and ask for help... If they still aren't any good, then you can be angry.

* Do something worthwhile in your spare time that you can slap on a CV at the end of it all and be proud of. The amount of time off is ridiculous so learn a hobby, partake in sports, internships, clubs, societies, instruments, languages, whatever, just go for it. Be purposeful!
* If you do something related to the field of work you want to work in then that's even better!
* If you get totally fed up of work, revision and halls then just make a revision thread bitching about university and post it on Reddit. It'll sort you out and put you right back on track. ;)

Advantages:
1)I have a B.S. in Psychology (I graduated with honors)
2)I have experience working with my mother who is schizophrenic.

Disadvantages:
1)Well, I will start with the largest impediment to finding employment. I have a DWI.  I hold myself fully accountable for this selfish, ignorant action. Did I deserve the large fine, loss of license, time in jail? Do I deserve my current struggle to find a job? I would say definitely to both.  I have made significant changes in my life since then, and at some point I would like a second chance.
2)I never have had an internship.  I applied for a few in college but didn't end up in any.
3)With my resume consisting largely of food service experience it's tough to get my foot in the door anywhere.

I would appreciate any direction as to where I should be applying. I would love to work in the mental health field, whether it's in a group home or even for a non-profit. My passion is in this field.  But at this point, I am willing to do anything that pays more money (besides a call center).  I know I have made mistakes in my life, believe me I live with the guilt (sometimes I hope that I don't wake up at all), but at some point I would like to come back from my current situation.  Anyways, I didn't mean to be so long-winded. Any feedback or direction you all can give me is appreciated. Thank you for your time."

A little bit of background:  I started smoking at roughly 13 years old and continued until roughly 21 years old until I quit using Chantix.  I picked the habit back up a couple years ago for a few months until I realized what the hell I was doing and immediately quit again. I have been analog free since.  

November 2013: I was in the last semester of my undergrad and found out my mother was receiving biopsies over a cancer scare. Also, I found out my dog I received for my 10 birthday had cancer.  And, on the same day I found out my grandmother had cancer from smoking her whole life.  We ended up giving my dog some unconventional methods in which prolonged his life as he was quickly deteriorating.  He his doing better now but by no means is he going to be around much longer. 

December 2013: I graduate Magna Cum Laude from a private business school in Finance and Economics.  I was working full time throughout my schooling and was trying to get an offer put together from my employer.  Our CEO was working my position into the budget but we were waiting on some funding that was overdue.  

I loved my job.  In December 2012, I was selected for a program through my school that sponsors my internship and places me into a position in a company that I share great passion for.  This is only given to one student and is an incredible honor if selected; truly great news.  I ended up being hired as a contractor by the company in May 2013 at a reduced salary until I graduated in December 2013. 

January 2014: My grandmother dies.  I still have yet to receive my offer for employment. 

February 2014: My best friend and neighbor since the day I was born is killed in such a horrific manner I cannot seem to grasp it to this day.  He and I started smoking together in our youth. This is a continuing matter that really isn't getting any easier. 

A few days beforehand I bought my father a simple ego setup after a ton of research (reddit, online non-biased periodicals) to try and rid his habit. I wanted to smoke. I wanted to smoke so badly I tried smoking again and was horrified by the first hit.  I still wanted to smoke though.  I remembered the setup I just bought my father and was awaiting his arrival from being out of town.  I filled it up with now what is horrendous juice and started vaping.  I loved it! I knew I wouldn't smoke again using this device. 

March 2014:  Funding hasn't come through and, in fact, we're informed the funding is not the amount needed.  Also, the funds that were being used to compensate me have dried up.  I'm let go.  

April 2014:  My fiance and I's dog died in our arms.  He was originally my fiance's dog when we met and became our dog as we have been together for 10 years.  He was the most loyal and caring animal and anyone who knew him is deeply saddened.  He literally made a point to get up multiple times and check on everyone in their sleep during the night. All he cared about was his family and I miss him so much. 

Here I am hitting the job market; never had so much time on my hands in my life. I have experienced multiple setbacks, emotionally and professionally, many times over the course of a few months, but I am not smoking again thanks to vaping.  I dropped my nic strength down from 18mg to 6mg and I am looking to upgrade to a mod [I have been hitting the classifieds to purchase a used mod setup (currently have PT2 mini and multiple egos) and I thought about picking up everything for a new mod setup but that wouldn't be financially responsible at this time.]    

Thanks for all your advice as I have yet to contribute to this community. Over the last few months I have been lurking and learning off other people's contributions and I have learned so much from this community's knowledge that I cannot possibly show my gratitude in the appropriate manner. 

TL:DR Vaping saved me from picking up smoking while experiencing the most horrifying and tragic events of my life to date. Thanks to this great community for all the knowledge I have gained.

1320 E. Hall St. Tempe 85281
 
I'm a sophomore at ASU studying in Iceland over the summer and need someone to fill my room for the last few months of my lease! I'm looking for someone for the months of the rest of May, June, and July. I am pretty much all moved out and you would be able to move it right away. The house is very close to campus and just off the light rail station. It has a beautiful backyard with a garden, chickens, and a bunch of fruit trees. My room is normal size painted light gray with a built-in dresser and a walk-in closet. 

I am very very desperate to find someone right now so please don't hesitate to call, text, or email with questions!

If you are a student looking to stay in Tempe over the summer for a job or internship, I did the same thing last year and I loved it! If you just want to live in Tempe over the summer, this would still be an awesome opportunity to get a taste of the city without signing a year lease. Right now I'm offering $400 a month plus utilities, which is average for a room so close to campus. 

There will be two roommates and if you are interested, you can certainly meet them and check out the place. Let me know if you have any questions or want to schedule a visit!

24sn4h,2,2014-05-05,I (F/20) have a new moral philosophy of no sex before monogamy-- does it really even matter?,throwaway4stupidq,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/24sn4h/i_f20_have_a_new_moral_philosophy_of_no_sex/,"Okay, so I went through a bad break up in July that ended in being stalked and lots of crazy court stuff (that's another story). After all of that, I decided to take a walk on the wild side (heh) and had sex with multiple people-- lots of FWB situations. No feelings, just fun.

However, I realized around January that the line between what I wanted to do with others and what I felt I had to do was blurring. I felt that I had to go down on a girl, give blow jobs to men, and have sex with both regardless of how I felt. I also realized that I wanted to get into dating (REAL dating) and not just fucking around. So I decided to not have sex (oral, vaginal, anal-- anything that's not making out and heavy petting) before monogamy. 

I meet this guy a couple of weeks ago and we hit it off. We do the whole cutesy holding hands and cuddling thing that I've never done before... Then we make out one night, which leads to another night of heavy making out, and then finally last night where I was like I WANT TO HAVE SEX WITH YOU. But I didn't. Because, at the end of the night, we were post-cuddling and having a conversation about DTR and he said ""wait-- you don't think we're dating, right?"" Me, ""no, friends... with benefits right?"" Sounding relieved, he said ""Yeah, I'm just not looking for a relationship right now."" I now recognize that I should have been upfront about wanting to not just be FWB, but what's done is done now. Also, he could just not be into me for a relationship. Totally cool, but I was really confused because most FWB Iv'e been in are not cuddling and kissing goodbye type of deals.

But his response makes sense, as in a week he goes off for the summer for some internship a couple hours away. We spoke briefly about seeing each other over the summer, but ideally I'd like to see where things go in the fall and possibly open the old doors of dating. But I'm worried that since the FWB status has already been established, he probably won't think of me in any other way.

**I would like to know what you all think about the no sex before monogamy thing. If having sex with him before the summer hurts my chances of maybe having something romantic in the fall. I don't want to get stuck in the whole ""why buy the cow (heh) when you get the milk for free"" deal. I don't think he'd think of me less as a person (we've talked a lot about slut shaming, etc.), but I want to present myself as someone to DATE not just FWB it with. Make sense? **

*I am using this situation as a way to receive feedback on this new ""moral philosophy."" Sure, I'd like to date the guy, but obviously that's not happening right now.*

side note: Conversation flows wonderfully, natural chemistry, and have been to dinner together and watched a couple of movies-- but nothing like dinner or public since the physical stuff started.


---   
**tl;dr**: I like this guy and we've made out three times and I really want to go further. But I'm trying not to do sex before monogamy in order to become more dateable and less FWB-able. He says he's not looking for a relationship right now, which I respect and understand. I'd like to possibly think about a relationship with him in the fall if things go well. I really want to have sex with him now tho, but I want to still make myself as ""datable"" and not just ""fuckable."" What do you think about the ""no sex before monogamy"" deal?

24snc4,3,2014-05-05,I [25 M] am thinking about breaking up with my girlfriend [22 F] of 1.5 years. Am I thinking rationally?,fullofunknown,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/24snc4/i_25_m_am_thinking_about_breaking_up_with_my/,"This will be slightly lengthy, so please try to read it all (or most) to understand. 


In June of 2012 I began talking to a friend (female) that I met at my best bud's birthday party in January of that year. At the time of meeting her I had a girlfriend. I didn't pursue any action at the time, nor did she push anything on to me. I did find out later that she found me attractive right away and was disappointed that I was in a relationship. In June we started hanging out more and more. Now I just came out of a relationship in May, so I was trying to keep my distance and be careful. We dated for 6 months before I asked her out. At the time, that was the longest I'd ever waited to do that. I had a good time with her up until about the ending of summer 2013. I was moving away for university and she was too (although not as far). Let's just say we're almost on opposite sides of the state now and it's about an 11 hour drive. During the time I was moving we had a talk where I thought things would end between us. I decided prior, because of my own experiences, that I did not want to try a LDR any more. I agreed to doing a LDR with her though.


Fast forward to today. This semester of school is coming to a close. The first year wasn't horrible, but it has definitely taken it's toll. We've seen each other a few times over the course of the school year. She's stayed with me and I've gone and stayed with her too. Here's the thing. The relationship is fun and I enjoy it when I'm with her. When we're apart, things aren't so hot. I've started to dislike talking to her each day because I never feel like I have anything to talk about and I feel emotionless towards her. I want to spend time with her over the summer, but I also want to stay where I live and enjoy things here and spend time with my family and friends. I'm feeling pressured about how I can split the summer up to spend time with everyone. I feel like she misses me a lot more than I miss her. I feel guilty because I'm constantly attracted to other females on my campus and where I live. I feel like if I was truly happy, I wouldn't really think twice about that stuff. 


The other thing is that I have a really, really difficult time opening up to her. Something about her personality and the way she displays herself is a turn-off. What I mean is her mannerisms on the phone or over video chat. Even text messages can be total freaking bitch mode to me. It just seems like she doesn't laugh and joke about things like I do, which make conversation fun. It just doesn't flow with her, more times than not. It's gotten to the point where I don't like talking to her because of it. I don't have any fun. I don't open up to her. I have other friends I'll share stuff with, or even other female friends and when I share things with them it's like I'm having an interactive conversation with someone. It's nice. 


Recently (via video chat) she asked me if I was going to sleep in the next day and I said, ""I'm not sure. I'll probably sleep till 9am or 10am."" I leave it at that, like I do with all my friends and anyone I speak to. She replies with, ""So... that's a yes..."" It's not so much WHAT she said, but the WAY she says it and I've brought this up before. Or she'll tell me she's watching a show and enjoying it and I playfully say, ""You should watch two more seasons! :P"" She'll reply with, ""I have a life."" At the time she was doing homework so I joked and said, ""Babe, staying in your room all day doing homework =/= having a life."" And she will come back with, ""Yes."" It just makes me feel like shit. I've never had an issue with someone like this. 


I think we'll end up wanting to live two different places post-graduation. She'll want to move in or at least live in the same city together. Currently there's no way in hell I would move in. I think it would be crazy. I don't feel like I was able to spend enough time with her before we moved to even make a judgement call on that, not to mention all these issues I'm feeling with distance. I want to apply for internships over the summer and stuff and I'll feel guilty if I were to get one and wouldn't be able to visit over the summer. She'd be very upset and I feel like it's preventing me from doing that (even though I know we'd both agree it's fantastic for our career futures).


We don't share the same religion/spirituality (Catholic vs agnostic). She always has something to say about the food I cook myself too and it's really starting to get on my nerves now. If I cook anything with some oil, butter, eat a cookie, ANYTHING remotely sugary, fattening, or anything along those lines and I get a ""That's not healthy."" I'm just sick of it. Seems like ALL the little things are getting to me now, all the time. Am I overreacting and should I not ""sweat the small stuff?"" 


Time to wrap this up. I've been feeling this way on and off for months and I'm really thinking that things just aren't going to work out and it's a flame being smothered. I'm the one letting go and she's holding on, clueless. She's got a nice family, they like me, my family likes her and she likes my family, my friends like her and her friends like me. It's positive from the outside I suppose. And then in the back of my mind I worry that I'm feeling this way just because of the distance or maybe I'm paranoid and depressed and it's affecting the relationship. I don't know. I just want some advice and to see what you guys think. 

   
**TL;DR:** Thinking about breaking up with LDR GF because she's driving me crazy with... her personality I suppose. Maybe what we want is too different? "
24soad,7,2014-05-05,"Me [27F] with my boyfriend [29M] of 2 mos, didn't want to bail him out of jail",yeahwtf,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/24soad/me_27f_with_my_boyfriend_29m_of_2_mos_didnt_want/,"TL;DR -- New boyfriend has a bunch of crazy shit happen and needs me a lot over a short period of time. He moves in with me during his finals, supporting him feels like a bit much for me to handle. Matters come to a head when he frantically calls me thinking he's about to be arrested and wanting me to bail him out, we fight over my refusal. I basically kick him out, haven't really communicated since. Can we work this out when he's done with finals?
___________________________________________________

**EDIT: Thanks everyone for your comments, seems like there's a consensus. So he texted me after his final asking if he ""should put himself back on a website."" I called him and we had a talk in which I told him that I really care about him, but that the past week had taken a toll on my well-being and I wasn't sure I could handle him having a pattern of such incidents. He said that he felt that I had judged him unfairly, hadn't taken his side, and had led him on to believe that we had a relationship we didn't have per my reluctance to bail him out.**

**I then reminded him that we have only known each other for two months, and he said that he would be willing to put up bail money for a total stranger if someone was in need.**

**I wished him luck with that and told him I felt we weren't compatible, and he agreed. Guess that's the end.**

We met online in early March and hit it off pretty quickly. Neither of us had had much in the way of sex or relationships for a while, so we were stoked to have found each other. Intellectual chemistry was great, sexual chemistry was off the charts. He is in law school and seemed to be going in a good direction, so that was a bonus.

As things progressed, I saw several warning signs that I chose to ignore at the time. After all, I've had a somewhat crazy life myself and like to be with people who have had their own weird experiences. I should add that at this point, though, that I have my shit together and don't depend on anyone.

Basically, the warning signs were these: He's paranoid with super high anxiety and pretty much addicted to pot, which makes him feel better in the short run but seems to worsen his anxiety overall. He has some rather out-there schemes and theories. His life pattern involves friends going psycho on him and housing situations falling apart (will be relevant later).

Also, he kept mentioning how he likes the aspect of a relationship where people help each other out with major stuff. He half-jokingly asked me to do his laundry and grocery shopping, which I shut down, and he did coax me into helping him prepare for his finals. Maybe I am the one who is too reserved about this stuff - I've been used before and am really wary about it happening again, possibly too much so. He said he would always be willing to help me out in similar ways.

So all these signs had been cropping up, and I had been rather concerned but still loved being with him. About 9 days ago, things started coming to a head. He was going through finals then and is still in the middle of them - they're spread out over a few weeks - so he's been understandably stressed. He wants to transfer schools, so his grades are VERY important.

Nine days ago, we had hung out in the morning. I then went to work and got a series of frantic texts from him in the afternoon saying that his roommate had hacked into his email and sent out a threatening message. He and his roommate had mostly been friendly, but the roommate sounded a bit crazy and they had recently gotten into a dispute.

He needed a place to stay, so I offered him to stay with me and he accepted.

Over the next several days, I began to have more and more doubts. There was a totally weird situation where he asked me and a campus police officer to go with him back to his room so that he could retrieve his stuff - he was afraid his roommate would be there and start something/accuse him of stealing, and I felt that was really paranoid. Maybe I'm wrong though.

Also, he needed a ton of emotional support during this time. I'm a fairly reserved person and this was draining on me. However, I am willing to accept that this is probably my issue and that I need to work on being able to support a partner during a crisis.

About five days into him staying with me, we had a talk about him finding a hotel room for the next night - he said that he was totally willing to do that, but then he checked his bank balance and found that he only had about $600 left to pay for a hotel for about ten more days until his roommate would move out and he could move back into his room. I offered to have him stay with us if he chipped in on my roommate's portion of the rent and if she was cool with that, but I honestly wasn't really feeling it. Luckily, his best friend called during this conversation and offered to loan him money for the hotel room.

The next day, he had left and I was at home. I got a frantic call at around 4 pm in which he told me that the police wanted to speak to him right away and he was afraid they would arrest him. He needed two things from me: 1) to corroborate his story, and 2) to bail him out of jail if necessary, since he couldn't be there with more finals coming up.

Reddit, this is where I freaked out. In retrospect, I suppose I can understand why he was afraid, since he's been arrested before for weed. However, this totally came out of left field, and I definitely didn't handle it well - started yelling ""What the fuck!?"" and stuff like that. Mostly that was a response to him asking me to bail him out. I really did not want to post his bail and asked him to ask his mom or his best friend to do it. He said that whoever bailed him out needed to be there in person (which still puzzles me) and offered to give me money to do it; however, as mentioned above, he is totally broke and I was estimating that I would be liable for a lot of money if he missed his court date.

I started getting ready to leave and talk to the cops with him. Honestly, I knew then and now that I would probably end up bailing him out if it came to that, but I really wasn't happy about it.

He then texted me back saying that it was a false alarm - the police had asked him if he wanted to press charges. I was pissed at this point and texted back asking if he had found a hotel room for that night. We then talked on the phone and he informed me that he had not found one and had not talked to his friend who offered to pay for it. At this point, I was still pissy/abrupt and he told me he thought I was being really rude to him, and then he said that even though the bail thing had been a false alarm, he felt that it was an excellent test.

I again told him he needed to find a hotel room and that I was retracting my offer to have him keep staying with us. The conversation ended on a pretty sour note.

He came by that evening and packed up his things. We were both civil the whole time, didn't really talk about what had happened. Apparently his friend did end up paying for his hotel room. It seemed to me like we were done, but he mentioned something that indicated otherwise: We had talked before about him renting out his place as an Air BnB during the summer, staying at my house and giving me a cut of the proceeds. As far as I know, he doesn't have anywhere else to stay if he rents out his place, but he brought up renting out his place as something he definitely still planned to do.

When he left, it was Thursday night; it's now Monday and he has not contacted me. I know he has another final today and one Friday. I only reached out to him one time - I was looking at internships for myself and found one that would be right up his alley for summer, so I sent him the link.

**After all that, my question is this: Should I view that as a bunch of craziness at the wrong time in a new relationship and try to patch things up once he's done with finals?**

Also, I'm not sure what I should be doing right now. Should I leave him alone, or should I reach out? I am thinking about him taking his final today and want to send him a text later asking him how it went.

I mean, I am sure that his version puts me in a pretty bad light too. Girlfriend emotionally distant during a turbulent time, makes him move out during finals, and is willing to consider leaving him in jail over the weekend before an important exam. I can see how he would feel betrayed. We both could have handled things better.

I should also mention that I have a history of my mom asking me for large sums of money (a couple grand at a time) in very similar ways - the phone call out of the blue, the sudden financial demand, the refusal to understand that I'm not made of money and this really stretches me. When I got the call from him, it triggered all those memories and scared the shit out of me. Perhaps it was unfair, as rationally I know he's not her.

My friends have been telling me to run (by the way, some of them are redditors, hello to you guys if you ended up reading this). But I'm sure that his friends are equally on his side. I'm hoping to get a less biased opinion, which is admittedly hard when you're only hearing one side of the story. Is this salvageable or should I move on?"

24srhr,15,2014-05-05,internship vs research?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/24srhr/internship_vs_research/,"I'm currently a junior CS major and I'm having trouble deciding what to do over the summer. I have two options: I could either spend the summer doing an internship or I could do research with a professor. The internship requires me to learn ruby on rails and git by June 1st, is unpaid, and I have to put 20-30 hours a week in. The research is for an internet radio website and we're using the standard web technologies like HTML, Javascript, CSS etc., I make my own hours, and I do get part time pay. 

My main question is will the internship look better than research on a resume? It may be a stupid question, but I've always heard that unless you get an internship, you won't get a job. No one ever mentions research and frankly, I would rather do the research with my professor because he is actually paying me and I'm more interested in the technologies he's using rather than Rails, which is what the internship is using.

I already accepted the internship, but he's not paying me and there was no contract or anything signed, so I want to back out to spend time on the internet radio research and have more time for personal projects as well. Is this a bad idea? Can anyone tell me what they think about research vs an internship on a resume?"

I obtained an internship in January (I'm a junior at a university) at a startup as a web developer. It only paid $7.50 an hour as a contractor, but I was like, whatever-- I wanted to learn web dev, and this seemed like a fun opportunity.

It wasn't a bad time, but I didn't learn as much as I wanted to. Granted, I only worked about 20 hours a week due to class. 


Now, I'm about to work ~35~40 hours a week, and I'm about to get paid an X amount a month, but when i calculate that X amount, I get less than $7 an hour....


Is this fair? I'm going to talk with my boss relatively soon. I understand this is a start up and they did say you won't get paid as much, but I didn't except under minimum wage. I get that I'm a 'contractor' but still..


EDIT: New question... do Contractors need a ""2 week notice"" as well?


EDIT2: If I do quit, I want another web dev job. If I can't get one, would it still be smarter to quit and take a retail job for the summer? I'm still a student and was using this as ""internship experience"" but yeah.."

I know my bleak world and I can talk about that, but no cool personal stories to add.  I can ask some fantastic questions, however.  My questions are the only thing keeping the conversation going.  One day, I fear that my partner will realize this and leave me because I am too boring.  

My brain is constantly going, continuously churning with fears.  I am not good enough. I am not thin enough.  I am not smart enough.  I have nothing to add.  I have no hope.  I have no dreams.  I am a hollow body filled with a rapidly shriveling brain. When I do work up the courage to change my life, my brain strongly advises me to stop while I am ahead.  I feel like I am fighting a war with myself on a daily basis.  No one wins, but everyone suffers.  It is a pointless battle that is slowly killing me.  I do not see the point in living.  I often think about what it would be like to no longer be alive, but I do not actually want to kill myself.  Perhaps because deep down inside, somewhere in the corner of my brain, I think that things might get better.   If I lose weight, I will feel better.  If my acne cleared up, I would feel better.  If I had more experiences that would yield better conversation, if I had whiter teeth, if I tried harder, it would all magically disappear and I would be happy. I don’t even know what happy means. 

I don’t even know what would make me happy.  People ask me all of the time what I like to do for fun, what hobbies I engage in, etc.  I honestly don’t have an answer for them.  For the longest time, it was school.  But I cannot use that excuse any more.  I try to have fun and be happy by all the wrong ways.  One thing that has been killing me is my relationship.  I’ve never experienced such a strong duality of feelings before.  My partner and I have been dating for almost an entire month now, but it feels like so much longer.  From the moment we met, I was instantly attracted to him.  I knew without a doubt that I wanted to be with him.  I’ve never felt that way about anyone or anything.  He makes me feel incredibly loved, and when we are together, my anxieties and depression subside… that is until conversation arises.  Conversation is brutally painful and I hate every moment of it.  He talks about his craft with such conviction, passion, and dedication and it makes me sick to my stomach.  He can go on about how his line of work is extremely detail oriented, how much he knows about it, and how he wants to progress with it in the future.  I am bothered by all of this information for many reasons.  I am extremely jealous, almost to the point of pain, that he has found something that he loves, that he cares for, and that he is able to be extremely good at.  I hate that he found that and I haven’t.  I hate that he loves something so much and I know nothing about it.  When he talks about his line of work, I sit there like a dumb idiot nodding my head and trying to get by with my questions.  I have nothing to add to what he does, conversation wise.  I’ve contemplated doing research about his work so that way I can know more and eventually, add more value to the conversation and myself.  When I think about researching what he does, an immense wave of anxiety creeps over me and I get scared.  I’m scared that I will never be able to remember anything. I’m scared that I will research the wrong things.  Scared that if I do research it and bring it up in conversation, he’ll think I’m one of those needy and clingy girls who are only interested in what their boyfriend is interested in.  I don’t want to be that, but that’s what I feel like I am doing. I desperately long to have a passion of my own.  I want to be heard.  I want to add things.  I want to be confident in my speech when I talk to him.  

When I talk to him, or anyone who I feel plays a higher status “role” in my life, I freeze up and agonizingly dissect ever word that is about to come out of my mouth.  I stumble over words, chose not to say big words for fear of pronouncing them wrong.  I have a meek, unconfident speech.  An almost stable, non dynamic tone.  Who would want to even listen to me?  My lack of confidence is apparent in all that I am.  I don’t take care of myself.  Why should I?  I hate me.  I dress in unflattering clothes, barely put on makeup, smoke cigarettes, eat junk, slouch my shoulders, assume uncomfortable body posture.  It’s all in everyone’s face, especially mine.  Why can’t I just get it together and have some confidence in myself?  I deserve it, but I can’t bring myself to believe in me. 

What can I do to find my soul?  To find my purpose?  I’m not finding myself by sitting in a sterile office for 40 hours a week pushing paper, waiting until 5pm Friday afternoon.  When I get home, I’m too depressed and broken to get myself out there.  I am constantly in a state of mental and physical fatigue.  So much so that I don’t even care enough to muster up the energy it takes to take a shower or brush my teeth before bed.  I can’t invest my energy on improving my life because I have no energy to give.  

All of these thoughts plus countless of other agonies run through my head all day, every day.  And they are all hidden behind a relatively put together young 23 year old woman who always answers “I’m doing great, thanks!” to someone when they ask me how I am.   "

I'm a junior in CS and Math. Because of a whole host of reasons, my GPA isn't the greatest. It's below a 3.0 (around 2.8, might drop a bit lower this semester). However, I do have a good internship with a big 3 company(microsoft, amazon, google) coming up, and I go to a good school. Here are my pros and cons, essentially:

    **Pros**
    Big 3 Internship
    Open Source Contribution
    Research Work (very brief)
    Good university (UIUC)
    Good interviewer (problem solving, whiteboard coding, personable) 

    **Cons**
    Pretty bad GPA
    Networking (most of my friends are not in CS/engineering, working on fixing that)

Do I still have a chance of landing a decent job in the Fall? Or should I take an extra semester to boost my GPA before I start looking? The whole GPA thing is really getting me down. "

I know how to program, I have a bachelor in software engineering and have some professional experience  through some internships plus through personal projects. How ever, I have no experience in writing an SDK, and I don't really have any experience in gaming development. Eventually, that SDK will have to work with Unity and Unreal engine. Again, I don't have experience with those engine either.

Now, I believe I might be tackling a project that is bigger than I can chew, but I'd be interested in any kind of resources on how to write a quality SDK. Like, what are some common pattern that people use, maybe a framework for that. Maybe a quality, open source, sdk you know about that I can inspire myself from.

I plan on emailing him tomorrow morning (or should I email him tonight?) I'm not sure what to say. Can I just email him saying I enjoyed chatting with him, and would love to take him out to lunch? 

Assuming he likes me should I ask him about internships, knowing in august I will be in school 2 hours a way 4 days a week?

*Edit(in a dorm building)*
The first week was ok.  However after 2 weeks we had a ""family meeting"" to discuss things like cleanliness(pick up after yourself), guests(pre-warn for overnight guests and otherwise no guest between 11p and 10a(understandable people are sleeping or bathing during those times)) and things like that.  2 weeks later we have another meeting because one individual(Penny) is trying to be ""mom"" and going around to peoples' doors knocking to ask if you left something out or if you are going to put something away(however we didn't name any names we basically said we are all adults, treat each other as if we are we have moms at home who can yell at us).  It continued and Penny would make rude comments(like telling the single roommates that they will find a love like hers someday), so we had yet another family meeting where we kind of called her out on all of this.  It got to the point where we would be hanging out in the living room area and as soon as we saw her coming we would all book it to our rooms.
Another one of the girls(Phyllis) drank, a lot.  We didn't mind that she drank, as long as it wasn't to excess and she kept her stuff in her room.  Phyllis was one of the messier girls in the townhouse(I am not particularly clean, but i wasn't as bad), there would be times that she would make cookies and take half of them off the tray and leave the rest, or leave food out over night(like a chocolate pie, with some on the counter).  One day she saw an earwig in the bathroom and decided to bug bomb the bathroom, and forgot to turn on the vent or let anyone know, so when Penny went to go take a shower in the only full bathroom we have, she got a lung full of poisonous bug gas.  Phyllis also at the end of the semester left a lip gloss sized vibrator on the coffee table in the living room.
Myself, my good friend Jill, and one other girl, Meg, who happened to live right next to each other became very close which bothered Penny and Betty who lived upstairs with her.

Spring semester:
Penny has asked some of the blondest things i have ever heard of(I am a natural blonde and these things make me go ""WHAT!?!?!?""), like asking if she could use a freezer bad and not put it in the freezer, or knocking on everyones' door in the middle of the day when people are either in class or out on internships, because the microwave is not on, but is plugged in(the outlet for some reason keeps popping a fuse).  Another day she asked if she could put pasta she just cooked in a plastic dish, or would it melt.
Phyllis has been gone all semester on an internship in another state, but Meg met a guy and took Phyllis' place of annoying me.  The fact that she met the guy is not what is annoying, what is annoying is that he has a girlfriend that he has been with for over 3 years.  She made clear to him that she was having feelings for this guy, and he told her that he too was gaining feelings for her, but he has a girl friend.  He keeps making moves towards her (knowing well that he is still committed to his gf and that my suite mate likes him), like giving her long hugs and lifting her off the ground, and smacking and grabbing her butt, and telling her that he wants to kiss her.
Spring break comes and myself, Meg, and Betty stayed on campus because i was working in a classroom during the week and they had internship.  They had decided that it was going to be a no boys week(mind you they are both technically single). So i went along with it but had asked early in the week if we could end the ban on friday because it is my break too and i would like to have my bf or just guy friends over during that time.  I understand giving them the week since they have stuff to do.  I did not get a determinative answer from either of them.  Friday night comes and around 9 at night i get a message from Meg saying that my boyfriend can come over  Which at that point We'd get there, have a little bit of time and then he would have to leave because it would be 11, and we have to give a 2 day notice on overnight guests because the girls are insane.  I get home at 11:30 and out walks Meg with the guy she is ""dating"" with alcohol in their hands.  When she asked where my bf was i told her at home cause it is after 11 and i wasn't able to give a 2 day notice(hint hint).  The guy left around 6 the next morning and i learned that in their drunken extravaganzas they had ""relations"".
After months of myself and Jill telling her that she needs to do something about the guy she finally was like ""look you need to figure your shit out, you need to decide if you want me or your gf.""  And then when she gave him a time limit and the time was running out she was like ""Well maybe, if he chooses his gf, i'll tell her that he has been dating me and we had sex""
She also has a tendency of ignoring when i ask if my bf can spend the night

I'd rather live with guys they are so much better than girls."
24tn1q,45,2014-05-05,"/r/Filmmakers, Let's talk about resumes...",wildlikechildren,Filmmakers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/24tn1q/rfilmmakers_lets_talk_about_resumes/,"Having worked in Production Offices for several years now, I've seen a lot of resumes go through the office from all different departments. On some shows I'm the keeper of the resume email that is often on local union reports, film commission websites and various production reports. I get anywhere from 10 to 75 emails a day so it's safe to say I've seen way too many bad resumes. I sort through these resumes by department and forward any along that may be of good use to a department in need. Most of these ""bad"" resumes are from those who are just starting out or trying to get their foot in the door. 

This morning I received an email to my personal email from what seemed to be a guy fresh out of college. The resume attached was just plain awful. I should mention it also looked just like mine did when I first started out. It wasn't a resume, it was an essay and everything was wrong with it. I unfortunately had to learn the hard way about my resume so I kindly replied and offered advice if he wanted it. So now, I've decided to put this advice in long form and present my formula for a solid resume. I'll give you examples and answer any questions you may have below. This advice does not pertain to all industries. This advice is strictly for those looking to work in TV and Feature Films. 

[This is a simple formula I think would be useful follow. Formatting and whatnot is all up to you. 
](http://i.imgur.com/f4s5B9n.png)

**Your resume should answer the following questions:**

* What is their name and contact info? (I should not have to look for this)
* Which Department do they work in?
* What kind of experience do they have working in that department? (Absolutely Include position &amp; picture title, Maybe include Department Head, Line Producer/UPM, Studio, Location, Dates)
* What special skills/software do they have that pertain to this department?


**Your resume should be all these things:**

* Simple and Clean
* Straight to the point
* Organized
* Show proper font usage 
* One page (The only reason you should have a second page is if you have a kit to be rented, IE. Construction Coordinators, Steady Cam Ops, Video Assists, DITs, Etc.)
* in .PDF format 
* Cohesive. Who ever you give it to should be able to look at it instantly and know which department you want to work in. It's great if you've dabbled in different departments but what are they supposed to do with a resume that has Grip, Set PA, 2nd AC and Set Dresser right after each other? You can always have multiple resumes created specifically for a certain department. Departments want to be confident that you want to work in their department and have experience working your way up in it. 


**DON'T do the following:**

* Explain or describe your position, [like this](http://i.imgur.com/n32OsEV.png). I oddly see this a lot and half of the time the descriptions don't fit the position's requirements on a union show. I know what a Set PA, Grip, Camera Operator and Art Director all do and so do the Department Heads. Now, If there is special paperwork or required skills that pertains to your department that you know how to do then that would go under your ""Special skills"" part at the bottom of the page. For example, if the position above you has different requirements/paperwork and you know how to do these, then that is what you should list. [Here's an example.](http://i.imgur.com/EILM0Ch.png) [Example 2](http://i.imgur.com/ZVLa8Fn.png) [Example 3](http://i.imgur.com/JJNIgYv.png)
* List your self as a department head if you are starting out. You may have been the Key Grip on your student films or the Director of Photography on the short film that your buddy wrote but you are absolutely not any of those things if you are looking to work in the TV and Feature film industry and just starting out. Some may disagree but I personally see no problem with taking your credit as the DP and making it ""Camera PA"" or your Art Director credit on your friends music video and making it ""Art PA"". You worked on that short film, local artist music video etc. so give yourself a credit that will be relevant to the job that you're trying to apply for. When starting out, you want to show that you're willing to work from the bottom up. Just be smart about this. 

**What if I don't have any credits?**

* We all start somewhere. Don't get discouraged, you may just have to network and hustle much more than what makes you comfortable. Slap up a little resume with your contact info, education and skills and your interests. Get in contact with your local film commission, get the numbers/emails of local productions in the area and offer yourself up as an intern. Some productions' insurance companies don't allow them but often times they do. Send in a resume with the words INTERN all over the subject and email. 
* Utilize Facebook. Join your local filmmakers facebook groups and meet people, reply to crew wanted ads. Stay away from craigslist.  
* Volunteer at local film festivals. It's at least something film related to put on a resume and the connections you can make there are always beneficial. 






I'm not an expert but I hope I'm able to give some clarity. I've been writing this for a couple days now so It's a work in progress. I'm sure I'll think of more and I'll be more than happy to answer questions below.

24u1n1,2,2014-05-05,Starting tonight.,[deleted],NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/24u1n1/starting_tonight/,"I just discovered this subreddit and I'm ready to make a change in my life. I've known that I have a problem for a long time now but haven't tried to do anything about it.


I don't think I really developed this problem until about a year and a half ago when I moved 8 hours away from my girlfriend for an internship. We had been dating around a year and a half at the time. We were pretty sexually active, although we never actually had sex, and after I moved away began doing the deed with much more frequency than I had been when we were living in the same place. 


Shortly after moving, while my girlfriend was in town for a visit we did something very stupid and my girlfriend became pregnant. A few weeks later she found out that she had had a miscarriage. This was unbelievably taxing emotionally and caused us both an unbearable amount of stress, compounded by the fact that we were 8 hours apart and couldn't be there for each other physically for more than two days at a time.


Fast forward a few months and I'm still watching porn way more than I should be. My girlfriend and I take a trip to a B&amp;B where we plan to have sex with protection, as she's been on birth control ever since the miscarriage (about 3 months).


This is when I really realized that I had a problem. I couldn't get it up for her that night no matter how hard I tried. We were both so emotionally drained and exhausted from the past couple of months that I was afraid that night was going to irreversibly damage our relationship. The next morning I woke up and was able to get an erection, so I eagerly tried to start sexual intercourse with her. We had sex, but we both felt fairly unsatisfied emotionally afterwards as there hadn't been any romance or love in what we had done, which I can see was entirely my fault for simply wanting to do have sex while I was still hard, like I was checking something off of a to-do list. 


As it turned out, my girlfriends birth control wasn't working and she became pregnant again as a result of that night, and shortly after had another miscarriage.


Outside of my closest friend I've never told anyone about the above. It's been a little over a year and my girlfriend and I are still together and live in the same city again, although it's been very challenging. Since the second miscarriage our sex-life has been nearly non existent. I completely understand how my girlfriend feels and I haven't made any effort to push the issue with her. I know she needs time and I'm not in any hurry. However, I've continued to watch porn and fap obsessively to compensate for the lack of sexual intimacy in our relationship and I believe that cutting out this behavior will make my relationship stronger and improve my life in other ways as well. I'm looking forward to starting this journey.

24u2on,5,2014-05-05,Letter to a friend (debating on showing this to her or not),[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/24u2on/letter_to_a_friend_debating_on_showing_this_to/,"Dear Friend, 

I would like to formally apologize for making this friendship much harder than it ever had to be. I am pretty good at doing that. I want to take this time to explain myself and hope to help you understand the struggle that is my life. 
Let's begin with the previous summer, when we were first getting to know each other and in some 'in between' relationship that wasn't a committed relationship but wasn't a friendship. Those three months may have been the best three months I have ever had since feeling the effects of my depression 5 or 6 years ago. You made me want to be a better student, a better guy and overall better person. 
Things went wrong, and we had a few shaky months in there. School started going south, and my depression has been worse than ever. 
Please don't take it the wrong way; it is by no means your fault. You did not make my depression worse, me bottling it up and not doing anything about it for years made it worse. 
But, now we are at the friendship level of talking every single day. I have talked to you about my depression and you have responded with some advice. Here is why I have not been the best friend in the world lately. 

I fell in love with you very quickly and very unexpectedly. I never told you that I loved you, out of fear of losing you, but I was. Better yet, I still am and it is so hard to not tell you how much I love you. The other day, at the fashion show, when you walked out on stage, looking better than ever before, I felt like I had fallen in love with you all over again. Everytime I see you, I lose my train of thought and want to cry. I have constant dreams with you involved and I wake up in tears. Waking up with you next to me on my birthday gave me a tiny reminder of what it felt like to have such a wonderful person want me in their life even if I didn't understand why.

But, I am suffering from a disease that takes over my entire state of mind. I no longer feel the motivation to get out of bed, do my homework, talk to my friends, go out to the bars or really anything at all. I have to leave social events early on consistently because I know I am about to start crying uncontrollably and would much prefer to do that in the comfort of my own bedroom. You are leaving for three months to go to LA for an internship and its the longest I will have gone without seeing you since we first met, and it scares me. I know you don't want to hear all this, but I have to be honest, I am so afraid of losing you in my life, but I am so good at pushing those close to me away. When I hear you talk about your ex, or some guy you went on a date with, or some guy that was flirting with you, I lose my train of thought and am stuck in this whirlwind of 'why doesn't she love me' and 'what did I do wrong.' I don't know how I would handle you not in my life, because those daily texts from you are the only things I look forward to every single day of my life, even if we aren't quite talking in the way that we used to.

24u2pq,9,2014-05-05,[2nd year CS Major] Uneasy about future.,CSCOLLEGESTUDENT,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/24u2pq/2nd_year_cs_major_uneasy_about_future/,"A little about myself: 8 years ago I graduated high school with the bare minimum to get out. I disliked school and had zero intent to go to college and didn't take part in any planning or steps an average student would take for their future. 2 years after graduation, I was given a job doing graphic design and some minor web design/development (two hobbies of mine) for a small marketing company. This job fell into my lap and I was incredibly lucky for the opportunity. The pay wasn't great and I lived at home with my parents but enjoyed the work, especially any thing involving PHP programming. After 5 years I quit my job and moved across the country with my family and enrolled in a local community college, where my passion for school was reignited, and am currently holding a 3.8 GPA and working through my credits towards a Bachelors in Computer Science. My 'dream job' would be some marriage of Programming and Art(creativity) like Web Development/Design or App development, or possibly something in Software Engineering/Design perhaps, but really anything that involves Programming and problem solving is what I love.

Now my problem. As I stated, I am in my mid-twenties attending a community college full time, and I cannot help but feel like I am just being churned through the system. My computer science curriculum focuses on C++, and even after two semesters I feel like an amateur or worse. I also have taken some classes that dig deeper into the ""how"" computers work and basic computer language/compilers and that stuff felt way over my head yet still passed the classes. I will most likely be transferring to a local 4-year university soon and am very worried that I was rubber-stamped and pushed through, leaving my knowledge versus a university level understanding of Computer Science much to be desired. 

Is it possible to use the free resources available on the internet and properly bring one's self to the level that one needs to be at to enter higher CS level courses? And what about graduation? Should I be learning more languages in parallel to my C++ classes? And where does one learn about opportunities for internships and experience outside of the classroom?

I apologize if this is rambling or incoherent, I essentially was hoping for some guidance into the steps I should take or the things I can do to make the transition from what feels like someone who is earning a CS degree but will struggle to use it, to someone who will be successful after graduation."

24u57u,6,2014-05-05,Transferring from community college. Planning on moving out for the first time. Thoughts?,ttthrowaway25,rutgers,https://www.reddit.com/r/rutgers/comments/24u57u/transferring_from_community_college_planning_on/,"I have been accepted to SAS for CS and I think it would be a good time for me to move out. I will live on-campus if I can't afford it or if it involves me taking out any private loans, but I would prefer to live off-campus for two reasons: my family situation is tense, and living near Rutgers would provide me with more internship opportunities. I currently live far south in NJ with very few tech companies around and living near NYC and Philly would be a huge opportunity, not to mention that many internships require you to work during winter and spring vacations which I won't be able to do if I have to go home to my parents' 150 miles away.

We would both be receiving about $14772 per person in financial aid money for housing, food, utilities, etc. which is $1231 per month per person stretched over 12 months, on top of summer employment. (If you're interested in seeing how I got that number, click [here](http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=nnDKJ0L8).) Our parents have agreed to pay security deposits and deposits for utilities if necessary (we have both been using student credit cards responsibly for about a year now).

I've never been to the New Brunswick area so I don't know what to expect for the cost of living there. We were planning on living on Cedar Avenue in Highland Park ($1200-$1000 per month plus utilities) both for the neighborhood and because a Livingston bus stop is within biking distance.

I'm essentially afraid that we won't be able to afford it and it'll be too much to deal with. Since we've never really gone to school full time, we don't really know how hard it will be to manage time between school and work. Is working for $2000 per year at a work study (avg. 12 hours per week at minimum wage) too ambitious? Or do you think we'd be able to handle more? 

When summer time comes we will have more time to work. For me, I'd be taking a programming internship which is usually paid by law and the minimum wage is about $11, average about $15. The only downside is that they will most likely be in NY which requires $25 in train tickets every day.

TL;DR: two community college students looking to move out for the first time in off-campus housing. Is it possible or is it better to live on campus? Sorry for the wall of text."
24u5ig,91,2014-05-06,Any suggestions for learning HTML/JavaScript/jQuery/PHP?,wilfredthedonkey,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/24u5ig/any_suggestions_for_learning/,"So I've been programming for a bit over a year, but this year has been mostly focused on programming (I'm planning on majoring in it). I have learned the most basic of introductory Python and Ruby, and am completing a class in AP Computer Science (in Java) this year. Earlier this year, I went through the codeacademy tutorial for JavaScript.

I got an internship at a startup and they're telling me to learn certain languages. So I need a way to learn how to implement jQuery and HTML (as well as get a better understanding of JavaScript) really quickly so that I can become useful.

To illustrate what level I should be at, I was told to make a tic tac toe game that is interactive and tells you when you won/lost. I would like to be able to do this in a couple of weeks but... I don't know how realistic that is.

Does anyone have any suggestions for someone at my experience level? I mean, my coworkers will teach me themselves once I understand the most basic fundamentals, so I don't need to be an expert or anything.

They're also asking me to learn PHP... but I'm thinking at this point that's just way too much. If you have suggestions for learning that quickly, then by all means mention it but... I don't know.

I guess what I'm just looking for is a tutorial that's at the right pace. Ideas? How long do you guys think it would take to get the fundamentals of the language down?

Thanks!"

(40weeks +1day),goomygoomy,BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/24u9ga/update_membrane_sweep_symptoms_40weeks_1day/,"Here's an update, plus I have some questions about membrane sweep. I am officially overdue. It sucks. Have gained about 55 lbs. the entire pregnancy, and I feel like a bloated beached whale. SPD pain has been hard to deal with since about week 20, and I am just physically and emotionally exhausted, but I am still excited and can't wait to give birth. I am planning on a natural birth, but I am not opposed to changing my plans or intervention in needed. SO and I have mostly everything set up in our nursery space, only thing left to do is a little bit of organization that my SO said he'd take care of. For the time being we have to co-habit with the baby in our room since we are living at his grandparents house. Luckily the room is large enough for all three of us. We plan on moving out once I can return to work, hopefully with in the next 6-12 months we'll have our own place with a room just for baby. Anyway, today earlier this morning I had a 40 week ultrasound (almost peed myself. I hate the whole having to have a full bladder thing) everything on the ultrasound came back looking good and baby was very healthy looking even though he's measuring above average. Estimated weight is about 8.5-10 lbs. In the 80th percentile in growth. This scares me a little since I am worried about tearing a lot. I am a pretty small person 5'2"" and everything about me is small except for this huge new baby bump. Anyway later on today I had another appointment to go over ultrasound results with OBGYN, have a membrane sweep, and talk about induction. If baby hasn't arrived by Friday I have one more appointment with my OBGYN and we'll set an induction date for sometime in the beginning of next week. I hope it doesn't come to that. Membrane sweep was very uncomfortable and a little awkward since my OBGYN had an intern with her and she helped out. I almost cried after it was done, not from pain or discomfort, but I felt a little violated, but I chalked this up to my hormones raging wild, and it being a little awkward with my SO in the room with me. Now here is the kicker about an hour after I got home I just crashed and felt really out of it, and I am wondering if these symptoms are normal to have after a membrane sweep. I got really sleepy, so I cat napped all day probably getting in about 6-8+ hours of extra sleep. Then upon waking up my hands and feet are swollen worse than ever, my face is flush and I'm very warm (took my temp. it's normal at 97.6 fahrenheit), and now a slight headache and some cramping anytime when the baby moves. Is this normal? Should I consult with my nurses line at my clinic? Also I just want to say I am so thankful for the community here on r/babybumps. I lurk almost everyday and it keeps me so positive, and the advice/community has really been supportive throughout this whole process. I love you guys. I hope I can update you soon with a birth story and pics. Good luck to all of you."
24uefc,1,2014-05-06,I was going to rant about not being able to talk to girls but I decided to talk about more important stuff,the_axe_minister,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/24uefc/i_was_going_to_rant_about_not_being_able_to_talk/,"I guess if I'm going to rant and get everything off my chest, then I'm going to have to go back a while. I would rather write a history for the rather than a rant, because it bursts out of me and I want to shout about it and explain it to everyone. Being mostly rational, or at least repressed, I haven't told all of it to anyone but my therapist. She's heard it backwards and forwards, but I have the chronic, strong urge to tell the story to someone else, get fresh ears on it. 

During finals week of college, five years ago, I tried to kill myself twice. After the second time, my parents drove me back home and I checked into a psychiatric hospital. I spent 3 weeks in the hospital, got out for about 5 days and had to go back in because the Abilify they put me on gave me unbearable akathesia, then got out again in mid-June. They diagnosed me with severe depression with psychotic features, which by my reckoning was a pretty accurate diagnosis (even though I probably could also be manic--see below) and put me on Risperidone, which really, really sucked. I was crazy, legitimately crazy during that time, all I could think about was either taking drugs or wanting to die or both. In August I went back in because I made another attempt and ended up in the hospital again, spent a month there, and then a month at an inpatient program and then 3 months at a farm for sad drug addicts which I left because I had health problems. That was January. As a result of me being crazy and also the treatment for craziness, I had gained about ~50 pounds from stress eating and medication, I had skin fungus, I didn't shave, etc.

For about two months I was like that, basically I smoked a lot of weed and tried to order drugs off the internet and was so, so stupid, so unbelievably stupid. Then my psychiatrist at the time diagnosed me with ADHD and a Learning Disability then gave me a bunch of Adderall and Vyvanse, and that made me even crazier and more desperate for some kind of chemical help. I stole money from my parents to buy weed and a couple of times cocaine, almost got a possession charge, and did a lot of other dumb stuff. It was like I couldn't stop—I don't remember how I felt then, it's years ago now, less than five years but more than one, but from my actions it appears that I just couldn't , whether it was mania, or Adderall or whatever, I'd just keep doing the same stuff over and over again. Like I'd go out in my parents car to smoke weed with my friends even though my mom was begging me to stop, just to feel slowed down for a little bit. At the time though, I loved the Adderall, it gave me the motivation to shave and shower consistently and it made me lose a bunch of weight. And somehow I felt it even made my personality better like girls were more attracted to me when I when I was on it. It was weird because I was crazy on one hand but accomplishing things on the other. During this time I graduated from a six month full time culinary program, took two creative writing courses and made plans to return to college. 

The summer made me crazy, or my culinary program ending gave me too much time. I went to raves and did a bunch of molly which was fun, but I ended up in the hospital again because I tried to commit suicide by overdose. That was stupid and I knew it was stupid because I read so much about how to commit suicide and knew that overdose rarely works. After that I spent a month in a mental hospital and somehow convinced my parents to send me back to college. By the time that month in the hospital was up, I gained back all the weight I had lost on Adderall (they took me off of it) and stopped taking care of my appearance. In addition I was on about 15 milligrams of Zyprexa, which as anyone who has been on it, will make you blow up like a balloon.

Call it gumption, or maybe some level of privilege, or maybe just the effect of time, but somehow I've been stable since then which is to say I've been stable enough to stay at college for three years. Next semester, I will graduate college with a bachelors in computer science from one of the best undergraduate programs in the country. Getting this far was hard, for me at least, I don't know if it would be hard for anyone else. One of the fictions that tided me or comforted me during that lost year was the idea that I'd come back from this crucible or whatever it was and write a novel or something beautiful that would keep people alive, or maybe I had some profundity to impart to others like I was a prophet shouting in the desert. Never really worked out though, I realized about a year in that I didn't have the temerity to make it in the literary world, got drunk one night and decided to become a Computer Scientist. 

Now here I am after my fourth semester of doubling and tripling on Computer Science courses. I'm trying to find internships and I've wondered if the application process would've been easier if I hadn't been concerned with fiction and literature, or spent more time doing extracurriculars,. or had started my Computer Science major earlier, or had double majored in math, or my GPA hadn't sucked because I was either suicidal or on heavy antipsychotics for several years, etc. But you know those are good things to wonder, good problems to have compared to where I was three years ago. I'm not actively trying to kill myself or crazy on drugs and even though I'm really emotional and anxious all of the time (as always), I can control it. In addition I quit smoking and joined a sports team so even though I still have a barrel stomach and stress eat a lot, I'm pretty athletic and have lost a decent amount of weight. When I started this rant, I going to complain about not being able to talk to girls or whatever, but I had to start from the beginning to explain why that was, and ended up telling you what was/is really on my chest. So yeah."
24ufq4,1,2014-05-06,"I'm considering hard-mode, but GF is nervous.",[deleted],NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/24ufq4/im_considering_hardmode_but_gf_is_nervous/,"Summer vacation is coming up, which is a major relief. However, I've had trouble with PMO for about a month (probably due to finals). Once I get home, I'm going to start off with a strict regime from dawn until dusk, including cardio, lifting, reading, writing, possibly job, meditation, diet,  and working around the house. I've been considering a few hobbies as well. I also have an internship, but it will probably only take up 10 hours per week.

I've been struggling with PMO addiction for about 6 years, I've been with my GF for 4. She's enthusiastic about helping me get over it, but it is also a huge source of worry and stress on her. It has been a long and tough road trying to understand this addiction, and I have to thank NoFap for helping enlighten both of us. My GF will be working during the week at a camp and will be unavailable for most of the day. Also, both of us live with our parents. She lives about 10 minutes away. 

Because of each of our pasts, my sex drive is way more active than hers, which is an obvious dilemma in any relationship. I'm considering trying Hard Mode over the summer in hopes to reset my drive in some way. However, my GF thinks that it may be too risky, and I'll just be setting myself up for failure (not exactly what she said; she tries to remain as supportive ad trusting as possible). Also, she would miss the experience (i hope).

Should I try Hard Mode over the summer? Even if i don't, there won't be many opportunities over the summer anyway. Will this even help curtail my sex drive? Are there any added benefits to Hard Mode? 

Thanks for any responses."
24uhru,1,2014-05-06,Rock bottom... Hopeless..,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/24uhru/rock_bottom_hopeless/,"I feel so low right now... Despite being depressed ever since middle school, my feelings of hopelessness have escalated to a new level.

I've had low self-esteem and was depressed since grade 6... I was severely bullied by my ""best friend"", and she spread all these false rumours and had other people bully me as well. They were so mean, I felt worthless from such a young age and used to cry every day. I told myself that once I graduated and got to college, everything would be different. I had high expectations for college and thought that I would be happier.

I'm 19 now, but I'm now realizing I will never be able to escape from my past... I'm now a crazy, depressed, angry person with social anxiety, and I'm sure it all roots from the bullying. I was so excited for college, but once I moved into rez, I became afraid. My anxiety came out. I ended up sleeping around for a bit (I wanted to feel loved), which I really regret. I actually lost my virginity to a guy I met at a frat, who forced me into it. I kept resisting and he kept guilt-tripping me into doing it. Later, I even slept with a guy who had a girlfriend (I did not know at the time, though). I found out afterwards, and she found out about us. He threw me under the bus, blamed everything on me, and they basically just went on with their lives leaving behind the ""hoe who tried to home wreck their relationship"". I never got closure from this and I still feel pissed off about it. 

I was so focused on my depression and emotions that I neglected my studies and got kicked out of school. Now I'm back home and my parents are so disappointed in me.

So now I'm just angry, irritable and depressed every single day.

* I'm still pissed off about he guy who fucked me over... There's no closure for me and without it, I can't move on. It's been a while but I rage every single day.
* I'm pissed at myself for allowing myself to get into that kind of situation. I hate myself for sleeping around for that period of time... I can't believe I fucking did that. Some people may feel okay with that, but it's not okay for me- it only made me feel sadder.
* My parents used to be well off but due to a major investment fail and a few stupid financial decisions, we are now struggling to survive. They used to tell me not to worry about college funds and that they've got it all covered, but now that is no longer the case and I don't have any money at all saved. I suppose it doesn't matter since I got kicked out anyway, and I'm 19- old enough to work to sustain myself.
*BUT, I have issues with work. I've had four jobs before, and the longest I've lasted was four months. At my last job, I got angry, couldn't control it, and made a scene at work. Obviously, I got let go. The job before that was a sales associate job. My social anxiety got so bad when ever I was on the floor and my manager told me that she could not have someone like that at her store, and I got let go. I just scored a new job a few weeks ago; today was my first day, and the manager already told me he was going to let me go because he does not think the job is suitable for me. I'm good at interviews, but when it comes to the job, my real self shows and I can tell managers always regret hiring me. It's disheartening.. Makes me feel worse about myself than I already do. I really need money.. Yet I just can't seem to keep a job.
* I've lost pretty much all my friends (not that I had many to begin with). Everyone is doing well at college, involved, doing well in school, scoring internships, etc. I feel so left behind... The only friends I have left are just like me - no ambition, lost in life. 
* A part of me really wants to get somewhere in life, yet I have come to realize that I have lost all my passions. When I was younger, I had so many interests.. I loved to read, I loved soccer, I was interested in computer programming, etc. Sometime along the way, my interests disappeared. Nothing appeals to me, all I want to do is sleep my life away. 
* I've seen a counsellor and numerous doctors, and they all got frustrated with me and told me I'm too confusing. 

I've never felt this fucking hopeless and low in my life before, and I've had MANY lows. Wtf is wrong with me. I hate this I just wish I can start over in life.. But that's impossible I either have to live with this horrible feeling of being depressed and apathetic everyday or just kill myself"
24ulti,6,2014-05-06,First proper appointment at the gender clinic.,Naidje,transpositive,https://www.reddit.com/r/transpositive/comments/24ulti/first_proper_appointment_at_the_gender_clinic/,"A few days ago I finally was able to see someone at the hospital’s gender dysphoria clinic. This is a pretty big deal for me, because up until now I’ve been stuck on a waiting list. I’ve sought out a therapist and a support group on my own, and have gotten a head start on permanent removal of my facial hair, but finally seeing someone at the clinic means I’ve taken the first concrete step towards starting HRT.

The system concerning transgender patients in my country (The Netherlands) isn’t exactly ideal. Informed consent does not exist here and self medicating is very difficult. The vast majority of us are forced to go through so called “gender teams” of which there only exist 3 in the country.  Of those 3, there’s one at the VUMC hospital in Amsterdam that basically has a monopoly position, treating 85 percent of all Dutch transgender patients. Because of this the waiting lists are incredibly long, and because of the sheer numbers and lack of funding by insurance companies they’ve stopped accepting new patients since january this year. I was very lucky to have contacted them a mere month before they closed applications and as such I’m now able to receive care from them.

They maintain a very strict protocol for treatment with the first phase consisting of establishing a diagnosis of gender dysphoria. This is quite a lengty process that takes about 6 months on average. A patient has monthly meetings with various professionals. Mostly psychologists and psychiatrist, but also endocrinologists. Once the “gender team” has to their satisfaction established that gender dysphoria is present, the patient moves on to the actual treatment phase, which is HRT and transitioning to living life as their preferred gender.

So anyway, that’s how this stuff works in The Netherlands. It’s a very cumbersome process to say the least, not even going into the problems with lack of funding. Unfortunately it’s just one of the hoops I’ll have to jump through in order to start living my life authentically. I’m happy to have made it this far and be making proper progress.

The first appointment at the clinic was pretty scary. In my day to day life I’m still presenting as male. The only time I’ve ever been out in girl mode was going to my support group meeting. It still feels very new and awkward to me and I don’t quite have a lot of confidence in my appearance yet. However, the more apparent my wish to live as a woman is to the gender team, the sooner they will greenlight me for HRT, so it’s in my best intererst to present myself as feminine as possible to them.

I asked a good friend to help me out and she was amazing enough to agree. She helped me pick out which clothes to wear, and accompanied me to the appointment like the champ she is.

I had just received my fourth IPL hair removal session only 4 days before, and my face was still very raw. My skin was really still too sensitive to shave properly, but I did the best job I could and used makeup to cover up my beard shadow.

The ride over there was kinda scary as well. I don’t like using public transport to begin with, and I just had the feeling like everyone was staring at me. Thank goodness my friend was with me. I could focus on her and feel less self consious. Once we arrived the man at the desk was incredibly kind and referred to both of us as ladies, which felt awesome. After a minute or so the psychologist came out to meet us.

Most of our time was spent by him explaining what I could expect from him and the clinic in general and clearing up any questions I had. Later on I told him a little about my life. Mostly about college and my internship and a bit about my psychiatric history. It really was more of an introduction than a proper session, but next time we will go more indepth. I’m also registered as Nadia in their system instead of my old name, which makes me incredibly happy.

All in all, the talk itself wasn’t that spectacular, but it does represent a big step on the road to starting HRT."

My school is known for its CS program but that hasn't helped me much at all. I've been applying to internships since about mid December (about 50 total companies). I've only had 5 interviews and none of them panned out. Shit, most of them didn't even tell me I'd been passed over. I had two separate companies interview me and then not even bother to tell me I'd been rejected. 

Realistically, how important is an internship? Everyone I talk to on campus seems to have one lined up and they act like its easy to get one. I feel alone like I'm the only one without one.

It's really been stressing me out. This is kind of the first test of my skills/experience isn't it? I imagine applying for a job will be similar. If I'm not getting in now, what do I need to change to get a job next year?

I've read that doing personal projects and working on open source helps a bit but can it really replace an internship? Is it possible recruiters will wonder why I don't have an internship on my resume?

Side note: Is it still possible to land an internship position? I know its really late but is there any advice specific to getting a last minute position somewhere?"

(http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/23z3cw/update_3_update_2_update_me_21_f_with_my_father/)

So I received my internship and forwarded the acceptance to my dad. It's my finals week and I couldn't hold off much longer in not talking to him so I'm sort of weening the communication back in. I woke up to texts and emails of course. His wife is saying we all need to be in family counseling together to ""handling this in a loving and mature way."" My stepmom says not speaking to him for weeks when he's been ill has to be addressed and we all need to go.

I'm not sure if I mentioned this or not in any posts but I may have in comments. We'v had family ""meetings"" in the past where the two of them would gang up on me on things that weren't really issues and I'd become extremely isolated. However, this was never during therapy. My dad has mentioned in the past that in his therapy sessions with his wife, she takes control often and is overbearing.

I do not think it's her business and do not want her involved in our session. I told her I agree that my dad and I need to go to therapy which is why the therapist reached out to him in the first place, however, from my understanding he refused her help at the time. Well now she's saying he did apparently go. I assume this was not when she first reached out but when he realized I was serious about not speaking to him...most likely a long while after he refused to let her speak to me.  

While I do agree therapy is needed, we have never had my stepmom there for the reason being that I refuse. And I continue to refuse. I assume my father thinks that this issue is so drastic, completely from my end, that she needs to be there as well to help him maintain control. They cannot and will not force me to go if I am uncomfortable with the circumstances.

My father cannot use therapy as a weapon against me. His wife acted as if I should have known he spoke with the therapist. However, as mentioned in a previous post, he did not allow the therapist to update with me. Obviously I assumed that he refused help as well since he refused for me to get help from her. Now that it's convenient for him, and he's so ""ill,"" I'm the monster in all this and it ""needs"" to be addressed with the entire family. 

Of course, I received not one, but several emails from my dad. He didn't mention therapy or not talking to me. They all consisted with him trying to take control and telling me what to do. Things I need to get done, things I need to get started on. I already subleased my apartment and did a lot of the things he mentioned. It's not like I'm completely clueless in this process. But of course, he needs to feel like this is his internship and not mine...

Anyway, thank you all for your help these past few weeks. I have therapy in an hour to discuss this, but I'm not sure how to transition from not talking to him or how to make it clear I will not have my stepmom involved in this. It's not like I can physically keep her from driving to the therapist's office. She may seem gentle right now, but knowing her, she will put down the act and push her way there and threaten me in some way since I've been so inconsiderate of my father's illness and this needs to be done as a family and group effort.

TL:DR; Got the internship. Let my dad know. Now we need to have therapy involving his wife apparently. How do I get her uninvolved without having a war?

EDIT: [This comment](http://ud.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/23z3cw/update_3_update_2_update_me_21_f_with_my_father/ch3gyg7) mentions our past family meetings and what my parents are like in general. If you'd like me to give a more detailed example of these meetings, I'd be glad to."

We arrived in Albuquerque yesterday and are currently staying in a hotel. We have been looking for places to stay, but so far the best places will not be available for a couple of weeks. We have called a few places and have a few that we can settle for, but I wanted to confirm that there wasn't a better deal anywhere else.

There are two of us (males). We would prefer a 2 bed 2 bath that is somewhere near Eubank or UNM or near the Sandia labs themselves. We are willing to pay up to 1200 a month if utilities are included. We would also prefer if the place was at least partly furnished, but this is not a strict requirement. We will only be staying for the summer (3 months), no pets and no smoking. Anyone know where I can find such a place?"

I have become really dependent on a stupid machine that owes me nothing whatsoever.

Last Thursday, my computer refused to start. I remember I installed some Windows updates the day before. After trying and restarting and using system repair and nagging my engineer boyfriend about fixing it and seeing him try basically everything he could, the machine still refused to turn on. I did the ""math"" in my head and decided I didn't need to try and save my files. Everything I really need and cannot replace is backed up in the cloud, and everything else (like video game mods, series, films, music, etc.) I could download again. 

I was gone from Thursday evening until Sunday afternoon.

On Sunday, I booted up a Windows disk and reinstalled the whole thing from scratch. It worked. Perfectly. I started reinstalling my mod manager, Office, etc. I went to bed early and let it install its Windows updates, which were 148 updates. Quite a lot, don't you think? While reinstalling stuff on Sunday, I had my laptop open to fiddle on the internet while waiting. When I shut that one down

Monday morning, my PC won't start. I asked my dad (also an IT consultant) to look into it, but we are none the wiser. I thought, well, it's not the same, but I'll use my old laptop, at least I'll be able to work on my thesis or something, but... it wouldn't start up! Exactly the same error message, exactly the same problem.

What do the two have in common? Right, both installed (probably the same) updates prior to not starting up again. I tell my dad this, and he doesn't believe me because ""mom has the same windows with the same updates and she doesn't have the problem"". 

Meanwhile, Windows' System Repair has done something good for a change and got my laptop back up but... god damn it. How did I end up so addicted to that machine? My hobbies are on there: video games, music, films, Photoshop, web design. My school work is on there: thesis, exams, reports. My ""job"" is on there. Everything in my life that isn't going out with friends (which I simply don't do during the week because of my internship and my friends' similar thinking) needs a computer. 

I feel terrible and I hate admitting it, but I can't live without that machine. "

I accepted an internship with Amazon this summer and they never even asked for my GPA! So don't get discouraged! Work on those projects and prove your skills. Stay confident and the opportunities will come!

Good luck with finals everyone!

No, they weren't technically breaking any rules, and no this isn't a post to build a case and go after them, they're still a good company. It just sucks. Details inside",MR_MOOSECELS,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/24vlq2/lost_my_internship_because_i_got_time_off_of_work/,"I got into a car crash a few weeks ago (quick search through my comment history will show its been a topic of discussion for me in a few subs). Anyways, it screwed me up. That car was the only thing I owned beside this laptop I'm typing off (which isn't even paid off yet) and I worked for 2 years to buy that damn thing cash. While I got over the fact that Cougar was gone, the physical repercussions stuck around. I got a concussion in the crash.

No, this wasn't a wild crash, no the airbags didn't go off, and no I didn't black out, but a concussions a concussion and I still have headaches. I only took two days off from work post crash because I *really* cared about my internship, hell you could call it my full time job I was putting in 40 hours a week, and I just wanted to get back. Stupid, I KNOW, but the day I went back I felt fine. As projects and deadlines started mounting, my headaches began returning, and my depression which I was diagnosed with in December started ramping up my life became miserable. The last couple weeks of my life were a struggle everyday. Shit, I don't even know how I made it so long. I took yesterday off after I had broken a lot of shit in my room (moved back home to help cope/keep myself safe) and the doc said stay out of work for two weeks. Went to the psychologist later that night and told him what's up and I felt like for the first time in a long time things were really lining up for me. I'd have a week; I didn't want to miss the whole two weeks and told my doc that flat out, but during that time I could explore new interests without unnecessary stress. I went out and bought a drawing tablet yesterday to hook up to the mac, I bought a bunch of dogecoins because hey who knows lol, and today I'm learning to drive stick. Life looks on the rise for me. But, there's a catch.

I shot out an email this morning, real genuine, telling the team that I'm gonna be out for a bit and that the doc suggested two weeks. I scanned his note, put my cell in so people could call and ask questions, and I said full disclosure about everything I DID NOT want people think I was bitching out of anything. So I just got an email from HR/the leader of my intern program saying that since the three weeks built into the schedule after May 15th fall after my suggested May 19th return there's no need for me to come back and my time is complete with the company.

Really? I feel like I was drug (dragged) into a back alley and shot, like how could they send me out like that? I get that the time *is optional* but still. From the start I said I'd do it, I WANTED to do it. Now I feel like I'm walking out of this without finishing. Meanwhile, a major point of discussion and thought about a source of my depression is that I lack followthrough and this is just really a kick to the dick. I know its an opportunity to go do new things, get better, and become awesome, but shit guys and girls. That job..that's all I did. Yeah I'm trying to explore new hobbies, but shit. I put everything into that job man. Everything. Nevermind the fact that I'll miss the people there and I didn't get to say goodbye. 

I don't care about the recommendation, I can throw it on a resume and with my other experience/GPA/school I go to/connections I've built up I'll be fine finding a job. That's not the problem. I just wanted to finish this. I wanted to do it, to wear that suit on that last day and give them the presentation thanking them for giving me a chance when I was down. I wanted to thank the CEO for shaking my hand on the first day, unbeknownst to him only 5 days after I was diagnosed with severe depression. I guess I'm gonna be on here a bit more since I don't have a job now...but yeah. So, that's where I'm at, going to the gym soon, telling the people in my office at school that my co-op is..done, and I guess I'll learn stick shift later tonight. Not the worst day I've had, but its definitely a life-defining one. 

**TL;DR** Was already depressed but getting through the day at work then suffering once I got home. Got in a crash and the concussion compounded things. Was told to take 2 weeks off from the doctor, started getting a plan together to take advantage of the time, and my return lined up with the middle of the end of my time working and they told me don't bother coming back. Feelings mixed, jimmies slightly rustled.

Any thoughts/comments/coping mechanisms are appreciated."

The only downside to it that I can see is that it is involving the Raspberry Pi and as such is a Python-based environment, which I have no experience in at all. 

I already have some of the project completed, but it is based on pre-existing code and Googling when I didn't understand something about Python (which was all of the time). I wish I could ask the professor for help, but he has very little experience in Python and is a Chemistry lecturer. Do you think that I should power through this opportunity even though I have no idea what I am doing or should I wait for something I am more familiar with, which may never happen at all? Also do you guys think that this would be helpful in obtaining future internships? Thanks."

So there you have it, my summer goals. Now, brutalize me with inspiring quotes, criticism of my goals, subs to look into, advice to take, and sites that will help me along the way. I want to come back here every week and give a report on how everything is going. I know a lot of the things I listed may seem linked, irrelevant, or strange, but these goals are actually really important to me. I don't think I've ever set goals for myself, and I certainly have never check up on myself to see how I've come along with my goals. I'm trying to move forward and create a better life moving ahead.

24vujy,1,2014-05-06,[Seeking] Sandia Intern looking for a place to rent near Livermore,[deleted],SFBayHousing,https://www.reddit.com/r/SFBayHousing/comments/24vujy/seeking_sandia_intern_looking_for_a_place_to_rent/,"Hey there. I'm going to be an intern at Sandia National Lab this summer. I'll be there for three months, from approximately May 15 - Aug 15. Though I can find a place to stay until June 1 if the room isn't open until then. I'm looking for any place that has nice roommates, a kitchen, a bathroom, and is within a 30 minute commute of Sandia/Livermore area either by car, bus, bike, or anything. Not super picky.

About me: I'm a 23 year old male computer science grad student at UT Austin who likes climbing, kayaking, and outdoorsy things. I really like cooking too.

Although I really, really love being friends with my roommates and hanging out, if that isn't your house's MO, I'm still interested. I'll only be there for three months, and I'm good at entertaining myself.


I'm neat, quiet at night, and I can also keep to myself pretty well if need be. I'm almost always down for a movie night or a house project if people are into it. I drink, but I don't smoke at all - totally fine if you do, I'll probably even sit outside with you.

So let me know if you're looking for someone to room with out East. Send me a PM and we can chat."

I would rather write a history for the rather than a rant, because it bursts out of me and I want to shout about it and explain it to everyone. Being mostly rational, or at least repressed, I haven't told all of it to anyone but my therapist. She's heard it backwards and forwards, but I have the chronic, strong urge to tell the story to someone else, get fresh ears on it.


During finals week of college, five years ago, I tried to kill myself twice. After the second time, my parents drove me back home and I checked into a psychiatric hospital. I spent 3 weeks in the hospital, got out for about 5 days and had to go back in because the Abilify they put me on gave me unbearable akathesia, then got out again in mid-June. They diagnosed me with severe depression with psychotic features, which by my reckoning was a pretty accurate diagnosis (even though I probably could also be manic--see below) and put me on Risperidone, which really, really sucked. I was crazy, legitimately crazy during that time, all I could think about was either taking drugs or wanting to die or both. In August I went back in because I made another attempt and ended up in the hospital again, spent a month there, and then a month at an inpatient program and then 3 months at a farm for sad drug addicts which I left because I had health problems. That was January. As a result of me being crazy and also the treatment for craziness, I had gained about ~50 pounds from stress eating and medication, I had skin fungus, I didn't shave, etc.


For about two months I was like that, basically I smoked a lot of weed and tried to order drugs off the internet and was so, so stupid, so unbelievably stupid. Then my psychiatrist at the time diagnosed me with ADHD and a Learning Disability then gave me a bunch of Adderall and Vyvanse, and that made me even crazier and more desperate for some kind of chemical help. I stole money from my parents to buy weed and a couple of times cocaine, almost got a possession charge, and did a lot of other dumb stuff. It was like I couldn't stop—I don't remember how I felt then, it's years ago now, less than five years but more than one, but from my actions it appears that I just couldn't , whether it was mania, or Adderall or whatever, I'd just keep doing the same stuff over and over again. Like I'd go out in my parents car to smoke weed with my friends even though my mom was begging me to stop, just to feel slowed down for a little bit. At the time though, I loved the Adderall, it gave me the motivation to shave and shower consistently and it made me lose a bunch of weight. And somehow I felt it even made my personality better like girls were more attracted to me when I when I was on it. It was weird because I was crazy on one hand but accomplishing things on the other. During this time I graduated from a six month full time culinary program, took two creative writing courses and made plans to return to college.


The summer made me crazy, or my culinary program ending gave me too much time. I went to raves and did a bunch of molly which was fun, but I ended up in the hospital again because I tried to commit suicide by overdose. That was stupid and I knew it was stupid because I read so much about how to commit suicide and knew that overdose rarely works. After that I spent a month in a mental hospital and somehow convinced my parents to send me back to college. By the time that month in the hospital was up, I gained back all the weight I had lost on Adderall (they took me off of it) and stopped taking care of my appearance. In addition I was on about 15 milligrams of Zyprexa, which as anyone who has been on it, will make you blow up like a balloon.


Call it gumption, or maybe some level of privilege, or maybe just the effect of time, but somehow I've been stable since then which is to say I've been stable enough to stay at college for three years. Next semester, I will graduate college with a bachelors in computer science from one of the best undergraduate programs in the country. Getting this far was hard, for me at least, I don't know if it would be hard for anyone else. One of the fictions that tided me or comforted me during that lost year was the idea that I'd come back from this crucible or whatever it was and write a novel or something beautiful that would keep people alive, or maybe I had some profundity to impart to others like I was a prophet shouting in the desert. Never really worked out though, I realized about a year in that I didn't have the temerity to make it in the literary world, got drunk one night and decided to become a Computer Scientist.


Now here I am after my fourth semester of doubling and tripling on Computer Science courses. I'm trying to find internships and I've wondered if the application process would've been easier if I hadn't been concerned with fiction and literature, or spent more time doing extracurriculars, or had started my Computer Science major earlier, or had double majored in math, or my GPA hadn't sucked because I was either suicidal or on heavy antipsychotics for several years, etc. But you know those are good things to wonder, good problems to have compared to where I was three years ago. I'm not actively trying to kill myself or crazy on drugs and even though I'm really emotional and anxious all of the time (as always), I can control it. In addition I quit smoking and joined a sports team so even though I still have a barrel stomach and stress eat a lot, I'm pretty athletic and have lost a decent amount of weight. When I started this rant, I going to complain about not being able to talk to girls or whatever, but I had to start from the beginning to explain why that was, and ended up telling you what was/is really on my chest. So yeah."
24w4wh,2,2014-05-06,Trouble with female authority?,[deleted],BPD,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/24w4wh/trouble_with_female_authority/,"I've found most women in position of power in the workplace, or female authority figures, and I, do not get along. Most male authority figures really like me, and tend to be more helpful on average than their female counterparts. This is causing much turbulance in the workplace, and even in my job search. For instance, just today, i got an application from one retail store. The female manager who gave it to me looked down her nose at me and frowned, and told me to turn it into a store at a different location. I turned it in at the store nearest my apartment, as was my intention in the first place, and the male manager there right away gave me a big smile, said they're always looking for great people, gave me a mini impromptu interview and his business card and said i'd hear back in a week once the app was processed.

These are vastly different opposing treatments.

Even at my current workplace, the male managers often look out for me, stand up for me when the female managers unfairly try to punish me, diminish my hours, try to write me up, or fail to pay me for days ive worked. Im a good worker; hardworking, show up on time, fill in for people who dont bother to call off or show up, get work done on time, multi task, good customer service. Im often getting customer compliments. 

Female teachers ive had in school would pick on me as well... 

i really do not understand why female authority figures go out of their way to make work/school difficult for me, or to talk down to me, tell me my work is poor and im not good at what i do...while male authority figures are often telling me how great my work is, offering me more work hours, offering me internships at their companies, and so on?

is this a bpd thing? Why dont women like me? (i am a lady by the way, if that factors into anything).

edit: i also dont think im treating female authority poorly or in a way that would warrant them treating me differently. It seems to be from the get-go, as soon as i meet them, im pegged as different and am ""tested"". There has been one exception: I started work at a different location for my current company, and it  only has female employees- they treat me well, and a lot of them have more ""masculine"" personality traits while at the same time taking pride in the fact we're all ladies. everyone is treated fairly. I dont know if this is because there are no men to compete with or what. 

I am also fairly good looking, and competent, maybe women see this as a threat? 

i really do not know. 

one thing i know for sure is that i like being treated with respect, and i dont have an issue with authority unless they start something with me - testing me, setting power plays. one female manager even told me she accussed me of shoplifting and humiliated me in front of customers because she thought i'd just take it, and didnt think id say anything about it. Another female manager told me that the customers are smarter than me (despite my computer science degree) and to just accept that. It blows my mind how crappy people can be.

**CPU**: chose the 4770k for its hyperthreading over the i5 as I'm planning to use this computer for work/school Java development.
Overclocked this right now to 4.4Ghz (29 Idle, 65 Load)

**CPU Cooler**: looks good with the Case/280mm cooling/didn't want to use a H100i, there are so many builds with that.

**RAM**: Mostly for the looks, got a good deal on the 1866Mhz speed Dominator Platinums.
Got the 2x8gb set upgradability in the future. Maybe video editing? 

**Mobo**:Originally wanted a sabertooth but the formula comes with better components, integrated sound card, wifi, crosschill (watercooling coming in the near future) for only ~70 dollars more

**SSDs**: put these in RAID 0 with a GPT OS install and backing up to the HDD. 

**HDD**: Going to be holding more games if I fill up the SSDs and also for photo storage/editing storage

**GPU**: Was planning on getting a normal 780 for 1440p gaming but got a sweet deal on the Classified version. Overclocked to 1200Mhz currently with temp target at 72 degrees C. Boost clock up to 1397Mhz

**PSU**: Considering SLI in the future when the ROG swift comes out. Sleeved cables were not as nice as I expected so I got the Bitfenix extensions.

**Fans**: Considerably quieter over stock fans.

**NGFF SSD**: Got this to utilize the NGFF SSD Slot on the Formula and it's currently being used to cache for the HDD. 


Will be posting an update once I get the chance to stitch the cables."
24weh3,2,2014-05-06,Goddammit I didn't even get her name.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/24weh3/goddammit_i_didnt_even_get_her_name/,"There was this nursing student interning at the hospital I worked at. She's pretty, smart, caring, in the reserves, all that good stuff. She had a genuine smile and a good head on her shoulders.

And now she's gone...

My only concern is that I didn't get around to asking if she was seeing anyone. Or even get her name. I suppose one of the nurses who work can tell me that but I don't want to be or feel creepy about it. Now I'm thinking she really was interested and maybe wanted me to make the first move.

I've gotten better at talking to women amd can actually hold a decent conversation now. I thought I could ask with confidence if she was seeing anyone but it turns out I couldn't.

Now I could have been seeing something there that wasn't.  Maybe she was being nice and had no interest at all. But she's gone since her internship ended today and now I'll probably not see her unless she gets hired here or comes here for other reasons.

Missed opportunities will haunt you."

First build!
 
I've always wanted to build a PC but never understood the parts/process until I came to buildapc and used pcpartpicker. Through a few weeks, I did lots of research and came up with these parts. I got some good deals but probably overpaid on the keyboard and some other parts. 

Had these parts for over a month and finally got the H440 to build inside of this past weekend. This build is for gaming and Java development and testing. A little present to myself for the internship I am starting this summer.

24wlnt,0,2014-05-06,25/M and I need advice on how to keep myself from sleeping with my intern 22/F,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/24wlnt/25m_and_i_need_advice_on_how_to_keep_myself_from/,"This is going to require a bit of background and a certain degree of undertanding that I'm in this situation and the easy solutions (which seem logical) aren't possible... I may ramble a bit and I appreciate you bearing with me on this.

So, I'm a Vice President in my father's company, I was fortunate in that I was drawn to our line of work from a very young age and have been groomed for my position (and to be in my dad's position as CEO/President in less than 5 years) since I was very young. This gives me the unique advantage of being able to closely relate to what an intern needs from there term with us, as well as having an immense knowledge and skillset in my industry. This means that any interns we take on, are trained by me, and this has worked out great for us, we hire almost 40% (up from less than 10% before I took over) of the interns we take on.

Well, for our summer intern program it was decided at this particular sub-company (my company owns a majority in this other company, but we aren't the day-to-day management. We also sell things for this company from our main business and the ""root"" company) that my time was going to be so limited I could only take on one intern, no big deal we've been running the program at max for 2 years now a break will be nice.

Now to the crux of the issue and why I'm almost having a panic attack... That one intern? She's attractive... no that's not it, she's drop dead gorgeous. How do I know? Well I got her info today to start the paperwork and I did what I always do whenever we start working with/for anyone... I did some Google stalking. I stumbled across her instagram, and it appears she bar tends at a bar that requires very little clothing, as well as models for a sexy lingerie company, and oh yeah she's a cage dancer at a night club on occasion. You guessed it, we pulled her from the well known party school in our region.

Now, I already tried backing out of bringing her on, but it turns out her dad is exceptionally well know, wealthy, and involved in our industry. So we can't kick her to the curb. I've had attractive interns in the past and had no issue keeping it in my pants. While I'm pretty average in the ""looks"" department, I know I still get a big help  because of my status in the company, income, potential career benefits, and similar age to the interns. I've had three interns in the past cross the flirty line with me while I did there required two week ""business trip"" and had no problem nipping that in the butt. In only one of those situations had the intern been drinking, surprisngly enough. Please don't think I'm generalizing all women's behavior here, but there's a reason 80 year old billionaires can marry beautiful 20-30 year olds...

This girl is a different level of attractive/sexy/hot, and judging by her ""odd jobs"" while she's at college, she's more than aware of what men think of her. Hell, she could make a great sales rep, talk about opening doors! And again those same pictures tell me she has no issue using her good looks to get ahead.

So, here's what I need. How can I make her no-longer sexually attractive to me? Or at least get the though of how awesome sleeping with her would be out of my head. In the past the possible consequences/stigma were enough of a deterrent, but this is different, I can't make that *click* in my head.

I know it's a leap to assume she'd be attracted to me, and maybe that's another idea (make myself seem unattractive). On top of the ""attractive features"" I listed above, I work mostly in sales, and I'm really fucking good at what I do. Being a proficient salesmen also affords me the ability to easily read people (body language, response type, etc) and manipulate a social encounter to my advantage (basically, I've never had a problem picking girls up in bars, it's not great for relationships but it works fantastic for finding strange). If I get on the road with this girl and decide ""ahh screw it lets do this"" I have very little doubt I could make it happen. This has me terrified to a point of panicking. I feel trapped, one half of me is saying ""hell yeah you're gunna tear that up!"" and the other half (my logical/adult/not horned up half) is saying ""This could destroy your reputation, or worse, you CAN NOT sleep with her, flirt with her, or even stare at her boobs too long dammit!""

Any help/advice/tips is very much appreciated. I hope this doesn't come across the wrong way (I understand I'm in a position many men would envy), but this job and company is my life... and I feel like if the wrong head makes a split second decision, I could make a mistake that could potentially be very hard to come back from. I don't want to be known as an intern fucker, not to mention her dad's position in our industry and... yeah you get the idea."

I've been interning at this company since the beginning of spring semester and they want to hire me after graduation. My boss gave me a tentative offer of around $45k and I'm not sure if this is a fair offer or not. This also includes full medical insurance, 2 weeks PTO, 2 weeks of holidays with a possibility of a $10k raise if certain conditions are met.

A little about me...

I live about 1.5 hours outside of a large metropolitan city. Population here is about ~100k people. 

I have a 2.6 Major GPA but did not disclose that when I applied for my internship.

I don't have any personal projects to show for outside of things done in class.

24wrtb,1,2014-05-06,Deprive me of sleep? Deprive you of Internet access! [Very Long],pettyinternetdenier,pettyrevenge,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/24wrtb/deprive_me_of_sleep_deprive_you_of_internet/,"[This is long, so please scroll to the bottom for a TL;DR.]

Setting: Shitty apartment in a group home in a major urban area with extremely high cost of living. [For those not familiar, group homes are houses often in expensive areas that try to minimize housing costs by maximizing tenants of a living space.]

Actors: Myself (hereafter listed as ""M""), terrible roommate #1 (hereafter referred to as ""R1""), terrible roommate #2 (hereafter referred to as ""R2""), and terrible landlord (hereafter referred to as ""L"").

Story: I recently moved to a new area and was in dire need of a place to live. I had very little money, was currently unemployed (but had a full-time internship in hopes of getting my big break), and needed somewhere with a bed for a few months. I found a shitty place on craigslist that was listed as a ""group home."" It was more of a slovenly cave in the basement floor of an condominium building, with barely enough room for 1 person and a fish bowl. It had 3 tiny rooms, a shitty kitchen and living area, and a couple of bathrooms. It was a terrible living space, but it was very cheap (relatively, of course--for its price, you could live like royalty in the midwest) and my only option. I signed a short-term lease and moved in.

R1 and R2 seemed very friendly at first. Or rather, they didn't seem unfriendly. But my very fucking first night was terrible, and it's the beginning of my quest to enact petty revenge. I had returned from my internship and got in bed by 11 PM. They were noisy and talking in the main living area, but I didn't mind. Eventually they left the apartment and I got to sleep. Suddenly I woke up. It was 3 AM and they had brought friends over. They were drinking, already drunk, and screaming and hollering about something stupid.

M: [Peeping my head out of my room] ""Hey, is everything alright? I heard some screaming.""

R1: ""Erwhat? Yeahiswear we're fine we're fun hahaha omg yeah we just wentout and danced SO FUN OMG haha oh you were sleeping? SORRY!!! HAHA omg I'm so drunk.""

R2: [Laughing and kissing some guy.]

At this point, a lead-lined mantle of regret was laid upon my shoulders. I knew exactly what I had gotten myself into. I had to choose whether to put up with this shit or duke it out. As I laid down back in my Harry Potter-esque, under-the-stairs-closet-style room, I decided I would just get along, finish the lease, and move to a place with respectable roommates. I just needed to play nice.

That decision didn't last long.

THE VERY NEXT NIGHT THE SAME SHIT HAPPENED. They were watching a movie and being boisterous at around 2:30 AM. Mind you, this is on a Tuesday. I'm not being a party pooper, I'm being an attempted-member of society trying to do well on an internship to get a job. I needed *some* sleep and I needed to get up very early.

M: ""Hey can you guys keep it down? I didn't sleep well since you had company last night and you're being really loud again...""

R2: ""We didn't ask you to go to sleep early!""

R1: ""It's not our fault you work during the day. We would evenings so we like to have fun after work. Not our problem.""

I retreated to my room again, defeated. I drafted a text message to my landlord that basically contained a complaint and a request to require peace and quiet late at night. I didn't think that was too much to ask. Apparently it was.

After sending the text message, I heard back from the landlord.

L: ""I'll try to talk to them but they have every right to make noise. You should buy ear plugs.""

M: ""Wait, what? At 3 AM they do not have the right to make noise. At 3 AM I have the right to sleep!""

L: ""There are no laws saying you can't make noise in your own home at night. Ear plugs will help.""

Fuck me, right? After a couple of nights of this shit occurring, 1 incident make me snap. The roommates were binge watching TV shows on one of their laptops in the living area (they could have done it in one of their rooms) at around midnight. I popped my head out to get some info for my revenge.

M: ""Whatcha watching?""

R1: ""Scandal. So good.""

M: ""Oh, big TV fans?""

R2: ""Yeah we watch shows every night.""

M: ""Oh... Cool..."" &gt;:)

The next morning I checked the wireless router in our ""apartment"" and found it was a simple Linksys router. Oh, this was going to be good. Typing 192.168.1.1 into my browser with knowledge of the default username and password cleared a wide berth for my plan. I found their MAC addresses for their phones and laptops through some snooping on the connected devices on the router's history. I added all devices except mine on the 24/7 restricted list.

That night when one of them returned from work (right before my bedtime) I heard the most satisfying shriek ever uttered by a living creature. It was the sound of harpy having a conscious amputation of its wings. To most, it would be agonizing and very alarming. To me, it was the sound of Jimi Hendrix making love to a guitar; it was the taste of a buttery, salty, sweet caramel; it was the feeling of a cold silk pillow on a warm morning.

M: ""Woah, what's wrong?""

R1: ""The Internet is down! UGH!!!""

R2 showed up later and echoed R1's anger in the Internet's ""inability"" to serve their needs. I shrugged it off, put in my newly purchased ear plugs, and smiled for the first time in a while.

This continued for about a week. I feigned ignorance every chance I got (""The Internet is still down? That's so weird!"" and ""Nope, I don't use the Internet. I read books. Hope it works for you soon, though!). Eventually one of them called L. He came by, couldn't log in either, and scheduled the cable company to come by and take a look. Oh no, my plan is foiled!

Not really. I just removed the restrictions on the day the cable person came.

After the cable company couldn't find any issues, the restrictions were back. After continued complaints by R1 and R2, L bought a new router. Magically, the Internet was back on! Until I reinstated the restrictions. It was a bit of a challenge on the new router, since it was a different brand. But with my limited computer savvy I figured it out.

The anger and frustration I witnessed in them was incredibly validating. I'm a very loving, friendly person, but the repeated times I asked for some consideration and respect were shoved in my face. So I decided to act. And it was glorious.

The apartment was significantly quieter from then on. There were the occasional parties and gatherings, but with ""unreliable"" Internet, our apartment was *not* the place to be. And so I managed to get by.

Towards the end of my lease, I found out one of the Rs had their community college finals coming up. All were online. Being the person that I was, or at least hoped to be, I did some prodding and removed the Internet restrictions before finals started. Expecting studying to be going on, and quiet to be a byproduct of studying, I felt fairly safe with my unrevenging. But the INSTANT I had the Internet back and running, music was blasting every hour they were home, shows were watched without headphones, and noise was rampant at all hours of the night. 

That was their one chance, and they blew it.

The very next morning the restrictions were back on. Cue the returned anger and complaints of R1 and R2. They spoke to L and didn't get a satisfying response. 

R1: ""But I have finals!""

L: ""I don't know what to tell you. The cable company says the router and connection are fine. It has to be your computer.""

R2: ""But my computer doesn't work either!""

L: ""I don't know what to tell you.""

R1: ""Hey M, do you have a computer?""

M: ""Me? Oh, yeah. I do. Why?""

R1: ""I have to use it and mine isn't working and I have an exam tomorrow and omggggg I need it now let me use it!!!""

M: ""... Not my problem.""

I never found out how finals went, but I do know that things stayed fairly quiet for about as long as my lease had left.

**TL;DR: My new roommates were avid online TV watchers, but didn't show any respect or consideration for quiet at night. So I put their devices' MAC addresses on a restricted list on our apartment network. I gave them several chances to quiet the fuck down and be respectful, but they got what they deserved. Oh, and I think one of them failed a final or two because of it.**"

        The Intern group updates all staff on their findings and process concerning Object 14573-A

        Dr. Wineholt explains to the interns that it's not possible than an object that massive would radiate heat and be an extra solar non orbiting entity.  She also corrects their Mass and Volume calculations as ""Drastically Overestimated."" 

        Dr. Chen claims all this is impossible.

        Dr. McHelan updates staff on diagnostic test.

Dr. Rathburn encourages the staff to send the findings to observatories in Germany, China, and New York.

The coming months were arduous, to say the least. I had made a deal with the Detective beforehand, I plead guilty to being an accessory to a crime and my sentence was five years of probation. I pulled the trigger on everyone, all at once. They arrested the Head of HR (HoHR) for murder, and she was convicted several months later. To the best of my knowledge, she's not only still in jail, but won't be up for parole until my children can vote. The CEO was convicted for insider trading, which is the blackmail that HoHR had on him. Money somehow escaped the laundry list of convictions, which I'm not sure how that happened. 

 Really Cool VP and several other VP's spun off into their own firm, and when they did they presented Skip and myself the opportunity to work with them at $NewCompany. We're both still there to this day, the PFY and myself. Work here is rather uninteresting compared to the events that happened at $Company, but I'd rather not be interesting. Motorcycle IT Guy decided  to move out of the area, and settled down somewhere in Arizona. The last I heard from him he had gotten married and was expecting a little one of his own. 

 Unfortunately, the events at $Company were completely true. When I decided to write my tale, as unbelievable as it sounds, I first contacted the Detective to ask if I should even bother. He has read over and given his blessing on this version of events. I wish I could say that I didn't have to change things to protect the innocent, no matter how few of them there were. Both Skip and the Detective read over this story, and both of them agreed that it's detached enough for it to protect ourselves. 

Since I know you won't appreciate a cliffhanger. Dan is currently retired. When $Company went under he decided that he was done. He survived a heart attack not too long ago, so I suppose he can't be in that great of health. 

 Oh, one last thing before I close this tale. The PFY has instructed me to write both a set of tales involving $Company before I was given Sword or MITG quit, and another set for the events at $NewCompany. I'll be starting those soon, so this isn't the last you'll hear from me. 

 Cheers, 
*rstrt*

Edit: 

 *I've been asked the same couple questions, I was convicted of Withholding evidence. It was a formality if nothing else, but they barely slapped me on the wrists. The folder I handed HoHR contained proof of other, more petty crimes, including a letterhead from her company that wrote that software. The folder was only to prove that I was serious and actually had something. There was a 'rumored' bit about the murder in the Black File, but I never acted on it since I assumed it was bogus. The Detective had me go in with a wire, and hoped that she would confess to pushing Intern. He got enough for an arrest, and she ended up pleading guilty and confessing later. I don't know exactly what they were arguing over, just that she pushed him to get him to back off. His death was really only an accident, but she tried to hide it for years before MITG told me about it.*

24wz6u,6,2014-05-06,Advice on a possible internship,Ribald_Partisan,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/24wz6u/advice_on_a_possible_internship/,"So, I interviewed for a full developer position but I didn't get it. The owner of the company mentioned that they do internships and that I would be a good fit. My time ran out on a problem and he told me I could submit it if I wanted when I was done. Of course I did.

It's been about a month. Summer's rolling around and I'm not seeing any internship posted or sign that they offer one. I'm a self-learner, though, and a lot of internships won't hire me because I'm not enrolled in school. I need a bridge so that I can have viable experience.

Is it too bothersome if I e-mail and ask about the internship? Or should I leave it alone and turn my attention elsewhere? I'm not afraid of being persistent but I also don't want to put strain on a bridge to a potential job in the future (I very much like this company.)"

24x69f,2,2014-05-06,I have no idea how to put this in words,secretsecrets11,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/24x69f/i_have_no_idea_how_to_put_this_in_words/,"I don't know if this is the right place to put this... maybe there isn't one. I suppose I'll start with a little back story. I grew up in a ""privileged"" household. I am an only child, and the only time I didn't get whatever thing I wanted was for moderation's sake. We were not millionaires, but definitely upper middle class. The best way to describe my mother was a romantic. She loved the good books where an honorable and upright man learned to love the strong-willed, wily, beautiful woman. They probably appealed to her because she always found another facet of herself in them. My father was a man of math, domineering. Living is a sum to him, measurable in the number of trips to the golf course only in a positive amount if the ""domestics"" comply to his wishes. Not that he was openly abusive then, but the charismatic and charming man of Mother's dreams was far from the deprecating man she married. Not that this was my father's only characteristic. He was always a curiously generous host, and often times the jokes he picked at my mother could be easily rebutted and laughed at instead of broiled over if she had but a sense of humor. It it a shame she didn't. 

From descriptions to events, I suppose things culminated and began to boil and roil over the sides a day a short number before Christmas. Mother had taken an innocuous trip to the bank only to discover that her name was nowhere on the paternally plastered savings account. Years later, I remember that car ride. Her frame trembling as a thin veneer over the tumultuous emotions within, a sum of about two thousand dollars from some offshoot account in her pocket the only money she had acquired from fifteen years of marriage. She had no scruple in letting that hurricane loose in the car. The sounds of her sobs are as unforgettable to me as the sound of the hellish storms that roar through our area every year, and no less terrifying. What words can describe the helplessness a spoiled feels while watching her Mother sob herself into pieces? 

She managed eventually to calm herself enough to call a locksmith to provide his services. I remember the irrational giddiness I felt at my father being unable to let himself in that day. My mother calmly walking to admit him, with me smiling all the while like a trickster in on another great joke. What followed over the next few days is trite and I therefore feel no need to delineate, especially considering that there is over two years of what is possibly One of the Worst Divorces in history, and some years following that left to tell. 

Father moved to his parent's house before he procured an apartment, a fifty year old man parodying a new college graduate. The only thing I feel worth mentioning about those preliminary days is this: I sat in my bed moping over the preponderate weight of a sad thing happening to me, me, of all people! Mother came in and declared in her wistful way of dealing with the bad, ""Oh daughter! Everything will be alright!"" I mention this only because her own words now seem like a sick joke. I suppose you know already, from the very posting of this to this subreddit, that things were not, in fact, all right. Shortly after this, my mother took to having me watch her sleep. I do not remember when this came about, such as when one hardly notices the boundary between a mist and a light rain. This progressed to placing precariously balanced bits of plastic supported on wood or some other sort of material over her head. Think a plastic storage box lid suspended over wooden sides of a desk with her ensconced underneath. Her explanation: people were shooting chemicals at her while she slept. I was immune because it was professional stalkers my father had hired to do this to her, to force her to relinquish custody over me, precluding him from the necessary child and other fees that he would have to pay in proportion to his substantive income. Things progressed to worse yet. My mother had designed our house to be open, with large windows in nearly every room and a preponderance of doors leading to the outdoors. I feel in is worth mentioning we live surrounded by woods, on land my grandfather purchased and gifted to him and his brother. We neighbor my father's brother to the right, and he is to the right of my grandfather. Back to the living conditions, five or six different mechanisms for locking were common for every entry in the house, with often times, to complete the regalia, a metal bar, specially made for this purpose, jammed under the door handle. She did this to keep the ""stalkers"" out, as she called them. We do live in a southern state, and she concluded that we were harassed by some masochistic group, bent on terrorizing gays and women with chemical weapons or other harassment techniques to gratify their desire for power. 

Mornings were the times I collected most of this information. She had not steeled herself for the day yet, and in the paroxysms of rage and hysteria that followed, I was exposed to the horrors that she claimed plagues her existence. Among these claims were that they were doing illegal medical experiments on her at night, (explaining the numerous locks on the doors), and harassing her in public through people hired for this purpose. She was at this point, working only on her education, (my father paid for all living expenses), for a degree as she had never finished college. At one point, she asked one of the people she identified as a lackey to the Stalkers how much they paid him. He grinned and replied, ""enough to pay for college."" She claimed she was raped. She claimed she was molested nightly. She claimed once, that she tried to wake me, but I was so deeply asleep it was obvious I had been anesthetized in order for them to mess with her without disturbing me, (remember, I had ""immunity""). I would like to pretend this is all one a schizophrenic delusion, as the doctors tell me her behavior was, but there are nagging things that I have seen that do give this terrible story credibility. I saw once a card to a strip club on the office desk. I can state, honestly, that neither of us have ever been, nor had the inclination to go, to a strip club. When asked, she sighed and responded resignedly, ""they do this all the time to mess with me."" She had also taken to wearing hats, to protect her head from the chemicals they sprayed at her from inside her car. On the freeway, a man drove past us with a sign that read ""nice hat."" It was inexplicable to me then but it now haunts me as sign that this may not all have been a delusion. I try not to think on these parts of my life when I do not have to, but the newly occurred event that prompted me to write this is dredging up things and making me consider them from a perspective that only one out of danger can take on one in it. What else could have possibly brought that man to hold such a pertinent sign to her case? I can think of no explanation other than the one supplied by my mother. Remembering this occurrence, I can still picture the smile that man had on his face, even though I haven't seen it in four years. Even more disconcerting, my mother has those fake veneer teeth to cover hers that were permanently stained by asthma medication as a child. They were implanted at a time when the technology hadn't advanced to where it is today, so every tooth was ground down in an excruciating process to make room for the false one.Even then, I remember thinking about how odd that was as a child. The office that had been outfitted with a flowing fountain and verdant vines to appease the calm men in white coats seemed odd, juxtaposed to the primitive thing they were about to do to her face. I digress. After a spur of the moment decision to visit the dentist who had given her the teeth, giving the Stalkers no time to bribe the dentist, my mother was told that the teeth she had now were not the teeth she was given, affirming her suspicions of the medical experiments. On the legal side of things, she switched attorneys no less than four times during the divorce. Once, when she went to collect her paperwork from an attorney who had served her use, the interns and whoever else collected it for her were visibly terrified and obviously wanted my mother and her things away. She believes they were bribed.

 I, on the other hand, suffered no physical harm besides the caustic living conditions I became used to. The house was rarely clean, with possessions dumped wherever was convenient, and a dog that was never potty trained so the whole place reeked of urine. The dog problem was solved quickly however. She had never been trained, so at any chance that presented itself to bolt from the house, she would. This time, she crossed the road and was ""hit by a car."" This is in quotation marks for I still know not of the truth. Here is how things progressed, however. After a fruitless search and searing cries of her name out to the uncaring trees in the darkness, I left for my room to let my mother continue the search. She entered to tell me the dog had been hit by a car had been found dead in the road. I was hysteric at this news. I would have been immensely sad at the death of my companion anyway, but I now lamented with all my selfish heart the deplorable condition of my mother. She, the aforementioned, had called my father. He appeared miraculously quickly to bury her and console me. Keep in mind he lived at this time thirty minutes away. I noticed nothing of the oddness of this; I was curled up around the hole in my stomach and bawling my soul out. Later, at my asking for the story some years later, she revealed that the corpse, on her inspection, seemed to bare knife marks, as if she had been stabbed. Mother also said the carcass was coated in a sticky substance, one she claimed was a favorite for them to shoot at her. Once, at the defecation of one of our dogs on my uncle's lawn, (remember, he lives next door), he threatened to shoot the dog. He was a man of an appreciation to alcohol's tint to all daily things, so I never took that threat seriously. I probably should have. Skipping around, our house was also broken into twice. As I stated, my mother designed our house, and fulfilled her dream of an indoor garden with its completion. The atrium is surrounded by windows opening to the dining room, living room, and master bedroom. On one occasion, we returned to the state of the art alarm system, (that my mother swore on her being was compromised), blaring and the doors to the atrium wide open, as if the malevolent personnes had had no time to make it a clean break in. Nothing was taken however, and if following the ""logic"" my mother presents, that was probably only a scare tactic. The other occasion, I saw the window screen in the master bedroom torn, as if someone had used it as an entrance. Mother had not even bothered to call the cops. She insisted the Stalkers were intimate friends with all law bodies and possessed tendrils extending all throughout the infrastructure of our small, local government. 

Life, during this time, seemed like one long storm with no shelter to relieve me from the rain. Everything was wet, so nothing was wet, but nothing was surely dry. I visited my dad at his apartment twice a week and every other weekend, but I felt it betrayed my mother to enjoy this feeling of comparative normalcy. I was scathingly jealous of my friends with closely knit, supportive families. Father acquired a second woman, who is honestly the sweetest and most pleasant woman in the world, if a little too submissive for my taste. Not that you could ever knew I thought this of her. I suppose I took my mother's hatred for my father out on her. We are on good terms now, but she will probably never get the apology she deserves from me. For that to happen, she would need to know my circumstances fully, and just writing this is chaotic and exhausting. I cannot imagine trying to tell it. Anyhow, I came out of the ""Dark Days"" as I call them, with the help of my tormentor and guardian and angel and helpless protector: my mother. If anyone has seen Breaking Bad, I suppose her method is comparable to the one Walter used to absolve his family of blame. She called my father, and told him everything that she knew he already knew. He was a diligent pupil, took his notes smartly, and within a week I was in custody. In my mother's view, he had finally accomplished his goal. 

I fear I must take myself back into this life though, or the event that has transpired will end it forever without me ever knowing the truth. My grand mother died a day ago, and my mother is now traveling to her hometown for the funeral and the final business. Though my father's main goal was custody of me to avoid paying child support, a sub goal  on his List of Super Malevolent Goals is to get my mother to leave this town and stay in her hometown, one clear across this country. She called me and told me of how when she went to the gym pool, she floated. She believes the injections from the stalkers have continued, and actually welcomes them, for she feels that without their ""medication"" she would surely perish. These she believes to be oil injections into muscle, as she looks flabby there. She told me that if she dies in her hometown of a heart attack, to know what really happened. Through this ordeal, I have lost any trace of religion I have ever had, (not that I have ever instilled with much in the first place), but strangely enough, I comply to and enjoy looking for ""signs."" Whether there is truly some cosmic being proving extra-terrestrial aid, or if desperate people simply cling to the most substantive of nothings, I feel it is finally time to tell something of my story. Reading back over this, I realize the discursive nature of it, but trying to put this in any chronological order is difficult for me. When one thinks back on their life, it is usually comparable to a constellation. The bright spots of light are remarkable events that easily come to mind and are fully seen. Connecting these spots together though, with beams of light, requires some imagination. As when looking at the real stars, we have to imagine the scorpion its tail or the Orion his belt, some effort is required to see the person in one event as an extension of the person in the other, and it is with even more difficulty that we can connect the person we are now with the person we were then. My late childhood denies me a lovely, clear cut constellation. My stars are not clear points of light, but a nebulous fog that scatters all light, enveloping me, leaving me as lost and helpless now as I was then.  "

I would appreciate any advice!",throwawaytxgf,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/24x7e3/22m_i_am_considering_moving_in_with_my_gf_22f_to/,"tl;dr Gf moving out of state, make or break situation. If I move in with her, I keep a healthy relationship, but risk not finding a job in my field. If I stay back, I break everyone's hearts, but may have slightly more opportunity (but still run risks of a state/city that's not in the greatest of shape in comparison to the one she is moving into). 

Hello, for the past couple months I have been torn. I will try to explain this as best as possible. First, thanks for your time in reading this.

My girlfriend and I have been dating for a little over 3 years. Met freshman year in college and we recently graduated. We have been having the time of our lives, and we really do love each other. We click very well, and have so much in common. We get along really well with each other's families as well. The last semester of college, I was doing an internship in one state, and she was doing student teaching in another state, so it was pretty tough, but we managed to get through (I visited her once, and she visited me once). Before leaving for our respective states, we talked about what we thought should happen....we decided to stick it out together. And we made it. Now, she was offered a job in the state she taught in, and I have no job offers at this point. 

Initially a couple years back, we talked and agreed that careers come first, and relationships second. I believe that this mindset has changed, as she asked me to move in with her, despite me having no positions lined up. I have talked to my parents about this, and they are not sure what to think. From the sound of it, they are suggesting to not move in without a job. Their argument is that where I live there is plenty of opportunity (big city), and that I have established connections/networks here. My parents are really smart people, and I trust them, although they can drive me a little crazy at times if I stay in the house too long. On the other hand, my gf has been waiting and waiting and waiting. I almost feel like I owe it to her by moving in. I really did miss her the past semester. I have stayed over in her house many times in college, and I can definitely see myself living with her. Additionally, her argument is that I can find a job no matter where I go (it's a different matter of finding the job in the field I want to go into, however). The city she is moving into has been experiencing a lot of job growth, especially in comparison to the city/state I live in now. I will say that parents on both sides are supportive of whatever decision I make. Another note I should maybe make is that my financial situation at this point is relatively sound, and no college debt. 

I have stated to my gf that I would feel bad/guilty not contributing a lot to living expenses, that I would be a burden. She has said constantly that it would not be a problem based on the salary that she will be receiving. I don't know how/if this mentality will change over time.

Very recently, she has been putting on a lot of pressure to make a commitment. She has told me multiple times that she would feel that if I were not to go, then our long distance relationship ""would be for nothing."" I couldn't bear breaking her heart. I have been constantly going back and forth between moving in or not, and have been telling her what I wanted to do without trying to sound like I was committed one way or the other. I have applied to multiple jobs in the state I live in now (where she also lives), and she hasn't been too happy about it because while I say I want to move in with her, I am applying for jobs in other places. It has been extremely difficult to make any sort of commitment. I have applied for a couple jobs to the state/city she is planning on moving to. It is very difficult, however, to apply for positions out of state. I understand her frustration with my lack of commitment. She likes to get her hopes up about things, and as soon as she does, I tell her I applied for another position somewhere else. She has said that if she was in my position, the decision would be much easier than I am making it out to be. And this is where I get most upset, because this has been one of the hardest decisions of my life. If I go, I get to stay with her, but run the risk of not finding a job in my field. If I stay, I break her heart, and while there are plenty of opportunities here, I still run a risk. 

I have been torn for months. One day, one option will be the most perfect idea ever. The next day, I am realizing it is the worst idea ever. I want what is best for the greater good, but I realize that sacrifices will be made no matter which way I choose. It really is a bad position. Again, thank you so much for your time and advice.

If you need any more clarification, please let me know. "

This is my second post today. Today is my first day of summer, so I sat down for twenty minutes and wrote down all the things that I'd like to do this summer. Here they are. 

-Get 5 girls phone numbers

-Make out with 2 girls

-Have sex

-Save $1000 dollars, give my dad $1000

-Go on a bike ride of 50+ miles

-Do voice-over work

-Learn to code; spend an hour a day learning coding.

-Get on a solid schedule. Wake up at 6 am, get in bed by 10.

-Show my friends gratitude.

-Get an internship for the Fall.

-Read 16 books.

-Get back into shape.

-Learn to cook.

-Learn to garden.

-Volunteer 40 hours.

-Quit smoking weed.

Play 10 open mics.
-Get paid to play a show.

-Keep my room clean.

-Upgrade my wardrobe.

-Read every night before bed.

-Travel somewhere I've never been before by myself.

-Get a hard drive and flash drive.

-Get on a budget. (Was thinking $35 a week, did some calculations and came out to $45. I'm thinking to limiting myself to $40 a week. -Stop using my debit card.

May be a lot, but I think that if I start tomorrow (I started today, but not really) I'll be good. I'm thinking about not posting on here for my second trip to 90 days, but we'll see. I just feel like I spend too much time on this sub. 

In particular, I need to focus on the first three. I'm not saying that if I don't do them all, I'll be upset. Instead, I just want to make sure that I actually pursue women. Recently, I've been broke and flatlining. I just got a job, and am coming out of the flatline. There's a girl in my class that likes me who I'm going to be meeting up with later in the week. Hopefully things go well. "
24x9z7,24,2014-05-06,My Online MBA Experience,PennStateOnlineMBA,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/24x9z7/my_online_mba_experience/,"As more reputable business programs begin to offer online MBA options, I figure my experience may be of some use to those considering this route.

**About me:** Business Admin undergrad from an ACC school, 3.25 GPA, 650 on the GMAT, and a military background with two years of experience when I submitted my applications to Arizona State and Penn State.  I was admitted to both and selected Penn State’s iMBA program.


**Selecting a program:**  Those of you who have looked into multiple online programs have probably realized that the design of each program varies significantly from school to school.  Most of the more reputable programs have a set course load for you to complete over a 1-2 year time frame.  Some schools require in-person appearances every semester to take final exams while other well-regarded programs online require as little as 3 days for in person orientation.  Penn State’s program requires 2, week long residencies.  The number of credits for the degree also varies.  I ultimately chose Penn State over ASU because PSU’s 48-credits featured more interesting classes compared to ASU’s 42 credit program.

Cost is another important factor to consider.  During my search, it seemed as if most online programs had the same or more cost of tuition as their brick-and-mortar counterparts.  However, the main benefit of the online route is that you do not have to sacrifice wages for two years as with full-time programs.  Some employers are also very generous with assisting employees with continuing education, but this is different for everyone.  Some tax incentives also applied in my case that lowered my taxable income by several thousand dollars.  In all, the listed tuition for Penn State was around $55,000 for the entire program.  Tax incentives and employer assistance reduced this to approximately $48,000 in my case.

At this point, I am going to speak more directly about my experience with the Penn State Interschool MBA (iMBA) program, but many of the themes likely apply to other online MBAs.

**PROs:** 

*Flexibility.* Each online program is different, but the concept is the same: study anywhere you have an internet connection. I had to attend two week-long residency classes over two years. Everything else was done online. I was an Army officer during the entire program and completed 18 credits of the program via a very slow internet connection in Afghanistan. Most of the assignments were due at the end of each week, to include timed exams. As long as you finished in the allotted amount of time, you were fine. You will most likely do a significant amount of teamwork during the program. Most teams in my program met 1-2 times a week on a fixed schedule for about 30-45 minutes each meeting.

*Cost.* Although most of the more prestigious online programs cost the same as their full-time counterparts, you actually save a lot of money if you continue to work through the program (ie you don't pay the opportunity cost of forfeiting your current income). Most employers also pay some sort of subsidy for continuing education. I'm not 100% sure, but I believe you will need to pay taxes on any amount of educational benefit over $4500/year.  

*Networking.* You'll need to put some effort into this, but if you attend one of the better online programs you'll likely meet other students working roles in upper management at big firms. Two of my best connections are a R&amp;D manager at a Johnson and Johnson subsidiary and a SVP at a Fortune 1000 tech company. Although this was a plus for me, it is no guarantee of other people's experience. I think networking opportunities at traditional programs are much greater than online ones.  I eventually got a pretty good job based solely on the recommendation of the SVP at the tech firm (as in they created the position specifically for me based on his recommendation).

*The Degree.*  My diploma says “Pennsylvania State University, Master of Business Administration.”  No mention of online, no asterisk.  It is the same diploma handed to those who graduate from Smeal full-time program.  My resume also states the same.  Although I do not claim to have attended the Smeal School of Business, my resume does not state that my MBA was done online.  I am honest in all interviews when asked on the matter, but in reality it has come up in less than 25% of interviews.

**CONs:**

*Class structure.* The design of my program was extremely do-it-yourself. Here's a wall of the professor's notes to read, 1-2 chapters of textbook readings, and participate in these discussion forums with your classmates. This structure allowed for slacking from students and (some) professors alike. Traditional lectures via webcam (what I expected going in) are virtually non-existent. Weekly professor office hours were held through conferencing software similar to GoToMeeting, but a majority of them were not mandatory. Some students skated through a two year program and earn a 3.2 because of the lax structure. It really added to the online-isn't-worth-it stigma.

*Classmates.* Just as a rough estimate, I think about one-half of the program could get into a pretty decent MBA program (within the top 25) if they didn't go the online route. The other half weren't exactly dumb, but they were either extremely lazy or lacked business acumen.

*Networking/Recruiting/Employment Opportunities.* This is probably the biggest shortcoming of online programs in my opinion. First, a lower-quality of students mixed with considerably less face time leads to less opportunities for networking. Next, corporate recruiters target future MBAs on campus, not through Internet correspondence. Most Fortune 100s groom their MBA hires by first picking them up for a summer internship after their first year, then hire them in the fall. Finally, the dominating opinion in the business world is that a full-time MBA is better than part-time or online MBAs. It's most likely true, but not to a great extent IMO. I've filled out resumes that were very specific in their requirements for MBAs from full-time programs (ie they excluded part-time and online applicants).

*No degree specialization.* I think this is true for most online programs. You take the same 42-48 credits as your entire cohort so you end up with a mass of people with a general management-type MBA. I wanted to specialize in supply chain management and I missed out on a MBA in SCM by going the online route. I don't think this will really hurt me in the end, but I wish I could have studied more in the topics that piqued my interests.

**Results:**  I finished the program in the allotted two years with a 3.8 GPA.  I left my job in the military for the private sector four short months after graduating.  My networking with quality classmates in the program led to several good interviews with large companies (JnJ, GE) and eventually a position with a mid-sized tech firm.  Although my starting salary (ballpark $90k/year + 10% annual bonus) will not be as high as most of my full-time counterparts, the fact that I continued to earn high wages through my degree resulted in a greater NPV for the online route vs the traditional MBA route (assuming avg. tuition + salary information for a CMU grad over 5 years after graduation and assuming a 7% discount rate with 4% annual wage increases across all jobs).

**Advice:** If you travel a lot for work, live too far from a reputable part-time/evening program, and cannot take off two years to attend a top or mid-tier MBA program, then an online program from a reputable school may be a good option for you.  At the end of the day, you need to really ask yourself if getting this degree is worth it to you personally and professionally. How much will your employer assist with tuition and what sort of time will you owe in return for their assistance? Is it something you really want? What opportunities will it open for you that you wouldn't see without it? 

I welcome any constructive criticism or questions to this post.  I will continue to monitor this post through this throwaway account.  I look forward to the discussion and hope that some of you find it informative.

24xa2s,5,2014-05-06,Tutorial for learning Python that assumes you already know C/C++?,[deleted],learnpython,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/24xa2s/tutorial_for_learning_python_that_assumes_you/,"I've got an internship lined up for the summer and they want me to learn Python or Perl for the position.  Python seems to be more popular, and everyone says it's easy to learn, so here I am.  I'm a computer engineering major, so pretty all of my experience with programming is in C (with a little bit of x86 assembly, ARM assembly and C++ on the side).  Now to my question.

Is there a good Python tutorial out there for people that already know C fairly well?  All of the tutorials I can find (which are very few) start out assuming I know nothing about programming, which makes it difficult for me to find what I need.  It would be nice if there was a tutorial out there that said ""arrays in C are equal to lists in Python"" or ""input is equal to scanf in C"".  So I thought I'd come on here and see if anything like this exists.  If not, I'll just keep looking stuff up individually.  Thanks!"
24xbhr,3,2014-05-06,"Question about possible ""limitations"" on future job opportunities because of internships and experience",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/24xbhr/question_about_possible_limitations_on_future_job/,"Sorry for the wall of text, my issue may be similar to others, but my background is just providing some insight to my situation:

**My Background**
So I have had some luck regarding internships since I've started pursuing my BS in CS. With my background with the military for a few years and some decent grades, I've been able to somehow work my way into a few positions. 

I live in a city with a relatively healthy tech scene and I landed a continuous internship (they call it an apprenticeship) with what is arguably the biggest corporation in the city. 

I had an ""in"" and had a referral for the program, but during the interview process it's just called a ""technical apprentice"" position and they put you on a team depending on who you interviewed with and what team they happen to be on if they decide they liked you. So, you could be put on a mobile development team, or a backend support team, etc etc. The position I got was being put under an engineer who is part of the solution translation team (translates the software into the languages that the company supports, among other related things) who handles all of the technical aspects that arise on this team. So I dealt with backend packaging of translated strings, client and internal SR's, testing, etc.

I had another ""in"" with what is arguably the second largest tech company in the city, or at least the fastest growing, and was told that I would be ""perfect"" for this summer internship position this year in which I will be supporting some of the internal business solutions on the backend side as a system analyst. There was no real application process since I had a solid referral, so I couldn't opt for a specific position, if they even offered that chance.

**The issue** is that I have no interest working a career as a systems engineer or dealing with any sort of heavy IT role. I enjoy coding and development and have been slowly teaching myself mobile development on top of the little software development I've had a chance to do. Because of the luck I've had with the internships and some of the vagueness of the application process, I've just rolled with whatever I could get. I didn't want to act ungrateful for the opportunities, they are extremely great positions in which I've learned a great deal and I'm humbled that I was looked at. I felt having two of the bigger companies in a growing tech city on my resume would be beneficial, regardless of the position, as long as it was dealing with CS in some way. 

I'm really worried that I may be limiting myself to doing what I want to do as I feel like I'm on this system engineer path that I didn't really plan to do, I just sort of fell into it. Does anyone have any advice or similar experience? I'd really like to pursue a career with a startup or smaller business as a mobile developer, but if I find myself applying at larger companies, will I even get looked at much for the role that I want?

**tl\dr** Have you ever felt like your job/experience is taking you down a career path you would prefer not to go down?

Thanks, I appreciate any response! Let me know if I can provide a resume for overview if that may help for some reason.

Edit: Please let me know if there is a better suited place for this. The weekly internship advice thread seemed to be a little dead."

Looking for some advice!,I_Just_Want_It_All,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/24xbvp/any_nc_state_studentsalumni_on_this_subreddit/,"I will be joining the Wolfpack in the fall as a Mechanical Engineering student. I am looking for any advice that may make my transition easier in the slightest way. These are my initial concerns:

* What sort of computer I should look into buying? [(recommendations here)](http://www.eos.ncsu.edu/soc/laptops/buying_new)

* Would it be beneficial to have both a laptop and a desktop?
 
* What I programs I should load and where could I get them as inexpensively as possible hopefully? Aside from the obvious Microsoft Office (I have that covered; I picked up a license for Office 2013 through an internship for $10. Score!) and such. 

I have basically a $3,000 limit which I would think would be plenty to invest in a solid laptop, a solid desktop, printer, cables, cords, etc and maybe a tablet (if the money will allow) for the next four years and it will be covered by a scholarship. 

Some additional questions:

* What exactly is MatLab?
* As an ME, should I learn any programming or coding?
* Is there anywhere that I could take a sort of ""refresher"" for Pre-Calc and college algebra? I have not had a math class in three semesters and I am worried that Calculus is going to destroy me...

Any general advice would be greatly appreciated as well!! Thank you!"

24xdmo,3,2014-05-07,I think im a lost cause now,[deleted],Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/24xdmo/i_think_im_a_lost_cause_now/,"long story short I have pretty much given up on the Mental Health Care industry for any help after 12 years of failure.

Been diagnosed with Depression and PAnic Disorder since 2002. Have a history of hospitalisations for suicide attempts. Most recent one was over the last few days. After severe increase migraines and anxiety each day over the previous week I pushed myself to work through the week as I had taken day off the previous week.
Well by the time I got to Friday night I pretty much collapsed mentally and physically and went into a complete force 9 Panic Attack with waves of at times severe suicidal urges, which lasted until Monday. 
On Monday morning I couldnt take it anymore and decided to either kill myself for good or check myself into the mental ward, or at the very least get some meds to try and hopefully break the cycle for good. I got my wife to drive me to the hospital, although I freaked out on the way and got out and walked. My headspace by that time was a complete mess, it had reached its critical mass. I tried to explain as well as I posisbly could at the time what I was going through and that I needed urgent help.
Basically I was then interviewed with the exact same questions from three different people, a nurse, an intern and then a psychiatric emergency doctor and a trainee. Basically at the end of all the questions they just asked me why I was there and what I expected them to do to help. I was almost in tears and asked what else I should have done or whereelse I should have gone and they psychiatric doctor gave me a card with the emergency mental health number on it.
He then told me ""I dont want to come across as patronizing, but its really great you made the choice to come in here and that you had been doing exposure therapy. So thats really good. But we dont think its in your best interest to give you any medication right now as we dont want it to interfere with your exposure therapy, and we think admitting you would be worse for you right now.""

and that was basically it, all he offered was someone to give me a call the next afternoon if I wanted just to see how I was. I asked him point blank, in the meantime what should I do if I have a serious suicidal emergency. He told me to call the number on the card. And I said what if I am having that suicidal emergency RIGHT NOW!
I got a blank look from him and then he said I should talk to them and they can recommend to the hospital if I should be admitted or not.

So that was basically it. I asked if I had to check out or see anyone or blood tests or anything and he said no. They gave me a phone to call my wife to pick me up. I was physically shaking almost violently at that point. I tried multiple times to call but it came up engaged each time. I took a break to go to the toilet and come back and try again as I had no other way to get home. But the room I was in they had taken the phone and the psychiatric doctor was no where to be seen. I didnt know what else to do so I figured I would just go home, distraught and practically in tears. Another doctor walked past me and asked if I was ok and I said no. He obviously sensed something wrong as he asked if I minded stepping aside and talking to him for a minute.
I did my best to explain my current situation and he agreed I could probably do with some immediate help, went and talked to the psychiatric doctor but then came back again saying the exact same thing they didnt want to prescribe me with anything, and they didnt want to admit me in the hospital.

So I walked out and caught two buses to get home, and a few hours later I called the Emergency Mental Health line again because I had more of the panic/suicide waves coming back again. The guy I talked to was helpful but said he couldnt really do anything other than try and talk me through the crisis or recommend an emergency room.

I somehow made it through Monday night without much sleep and made it to work and got through work somehow, purely by focus, distraction and lots of coffee. Although I was unable to eat anything. Again by the time I got home, or even on my way home the waves of panic and suicidal urges started again. This led to the most serious panic attack I may have ever had. In the space of about 1 hr I got into an argument with my wife, asked for a divorce, had another phone call with the mental health service. Although when I called the emergency number on the card the Psychiatrist gave me the lady got mad and said I called the wrong number. I was distraught and said that was the only number I had and that was what the doctor who refused to admit me or help medically said I should go to.
She said obviously I got it wrong and gave me the number I ""apparently"" should have called (which no one had given me). The lady on the other end was nice but couldnt really do much either. I got my wife to drive me to the hospital again but a different one this time as I felt I ran out of options. They were very busy though, I explained my predicament and the severe anxiety and panic of being in th eroom and having everyone looking at me funny or not wanting to approach me. They promised to get me a quiet safe room I could sit in while waiting but it never happened. I kept getting hot sweats and nausea and went outside multiple times to throw up.
Eventually after a couple of hours I gave up and asked to call my wife. Again it was engaged, so I said to them I am just going to go. She said ok.

So I walked to the closest train stop and got off at the closest stop to my house and got home after about an hour. Well then shit had hit the fan because apparently the hospital called my wife because they realised I had really left and were worried about if something happened to me. I figured none of them could give a shit and had just gone home. And yeah I still feel guily about that now.
But anyway my wife said when she got there the nurse came straight out to talk to her directly and a doctor came out too. My wife was amazed that not only they let me go in that state but I had no one even come out to talk to me even briefly during that entire time.

I couldnt help thinking that being 37, male, sweating, figeting, shaking, vomiting, agitated, that I was some kind of drug addict or abuse husband or something. Basically no one has followed up with me since, and I have been doing a lot of thinking and I need to go it alone for a while.

I have decided to take a break from Exposure Therapy and Group Therapy for a month or two, find a different GP, get my meds sorted with a different Psychiatrist, and never go to the Mental Health Services if needing urgent assistance again. Not really looking for advice but happy to listen to it or if anyone has similar experiences. But I really just needed to get this off my chest today.

My name is (name). I am a student at Loyola University New Orleans and I came across your job listing. Though it it a few weeks old, I hope you are still considering applicants. I started programming in high school while in statistics class, after completing lecture material and homework and after being told by the principal that wandering the halls during class wasn't an appropriate use of my time. so on my TI-81 I programmed most of the common functions that I encountered in stats as to leave more time to i guess program more niche stats problems (and eventually adding additional prompts to make the programs more user friendly for classmates to use). This continued in college for basic math, physics, and chemistry problems until one day a teacher told me about a more advanced programming class that they were having trouble filling seats in, and with electives to spare I took it. In this class I was thrown in the deep end, but I learned a few valuable things mostly documentation and that you can loop without ""If...Goto"". And since the class had assignments that were available in several languages, I learned to choose the platform I was using carefully. after this I took the introductory Programming courses at Loyola in order to finish with a minor in Computational Sciences. 

One of the things that drew me to your internship is in fact that I have only dabbled in one of the languages (Ruby course on codecademy though I don't know if this is Ruby on Rails) you suggest that an applicant be familiar with (I'm gonna end this sentence with a citation instead of a preposition in case you are a stickler about those things http://www.grammarbook.com/grammar/probPrep.asp, if not carry on). I would love to learn new syntax and the strengths of a new language over the summer, especially while using it solve new problems and develop applications that make peoples lives easier and hopefully less stressful. All of this being a little behind my desire to start an internship that could help me start a career in development of other applications and tools.


So attached are my resume (Resume.docx) viewable in Microsoft Word 2010 or more recent, two sample programs: one that was used to calculate the temperature change and energy associated with a bomb calorimeter it will also measure the temperature change for a pressure constant calorimeter, though it will give an incorrect reading for the energy associated with it (calorimetry.vi) which runs in LabView. The input requires a tabulated text file of the temperature readings over time. The next program is a simple Postfix calculator that I made for class (stack.exe for the program, stackexedocumentaion.docx for the code and documentation) executable in windows and viewable in Microsoft Word 2010 or more recent. 

I hope these give you an idea of my qualifications, and I hope more than that, that I meet your expectations in a candidate. for any additional questions, you can email me at (email) or you can call or text me at 757.817.5128.

How big of a deal are short run jobs and gaps for a junior web developer? To be more concrete: I started an internship, which quickly turned into a junior role last year. This whole episode lasted 6 months, after which I had to move to another country, where I found a remote junior role.This role lasted close to 4 months, and because of mounting communication issues I quit. 

I've decided to take time off, heal burnout, and learn some new things. I've been diving into machine learning and I've been contributing to a cool OSS project.
After 4 months I'm moving *back* to where I came from and I'll be looking for a job again. 

**tl;dr** I have a total of 10 months of work experience in a 17 month period, with two fairly large gaps - the first due to moving, the second due to burnout and moving back.

Is this information on my resume going to affect me negatively? How can I minimize the negative effect if it occurs? I have code I can show for the gaps and plausible reasons why I quit my last two jobs fairly quickly (moving), but for that I gotta get passed CV screening I think.

Cards up to The Spaces Between  

Decklist [published on NetrunnerDB](http://netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/5179/payland).

Okay, I've been refining my deck for a while, and this is what I have now. This is the deck I'm planning to take to regionals if The Spaces Between comes in time.

In the beginning of the game, you want to get money, and score an agenda quickly. Money should be easy, with Medical Research Fundraiser easily getting you to Restructure level, and many of the agendas help with economy. The cheap stopping ICE really make it possible to score even without ^much money, but you need enough to rez ICE on your centrals and have 3 ICE on the remote.

In the middle game, it's rather important to get the runner to run into a rototurret or archer, but in case that doesn't work, 3* WoW, Power Shutdown, and Corporate Troubleshooter, can take up the slack and get rid of troublesome things like corroder, SMC, and Clone Chip. Interns is there to bring all of them back.

Once you're at match point, things can either be easy or hard. If you managed to get rid of their breakers in the middle game, you can comfortably score the last agenda. If they still have a sharpshooter, a clone chip, SMC, or Femme Fatale on a Personal Workshop (that last one stopped me from winning the Chronos Protocol I just attended), you need two Corporate Troubleshooters to boost two different things, and you need a lot of money, and you hope that you scored Government Contracts. During this time your remote is the most important thing to work on, and bad publicity is pretty much just a single credit for the runner. Medical Research Fundraiser is worse now, but it's still as good as an easy mark. The troubleshooter is the most important card now, and you want as many as you can get. You'll be rather far through your deck now, but it should be fine. This also the time for mindgames - trying to get them to waste their money on a will-o-wisp or sneaking through a project atlas while they aren't looking.

Some notes on cards I used: -Corporate Troubleshooter is the core of this deck, and you really cannot have them trashed. If you have them in HQ, ice it up well. -Inazuma almost has a ""trash a program"" subroutine. Corporate Troubleshooting it gets around sharp-shooter, one the greatest weaknesses of this deck. If you absolutely need to make a server taxing despite all the BP that is flying around, you can set up a server with this in front of archer. -Medical Research Fundraiser is really useful to stop Restructures from becoming dead cards, but despite that, they could be replaced with Beanstalks, which give more net money, which is important for troubleshooting those who use ninja or garotte. -The main weakness of this deck before The Spaces Between comes out is that there's not enough volume of program-trashing, and although WoW will pretty much always get trashed the first time, its effect is almost as good as a trash, and still rather good against expensive icebreakers.

Cards I don't have: -No scorched earth means that people theoretically could go tag-me against me, but most of the time people put up Plascrete against Weyland all the time and some of the cards best against this deck are resources, (Personal Workshop, Xanadu, Same Old Thing for recursion) If I really wanted to add tag punishment, I would probably add in Closed Accounts, which combos with MRF and pretty much means I can score one agenda while they're collecting resources.

-I really would like to have Reclamation Order, because it's recursion that works on whatever I have used most of, which tends to be what I also need the most (if I'm going full Power Shutdown, I need to trash every last thing, if I'm trying to score agendas, corporate troubleshooter is good, and if I have a set-up server and just need money, I have 3* Restructure) However, I really need lots of the influence. The only card I could imagine swapping out for it would be MRF, which only acts as economy and could be swapped for Beanstalks."
24xr5q,0,2014-05-07,"I, 27M, met someone that changed my outlook on my life. Now stuck with difficult decisions to make",updownleftrightB,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/24xr5q/i_27m_met_someone_that_changed_my_outlook_on_my/,"The other week, my internship took me out of state to a location I have never experienced before. So trying to make the best of my short time in this new land I opened up Tinder and began swiping trying to get local experience for fun things to do around the city. I've never really had a positive experience on this app before so I didn't really have any expectations. Soon after to my surprise a very kind local girl began a conversation with me. The conversation was very casual, what I'm I doing in the area, how long am I in the area while I asked for recommendation for dinner and fun places to go. This continued for another day until she asked me to continue sending my tourist questions to her cell phone number. Unbeknownst to either of us, we coincidentally crossed paths hours before she gave me her number. Later that night we both brought it up and laughed about how strange that was while complimenting on each other’s appearance. 


The following day after the conference that I was attaining ended we made plans to meet in the city to grab drinks. We spent about two hours at the bar chatting about how we got to where we were and shared interests. Her life was incredibly fascinating and explained her to how I was living vicariously through her stories because it was a life that I was very jealous of. I, myself, have lived in a single state and have traveled not very often; my biggest life change was going to college an hour and a half away from home. She explained that she was born outside of the country, moved young and then went to college. From there she followed her career path into another state, just picked up and did what she needed to, to enjoy her life. The conversation seemed to go very well with very few pauses, mostly to take a slip of our beers. Once the bar closed I paid for her drinks and we walked outside. We continued chatting for a little while as she walked to her car and I waited for my taxi. Once I got back to my hotel I message her about how much I enjoyed her company and was hoping we could meet up again before my trip ended and she said the same.


Unfortunately, my last night our plans to meet up again didn't work out. Before my plane took off I messaged her to again say it was really nice meeting and wished her all the best in her future adventures. I've been home for almost a week and the conversation has pretty much stopped and as you can probably tell I fell head of heels for this girl. I'm struggling with getting her off my mind and finding my tasks difficult to complete because my head is elsewhere. I'm beginning to think that the feelings are not mutual and I did not leave the same impact as she left on me. I sent her a message asking if she felt anything the night we met but she didn't respond so I figured now that I'm simply bothering this individual. Of course on Cinco de Mayo, I got a little drunk and sent her another message explaining that I was drunk but that she was gorgeous and wished her goodnight. The next morning I was greeted to her response saying it was a great text to wake up to.


Now comes for the plot twist and difficult road ahead part so grab your popcorn, I'll wait. Ready, let’s go!


As of earlier this year, I'm newly engaged. We have been together for over nine years and have been engaged for almost two months. I absolutely love my fiancée and care so much about her. I told her what happened and explained to her that everything was causal and that I never intended for our meet up to be anything more than lighthearted conversation while thanking her for helping an out of towner. She was not pleased and I completely understand why, she asked if I cheated, I said no which is the truth. Although it bothered her she believed me and has moved on. I did not tell her how I felt about this person but I did explain that this person’s lifestyle is one that I'm incredibly jealous of and one that I want to live myself. I explained how I feel that I've mostly lived a life pleasing others instead of pleasing myself. One that is very ordinary and not adventurous. I have had numerous conversations with friends about my position and they agree that I haven't been living my own life for a long time and that they see my relationship with my fiancée as one of comfort, that I've always stayed with her because I feel safe with her.


I explained to my fiancée that she has been a major factor for my decision to not continue on with graduate school which could be across the country. To my surprise she agreed and apologized for not being so supportive and that she will do her best to change that. Her lack of support has mostly been the idea of me being away from her. During my undergraduate, I was away and we would constantly fight because of the distance (which I was okay with dealing with but she had trouble with it), she would sometimes say that she wasn't the one that decided to move away, I was. These arguments were incredibly hurtful and largely made me think twice about going to graduate school. During her apology she said that she wants me to continue school but only if we were together, where ever my schooling took me and that our relationship will not work if we don't go together. Now she is also still in school and said she would be willing to continue where ever I went but I was hesitant in agreeing with that. I believe this has to do with the first time I went to school; I wanted to enjoy being away but never got the opportunity which I thought I would be able to get if I go to graduate school.


The other day while I was drunk texting, my buddy's tried something on me, they switched the contact information with the girl I met to their number and made it look like she responded to my drunk message. During this little test I got really excited about each message and would let them read my message so it didn't sound so pathetic. Eventually I found out what was going on and was heartbroken. They said this was good and that it showed what I really wanted, I wanted to pursue this other girl regardless of the distance. My friends all believe that I'm in my current relationship out of comfort and that I'm settling. I don't want to believe that they are right but I'm not sure where to go with this. I'm so committed to my fiancée that I feel I might be throwing away everything for absolutely nothing. My friends keep telling me that I'm in a hard position and that if I do act things will without a doubt get weird, feelings will be hurt but that what's most important is how I feel and I shouldn't base my decision to please others, specifically my fiancée. After I collected myself from the trick that was played on me my buddy set down with me and kept telling me that he doesn't think the decisions I'm making in my current relationship are the decision I want to make. He left by telling me that he believe the girl I met would contact me again which she actually did, in the morning (was actually her this time!). When I told him this he said that I had a made bigger impact than I'm letting myself believe and that this shows I shouldn't settle for what I have but for what I want.


My fiancée does suspect something is going on and I told her I will let her know everything on the weekend when we see each other again. Honestly, right now, I don't have a clue what I plant to say to her when the weekend arrives. I'm in such a mixed bag of emotions with half wanting to run while the other half is simply looking to remain comfortable. Did I mention we both have finals this week and graduate next week and that we have family traveling to see us both this weekend? I picked one hell of a week to question my entire relationship/rest of my life. I'm not entirely sure what I'm expecting from posting this but I just had to write down everything because I can't stop thinking about it. If you read all the way through this, thank you, I apologize for the grammatical errors and please let me know what you think.

------
**tl;dr**: went on a business trip, met a girl, she made a huge impact on me. I'm actually engaged, my friends think I'm settling. Having difficulty with deciding what to do next."
24xrrn,31,2014-05-07,Who caused Travis' Suspension and 9 Months without Interns?,jasonayeiter,opieandanthony,https://www.reddit.com/r/opieandanthony/comments/24xrrn/who_caused_travis_suspension_and_9_months_without/,"I know everybody reading this is saying Blind Intern Stevie right now.  But, there's something that nobody ever brings up about Travis' suspension.
 
Take a listen to 01:58-02:14 of this clip: 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBZJjCrxNfQ

This was about a week prior to his fight with Danny and Sam makes a vague reference to some of the crotch-centric harassment of Stevie.  He tells Sam ""Let's not even go there..."" because he knows the show could get in trouble.  So, who was the person who ultimately revealed Blind Intern Stevie got kicked in the nuts?  It was Stevie....right?  Go to 23:04-24:06 of this clip:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipg0lwDZIBM

It's Danny who actually brings it up and Stevie only gives details after being pressed on it.  He even says that he didn't want to talk about it on-air.  

Technically, Travis is responsible for his own suspension (he did kick Stevie in the nuts) but the catalyst is Danny.  Also, if you listen to the rest of the clip beyond the times above, Travis eventually realizes this could problems for him.  So, Travis tries to apologize and help his situation but Danny just makes it worse by mocking Stevie over it and making it seem that the show doesn't take it seriously.  There's a point where everybody on the show either distances themselves from inappropriate treatment of Stevie and/or tries to help Travis out.  Except Danny.    

Oh...and keep in mind that Travis was one of the people that Danny liked on the show."

:--|:--
[So if he was making more than 500k it would be okay in your book?  That's pretty messed up.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chblogk?context=5)|Seems like I'd be even more of a piece of shit if I was that successful. 
[Are you involved much with the general goings on of the casino? If so, what goes through your head when you see huge amounts of money being gambled away by someone who doesnt know when to walk away?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chbjzvs?context=5)|Yes, I'm an executive so I'm in touch with most everything that goes on. Most of the time when I see something like that, I just say ""good for us"" and try not to think about whether or not the person can afford it or not.
[How much do you make a year?  Unless you are making like $500,000+, then you are a piece of shit. you are destroying thousands of people's lives so that you can make a living and afford your bmw and other status symbols.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chblfio?context=5)|I don't make $500K a year so I guess that makes me a piece of shit.
[What is the worst most tasteless thing you or the casino in general did to make money?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chbkkg7?context=5)|I, obviously, like to think I'm uber classy. But in general I think paycheck cashing promotions are pretty tasteless. E.g., Cash your paycheck and get 5% of the total value in free slot play.
[Can you ELi5?  Sorry, to me that just sounds like you hand over your $1000 you earned, and get back $50? Which seems wrong...?  Or do you get an extra $50?  Hmmm... Thoroughly confused myself.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chbo6jh?context=5)|Let's say your check is $1,000. The casino will cash your check and then also give you $50 in promotional credits to be used on the slot machines. The idea is that since we've given you some ""free"" money to begin playing the machines you will also dip into the $1,000 cash that we also handed you.
[Are there any clauses that prevent you from just spending the $50 in free bets and cashing out the $1k without actually playing with it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chbt3lg?context=5)|No, you get the $1K in cash and the $50 can only be used in the slot machine. I've done this once when I started my new job and my direct deposit wasn't set up yet so they issued me a live check.  
[How many people just walk directly out of the casino after cashing the check with their 5% bonus?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chbt4nq?context=5)|I don't know, I've never run this promotion but generally speaking when we give away promotional credits, the ""walk rate"" is in the 25% range.
[How often do you go to the strip clubs in vegas? If you go how much do you spend? Do you get treated better if they know what your job is?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chbm85k?context=5)|I really don't like them so not often unless someone is in town that wants to go. I don't have a moral objection, just think it's a waste. ""Hey do you like to eat steak? Give me $20 to smell this delicious steak! No, you can't try it!!!"".
 |So that having been said, I might spend $20 to give to the girls on the stage and maybe a lap dance.
 |No, I don't get treated better because of my title really. They usually just care about how much money you spend and that's it.
[What are some sneaky strategies that you use to get people to spend more money?  I don't mean obvious things like having ATMs...but things related specifically to gambling.. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chbki6o?context=5)|Ummm... Off the top of my head I think the sneakiest thing is probably side bets on table games (e.g., play an extra $5 and if your two cards are a pair then you win $25) because the odds are terrible or things like advertising low table game limits but modifying the rules (e.g., blackjack pays 6:5 vs 3:2) to increase the house advantage.
[Some casino customers are super cheap and only play $1 Blackjack. Others are whales and the casino spends a lot of money to attract them, but they are rare. Somewhere in between, I imagine, there are customers who spend a significant amount and exist in numbers to make most of the casino's profits.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chbjv53?context=5)|First, we quantify most everything by ""theoretical worth"". That is, how much we can expect to win from you based on the house advantage of the game you play and how long you play. The general formula is decisions per hour X house advantage X hours played X average bet. So, $25/hand at blackjack X 1.5% house advantage X 2 hours played X 60 decisions per hour = $45 in theoretical worth.
[Is that true? How much does a ""bread and butter"" customer gamble in a day?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chbjv53?context=5)|Second, It really depends on the particular property. The number is a lot higher for Wynn then it would be at Joker's Wild (a really, really dumpy casino on the outskirts of Vegas). That having been said, most places will be very happy to have you if you are in the $150-300 a day in theoretical worth range.
[That sounds pretty affordable.  Assuming a 30% comp return I guess that comes out to $50-90 in comps a day.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chblkv9?context=5)|30% includes the stuff we send you in the mail generally too so at the $300 range you could expect a room and a meal a day. 
[What kind of awful rules are you using to have a 1.5% house advantage, or is that number based on the average player being really terrible?  How much in comps would I actually generate for two hours of $25 a hand Blackjack? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chcua3a?context=5)|I just threw the 1.5 number out there. We also factor in skill into house advantage so as to be more favorable to the player, comp wise.  comp wise we'd probably give you 15% of the $45, or $6.75. That's just in what we call discretionary comps that the pit supervisor or host can give you. Then you could expect another 30% in the mail via free bets, hotel, food, etc. 
[I guess you need to register with the casino loyalty club so you know what we are spending.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chblpsz?context=5)|Correct.
[I currently reside in Arizona, where you can't swing a dead cat without hitting an Indian reservation and - as a result - a casino.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chbkdfl?context=5)|Well I've worked all over the country and, yes, of course we always keep an eye out on new competition that would impact our existing customer base, especially as the business has seen much more legalization in new jurisdictions in the past 20 years.
[The casino/resorts are getting increasingly sophisticated.  Better facilities, better entertainment, and better marketing.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chbkdfl?context=5)|For Vegas, I think most strip properties have dealt with this by investing in properties in regional markets so as to send their customers to their Vegas properties so it is pretty accretive. Someone from Harrah's Ak-Chin in the Phoenix area gets offers from Harrah's Las Vegas quite often.
[Is this something the Vegas casinos consider a rising threat, welcome competition, or something else?  How do you - as a marketing guy - react to the fact that a trip to a casino no longer necessarily means a trip to Nevada or New Jersey?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chbkdfl?context=5)|The bigger problem really is for the markets where they were a monopoly for some time and really rested on their laurels. Reno and Atlantic City come to mind. Those markets are dying fast and there really isn't much upside. In Atlantic City, for example, you have casinos buying competitors just to close them so as to reduce the inventory.
[What really happens when somebody wins on a slot machine? Like, what is the behind the scenes stuff that we don't see? Are they checking out the cameras to make sure it was that specific person before they payout? What if you switch seats? What if an underage gambler wins?... What if they switch seats with an of-age gambler??  Honestly, I've never done that, but I've always wondered the underage stuff because I've never ever got carded on slots!  I've won hand-pays before (nothing really exciting\) and they always hit me with the tax form. What do you guys do with the tax form? Does it get sent out from you guys or does it remain my responsibility from thereon?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chc87xj?context=5)|I worked as a slot analyst (analyzing machine performance) years ago and never on the floor so I don't know/remember the exact steps. Essentially, though, it's verifying that the machine is functioning properly and recording the details of the jackpot for audit/regulators. If it is a taxable jackpot ( &gt;= $1,200) then we are required to fill out the IRS W2G form to report it to them for tax purposes so at that point we have to get your ID, etc. to facilitate that. Then of course, there is the matter of actually paying you the money, verifying that it is the correct amount, etc. The tax form does get sent to the IRS. You can request the taxes not be taken out of your jackpot as you are only taxed on the net win at the end of the year.
[How did you get involved in the casino bussiness?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chblwbr?context=5)|1/2.) Just needed a job and applied to a very entry level job and worked my way up.
[Did you set out to work at one or did it come about another way?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chblwbr?context=5)|3.) It can be fun and exciting.
[What do you enjoy most about your job? Least?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chblwbr?context=5)|4.) There's a lot of pressure to make money/meet your budget so all of the bullshit that goes along with that. Dealing with politics, having to adjust staffing, etc. And I don't like that at my level the usual tenure is 2-3 years so you move around a lot. I'd like to be more settled, especially in a place I'd really want to live for a long time and I don't feel like I have much control of that in this business.
[1\) When you talk about being moved around a lot, is that relating to being moved around in what you do at a particular casino? or more like which casino your working at?  2\)  Do you feel that your skills at this current job gives you fallback options should your tenure run out? ( Such as in other service based industries?\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chbm97t?context=5)|1.) I mean there is only one of me at every casino so if something happens whether I don't like where I work or what something different (e.g., more money) or they don't like me (shocking, it happens!) then the likelihood that I have to move is high, especially if I'm in a city that only has a handful of casinos.  2.) I obviously feel like my skills could take me anywhere! But in reality, it has been tough to change industries when I've tried. Usually places like hotels don't pay as much as casinos and look for more sales-related skills and restaurants don't really have marketing people except at the corporate office whereas my skills are more analytics-oriented. And both usually pay less than casinos.
[ time I went to Vegas (around 30 years ago\) it still had that ""mob"" vibe.  When I got married there in the 90s (I joke now that I gambled on marriage in Vegas and lost half my stuff\) it was much more ""corporate"" and ""family friendly.""  The ""What Happens in Vegas"" campaign seemed to try and change that perception.  Do you think there's value in returning Vegas to a more ""wise guy"" kind of feel...playing up the classic vibe, or is it just a big collection of theme parks with gambling?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chbmdwb?context=5)|The problem with returning to that type of vibe is that it's difficult/impossible given how big the casinos are. Sure it was easy for Benny Binion to control everything and not be ""corporate"" when the old Horseshoe was literally 1/10th the size of MGM Grand. 
[What was UNLV like?  Did you live in the dorms?  It seems like a strange school where everyone commutes and there's no college life around the campus.  What are the pros and cons of going there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chblnl0?context=5)|I went there for grad school so was older and had a wife and a house. It is definitely a commuter school so there's not a lot of school spirit. I went to undergrad a school with a huge, huge, huge, football program so it was a bit of a change for me. I also didn't find the students to be terribly bright (with exceptions, of course). On the upside, a lot of people like living in Vegas and the Hotel Administration College (where I went) has very, very good brand recognition.
[Do you find people have lots of misconceptions about the casino industry?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chbju23?context=5)|That the games are rigged and that we love giving away a lot for nothing/little in return are probably the two biggest.
[So what's up with prostitutes and the casinos?  I understand that prostitution is illegal in Vegas, but that they're still there.  Is it like the movies, where they're just hanging out in the casino bars waiting to be picked up?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chbn1nu?context=5)|Yes, they hang out at the bars and then there are services you can call and have them sent to your room. If it's overt, casino security will clear them out of the bar area but the vice cops generally focus on human trafficking kind of stuff. 
[As an insider, what do you think the job prospects are in the industry for someone with a similar education background, but no casino experience?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chbp2w8?context=5)|1.) The industry relies heavily on industry experience so job prospects are good if you're willing to start in a low position and work you're way up. If you go to UNLV and get the degree I got and expect for some casino to make you a Director of VP with no experience then you're going to be very disappointed.
[Is that just bizarre luck?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chbp2w8?context=5)|2.) Bizarre luck.
[What does the industry think about states with Indian reservations that prohibit casinos like Texas?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chbp2w8?context=5)|3.) Definitely potential opportunity. I've read about that small tribe in Texas. It'll happen eventually in Texas. The people in Louisiana will not be happy, though.
[Is it viewed as a potential opportunity for growth with a small tribe, more competition, or a wedge to open the state to gambling?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chbp2w8?context=5)|4.) No problem!
[For every average person out there, would you suggest not playing? I mean, in the sense that, it's just not a viable option?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chbo79g?context=5)|Viable for what? Making consistent money? Then definitely not. If you are entertained by thrill of gambling and have the discretionary funds to do it, then by all means. 
[Aw okay! cool. Any idea why people do it? Is it just a thrill? Would being a ""whale"", make more of a difference?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chbpxgh?context=5)|For the people that do it for entertainment, it's the thrill of anticipation.
[Was it hard getting a job with such a detailed degree?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chblwnh?context=5)|My undergrad degree is pretty bland, political science, so it wasn't hard at first. I did my grad degree in casino management because I was living in Vegas, wanted to get an MBA, didn't want to take 2 years off from work to get a full-time degree, didn't have the support of my job to get an executive MBA, and didn't like UNLV's MBA program.
[EDIT: Thanks for answering my first AMA question! Really good answer too!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chblwnh?context=5)|NP! Keep asking away!

I.e. omaha, hold 'em, pai gow, stud...  Also, without being too specific, what is the average annual income for said occupation? Are the dealers payed solely by tips/do they get to keep all tips?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chcl5hv?context=5)|1.) Generally there are poker dealers and table games (e.g., blackjack) dealers. Few do both. Among the table games dealers, most know multiple games as the more you know the more hirable you are. In terms of the qualifications it's just that you've gone to some sort of dealer school (there are commercial ones and some casinos do it in-house), experience, and a live audition.  2.) Really depends on the market and the casino. At the high end like Wynn or Venetian they will do close to $100K/year but at an entry-level place it could be more like $25K/year. It's base salary plus pooled tips (aka tokes).
 |3.) You've never thought of dealing the WSOP? They need as many dealers as they can find.
[Do Casino's design their decor for different target groups?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chbjvfy?context=5)|Of course. Hard Rock and Cosmo are designed for younger demographics and Wynn and Venetian for older affluent ones.

I worked at a place a little outside of the main city in the south one time and we'd buy broader search terms for people looking for ""entertainment in main city"" in case they didn't know there was a casino nearby.

 |2a.) don't be afraid to fail, but be smart (and profitable) about it.
 |2b.) don't rest on your laurels. stay in touch with your customers. 
[Go on ...  What does a casino do in that regard?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chblbzb?context=5)|From a gambling standpoint, people in that age range like penny slots so we offer a lot of penny slots. We put on shows that would appeal to them. We would make the decor more classic vs hip. Etc.

We're required by law to fill out a [Currency Transaction Report](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency_transaction_report) for transactions over $10,000. So if you got to that point you would have already given us your ID, etc. We'd obviously make sure that surveillance is watching you to make sure you're not cheating but if you're on a random hot streak and betting $10K/hand then it wouldn't be a huge deal at most strip properties.

But hypothetically what would 10 grand get you :(](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chbkwci?context=5)|At my place, (which is not an uber classy place like Wynn or Venetian), you'd get pretty much whatever you'd want. Suite, dinners, limo from the airport, show tickets, etc. We'd generally reinvest in you 30% of your loss so just figure out what $3,000 in comps would get you.

It's a very crowded field, especially on the what I call ""pretty picture"" side of marketing. I wish I had a more specific answer to give you. 
[What does being a marketing executive involve? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chbn2yr?context=5)|I usually say I'm in charge of driving profitable revenue.

[Do casinos hire interns? I'm currently a student at a public university. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chbnawq?context=5)|Absolutely. I think most of the major companies have management training/internship programs. Go to their careers websites. Caesars Entertainment, MGM International, Pinnacle Entertainment, Penn National Gaming, etc.
[Would you recommend a job in marketing? what skill sets would be helpful for marketing?  i'm interested in it but not entirely sure what it's about. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/24x8c0/iama_marketing_executive_at_a_casino_ama/chbniw9?context=5)|I think the best combination in today's world is to be more right brained with a creative bent as more and more the question asked of marketing folks is ""quantify how your idea makes me money?"" and less and less ""what's the most most creative idea you have?""
 |It's a crowded field especially on the left brained side (e.g., advertising and public relations) because people think it's ""cool"". So if that's you're interest, I'd say being tenacious and creative is what is going to get you far in that world because it's tough to get your foot in the door and you have to have thick skin and then when you do get your foot in the door you are going to have a very short leash to prove yourself.

24xwwg,5,2014-05-07,"My[24M] girlfriend[24F] of nearly 6 years has broke it off with me and giving me an extremely cold shoulder. Problem: We live together, she found someone else, only been a month. *Warning: LONG read*",RelationshipAdvice84,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/24xwwg/my24m_girlfriend24f_of_nearly_6_years_has_broke/,"I have been lurking here since my break up in order to try and relieve a lot of my emotions by reading similar stories, but I think it has gotten to the point where I would greatly appreciate some input into my situation.



I met the love of my life when I was 18 in college. She was my first girlfriend (but I wasn’t hers) and we lost our virginities together. It was something very special we both shared and I appreciated her a lot during our first two years together. 



When we first met, she was attending school nearly 3 hours away, and I was in community college. After 3 years, I was able to attend the same university as her, and we eventually lived together. This was great initially, but I found myself to be extremely stressed because I was forced to pay my whole tuition without any grants or my parents. This was due to my parents unwillingness to help me with my education. So, naturally I did what most individuals in my situation would do. I picked a major that would have the highest earning potential and wanted to work extremely hard in order to find a job that could pay off these loans(30-40k). STEM it is! 



During my first year at the university with her, problems starting really emerging after living with another. It was 4 years together so we pretty much knew our behaviors. Problems has always been lingering in our relationship, and the biggest two were the lack of sex and my emotionless self. I always took a lot of units and worked/ done internships, so I would often time be too tired to have sex or I would rush it. This would also make me very driven and I would have to avoid any overly emotional things so I don’t get distracted from my ultimate goal. These were a few of my biggest fault in the relationship. This in turned caused her to never receive an orgasm during our entire relationship. I have tried oral and fingering but she was never really too into it. At the end of my first year, problems got even worst.



5 years into the relationship. I found an amazing internship that allowed me to utilize my skill set and I learn a lot, but it caused me to stay up many nights with 3-4 hours of sleep. This was because I wanted to do extremely well in my classes and maintain this internship(paid if that matters). She always missed someone to cuddle with, talk to, and be heard. We sleep at different times and our overall interest was different. Mine would be extremely career driven and to achieve everything I want, so I would not regret anything when I am older. Hers would be a relaxed lifestyle that consist of eating food all day because of her parents paying her way through a lot of her life. At that moment in time, many days consisted of me telling her my problems at school and work, which I failed to see how self centered I was at the time. This made her feel like she was more of a friend or a companion rather than a partner. I didn't appreciate her enough and I understand that now, but at the time, I was so career driven that I couldn't see the value in a relationship.



After about 9 months of tolerating my lack of emotions and sex, she eventually broke it off with me, but we lived together.  So, she started going out with her friends more. She went clubbing and etc etc. During that time, I quit my internship since the amount of stress was over bearing. After about 2 weeks, I decided to seek out professional help of a therapist. I was told that I was not empathic enough with girlfriend and when she wanted to voice her option, I would brush it off and be highly irrational. Now that I have more time to be a student and learn to love and live again, I understand all my faults, but she does not want to give this relationship another try.




Today which is about a month later, I always had high hopes that one day we could be together. I just wanted to make sure that I would have a great job that could provide for my family when I grow old which is why I work so hard. In my last attempt to save my relationship, I did everything that I knew would make me a better overall person. I started to cook, clean, and be more empathic. But after this past week, I saw her talking on the phone and texting non stop, and it reminded me of when we first met. The way she use to talk to me and text me all the time. I asked her and she confirmed that there was someone new. 



This hit me like a ton of bricks. Knowing we broke up, that was one thing, but now I might not even be able to love her anymore. When we talked about it, she said in these words “It has been a month already, you should be over this break up.”….”Maybe you just need to get mad at me so you can get over me easier”….”I am your first girlfriend that is why this breakup is so hard for you”. She found someone within a month and I am still traumatized over the breakup. She makes me feel as though I am wrong for wanting to work it out. She doesn’t see a future with me, so she thinks it will save us both time since “there is someone better for us out there”.




I am absolutely stuck. I have been having a terrible final quarter at school due to this. It is extremely hard to write out every detail of the last 6 years but that was the general gist. I just want an outside unbiased opinion. What do you guy’s think of me and my situation. I am extremely open to criticism. Do you guys think this relationship is still worth pursuing? Is moving on so quickly after 6 years justified? I am still in love with her but she lost everything for me. Was my actions before so bad that it cannot be saved? I am completely lost and have become more emotional now than I have ever been in my life. I just would like your opinion whether it be good or bad.





&lt;bold&gt;TLDR: My girlfriend of 6 years broke it off with me, but we still live in the same household. I was extremely emotionless throughout the relationship since I was so career driven and she is the exact opposite. This caused us to have a horrible sex life and she never had an orgasm. She told me that she found someone new and the guy is completely different than me. She keeps telling me “Maybe you just need to get mad at me so you can get over me easier”, and I am completely lost. I love her, but I am not sure it is worth pursing anymore.

24y5db,16,2014-05-07,Extremely stressed. Leaving first programming job. Need some advice.,usernameisnull,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/24y5db/extremely_stressed_leaving_first_programming_job/,"I feel the need to preface this with a bit of backstory before getting to my main questions.

Backstory - Got my BS in CS in 2012, had no luck finding anything (probably my lack of internships). I got hired back in August by a small (~20 people total) company doing development work. I started with Classic ASP then moved on to C#.Net (while still supporting sites built in Classic ASP) when new projects came up. I even wrote a desktop application to print movie tickets for a local Film Festival (no bugs, didn't crash. hahahaha). Here's the thing though, I'm pretty much a factory worker at this place. I'm pushed to slap code together in hopes of producing something that works just enough for my boss to show off. I've had to teach myself the majority of what I know. I have a ton of respect for my mentor but he has very little experience with .Net and has had barely enough time to show me the ropes. 

So, I'm leaving the company. I want to find a job where I can code in a slower environment. I'm thinking something along the lines of Intranet tools for a medium (1-5k) sized company. My resume is [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/dlp86qxjinvij91/Resume%20for%20Reddit.pdf) just to give you an idea of my skills.

Does wanting to work in a slower environment sound weak (not sure how else to put it) in any way? What sort of questions can I ask to figure out how fast the pace is without sounding lazy? "

I have no idea where I can go from here, or how to do it.",justwanttotest,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/24ybrw/im_a_qa_analyst_i_have_no_idea_where_i_can_go/,"I graduated from a really good school 2 years ago with a degree in Chemistry. I was pretty much forced into that degree by my parents, and by the end of my schooling I realized I just did not enjoy it at all, and had no interest to go back for my PHD. I really enjoyed the intro CS classes I took, so I decided I would try something out along those lines. I found a QA internship in Boston and after a few months was promoted to a full time QA.

My current responsibilities are writing up test plans, black box testing handheld devices and web apps, managing test plans for a team of testers off in India, working with PMs/Developers etc. I do not do anything involving automation which is where I was hoping to get too. My company has a completely separate automation team, and does not want the team i'm on doing automation. We're assigned all the manual tasks. I've spoken to the head of the automation team to see if there was any chance I could transfer, but they don't have any openings. It seems like there is currently no way to grow in my company.

So now for some questions:

I'm having a very hard time telling apart all the different QA roles. I originally thought it was just QA analysts who do manual testing + automation, and SDETs who also do automation, but also white box testing. Is this the case? If so, what role would I have considering I don't do any autmoation I also thought that QA analysts were not paid well, but SDETs were payed the same as developers. Based on my current salary I thought this was true, but looking online I that QA salaries are really high as well. Are these sites just conflating SDET with analysts? If QA analyst should be making a lot more money than I thought, maybe my best path is to just stick with QA analyst (a different company that does some automation).
(http://www.indeed.com/salary?q1=QA+analyst&amp;l1=boston,
http://www.indeed.com/salary?q1=QA+tester&amp;l1=boston)


Assuming SDETs get payed a lot more (which i'm assuming is the case), I would like to eventually work my way up to this position. For the past year or so I've been doing some minor studying to try and improve my skills. I'm familiar with the basics of Python (classes, inheritance, i/o etc), though haven't done any work on the deeper stuff (design patterns, data structures, algorithms). I've gone through Selenium tutorials and automated some websites for fun. My most recent learning experience has been with SQL (just started). I'm trying to teach myself, but i'm getting to the point where i'm not sure what I should be studying if I want to get into the SDET role. I'm not sure which areas are important, and I definitely don't know how to get any actual experience. What areas should I focus on studying, and how should I go about getting experience?

Based on what i've been able to find from skimming the internet, I shouldn't have too much of a problem finding another QA analyst position that has automation. Do I have any other choices right now? Is it possible I could just suck it up and take a SDET internship at some company now, and hope that they would take me full time after? If that is not reasonable, are there any other good options? If not, where do I go from QA analyst? Just stay there while studying until I know enough to become a SDET? I'm just very unaware of what opportunities there are for QA, and how to advance?

I'd mainly want a research level job in industry, primarily at a software company like Google/SAS/Amazon/Microsoft as a data scientist.

We’ve had to put off our wedding because he had a difficult time finding a job (after quitting one abruptly) and then he developed major depression as a result of his employment situation and health anxiety. He is currently doing an unpaid internship required for a professional license and I am going to be a FT student for another 3 years.

 He finally sought help from a psychiatrist and another therapist after my family and I sat down and convinced him and his parents separately. (his family is completely MIA and unsupportive). I love him dearly and I am probably more emotionally attached to him than he is with me but the only thing that is promising of a brighter future are my own lofty dreams and hopes. He only invests time and effort into his two dogs, this MMORPG that he plays obsessively and oddly enough, his mother. 

I feel like I’ve been dragging his weight and his problems- which I DO understand is a fact of being with a depressed partner. But he shows no gratitude, no initiative to try and speak to me about anything and when I approach him about any problems or concerns (i.e he stays up all night playing this game and does not show up to his internship, consecutively for almost 3 weeks) he shuts down and blames me for setting him back by making him feel guilty for his behaviour. 

I’m exhausted and miserable, everyone in my life sees this and is urging me to do what is best for me instead of opting to continue on this route. It just really kills me to see and know that he is someone I really love but cannot get my life started with-  the reason being a combination of real circumstances with his employment and his own mental state. I know ending our engagement is probably for the best but even then, I don’t know how to do so amicably.


---   
**tl;dr**: Engaged for 3 years to depressed partner. No signs of improvement in his mental state or with our life circumstances despite seeking professional help. Heavily leaning towards ending our relationship but still in love with him and feeling distraught. "

I read through every page of an Android fundamentals book, and for the past two months I've been working on my first app. In the meantime, I've been applying to Android-related jobs, and am waiting to hear back from two places that want to schedule last-round, on-site interviews - in addition to this third place that scheduled a phone interview.

You know what sucks though? Every Android job posting lists ""must have at least one app in Play Store"" as a job requirement. So I'm trying my best to finish my first app on top of schoolwork, but at this rate it's going to take another month before I'm anywhere close to finishing. There are all these little concerns - like deciding what features to implement, laying out the user flow, designing a logo, dealing with threading, setting up a backend, testing - and it's just a lot of work to meet that must-have-app job requirement. No one wants to see my Android app's half-complete codebase on GitHub.

On top of school and personal project stress, it turns out that there aren't that many Android positions in NYC compared to general back-end work. Maybe I should have invested my personal project time into web applications. Maybe all three of my current job leads won't pan out. Then I'll be fucked, and that places even more stress on me to finish my first Android app, which needs to meet my personal bar of quality before it's released. Even after that, maybe I still won't be able to find an Android job.

I been lurking for quite some time now and am interested in some feedback",[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/24zg18/23_year_old_student_and_never_learned_anything/,"Edit: Please ignore the typo in the title. I can't believe I missed that.

Hi PF! I've been lurking for a long time and thought that, with the news of becoming a default subreddit, now would be a better time than any to ask for some feedback.

I'm an undergrad student studying for a BS in engineering in California. My goal for the next five years is to pay off, or substantially decrease, my student loans, and to start saving and investing for my future. I'm currently at the tail-end of a year-long internship. By August I will have about $12,000 in my savings and checking accounts. 

I have just one semester of college left, and unfortunately I am currently unsure about the cost of tuition for my last semester. 

My finances:

My internship pays about $3500 per month. 

* $535 goes to rent
* $300 to a leased car. I know it’s not ideal but I needed one asap for the internship and didn’t know where to turn. 
* $144 car insurance
* $130 fuel
* $150 groceries
* $250 eating out/bars

I have no CC debt. My only CC account was opened this January. I opened it just to build credit, and I pay it off every month. Credit limit was recently raised to $3,500.

Here are my debts (all student loans):

* $11,000 federal subsidized @3.4% and $4,000 federal unsubsidized @6.8%	
I pay $160 per mo for both of these (the minimum)

* $11,000 federal @5%
I pay $117 per mo for this (the minimum)

* $16,000 Sallie Mae @8.625%
I pay $200 per mo, and my father matches this with another $200 per month, totaling to $400 per month. I think the minimum on this loan is ~$180.

These total to just under $42,000 in student loans currently.

I only have a few more months left until I get back to being a full-time student. When I go back to school, my monthly expenses will decrease significantly: no rent, less fuel, and less in groceries. 

Until that time, I want to maximize the money and income I have now to match the goals stated above. Am I doing enough to take care of my loans? Should I double down on the Sallie Mae loan and pay off a large portion of it or keep paying above the minimum? 

The above expenses are approximately what I expect to see after I graduate and start working full-time as well, so I would like to hear your thoughts on how I'm doing now too.



Thanks for your time!

Not sure if I'm doing this in the right subreddit, but here I go.

I'm a computer engineering/science student who is looking for an internship in the game industry. So today I went to a networklunch for gamestudios and students. I met some studios over there which seemed interested in C++ programmers(which I am). Now, they were all happy about me being able to program in C++, but all of them also told me they wanted to see a portfolio of the games I made.

Now there is my problem. I don't really have a portfolio and can't make one in time(I only have like 2 games I can show them...). So I came up with the idea of making a little game. I will send this game to all the game studios I want to apply for. In this game the studio will get to know things about me and get to see my curriculum vitae.

So my question after all is: Game developers/Game studios of this subreddit, do you think my idea will help me and will make up for the fact that I don't have an actual portfolio?

Good interest in the material, a lot of image scanning and vertebrate physiology.

I'm also trying to network with a professor who is world-renowned in his field and does research in what I'm really interested in. Not sure what options are open for me though but I imagine he knows a lot of people who perform research in my interests in cognitive neuroscience. 

I'll have to find a part-time job if I do research, but summer classes appear to be in the evening so it shouldn't be too much of a hassle to find something - I can work in another department within my library for 15 hours at around minimum wage (just a little less than the internship).

We are Mesmer Laboratories, center of scientific innovation for the man and woman on the go. We're looking for people to test out our latest line of ""intimate technologies"" as the lab boys like to call them. Me? I call them sex toys and boy are they something. Took a few home and the wife's still recovering.

***

These are the toys we have up on the docket for testing today:

**The Obeisance Marker:** Not really sure how this guy happened, but here's the gist: write ""happy"" on someone and they get happy, write ""loves giving blowjobs"" and you'll be sore for a week. Lesson learned there. You are only limited as your vocabulary. Be as open or as discreet as you like. Wipes off with hot water. Comes in anything from fine-tip to chisel.

**The Vibro-tail:** Our prehensile cyber-limb research yielded this little beauty. It's a butt plug (we're upfront about it), but once you've got it in, thousands of nanobots come out and start attaching the tail to your nervous system. CAT-001 produced several changes in the first wave test subjects, including but not limited to licking oneself clean, purring, increased reflexes and muscle density, pupil alteration, adoption of other feline behaviors and in rare cases, negative impact on higher brain function. Don't worry though. If that happens, we have top-notch rehabilitation facilities.

**The Constrictor Stocking:**  Slip a pair of these on and they'll tighten to the point of near-crippling pain. Now I know that sounds bad, but hear me out for a second. We included a painkiller distribution system that kills it before it even starts. Side effects of the painkillers include heightened arousal and promiscuity, enhancement of female physique and behavior patterns. Happens to men too. Super-estrogen does that. You may not be able to take a step longer than six inches, but by god they'll be amazing steps to watch. Note: for safety purposes, you must designate someone else to have permission to remove them. We found that people tended to get distracted otherwise.

**The Symbiote Suit:** Ever see Spiderman 3? Basically that. The notes say it increases libido, but that's basically everything we carry. Ah, here we go. Looks like you can morph this thing up quite a bit. The tentacles this thing puts out can stretch up to 20 feet and carry 400 pounds each. If that sounds a bit excessive, we haven't even found a limit on how many you can make, so go nuts. This thing can get sticky too, in case you want to do it on the sides of any nearby buildings.

**The Flux Mask:** Have you ever wanted to SHAPESHIFT! Well we had just the thing for you. The thing could make you look like anyone you'd like. Makes for a hell of a costume party when half the people there are Nic Cage. Long story short, we got drunk and we came into the labs in the morning to find that a small scale war had erupted near our vault and the original plans for this were missing. Personally, I smell CIA but they took it fair and square. We were prepared to let this one go, but one of the lab boys spent a week rebuilding it as much as he could. Only works for half an hour now, but still better than nothing.

**The Mod Capsule:** Ethics be damned, we wanted to make better people. Feed someone one of these and they enter a sort of pseudo-trance where you can modify their personality or behavior. Presto! Instant productive member of society, right? Wrong. The effects wear off after two hours and cause amnesia of the time in question. If you take someone on these out in public, they're your responsibility.

**The Anti-Whip:** I wanted to be able to inflict bottomless shame on my under-performing engineers, so I had them build this. Turn it to one of any number of emotions and hit someone with it. BAM! They feel it. Shame. Pride. Sobriety. Lust. Submissiveness. Primal fear. Current versions are USB enabled for the downloading of emotions as they are harvested.

**Amplification Gel:** Nanobots again. Rub a palmful of this on someone and their nerve endings in the area double. Enhanced sensation wherever you would like it. I rubbed some in my hair and stood outside when it was windy and boy let me tell you how weird that felt. Repeated application of the gel increases the effects.

**Engorger Serum:** Do you want to be bigger? Doesn't matter where because this does it. One small injection makes the surrounding area bigger, longer, firmer, or bouncier as desired. Remember how the gel gets more effective the more you use it? Well this does too, but it is nowhere near as pretty. Remember, sometimes less is more.

**The Control Band:** This simple collar goes around the neck and assumes direct control over the wearer's nervous system. It comes pre-loaded with a variety of entertainment and fitness programs as well as the ability to completely subjugate the human spirit. Accepts voice commands fairly competently and is WiFi-enabled.

**The Power Band:** When you clamp this thing on your wrist you may notice a metallic sheen spreading from the device. That's normal, don't try to take it off before its finished. When its finished turning your skin to metal, you'll find that you've become significantly more durable. Early testing showed the ability to deflect low-caliber firearms. Just in case you get into something you can't handle though, you can modify your own pain response or even turn it off. Color customization options are also available once fully initialized.

**The Harmonizer:** We pulled up a few tons of crystal from a jungle somewhere and after extensive testing, we discovered that it naturally induces deep trance. After more testing, we developed protective lenses that allow users to resist the effect. One-on-one testing showed that in addition to it's hypnotic effects, it acts as a telepathic bridge, allowing mental communication across great distances.

**The Swapper:** It used to be that when you wanted to switch bodies with someone, you'd have to lay out flat and swap brains by hand. Not anymore! Now all you have to do is grab hold of one handle while your swap-ee grabs the other. Presto, change-o, you're looking at your own handsome mug. Repeat the process to change back, easy as pie.

**The Feeldo:** Ladies, have you ever wanted a functional penis? Congrats, even if you said ""No"", science has given you the option. Just insert the knob and this normally hard plastic dildo feeds off of your natural body heat to power itself. This thing excretes all the right fluids, feels just like real skin and even hardens and softens like the real deal. Available in a variety of color options and with optional testicles, bullet vibe or bullet vibe testicles.

**The Limiter:** Available in any jewelry form factor, the Limiter tricks your brain into thinking you're a fraction as strong as you are. Originally developed as the DE-Limiter, we've got to find some use for them somehow. Do any of you fantasies need you to be weak as a kitten? If not, consider tricking your enemies into one.
***
Alright, the bean counters said that we don't have near enough money to properly test all of these things ourselves, so we're going to have to open-source things. They also said that we can't afford a senior staff, so everyone is getting demoted to interns. Upside is that interns are easier to insure. Downside is that we have a lot more room for interns right now. So that's where you come in. We need new interns to create more wonderful technology and more test subjects 
We're letting you in on the ground floor on this, guys and gals. Don't ignore Science's call. If you're interested, feel free to apply below or over PM.

Need some help.",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2504x5/i_was_a_nontraditional_student_30_coming_out_of/,"So besides the headline, here's what I've done: 
I graduated in December with a second BS in MIS. I created an online employment application system for my ""internship"", a senior project I did with another developer from a local company (Problem with that is that he's my husband too, so I don't know if I can really list him as a reference...I had the same issue seeking someone to work with for my project, not a soul wanted to help...I asked four different companies). 
I am comfortable working with VB.NET, C#, ASP.NET, HTML/CSS, javascript, Java, SQL, and MySQL. I've posted projects using all those languages on GitHub and have added on cover letters that I can provide code samples if needed. I'm currently working in retail management. We have a business analyst who I worked with to create software that can be used to make his job easier. I've been applying to jobs for a year. I've managed to get two phone interviews, but today just sucked: I got rejected for an unpaid internship. I don't understand what I'm doing wrong. 

Any feedback on what I can do to better my prospects and set myself apart? I don't really have a network as for most of my education I was a single mom who worked nights...so I went with an online degree. Having gone through both a traditional BS at a brick and mortar school before that, it definitely didn't strike me as a diploma mill. I worked hard at everything I did and participated in discussions more than I did in college the first time around, graduated with a hard earned 3.6 GPA. 

I'm not going to get on a feminist train, but the female part is simply that most of my friends are female, and none of them are developers, or involved in IT at all, and I have really no idea on how to network in this field. 

I just want to program the day away and have someone pay me for it! It seems like 80% of the battle is getting past HR. Are there any tricks for being able to get your resume to someone who's actually in the department? "
2506xq,0,2014-05-07,How soon should I start looking for internships,epitone,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2506xq/how_soon_should_i_start_looking_for_internships/,"First, a little sidenote - I'm a transfer student that's going to be moving towards a 4-year in the fall, but I haven't actually taken any ""intensive"" CS courses but decided to get my GenEds out the way at community college (I've only taken 1 programming course, not counting the prereq ""Into to OOP"" course).

Since I'm not going to be taking any CS related courses until I transfer, what would be the best time to start looking for internships? By the numbers, I'd be a 2nd semester sophmore (or 1st semester, barring the fact that some GenEds might not fill certain requirements) but since I haven't actually taken any CS courses, I'd be more like a freshman in terms of actual CS knowledge.

My question is - with this in mind - when should I start looking for internships for the following year? I'm presuming that applying for internships now would be a bit of a waste since I haven't got any concrete CS knowledge (though I have applied to a couple, most haven't responded, or I just got flat-out denied).  Should I be focusing on anything in particular over the summer so that I can get a leg up when I attend school in the fall?

**tl;dr:** I'm a transfer student who hasn't taken any real CS courses, how soon should I start applying for internships for the next year?"

Background: I'm a sheltered suburban college kid living around Boston. I think bad parts of Allston, downtown crossing, Chinatown and people on the Orange line are considered 'ghetto'.  I have an interview for an internship for a place on Cummin's Highway between Washington and Blue Hill Avenue. I usually stick to the Cambridge/downtown Boston/Fenway/Allston/Brighton areas. I have a few questions:


1. title, is the Rosindale area safe?
2. What's the best way to get to Cummin's Highway from downtown? Google maps says Orange line to Forest Hills and then the 30 Mattapan station bus. Is the route along the bus the gentrified part of South Boston? Anything with Mattapan in it's name makes me wary."

The girl I loved, the girl I thought I was going to marry broke up with me 6 months ago. I am still young but I can say that I have yet to meet a girl with that combination of brains, looks, and personality. Now she is on the market and is being hit on every time I unfortunately run into her. Me on the other hand, well I haven't had a sexual encounter since. I haven't had the opportunity either. I tried to get back together with, because I truly, truly love her, and there is not way I can rationalize with that, but those attempts have failed, and I am pretty sure she has moved on. I wish with all my heart that those feelings could just disappear but they don't. I try to avoid seeing her but I go to a very small college and it is basically impossible. Sometimes I do feel like I am getting better and then I will just see her beautiful face and it will send me back down into the spiral of depression. Meanwhile the rest of my life has gone to shit. I have no internship and no job this summer, meaning that I have to survive off of my meager savings for the summer. Worse than that is that I am stuck at my college, 2,000 miles away from home, if I don't get a job or internship. My parents have told me that I can not come home without one. I have applied to about 25, and have only gotten 2 interviews, neither of which have panned out. My depression and the pressure to get an internship have had a very negative effect on my studies. I have lost all motivation to do work. I drag myself to the library but all I do is force myself to read whatever I am supposed to, but I can't actually do it. It is as if the words or going in to me brain and coming right out. There is a haze of depression and sadness that just surrounds me all the time and I can't produce decent work while doing that. So my grades have suffered and my parents will grill me about that. I have no idea where I want to go in life, it seems like everyone surrounding me is doing all this things, holding all these leadership positions and doing important internships and jobs and here I am just sitting at my computer. I have tried to remain optimistic and proactive. For the beginning of my depression I was able to do all my work and get good grades, I was able to apply to a bunch of internships. But as time goes on none of it has really improved my life. Things are still just as horrible as ever. I have tried CBT and more traditional therapy, and I was on anti-depressants but none of those things did any good. I exercise 6 days a week and that hasn't changed things either. I have already tried to kill myself, it was a half hearted attempt with pills when i was drunk, and all it did was make me feel awful the next morning. But honestly I don't know how much longer I can go on like this. I want with all my heart for things to get better, but I have lost the motivation to try. I tried already and it did no good. I can't keep going on if I don't get any results to keep me moving forward. I won't kill myself tonight or in the next week, I still have to work up the courage to do that. But I am afraid, I am getting regular thoughts of suicide and that is a start. I don't know what to do, nothing feels worth living for if things don't change or get better."

My girlfriend (F20) and I (M20) have known each other for 7 years, been friends for about 5 years and only got together last year (we've been together roughly 5 months now)

Here's the thing, I love her, a lot, I know it's a little early in the relationship to tell but it somehow feels like she's the one; I feel comfortable around her and I've many plans for the future and they all include her! I know she loves me too, but there were a few incidences that happened over the course of the past 2-3 weeks that made things take a turn for the worst (I believe it's a rough patch but this is my first relationship so I'm not sure if it is...)

A month back, she started a pretty stressful internship (in addition to that, she's been pretty depressed about her family issues, university applications and a currently still ongoing pregnancy scare) 
Things started to turn a little downhill after the 2nd week of her internship where she started to have a severe lack of sleep. She was getting roughly 3 hours of sleep daily and had severe insomnia, plus her hormones was making things worst. Hence, she started to slightly more severe mood swings!

Now this was probably the tipping point, there was this one night where she apparently really really wanted to meet me and talk to me...but stupid me only heard how tired she was over the phone and constantly told her to go get some rest. After hanging up the phone, I kinda sensed that something was off so I went to buy some desserts and dropped it off at her house kinda expecting her to be very happy but she apparently got even more pissed cause I was ""here's the dessert!! I'm going to go now so please go get some rest ok?"" And she felt like I left her hanging the whole night... 
I didn't realize this till the next day when she canceled our supposed date because she felt like I was too busy and went to meet our friend instead. 

Feeling quite upset, I asked her what's going on and that's when she kinda laid most of it on me saying that I wasn't there for her when she needed me and that maybe I didn't understand her because I didn't realize that she wanted to speak to me. She did say afterwards that she realizes how high of an expectation that is and that perhaps her expectations of me were too high. We talked it out and I thought it was settled since this was the one off time I read her wrongly and That's when she told me this line which hurts till today...
""Nothing changed, just that when I have troubles you won't be the first guy I go to for help now""

It hurt when she said that but I was determined to win her trust back regarding this issue.
Then came our overseas trip! We were both super excited at first but the day before the trip she got into a car accident and she fell into a state of depression afterwards. This time I did manage to pick up the signs and went straight to her house with some macaroons (her favourite) and managed to cheer her up which was great! Now the overseas trip seemed like it was going to be great but...

Due to my lack of sleep + unfocused mind (I was worried because she was treating me pretty differently) I was a klutz throughout the trip. Taking out my phone in the middle of the road etc and she constantly had to pull me out of dangers way. (This only happened in the morning for some days though) 

And everything I did kinda ticked her off, be it my endeavors to cheer her up or me doing my own things. There were moments in the trip that made it feel like everything was back to normal and we were both super happy again but at the last night of the trip we were talking about our future when she suddenly laid this on me again 
""... I want you to be the one but somehow it feels like you're not""
""I love you, but something is stopping me from loving you more""
""I need a man, and you're more of a boy""
""I feel like I can't rely on you anymore""
""I like the man you want to be and not the person you are right now""

I don't blame her for saying this because I was indeed acting like a boy, doing childish things and basically being a klutz. But this isn't how I normally am back at home and despite her making me super sad during her mood swings where she pushes me away, I love her to bits and I'm willing to improve myself and mature more to prove to her that I can be the one!

One thing to note is that she's been a few weeks late in her menstrual cycle and we did get her checked and the doctor said that she wasn't pregnant but probably all the stress is causing her hormones to get screwed up. Which is a possible explanation as to why she's feeling so ""ugh"" to whatever I do and I'm really hoping that it is. I want to believe that this is a rough patch and we both did agree to work things out and give me time to mature but somehow deep in me it feels like things would never get back to the way they were.

What should I do? 

TL;DR
I wasn't there for my girlfriend when she needed me and acted like a boy and klutz in our overseas trip which led her to feel like she can't rely on me and hence she lost the feeling that I am the one."

I come to you with a desperate plea because I have no friends to confide in so I must confide with strangers on the Internet. At least you guys seem to be an amiable bunch that are more likely to help out than tell me to kill myself (which I have to admit has come across my mind more than a few times in the recent past). I've posted this on /r/mylittlesupportgroup and I don't know your rules on multiple posting, but if I don't get help soon, I fear what I might do.

I need life advice. 

Ever since I've left high school, my life has been nothing but a string of failure after failure. I was originally accepted to the University of Waterloo in Ontario, for an ambitious program that combined a computer science degree with an accounting degree. I originally wanted to be just computer science, but with influence from my accountant mother, she encouraged me to take CompSci with Accounting.

I moved out, then something in my head just switched. In high school, I was a responsible honor roll student who got all As with little to no effort. When I moved out, I just let go of everything. All my classes started failing, I got sucked into different computer games that sucked up all my time, starting with Skyrim, then into League of Legends. 

After I moved out of the dorm without steady internet, I realized how wretched of a person I could become. I remember that after every class, instead of going somewhere to study, I went to one of the common rooms with my PC, mouse and mousepad ready, hooked up and just played League of Legends until an ungodly hour before returning to my room to sleep. I've also downloaded a porn game and fapped to it until 5 am in the morning, making me unable to go to class the next day.

After a straight year of mediocre marks, my parents and I agreed that maybe Waterloo was too difficult of a university and that I should go to an easier university. Better to do well in a lesser university than to do bad in a good university right?

Well, moving to York University initially wasn't so bad. I did get good marks initially. But this year, I've once again failed my parents and myself. My League of Legends addiction stayed, causing me to play instead of studying, causing me to bomb my midterms on two of my major courses, causing me to drop one and end up getting a D in the other. I never paid attention in class, I was too proud and stupid to think that I needed to. ""I would read that on my own"" I said to myself, but I never did since my nights were filled with League. Since I also repeated an accounting course that I needed for an internship but didn't get the mark I needed last semester, but since I kept forgetting to do online assignments and didn't pay attention in class, I ended up getting a worse mark than before. I'm very lucky that the internship office said that they could make exceptions if my GPA was high enough.

Now, with the beginning of my new semester, my ol' faithful ASUS laptop that fed my addiction to all of my video games for the past 4 years has died and I've managed to get some time to think about my life. I decided that I would start paying attention in class, start studying and stop playing so much games, especially since the laptop I have now can only play shitty games.

However, my dad just talked to me about an hour before I typed this. He and my mom have been nothing but supportive of me throughout my failure at Waterloo, but my recent failings has recently driven them over the edge. My mom, who was usually a taskmaster behind me in high school and my main motivation for getting good marks often came from her, has become more dismissive and pessimistic about me and my schooling. My dad picked up on this and after hearing about me fucking up last semester has issued an ultimatum.

If I don't start pulling my marks up (and B's are probably not going to cut it), he said that he no longer wanted to feel like a failure as a father and wants me to live alone. For the past 20 years of my life, he has offered nothing but support and fatherly advice, but I have never done any of it. I can't blame him for wanting to kick me out. I've wasted so much money with my failure and appear to want nothing more but to play games all day and night.

I don't know what to do. I want to believe that I can study and do better in school, but I don't know if I can at this point. I have already promised myself the same thing multiple times in the past, but I always seem to forget the strife and pain that I went through just a few months before and fall into old habits.

I've already feel guilty about all the shit I've put my parents through and it's beginning to affect my head. Ever since I've failed those midterms last semester, every time I go through any kind of emotional stress, I've been getting these intrusive thoughts in my head. ""Maybe you should just kill yourself,"" they say. After I hear these things in my head, I always find myself going down a train of thought analyzing the benefits of suicide, how it would help my parents not have to feel as failures anymore and how I wouldn't have to worry about disappointing them anymore. I'm scared of what my own mind is doing that is seemingly out of my control.

Even with suicidal thoughts and all of my parents efforts, I am very afraid of falling back into the cycle of improving, then forgetting and returning to old habits that will cause failure. I'm lost. I cannot tell anyone in my life about this. All of my friends wouldn't know what to tell me and probably couldn't tell me much but basic uplifting tropes and shit. I don't want to put all of my emotional baggage on them. They don't deserve it, they have their own lives to worry about.

The only glimmer of hope I see is that I have been successfully working out at home using workout videos. Although most of my drive to get in shape was to get ""a pornstar body"" (I'm really fucking motivated by sex for some reason), it's about the only good thing I have going for me. Hell, that might be the only way I could make money when my dad kicks me out and I have to start whoring my self out.

Please, I need help. I need a third party to tell me what to do. I keep seeing the pattern of my life but I just can't seem to break the cycle. With my dad about to kick me out, I'm really afraid that if I don't pull my marks up and turn myself around, I may end up on the news no more than a year later as a dead man who hanged himself in a local alley.

Any kind of advice is needed, even if it's just a redirection to a larger advice subreddit. I've tried to find one but Google didn't help me this time. Please, I don't know what to do."

Or should I just die now,toosadtolive,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/250wq5/i_hate_myself_sooooo_much_is_it_possible_to_ever/,"I've been depressed since I was in the seventh grade.. Only 12 years old. Because of daily bullying from my ""best friend"" every day since fourth grade, I already felt like I wasn't good enough by mid grade 5. By middle school I was used to people treating me like trash and by ninth grade, I was very suicidal. I cut myself for the first time in a bathroom stall at school and since then, I was hooked. I spent all my time thinking about suicide and I thought of ways to kill myself. I even wrote several suicide letter and I always revised them because I didn't want to leave anything out. 

Finally my family moved to a different state, and I left all those people who bullied me behind. Unfortunately my memory is really good and even now, I can remember specifically what many people said to me and what they did. And at my new school, people were so friendly to me   and one of the popular guys at school asked me to homecoming. I was basically transparent and everyone I met could tell I was extremely insecure and I had numerous people ask me what I was so insecure. I made some good friends there and overall got a little bit happier, but underneath it all, I was still so insecure and hated myself.

I had always read that college was supposed to be the best four years of your life. Well when I went to college with high expectations and thought I would finally leave my self-loathing behind and find myself. All my good friends went to the other side of the country for college and they all got in serious relationships, scored internships, got really involved, have high gpas + are preparing for med school/law school, etc. And there's me: I went to college, I was on my own for the first time and so lonely and depressed. I lost my virginity to a frat guy who kept pressuring me and calling me a bitch and insulting me until I gave in. When I did, he treated me like girls are treated in vulgar porn scenes. I got even more depressed and slept with three more guys within the next few months, and one of them treated me like shit as well. I even cried while he just laughed. I know some girls are okay with sleeping around (and that's fine), but for me, it makes me feel like shit. Every day I think about this and I can't believe I let guys treat me as badly as they treated me. I realized that my whole life, I've only had one guy who has liked me for me... Everyone else was people who have never spoken to me and most of them lose interest once they actually know me. This is disheartening.. it's like my true self is unattractive. I lost all ability to focus and can't even study.. Whenever I actually attended class, my brain was all foggy and I couldn't bring myself to listen. I failed almost all my freshman year courses, and got kicked out. But I appealed, got back in, and ended up getting kicked out again at the end of this year. I have a total of 19 credits after 2 years at college, and now I have no school and I owe 20k in student loans. I had a job but lost it because I couldn't control my anger at work one day and caused a scene. I finally got a job the other day as a door-to-door marketer, but that is the WORST job ever, I am depressed as fuck and I have to act happy, KNOWING that I'm annoying the fuck out of other people. 

Idk when I think about it I just don't really see a future for myself... I don't see myself getting anywhere in life and I really don't know why I bother to keep myself alive... I've hated myself for so long I just don't know if I can ever like myself again...Why live when I don't?

So, I landed an internship in the bay area as a software engineering intern. My interview questions were all algorithmic based (arrays, sorting etc). Now, when I got the letter, and as I spoke to my internship head, he says my job is to work on Ruby on Rails development. 

I accepted the position because I was willing to learn and this seemed like a fantastic opportunity, but the problem is that I don't have experience in Ruby on Rails. How should I go about it? Can I learn the basics in 4-5 days? I don't have much time before I join.

Thanks!"

Hi. Throwaway account.
I, 24F, have been in a relationship for 6 years with my SO, 21M. We live together in a small student-studio, and have been living there for 4 years. We rarely fight, and never really had issues. Recently, he went to Malta for three months, for an internship. 

Going abroad was something he'd really been looking forward to. I couldn't be equally excited, but I wasn't going to be in his way either. We made plans to Skype a lot, play Minecraft together a lot, and to watch movies together. 

When he arrived, none of these plans were followed through with. He was always watching movies/series with his new-found friends, or he went out. Eventually, we settled on Skyping 2-3 times a week, while playing chess and rambling. The rest of the time we'd send messages through Viber. I was lonely, but learned to adapt. 

After two months, I got the opportunity to visit him for a week. It was awesome, and everything felt like it was back to how we were before this LDR. Just being together was amazing, and we spent the week being very much occupied with one another. We also talked a lot and I felt like he really understood all my concerns and loneliness. I went home with a happy heart, ready to embrace those last three weeks. 

However, in those last three weeks, things have gone downhill. He lost his phone during our trip and now we can only contact one another through Hangouts. We chat during the day, but not overly so. Sometimes he leaves for half an hour or even several hours and he forgets to tell me. Most of the evenings he's going out. We've only Skype'd 50 minutes a week - and only because we watch Game of Thrones together. That's it.

Yesterday, I had a hysteroscopy because I had surgery a while back. It hurt a lot, and the outcome wasn't positive at all. All he was saying was how terrible he felt for not being able to be there with me, and I was the one comforting HIM over that. I suppose, it's an upgrade from him just belittling my issues, going 'Nah, you'll see, it'll be nothing.' or 'They'll just give you a pill to fix it, don't worry dear.' 

The hysteroscopy caused me to feel lonely, anxious and stupid. He wasn't there for me afterwards, either - he went out with his friends again. I sent him the following e-mail: 

*I know you're coming home soon.*
*And I really don't wanna nag.*

*But in the past weeks, the only Skype-time we've had is one hour/week, and only for watching GoT. We do virtually nothing together, except chatting.*
*I know you're just trying to make the most of your time there, and that you'll be here soon, but please forgive me for feeling a little 'off' about this whole thing. Especially tonight. Sorry.*

*Love you a lot. It's the chocolate talking.*

*Gnite.* 

He ignored it and sent me his usual 'Goodmorning honey &lt;3' messages. We chatted a little, but it seems like I can't feel any of the closeness I usually feel. He said he was sick and going to bed last night, very curtly, and when I asked him what was wrong, he simply repeated himself and logged off. I asked him if he was feeling better this morning, and what he was feeling, and he said: 'I told you I had sniffles.' 

He didn't tell me that at all. This is a recurring issue where he tells someone something, and then he thinks I magically also know what he's said.. 

I'm really engaged. I post things on his Facebook every two weeks or so - he ignores it, while I know he's online and talking to other people on Facebook. It's come to a point where I start freaking out about things I normally don't freak out about, like: 'Why is he ignoring everything I send him on Facebook, but he is liking other girl's pictures?' 

He's coming home in one day and a few hours. But I'm not sure I want to be there when he does. I'm contemplating calling my mother and to drive home with her for the weekend, and to just ignore him. 

On the other hand, I know he probably doesn't mean it this way at all. But it's hard for me to see any other perspective. 

Sorry for venting.

[TL;DR: Boyfriend of 6 years goes to Malta for three months, suddenly we're not talking as much anymore and all the time we'd usually spend together is now spent 'out with other people'. We Skype'd for 50 minutes/week for the past three weeks, and only for watching Game of Thrones. I sent him an e-mail, which he ignored. Not sure I want to be there at the airport when he comes home in one day. I feel really sad, distanced and alone.]"

What I did was basically use ctrl + f for everything that the manager wanted done. I didn't really learn much but I tried by trial + error until I changed the program to how my manager wanted it. 

I think being honest about that is good for the interview but I know I should explain how I SHOULD have went about it in hindsight. This was a program sort of like Paint/Photoshop for reference. I only had Intro to CS 1 and Intro to CS 2 under my belt and simple knowledge of Swing as my starting knowledge base.

I should have my first degree this fall. I've been trying to gain formal IT experience but just can't land an internship anywhere.

Does anyone work at or know of an organization that I can volunteer at for IT help? I'm fairly proficient with computers and enjoy working on them and building them in my personal time. Any help would be appreciated, thank you.

EDIT: Adding some background info as someone mentioned it wouldn't be a bad idea. (reply from below)

It's taken me 10 years because I took 5 years off from school. I traveled to Europe and tried a career across the country that didn't work out. I found out real quick that I do not like Sales. I racked up full time bills so I've had to hold a full time job. I've been taking 3 classes a semester for the last 3 years.

I would consider my stronger skills to be hardware related, I absolutely love tearing up PC's, stressing and pushing hardware to its limits. I think switches and servers are fascinating and would love to tinker with them more but I have never had the access to one.

If I have ever had a problem with software I could almost always figure out the problem and never really struggled operating typical software. I have some very basic SQL knowledge and UNIX programming knowledge.

My biggest skill would probably be my Work Ethic. I always see the socially inept IT staff at the hospital and how they communicate with guests, patients, and other staff members and I just feel that they are all IT knowledge with no soft edges. I always think to myself given the chance and with the same training that they received I could always see myself doing a better job than the next guy.

I know I am going to have to start at the bottom of the bucket and crawl my way upwards, and I am perfectly okay with that. I am so willing to have a chance at a full-time position I would even work for free for months to receive training and a chance to see how I work and work with others. The problem is I cannot give up my current 6am-2pm job because of my bills.

[Original](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/24v7fn/my_21_f_roommate_and_best_friend_20_f_threw_out/)


I will try to make this as clear as possible, even though I'm typing it during a work break.




Immediately after I posted on Reddit, a lot of you had the same advice to report her to the nursing board, residence life, the nursing department at our college, to the police, to the sorority, and to her parents. I decided to report her to all of the above while hiding at the sorority house.


Early yesterday morning was when Sarah made her Facebook post about me, and it took only until after lunch for my sorority sisters to start texting me like mad. This was not the first time that Sarah had shamed another sorority sister for having an abortion, and that particular woman (we will call her Emily) was one of the highest ranking members. Emily was the one who called the meeting to have Sarah kicked out for breach of the code of conduct (treat all your sisters kindly, support one another, no gossiping, etc).

Meanwhile, Residence Life was busy trying to contact Sarah's parents after I showed them her facebook rants. After the sorority contacted Sarah, she flipped out yet again on Facebook and started to rant about how she wanted to die.

The RA on duty (also one of my good friends) had decided to go speak to her to see if they could help. At this point, it was clear to everyone that Sarah was not right in the head, because she was screaming at her through the door crack. Sarah refused to answer the door, so the RA decided to escalate it higher and no one saw Sarah until the sorority meeting.

**The Sorority Meeting**

At the meeting, everything seemed to be okay. Sarah was the last person to arrive and she just took her seat and acted normal. It was eerie to see her gush over everyone only hours after she pulled her stunt. Only about half of the sorority was present, but the president decided to proceed regardless. It only took two minutes for us to vote unanimously to kick her out. Emily sat next to me the whole time. To put it mildly, Sarah did not take this well. She turned bright red, spit on the ground in front of Emily and me, and ran out of the room screaming. We called campus police on her as she left.

**After the Meeting**

Sarah returned to our dorm room. The Res Life Administrator tried to speak to her, but she refused to answer the door for over 20 minutes. They had to call the police to kick down the door because she was holding the handle on the inside so they couldn't unlock the door. The police showed up, kicked down the door, and found the dorm destroyed.

All the furniture had been smashed (or scratched if it was too heavy), the carpets were covered in food from the refrigerator, and she had painted random swear words on the wall in what looks like blood (but she had no scratches on her, so who knows where the blood came from). The found photos of Harold covered in lipstick in her purse (this wasn't like a kiss mark from lipstick, but more like she used a lipstick to entirely cover Harold's face like a crayon). **She resisted the police trying to peacefully convince her to accompany them to the hospital.** Sarah was taken to the hospital and charged (I'm not sure what the exact charges were, but I am aware that it includes unlawful posession of prescription medication because they found my pills in her purse and they had my name on the labels). She is still in the hospital today undergoing a psych evaluation.

**The Hospital**

Sarah and I were both interns working for the hospital that operates the pregnancy clinic. I reported her to HR for theft, harassment, and privacy violations along with giving them screenshots from Facebook.

As of this morning, Sarah did not turn up for work so she was terminated for no call no show. HR had me in their office for an hour this morning asking if I would like to press for a HIPAA investigation (It turns out that some of her facebook rants had information that could only be obtained through patient records. I have no idea what information it was since it was the HR lady who found it). I said yes, because there's no way it would hurt for Sarah to be investigated. HR also notified the Nursing Board and the Nursing Department at my college independently of my reports.


So I think that's pretty much everything. Sarah has been arrested and charged, kicked from the sorority, fired from her job, kicked out of the dorms, and numerous reports were made to the proper authorities. I still care for Sarah with all of my heart, because I realize that she is severely mentally ill. I will always blame her for what she did to me, but I know that it wasn't the best friend that I knew for all those years. It was a different person who did that to me.

I am feeling physically fine after all of this. Harold and I are talking about getting an apartment off campus together. If that doesn't work out, I will stay in the sorority house. Sarah's parents have promised to pay me back for the abortion costs ($400) because they know I didn't do anything wrong. I'm grateful that I have their support.


TL;DR: Sarah has been arrested, everything turned out okay. You should probably read the whole thing for details.

I would never declaw my cat, but I don't know what to do.",Seinpheld,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/251ux5/my_22f_brother_27m_and_his_fiance_25f_want_me_to/,"I would like to preface this post by saying I completely understand why my brother and his fiancé would want my cat to be declawed. I am not ignorant to the fact that he could tear up their furniture. 


I am very close with my brother and his fiancé; we hang out regularly and get along great. They moved into a new home about 6 months ago and subsequently got engaged. We have all been living in the same city for the past four years, as they both have jobs here and I was at university. I recently was accepted into the dietetic internship through my university and will be moving in with my brother and his fiancé for a year starting in August to save (a lot) of money. They are doing me a huge favor by allowing me to live with them, and I couldn’t be more thankful. We are all very excited to be roommates.


The issue: I have a 2-year-old cat and he is my world. I would not have gotten through university without him. He is very well mannered and an all-around perfect cat. He does scratch his claws, as most cats do, but his scratching is limited to one black chair that he has used since he was a kitten and his scratching post. Before moving in, my brother and his fiancé want me to get my cat declawed. There is absolutely no way I would ever declaw my cat; I find it very inhumane. I am not saying that people who declaw their cat/s are terrible people or that no cats should ever be declawed, I just personally don’t believe in doing that. At first, my brother said I did not have to get him declawed because he knows how much I do not want to do that, and his fiancé was the one saying I needed to get it done. Now they have reversed roles and his fiancé is saying I don’t have to do it and my brother is saying I should and that he will even pay for the procedure. However, money is not the issue. I don’t want my cat declawed. I also think it’s unfair to take his claws away for the rest of his life because of a living situation only lasting a year.


So Reddit, I don’t know what to do. I have no idea what my options are. I don’t blame them for wanting my cat declawed, but I really believe he would be just fine if he still were able to use his two scratching items that he uses at my house. He responds well to the water-bottle approach, so if he starts scratching other furniture I believe this will work. Do I have any other options? I can’t live anywhere else and I don’t want to ship my cat somewhere else. But I also don't want to end up having arguments about my cat while living there. How do I help them to understand my side of this matter? Any advice is welcome, especially if you have been in a similar situation.


**TL;DR my brother and his fiancé want my 2 yo cat to be declawed prior to moving into their house. I would never declaw my cat, but I don’t know what my other options are. I don’t know how to help them to see my side of the story** 

**EDIT** First, I would like to thank everyone that took the time to read my post and provide comments and suggestions, they were so helpful! I would also like to say that I never forced my cat onto my brother and his fiance; they offered to take both of us in for the duration of my internship, and they really do love my cat and are looking forward to having a pet in the house. They just wanted his nails declawed as a precautionary measure (understandable.) Here's the good news! After reading all of your comments (both positive and negative) I decided to go over and talk to my brother and his fiance. I told them that I was not taking the fact that they are allowing me to live with them for granted, and that I am thankful beyond words that they are putting a roof over my head. I then explained why I am so resistant to get my kitty declawed, and used a lot of examples that you all had provided me. I was not forceful and just tried to provide them information without being biased. They were so understanding. They told me that they wouldn't want to put my kitty or me through that, and they especially wouldn't want him to acquire any destructive behaviors due to the procedure. We collectively decided that I will continue to regularly clip his nails, and if need be we will buy the SoftPaws :) I cannot begin to tell you how grateful I am to have such wonderful family members in my life. I am so lucky. Thank you, Reddit, for helping me find solutions to my problem! xx

252cnv,862,2014-05-08,The Three Lessons I Learned Pursuing A Career in Psychology,Human_Gravy,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/252cnv/the_three_lessons_i_learned_pursuing_a_career_in/,"My dream was to become a psychologist. It began when I was a young boy and my parents thought a visit with a therapist may assist in curbing some behavioral and social issues they were concerned about. The office was welcoming in its warm and friendly atmosphere. The therapist was a sweet lady that asked me to sit down and spoke with me about anything and everything that I wanted. She gave me advice on how to handle my thoughts and feelings along with something she referred to as “impulse control”. Eventually, we began to confide in each other and I started helping her through her issues too. We saw each other for years until she retired and moved to another state. A long lasting impression had been made and right after high school, I enrolled in college declaring myself a psychology major.


The program was difficult with all the lecturing, research papers, and tests but that wasn’t fulfilling my desire to help people. I don’t know how they expect students to gain experience without interacting with real clients. Case studies were bullshit, I wanted the real thing. They say that if you want to start changing the world, you need to start in your own community so I began to console those in desperate need on campus. While it did not gain me popularity with my peers, it was a valuable first lesson: You cannot help those that do not wish to help themselves.


I tried to help the women first since my therapist was a woman and I felt I had a better connection and understanding of them. Not that many women accepted that their binge drinking, experimentation with narcotics, and sexual promiscuity was a result of their father’s molestation, paternal lack of attention or male presence in their life, or an unconscious emulation of their mother’s behavior. I expressed my desires to help the fix their obvious moral flaws but I was met with physical violence more often than not. 


The men were equally as unresponsive to my diagnosis of their overwhelming desire to prove their masculinity. Their fixation on chugging beers, bedding women, and acting as an “alpha male” was due to underlying issues with unacknowledged homosexual tendencies and incestuous desires for their mothers. These encounters solidified my belief in helping only those that want to be helped. When I presented my theories to these troubled men, I was met with fierce emotional outbursts and threats of violence. 


As much as I wanted to help my fellow students, I couldn’t save them from themselves. It’s not about nature vs. nurture. It was their environment that didn’t help them see the forest from the trees. I switched my approach and found a method to have those in need come to me. I applied for an internship at a therapist’s office where I was assigned administrative work. Although it wasn’t what I signed up for, I made the best out of it. When the therapist attended conferences and after closing time, I was able to gain practical experience by scheduling my own appointments with new patients. Over three months, I had developed a client list. I must have done an amazing job because none of my clients ever returned after a session with me. 


The arrangement went well until the police crashed one of my sessions at the behest of the therapist. Some of my clients had called and complained about my treatments. The police became involved when some clients had relapsed and harmed themselves or others. I was shocked at that accusation that my patients had committed these crimes because of my malpractice. That’s where I learned my second most important lesson: you cannot blame yourself for client failures. You can’t win them all and some will fall between the cracks. Even though the weaker willed clients ruined my practice, the police were interested in having me do some work with them, pro bono, of course. 


They escorted me down to the precinct where I was assigned a private room and two new clients waited for a session. They read me the Miranda Rights which was unnecessary. I swore that under the rule of doctor/patient confidentiality I would not disclose any information to anyone about them without their permission. They questioned my qualifications, experience, and competency. I can understand why that clients are interested in the lives of their therapists but these questions probed too deeply into my life. After I finished my session with those clients, they told me that they wanted to keep me on for a little while longer. I was escorted to a cell for the night. I couldn’t imagine why they would put me there but I did not ask questions. It was probably due to budget cuts that they couldn’t give me a hotel suite. 


The next morning, I was bought into another session with a new client. The man introduced himself as my lawyer. I laughed at the joke and thanked him for the offer but I didn’t require his services. It would be a violation of ethical standards. The man didn’t seem to understand my refusal of his services and continued to act as if he was performing the duties of a lawyer for me. His case was very extreme but my job is to understand him, not argue about reality. 


Like the clients before him, he asked questions about my credentials and services performed for clients. Privilege would not allow me to disclose any personal information about them. I redirected the questions toward the lawyer in order to better understand his obsession with his job. My diagnosis was a combination of grandiose delusions, narcissistic disorder, and he was most certainly a pathological liar. Compulsive lying for a lawyer is an understandable portion of the job but his attempts to convince me I was in trouble with the police were bordering on the line of delusional. 


After finishing the session with the lawyer, I was taken into a court room to serve as an expert witness. I had never been in a courtroom before but I found it strange that the judge had referred to me as the defendant. I identified myself as an expert witness. The lawyer told me to stop talking which I took as an offense. We are both professionals. There was no need to treat me like a child. Why would they invite me here, as an expert witness, only to have a client keep me silent? Since the lawyer was the expert on law and court, I stayed quiet while I awaited the defendant to arrive. No one else showed up. 


The judge asked the lawyer for a plea on behalf of the defendant. He responded: “not guilty by reason of insanity.” I finally understood what they needed from me. I had spoken out of turn and was reprimanded before. The lawyer asked me to take the witness stand and answer questions. Once again, my credentials were scrutinized until I was dismissed. I don’t know how I was much help to the defendant as I had never met the man or woman before and could not judge their sanity.


After some deliberation, all parties concluded that the defendant was unfit for trial. I’m glad I was able to stop them from putting a mentally ill man through trial. He wouldn’t even be able to understand what was going on around him. The judge was impressed with my work and assigned me to a new position at a mental health institution. 


When I arrived, I was given an office with a desk, chair, and bed. The state must really be going bankrupt if this is how they treat their employees but that wouldn’t stop me from doing the job I was born to do. My client list consisted of daily sessions with other therapists that worked in the facility with me. The job required me to be there 24/7 but at least they were providing me with food, clothing, medical care, and restricted internet access. That’s where I learned my third lesson: always discuss your salary before you start doing a job. I never spoke with anyone in human resources about how much I was being paid for my services. I’ll have to discuss payment with them at some point in the future. For now, I am the happiest man on Earth. My childhood dream came true.

252dss,14,2014-05-08,The Three Lessons I Learned Pursuing A Career in Psychology,Human_Gravy,DarkTales,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTales/comments/252dss/the_three_lessons_i_learned_pursuing_a_career_in/,"My dream was to become a psychologist. It began when I was a young boy and my parents thought a visit with a therapist may assist in curbing some behavioral and social issues they were concerned about. The office was welcoming in its warm and friendly atmosphere. The therapist was a sweet lady that asked me to sit down and spoke with me about anything and everything that I wanted. She gave me advice on how to handle my thoughts and feelings along with something she referred to as “impulse control”. Eventually, we began to confide in each other and I started helping her through her issues too. We saw each other for years until she retired and moved to another state. A long lasting impression had been made and right after high school, I enrolled in college declaring myself a psychology major.

The program was difficult with all the lecturing, research papers, and tests but that wasn’t fulfilling my desire to help people. I don’t know how they expect students to gain experience without interacting with real clients. Case studies were bullshit, I wanted the real thing. They say that if you want to start changing the world, you need to start in your own community so I began to console those in desperate need on campus. While it did not gain me popularity with my peers, it was a valuable first lesson: You cannot help those that do not wish to help themselves.

I tried to help the women first since my therapist was a woman and I felt I had a better connection and understanding of them. Not that many women accepted that their binge drinking, experimentation with narcotics, and sexual promiscuity was a result of their father’s molestation, paternal lack of attention or male presence in their life, or an unconscious emulation of their mother’s behavior. I expressed my desires to help the fix their obvious moral flaws but I was met with physical violence more often than not.

The men were equally as unresponsive to my diagnosis of their overwhelming desire to prove their masculinity. Their fixation on chugging beers, bedding women, and acting as an “alpha male” was due to underlying issues with unacknowledged homosexual tendencies and incestuous desires for their mothers. These encounters solidified my belief in helping only those that want to be helped. When I presented my theories to these troubled men, I was met with fierce emotional outbursts and threats of violence.

As much as I wanted to help my fellow students, I couldn’t save them from themselves. It’s not about nature vs. nurture. It was their environment that didn’t help them see the forest from the trees. I switched my approach and found a method to have those in need come to me. I applied for an internship at a therapist’s office where I was assigned administrative work. Although it wasn’t what I signed up for, I made the best out of it. When the therapist attended conferences and after closing time, I was able to gain practical experience by scheduling my own appointments with new patients. Over three months, I had developed a client list. I must have done an amazing job because none of my clients ever returned after a session with me.

The arrangement went well until the police crashed one of my sessions at the behest of the therapist. Some of my clients had called and complained about my treatments. The police became involved when some clients had relapsed and harmed themselves or others. I was shocked at that accusation that my patients had committed these crimes because of my malpractice. That’s where I learned my second most important lesson: you cannot blame yourself for client failures. You can’t win them all and some will fall between the cracks. Even though the weaker willed clients ruined my practice, the police were interested in having me do some work with them, pro bono, of course.

They escorted me down to the precinct where I was assigned a private room and two new clients waited for a session. They read me the Miranda Rights which was unnecessary. I swore that under the rule of doctor/patient confidentiality I would not disclose any information to anyone about them without their permission. They questioned my qualifications, experience, and competency. I can understand why that clients are interested in the lives of their therapists but these questions probed too deeply into my life. After I finished my session with those clients, they told me that they wanted to keep me on for a little while longer. I was escorted to a cell for the night. I couldn’t imagine why they would put me there but I did not ask questions. It was probably due to budget cuts that they couldn’t give me a hotel suite.

Elsewhere, such as [here]( http://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/24ein4/google_and_netflix_are_considering_an_allout_pr/ch6e4mb), I have proposed that we write letters to the editor and submit them to our local or regional newspapers.  These letters should call out our legislators by name and call on them to re-classify ISPs as common carriers.

[I’ve explained why the LTE is a useful tactic]( http://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1os8rz/how_to_get_your_senators_and_representatives/) on a number of occasions, but the core concept is simple: emails and snail mail to the offices of your legislators will generally be read by an intern or a low-level staffer, whereas a published letter to the editor will likely end up right on the legislator’s desk because he or she knows—while many of us forget—that older generations vote more reliably than do younger generations, that older generations still read the newspaper, and that a well-written letter to the editor can influence the opinions of other constituents, whereas a private message to your legislator will not. 

In order to encourage people to write letters and to provide examples for those who aren’t confident in their writing, we’re going to be running a contest with this thread and are encouraging everyone to include in the comments section here letters to the editor that they have submitted or will be submitting to their local  newspapers.  The winner will be decided on May 15, a week from today, on the basis of how many upvotes each letter has accumulated (downvotes will be ignored).  The winning submission will be featured in its own sticky thread for at least 24 hours, and this thread will be included in the sidebar of this subreddit so that anyone who finds his or her way to our here will have examples of letters to draw from when they write their own.

If your letter is a first draft that you’d like to have critiqued by other users, please make a note of it at the top of your comment.  And if you don’t want anyone borrowing phrases from your letter when they write their own letter to their legislators, please explicitly say so.

Note: I will be adding my own letter in the comments section.  If my letter—or a letter submitted by one of the other mods—has the most upvotes after a week, the winner will be the most upvoted submission not made by a moderator.

Without further ado, let the contest begin!

252fgs,15,2014-05-08,So I'm not allowed to personally email my head developer,hellojava,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/252fgs/so_im_not_allowed_to_personally_email_my_head/,"I recently acquired a job as a developer at a startup. I'm still in college studying computer science, so, while I enjoy programming and solving problems, my experience with software and application development is little to nil. 
So I got my first project today. I was asked to create the inner workings of a simple contact form on the play framework. It seems easy enough: I've found some good documentation, but, at the same time, I have a million questions about the source code I'm working on. I was literally given thousands of lines of code and asked to figure it out myself. At the same time, I'm not allowed to email the head developer (Who is in Russia but speaks fairly good English) personally as he is busy working on integrations, and the CEO said he will be unable to answer my questions.

So, my question to you guys is: 
Is this a common practice in development? Do companies usually hand their intern source code with an assignment and ask them to go at it?

Your input would be appreciated.

[When the bubble bursts, how will it effect global economic trade with China?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/251h8c/iama_expert_on_chinese_business_and_how_chinese/chcp77k?context=5)|It's hard to tell when and if the bubble will burst. China’s banks look very similar to US banks before the 2007 bust. They are thinly capitalized and made risky loans in an environment characterized by slowing growth. If markets lose faith in the Chinese banking system, it could lead to a cascading liquidity crunch and rapidly deteriorating growth across the globe. Additionally, the Chinese government is limited in its policy response, because bailing out the banking system could alienate the middle class 
[Do You think Alibaba could take over Amazon or eBay someday?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/251h8c/iama_expert_on_chinese_business_and_how_chinese/chcp982?context=5)|Not in the US. Their primary market will always be China. However, new models for growth like it's AliExpress, could do very well in the US. Alternatively, its e-commerce 3rd party payment tool Alipay could make inroads in the US yielding opportunities for Chinese consumers to buy directly from US retailers 
[Can you give us an idea of the products Chinese consumers might be interested in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/251h8c/iama_expert_on_chinese_business_and_how_chinese/chcraw9?context=5)|It really depends on what type of consumers you are targeting and what suppliers you have access to. For example, authentic luxury goods from the US and EU are in high demand. Also, beauty products - skincare, makeup. Baby products - infant formula, and just about anything else. Be aware, not all of these consumers are in tier-1 cities. Lower tier consumers make frequent purchases online because there are not as many flagship branded stores in their cities.
[Would China be better off if they just took a huge hit now and stopped loaning the U.S. money?  Is the Chinese Government buying commodities to hedge against inflation globally?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/251h8c/iama_expert_on_chinese_business_and_how_chinese/chcpmeq?context=5)|China's ""go out"" policy at the government level is it's primary policy framework for international investment. As you look at its motivations, for doing so, it can be broken down into the following areas - investing in state-owned enterprises that go global allows China to invest it's US foreign exchange reserves (now approx 4 trillion) in a more controllable fashion than traditional investment vehicles. It allows the government to gain access to natural resources the country needs to fuel it's economy. Lastly, it helps create ""national champions"" or globally recognized Chinese companies that help boost China's softpower and raise its image on the international stage.
[What is one tip you would give a smaller business to be more successful?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/251h8c/iama_expert_on_chinese_business_and_how_chinese/chcp5tz?context=5)|If you're looking to enter the Chinese market for the first time as a small business you should really look at e-commerce. Platforms like Alibaba's Tmall International, are a great way to test the market before making a big investment.
[What are your thoughts on the Chinese real estate bubble?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/251h8c/iama_expert_on_chinese_business_and_how_chinese/chcrmlk?context=5)|I think the real estate bubble is in line with one of the many potential destabilizers of the Chinese economy. Refer to my note about ""shadow banking""
[There are so many ""manufacturers"" over there than just get some parts and put them together...how do I find the ""true"" manufacterers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/251h8c/iama_expert_on_chinese_business_and_how_chinese/chcpnsz?context=5)|The best way to find manufacturers in China to produce a product is via Alibaba.com. Their rating system allows you to determine who are good manufacturers and who are not. There are even 'verified' manufacturers where representatives from Alibaba go on site to the factory to audit the operations.
[Thank you! I've done some of that, my problem is that if I could skip the guys calling themselves manufacturers and get the parts to put together myself, I could reduce costs greatly. When I talk to them they all say it's their factory that makes them, but I'm almost positive that's not the case.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/251h8c/iama_expert_on_chinese_business_and_how_chinese/chcpw38?context=5)|It depends on how much work you want to do yourself. There are third parties that can take care of everything from payment, shipping, customs, etc. Or you can work with several individual manufacturers. It just depends how much time and money you want to invest.
[Any advice for a student studying communications who aspires to work in the PR/Marketing industry? Also, any places in China/around the globe where there are an abundance of opportunities for a future uni graduate fluent in Mandarin Cantonese and English like me? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/251h8c/iama_expert_on_chinese_business_and_how_chinese/chcrtct?context=5)|PR and marketing is probably one of the better areas to get into in China as a foreigner. If you speak Chinese fairly fluently you can get a job as a English copyeditor at  PR firm in China. With time you can rise to take on more significant roles within the organization.
[Is it true that Chinese companies will hire westerners for executive/managerial positions, just because they think that having an american/european-looking guy in charge will make them look more globally successful &amp; financially savvy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/251h8c/iama_expert_on_chinese_business_and_how_chinese/chcqard?context=5)|There are certainly cases where westerners are hired to be an ""international representative"" however if you look at larger companies making headlines around the world, the hire actual experienced western executives who have global experience and can bring new capabilities to their organizations.
[That does sound more reasonable.. Although, I have heard of situations where they'll hire westerners to sit in meetings and look rich, because they want to appear more capitalist?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/251h8c/iama_expert_on_chinese_business_and_how_chinese/chcr00h?context=5)|I think it comes down to face, or what Chinese call ""mianzi"". Having a foreign face at smaller firms doing business in China is a good 'credential' as they seek ways to position their firm against competitors.
[To what extent has outbound investment so far been led by the state?  Do you think China's going-abroad strategy is going to influence the balance of state vs. private ownership in the business sector?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/251h8c/iama_expert_on_chinese_business_and_how_chinese/chcq2fl?context=5)|Ill be back in 5 min to answer.
 |Chinese companies (both state-owned and private) are going overseas for two reasons - government-driven and business-driven motivations. While there certainly are government motivations which I mentioned about, the business motivations are very real. This is because the domestic business environment across a variety of industries is very competitive and also decelerating. Therefore, Chinese companies are going overseas to access new markets, secure new capabilities in the form of brands, technology and management capabilities. This is much easier in other emerging markets across SE Asia, Latin America and Africa, but it becomes much more difficult in advanced economies like the US and EU where there is much more regulation.
[Are there any pending US/EU policies that will drastically change the status quo?  Will these policies potentially be changed by the upcoming elections?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/251h8c/iama_expert_on_chinese_business_and_how_chinese/chcpi5b?context=5)|As you look at Chinese investment in the EU it becomes very complicated depending on where in Europe these investments occur. Deal reviews are typically conducted by individual governments and not the EU as a whole. Under the current system a Chinese company could have a deal blocked in the UK, then make the same investment in a less-regulated central european country and then freely trade their products across the EU. 
[What's the best approach for small company when contacting producer in China to get the best deal (best prices\) even if it's for small amounts of goods that are being ordered ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/251h8c/iama_expert_on_chinese_business_and_how_chinese/chcqf9t?context=5)|Small amounts are very hard. For the best deal you really need to buy quantity. Small batches are best to use AliExpress, large batch use Alibaba.com.
[A close friend of mine is going to begin attending NYU Shanghai next year for business,  what's your opinion if the school if you have one?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/251h8c/iama_expert_on_chinese_business_and_how_chinese/chcrhga?context=5)|I don't know too much about this particular program. I do know there are several top tier universities from the US that are opening co-branded programs in China and in other parts of Asia. They usually have the same faculty and curriculum to maintain the quality of education.
[Hey thanks for taking the time for this AMA, this is a really interesting subject. Japan and China, being neighbors, have always had a trading relationship. However, this relationship has been strained due to PM Abe's efforts to expand the Japanese self defense force and the touchy island ownership rights, not to mention lingering resenentment from WWII. Do you see their relationship ever improving or is it going to be as strained/uneasy as it is now forever?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/251h8c/iama_expert_on_chinese_business_and_how_chinese/chcqrtc?context=5)|I think we're at a particularly tense time when it comes to Sino-Japanese relations. It's difficult to say if this will ever go away given the long history, but it should hopefully not remain as tense as it currently is at the moment.
[As a student in uni studying International Business &amp; Marketing and minoring in Mandarin, how would I get a foot in the door into the China-US B2B relations field? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/251h8c/iama_expert_on_chinese_business_and_how_chinese/chcrdlp?context=5)|You should do everything you can to get relevant internships. Do your best to build up a practical skill like sales, or design. If you speak mandarin and have a marketable skill, you'll have great opportunities after your graduate.
[This guy is so obviously a representative for Alibaba, guys.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/251h8c/iama_expert_on_chinese_business_and_how_chinese/chcrsti?context=5)|I'm not. If you know anything about e-commerce in China, then you would know that Alibaba has a particularly strong position in the market. JD.com does well in the consumer space, but in all other categories niche players barely have any significant marketshare. 
[Hi, I am planning for the future is my money best going into a chinese business or a African business based in a country China are investing in.  I fear China's one child policy will kill growth in 15 or so years and China will be a mess with an ageing pop.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/251h8c/iama_expert_on_chinese_business_and_how_chinese/chcp71f?context=5)|We are at the very early stages of a wide-range of cross-border opportunities that will emerge as a result of China's globalization. From China's so-called 'walking wallets' the name used to describe its luxury-buying tourists, to trade linkages with Africa and Latin America, to the impact of Chinese firms operating in the US - like Shuanghui international's acquisition of American pork-producer Smithfield Foods.
[I thought China got rid of the one child policy ban.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/251h8c/iama_expert_on_chinese_business_and_how_chinese/chcpeca?context=5)|It's only in certain cities at this stage. Many cities now allow parents who are both single children to raise multiple children.
[Mostly, they'll temporarily hire a westerner who's already in China to wear a suit, and pretend to be an executive. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/251h8c/iama_expert_on_chinese_business_and_how_chinese/chcquv2?context=5)|I think theres a good NYT article about this somewhere. Google it.
[How would one stop them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/251h8c/iama_expert_on_chinese_business_and_how_chinese/chcpdye?context=5)|Of course, many in the United States are rightfully worried about the threat Chinese investment could pose to domestic security and competitiveness. However, there is no need to ""stop them"" - Chinese investment can lead to many benefits such as job creation, infrastructure development and increased tax revenues. The key is for the government to have the right regulatory processes in place to ensure potentially negative investment from China that could result in anti-competitive or national security threats are blocked.
[Doesn't the Chinese practice of currency manipulation harm these developments from occurring? Surly this and the other shady trade maneuvering, made by China, can be detrimental.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/251h8c/iama_expert_on_chinese_business_and_how_chinese/chcpqze?context=5)|I think the real worry is China's shadow banking sector. Shadow banking refers to any financing provided to a Chinese company by a “non-bank” entity. According to Reuters, China’s shadow banking industry is comprised of “thousands of unofficial credit providers, pawn shops, trust firms and various other loan vehicles ”. The shadow banking sector was allowed to flourish without much government intervention, because private companies helped offset the cost of supporting unprofitable SOEs while Beijing tried to maintain high levels of economic growth. 2013 estimates by global investment bank UBS put the size of the shadow banking system at $3.4 trillion – equivalent to 45 percent of China’s GDP.

I’m a German student, currently in my second semester of my Business Administration Bachelor, and I’m thinking about switching my major to Computer Science or “Business Informatics”, which is a double major in Business/CS. I got into programming only 2.5 months ago and but spend a lot of time doing it, and I definitely want to pursue a career in software development.

Because by the time I could switch my major, I would already have spent two semesters on my business admin degree, so switching to the major “Business Informatics” would be easier for me, because I could keep all my grades from this year (which were quite good) and I’d have way less workload in my next semesters and would have more time to learn other things. However, because the CS classes of this major build up on each other, I would also have to spend the same time on this major as if I would start at 0 with a full CS major. 

Also, the “Business Informatics” major has only 6 CS related basic classes and of course doesn’t cover CS topics in the same depth a Computer Science major does. In these basic classes Id learn the basics of Java, basic data structures and algorithms, Database basics and some web languages. In this major I’d also work on 2-3 projects during classes and I’d have one Bachelor project on which I’d work for two semesters. One specialization of this major I’m interested in is “Computational Finance“, which has classes in Heuristic Optimization, and the basics of Artificial Intelligence. 

I don’t know if a double major in CS/Business drastically lowers my chances of getting a decent developer position, because it has a reputation of not teaching programming properly in Germany. Of course I plan on getting internships and building a good portfolio during my studies. 

**TLDR: Currently in my second 2nd semester of my Business Admin Bachelor; Got into programming and want to switch my major to a tech related degree; A business/CS double major would be an “easier switch”, but wouldn’t cover CS topics in the same depth as a normal CS degree.**

**Is it worth it in my situation to start all over with a CS degree or could I just make an easier switch to the double major and focus on internships and own projects?**




Thanks in advance for your help!"
252hl7,6,2014-05-08,Feel like shit after exams. I want to quit I failed life.,LookThursday,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/252hl7/feel_like_shit_after_exams_i_want_to_quit_i/,"       I feel like shit I know I did badly on my first exam. It was a choose a or B and explain type question I knew I should have picked B. Not like, I was going to pick that, but like I really knew, the answer was this, but I was so fucking stupid and I did B.
      Second exam, I studied for weeks in advance. I read the questions too slowly and I didn't have enough time to finish. There was also a question I just didn't know how to answer that was 1/10th of the exam.
     Third exam is tomorrow, I haven't studied because I was working hard for the A's in my first two exams. I failed. I Fail. I failed. I don't want to go on anymore. I will after I stop being such a little bitch, but I think I am going to fail tomorrow.
I bought three chocolate muffins after the exam and that was pretty bad, I heard that's like the equivalent of cutting yourself in the emotional aspect (I wont physically harm myself, but I according to psychology I just did)

I failed at fucking everything and I failed everyone. I failed myself, my parent, my family and the people who are paying my tuition. (after I transferred someone decided to pay the other 5% not covered in my grant. I don't know what I am going to tell them when they ask me about my grades)

 Then I failed my fucking self by eating the muffins knowing they will take me back a month in the gym, because that is why I failed everybody. I gave up and had no discipline so I ate them to hurt myself.

I was terrible in school because of my time management. Otherwise I would do well on my homework assignments.When I was able to manage some time I failed at studying which made it pointless. I told myself I had ADHD and needed adderall to focus, but I know that's a fucking excuse I just need to focus more and stop going on the computer or day dreaming while ""I study."" I spend my time reading articles on the internet and end up going to bed at 5 am when all I wanted to do was study. No, I didn't spend time partying because I would always be ""studying.""

The thing that makes it worse is that I know what I am fucking doing everything wrong but I just can't fix it. I have done this before my freshman year went down to a 2.75 one semester after getting a C in a science class. Next semester I got a 3.75 which included a B+ in a more advanced version of the course I got a C in.

It is different now because now this is something I can't bounce back from. It would take 4 semesters of A-'s in all my classes to get to a 3.5. All because of one bad semester. Even If i get those A-s my employer won't care,  they will see only a 3.5. I would have to give up my extracurricular activities that have added something new to my life. I am terrible at networking, have no social skills and I don't know anyone so my grades are all i have. In fact I don't even know if I am just not smart enough for this school. 
I had a bad semester with no excuse other than I clearly wasn't responsible enough and I couldn't handle this. I could just have asked for the extended time which I qualified for it, but I told myself there is no extended time in the real world. I was so fucking stoopid. I just cried after reflecting on my life, I don't know if that is what you call self pity, I brought myself to a low point. I feel like an insecure, proud failure who tries too hard. The worst thing to be. Then I realized that if I couldn't handle this how could I handle a career in finance, as a business manager, as anything? I want to change my life.I want to cut this emotional bullshit. 


 I am not in tears at this point it has all passed, but I already wrote it so I might as well continue. I feel like I should go attempt to focus on my last test. It is the toughest one. The teacher is a super hard grader. I have to find a way to do this. 

I feel like I want the next school year to start. I want to get those A-'s. I want to change myself and gain discipline. I want to spend this summer studying. I couldn't find an internship. I have no friends to spend it with. what else will I do? Just wish there was someone that could help me through it all. Otherwise I am going to give up again. 

Its all gone now, nothing to write. That I want to succeed inspiration faded too. I wish I could just fucking focus and pump out these research essays for tomorrows exam like a normal person. Will i fucking fail this final I hope not. I just want to quit. 

Why is my life like this? Why am I like this? Why do I think so much?

[SLS seems to have encountered more criticism than average for a heavy launch vehicle. How has this affected your experience with the program?  Also, obligatory question about whether any of you have played Kerbal Space Program.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25250r/small_rockets_to_big_rockets_ask_our_nasa_team/chcwa7o?context=5)|Interesting question on criticism.  Personally, agency level criticism does not effect me day to day because we are so busy working technical details in developing our booster - making sure it will be ready for launch.  So when I see it in the news, it is a little frustrating, because I believe this rocket will provide a great capability, both for manned space flight and for unmanned science applications.  But I don't personally spend any time worrying about it because I want to get this booster right for any mission.  And no, I have not played Kerbal, but my son has told me about it and said I would love it.  Bruce 
[Do you feel that soon the US will experience a resurgence of it's space obsession that will allow NASA a larger budget for space flights to other planets?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25250r/small_rockets_to_big_rockets_ask_our_nasa_team/chcwc2r?context=5)|I sure hope so.  My 3 children are really excited about space and rockets and I wish for nothing more than an increase in American desire to reach beyond and do what we can do best. Gordie.
 |NASA has, historically, received strong support from Congress and our Presidents, so I'm guessing that the agency will continue to receive strong support, and a larger budget would surely help!  I would love to see a surge in the space program  that would mimic the excitement of the space program in the 60's. -Eddie.
[For getting into the field, what college degrees are most useful?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25250r/small_rockets_to_big_rockets_ask_our_nasa_team/chcw50t?context=5)|Hello out there, Thanks for being interested!  Most folks I work with in the SLS Booster office are engineers by trade, but we have all kinds - mechanical, electrical, aeronautic, and materials at least.  Personally, I have undergraduate degrees in geology and mechanical engineering and a masters in mechanical.  I was a thermal analyst in my early years before I moved into project management.  But any project like this takes hundreds of people, including financial and business expertise as well as engineering.  But certainly engineering is the primary degree we use.  Bruce.
 |There are several different degrees which help when working on any space program.  Mechanical, Aerospace, Electrical, Chemical, Systems, Environment Engineering are useful, but also business, accounting, and management degrees come in handy.  -Eddie.
 |I'm an Aerospace Engineer, I think that's most likely your best bet for getting a job at NASA, considering what we do. That being said, I have met a number of other various engineers at the center: chemical, nuclear, mechanical. Any engineering degree will you get a good start at a job though really. Answer taken with a grain of salt, I'm just an intern. :)

[What is your favorite thing about being part of NASA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25250r/small_rockets_to_big_rockets_ask_our_nasa_team/chcxwu7?context=5)|Hey penguinkitten, my favorite thing is that it's a GREAT place to work.  My job is a lot of fun.  NASA was selected as one of the top places to work in the government. I work with college students on a daily basis who are building rockets for us.  Additionally, I work with bringing on students as Pathways Interns.  But, NASA is always working towards new and great things... which inspires me everyday.  - Julie.
 |I love supporting an agency that is on the cutting edge of science and technology.  People all over the country seem to be enamored with NASA, and I'm proud to be a part of that!  -Eddie.
[What does someone in the UK, currently in secondary school, need to do the become an engineer at NASA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25250r/small_rockets_to_big_rockets_ask_our_nasa_team/chcxtw2?context=5)|To work directly for NASA, one has to be an American citizen. However, we have many contractor partners helping us build our SLS rocket that hire engineers from all different countries. Our engineers generally have degrees from accredited University in an engineering field and there are many different fields for engineers - aerospace, electrical, mechanical, industrial, chemical, environmental, etc. Good luck!  -- Shan.
 |NASA offers a limited number of opportunities for international participation.  Most projects are only available to students within the United States or its territories; and Department of Defense schools operating on U.S. Military Installations. However, there are several projects that will consider applications from international students.
 |One option you may wish to consider as you prepare for college is the NASA Academy.  You can obtain information and how to apply at: [Link to www.nasa.gov](http://www.nasa.gov/offices/education/programs/descriptions/NASA_Academy.htm) .  For information about all of NASA’s Education projects for students, please visit following Web page: [Link to www.nasa.gov](http://www.nasa.gov/offices/education/programs/index.html)
 |NASA  offers a number of activities, contests, and other opportunities that are currently available for students.  The list on the following Web page is updated as new opportunities are announced: [Link to www.nasa.gov](http://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/current-opps-index.html) - Julie.
[What is a basic set you want to build a rocket yourself? Edit: And what are often made mistakes and how do I prevent them if I'm building a rocket myself?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25250r/small_rockets_to_big_rockets_ask_our_nasa_team/chcwd8a?context=5)|If you're talking about hobby rockets, there are several inexpensive, commercially available kits that are a great way to get started.  One of the most challenging aspects of building a hobby rocket is the recovery system(s).  Be sure to seek guidance and advice from experienced rocketeers to be sure that you learn good habits and develop reliable recovery systems. -Eddie.
 |I think Eddie gave a good answer, for a first time build get a kit, then move on to designing your own rocket using a program like [OpenRocket](http://openrocket.sourceforge.net/) or [RockSIM](http://www.apogeerockets.com/Rocksim/Rocksim_information). [Apogee Components](http://www.apogeerockets.com/Rocket_Kits/High_Power_Rockets)  is a good place to start. Look into any local rocketry clubs in your area to get some help from the experts.
 |Edit: As for common mistakes, you shouldn't make many if you start with a kit build. The components are going to be strong enough for what it is made for, just be sure that you use a high quality epoxy and don't skimp. Let it cure fully. After the first launch the shock cord or parachute may have some damage. Be sure to inspect the rocket after each flight for any damage.

[What do you think of Russia's plan to build a super rocket capable of lifting up to 130 tonnes, and also colonize the moon by 2030?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25250r/small_rockets_to_big_rockets_ask_our_nasa_team/chcymjf?context=5)|I hope it'll reinspire the US to have a space race again! :) - Julie.
 |I think it is definitely possible.  The next stage of the SLS program is to develop their heavy lift vehicle that can carry 130t of payload to orbit.  Combine that with the initial SLS lift capability of 70t to launch the astronauts into space and you have 200t of payload! :)
 |I really hope we as Americans can get there first! :)  We've done it before and I know we could ""win the race"" again!  We have brilliant minds and capabilities in the upcoming generations of youth that are looking toward the stars! Gordie.
[How has the privatization of space missions effected NASA's future in Washington D.C.? Due to this competition, will NASA head into a more supervisory role (contracts, safety &amp; mission planning\) and away from actual building of rockets, vehicles &amp; rovers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25250r/small_rockets_to_big_rockets_ask_our_nasa_team/chcwgi4?context=5)|I think it takes both commercial and government involvement.  The private launchers we are funding are designed to bring crew and cargo to Space Station, while the SLS rocket that NASA is developing, is built for non-routine, deep space exploration.  So both paths are needed.
 |Hi EyesEvrwhr, NASA has been going to low-earth orbit for a long time.  We can now leave that to the private companies to continue that effort while we explore further.  So in my opinion, the privatization only helps us to continue to support things like Space Station.  NASA has many partners that help us do our job.  Thanks! - Julie.
[As someone who was pretty interested in rockets (from a huge interest in outer space\) but could never afford the hobby as a kid or teenager, now that I'm older, where does one even begin getting into rocket design and whatnot?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25250r/small_rockets_to_big_rockets_ask_our_nasa_team/chcxqq6?context=5)|I think we've pretty much answered this question [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25250r/small_rockets_to_big_rockets_ask_our_nasa_team/chcwd8a). Take a look and let us know if you have more questions, we'd be happy to answer.

[This may sound like an incredibly stupid question, but why do rockets have to be SO incredibly complex? Surely after all the years of development and progress in building them, they could be simplified and made cheaper. Or are they relatively simpler and thus cheaper than they used to be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25250r/small_rockets_to_big_rockets_ask_our_nasa_team/chcxyvv?context=5)|The U2 does get pretty high, about 70k ft by a quick search online. However the edge of space starts around 5 times that altitude, and the space shuttles goes quite a bit higher than that. Airplanes work in the atmosphere, they work by having air fly over the wings to produce lift. As you get into space there is less and less air. Not to mention the fact that airplanes use air-breathing engines. They don't work where there is no oxygen to burn. So you said it yourself, you still need a rocket, they carry all their own fuel and don't need extra oxygen to create lift. Also, the U2 gets up there by being incredibly efficient and not having a lot of extra weight it has to lift, like a rocket engine and payload. I know that they have looked into air launched vehicles, but it's not efficient, and doesn't end up saving any money to get things into space.
[Also, I've always been confused as to why a rocket as we know them is necessary. I understand the earth's gravity has to be escaped, but can that not be achieved by launching like a normal plane, and spiralling up, then perhaps using some sort of smaller rocket motor to push out of the last bit of atmosphere? The U2 spy plane can get pretty high, so if it had a small rocket strapped to it, could it get higher? Expanding on that idea, something the size of a 747 could theoretically do the same? Or could it? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25250r/small_rockets_to_big_rockets_ask_our_nasa_team/chcxyvv?context=5)|Not a dumb question at all.  It takes an enormous amount of energy to carry any decent amount of payload into space.  That's why the Satern rockets were so big (Satern V - 363 ft tall, SLS is 321 ft tall) and the engines have to be so powerful.  One fun fact I see is that our SLS rocket has the thrust of 135 jet engines on a 747 jet.  Gravity has not changed since Satern, and basic rocket chemistry has not changed either - which is why the rockets are still very similar.  Bruce  And yes you could definitely start be taking a plane that can fly really high and then strap a rocket to it and launch from there.  You should google a new concept by Stratolaunch Inc. (a Huntsville, AL company created by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen).  They are developing a low-cost satellite launching system using rockets made by Orbital Sciences Corp.  The contract is to build the world's largest air-launched space rocket.
[How did you land your jobs? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25250r/small_rockets_to_big_rockets_ask_our_nasa_team/chcw7w5?context=5)|Hey everyone,  I obtained a degree in Elementary Education and became a 5th grade math teacher.  While I loved teaching, it wasn't what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.  I found a contractor job in the Education Office here at Marshall Space Flight Center.  After 7 years, I went back to school and obtained a Masters in Human Resources Management.  By going back to school, I became a co-op and eventually a civil servant.  I love my job!!  - Julie.
 |I have degrees in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering.  I supported NASA Marshall Space Flight Center's Non Destructive Evaluation office that tested various space flight hardware flight and test articles for the Space Shuttle, International Space Station, and NASA's newer work.  At a time when work in my specific office was running low, I applied for my current job and accepted an offer. -Eddie.
 |Hey,
 |My name is Jason, I'm and intern working with Julie Clift on the Student Launch team. I don't know if I'm the best to answer this question being just an intern, but I can tell you that I got the job by being on my school's Student Launch team as an undergraduate. I was on the team for a year and then I became a lead for the team. Julie saw that on my resume and called me up to offer the job!
 |Jason.
[ Will the SLS Booster in EM1 be recovered? Can a Europa Clipper reach  Jupiter’s Moon  in less than 3 years using the SLS? Will the MegaFlex still make as a wing of the Orion? Is the Cygnus Service Module with Ultraflex solar Panel capable of being utilized as a space tug for Expandable Habital Modules? When will the Stratolaunch Pegasus launch? Aside from Rockets, Space Solar Panels will you not make a HumanSpaceship in the future? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25250r/small_rockets_to_big_rockets_ask_our_nasa_team/chcwu2x?context=5)|I can only answer one of these since I work the Booster.  We were going to recover it under Constellation - in fact ATK developed and tested a new parachute system for that booster.  But when SLS came about, the requirements and flight manifest changed and recovery was no longer the best cost option for our system.  Bruce.
[How much impact do you see 3d printing having on the industry?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25250r/small_rockets_to_big_rockets_ask_our_nasa_team/chcwwup?context=5)|As an intern here at Marshall, we were taken on several tours. One of the big ones was to show us all the additive manufacturing capabilities that we have on center. There are a good number of people working on 3D printing here using it to create different parts. I know that they said they were making quite a few different things to be tested in rocket engines. They were all extremely hopeful there, telling us that printed parts were a fraction of the cost, many times quicker to produce, and gave nearly the same strength as machined components. That being said there is still a lot of work to do. Different printers give different material properties, and there is little oversight in the process. Part of the work they were doing there was qualifying different machines and processes, pinpointing the properties that a certain technique will give you to create a database that companies can point to in the future when ordering printed parts.
 |Jason.
 |I think that 3D printing will have a major impact in the manufacturing industry.  I have had fun model rockets created by 3D printing on my desk for over 10 years.  The technology has been around since the 1980s but only recently has it become much more economically available and the technology has improved dramatically.  NASA employees at Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) have already created a 3D rocket engine part and used it flawlessly in a real launch.  The part they recreated was stronger and much cheaper than buying from an outside vendor.  MSFC also has a Deep Space Habitat division where they are creating a mockup habitat of what astronauts might live in while travelling to Mars and they have shown that they can create needed tools or parts in space as they travel.  I think that is an invaluable resource when you are away from your home on planet Earth and all the resources we have here! :)
 |I wonder if I can create a model of myself! :) (Actually a German company creates ""Barbie"" size replicates of people, for a price of course!)
 |Gordie.
[Beyond ion engines, what technologies are realistically feasible within the next generation to provide very high specific impulse propulsion?  Is VASIMR anywhere near being ready for prime time, or does it seem like there may be some major hurdles left to cross? Are there lesser known technologies that have turned out to be promising, at least in theory?  I've heard that there has been a lot of work in low energy interplanetary transfer over the last decade. Has NASA actually found the math to hold up, or is that still mostly mathematical theories that have yet to work out in application?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25250r/small_rockets_to_big_rockets_ask_our_nasa_team/chcyrso?context=5)|I'm not much of an ""exotic propulsion"" guy, but I know electronic propulsion has been used as a low thrust, high Isp alternative. -Eddie.
[Project Constellation was developing the Altair lander along with the Orion, are there any plans to use the lander with the SLS Block II and return to the moon's surface for testing habitats intended for a future Mars mission? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25250r/small_rockets_to_big_rockets_ask_our_nasa_team/chcwiit?context=5)|I just work the booster development, but I am not aware of plans to use that specific lander in the near future.  I remember it was discussed in Constellation days that we would use the moon as an outpost, but I don't think we have that right now.  The SLS rocket can certainly go to the moon and the first two test flights send the Orion around the moon and back, but no landers involved.  Bruce 
[I don't know anything about rockets. What's a cool fact about rockets?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25250r/small_rockets_to_big_rockets_ask_our_nasa_team/chcxus6?context=5)|Speaking specifically to NASA, the SLS will be able to launch the equivalent of 22 fully grown elephants as a payload.  =) -Eddie.
 |And... it (SLS) will produce the horsepowere equivalent to: 208,000 Corvette engines or 17,400 locomotive engines.  Wow! - Julie.

I did build and fly two rockets obtaining my level 1 and level 2 certification.  So... anyone can build rockets.  But, the hardest part for me, was seeing my rocket go out of eyesight and praying it would come back.  It did! :)  - Julie.

[What is the biggest amateur rocket each of you has flown?  How high did it go?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25250r/small_rockets_to_big_rockets_ask_our_nasa_team/chcxa40?context=5)|Hey Cablancer2!  I'm not a huge hobby-rocket person, but have flown two.  I hope to get back into it one day.  My largest was on a J motor and flew to about 5,000 ft.  What about you?  - Julie.
 |I've flown a 6"" wide, 38 lb rocket to just over 14,000 ft with good recovery. -Eddie.
 |I made a 3"" diameter rocket about 4' tall for my level 1 certification flight. I flew it on an I216 to about 3000'. I didn't have an altimeter on that one so I'm not certain. Had too big of a parachute though, I walked around for close to 3 hours looking for it. I went home without a rocket, but I was called up by the farmer who's land we were on and got it back several months later.
 |Currently I'm working on a level 2 rocket that will be electronic recovery with an IMU in a payload bay. It's a modified [kit](http://www.madcowrocketry.com/Arcas_HV_Rocket_p/k-144.htm) build, I'm planning on putting a J in it, haven't decided which one exactly.
[Julie, I'm really wanting to go in to NASA Education - particularly at MSFC where I have already been looking into internship opportunities. After the Shutdown, the budget forceast for Education and Outreach in our government offices looked bleak. At the university I'm associated with right now, our outreach opportunities in many departments were tied to NSF funds and things are having to get creative - to put it positively.  I believe that NASA education, particularly opportunities like this Launch event, is going to be essential to creating the broad scientific literacy that will ensure long-term support for the SLS and its goals.  So what *good* news can you give us about the future of non-rocket scientists at NASA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25250r/small_rockets_to_big_rockets_ask_our_nasa_team/chcwmlo?context=5)|Hi Tuesday_D!!  Great question!  There are currently not any open opportunites in our office... however, most people think to only look at USAJobs for opportunities.  I was actually a contractor before becoming a civil servant.  So check out the contract that supports the office, in this case, Aetos just received the new contract.  They are likely to have more opportunities available.  Additionally, it's always good to have a teaching degree to work in our office, if you don't already.  There is also a new program called Pathways.  If you are interested in going back to school, you can apply for the Pathways Intern opportunites on USAJobs.  If you've graduated within the last two years, the Pathways Recent Grad opportunities are a better fit.  As far as the future of non-rocket scientists at NASA, there are more opportunities that people often don't think about.  We have photographers, graphic artists, TV broadcasters, communications, human resources, protocol, and a number of other positions that support those great rocket scientists.  I hope that helps answer your question! - Julie  
[I want to go into NASA, but I am not sure what major to take, base in your personal experience, Would it be better to be into multi-disciplinary majors? Or should I specialize in one specific field?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25250r/small_rockets_to_big_rockets_ask_our_nasa_team/chcx8k6?context=5)|Hi AricYael - I would recommend looking at what interests you first.  For example, Marshall primarily works propulsion.  Each of the ten NASA Centers has different expertise.  Because of being a propulsion center, we hire mostly aerospace and mechanical engineers and less of electrical, physics, and science majors.  But, as I said, look into which Center fits your interests.  - Julie.
[Simple question here, how fast can you possibly make a rocket these days? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25250r/small_rockets_to_big_rockets_ask_our_nasa_team/chcwyvo?context=5)|Depends on what type and size of rocket you are referring to.  Are you talking about a rocket like the size the college groups in the NASA Student Launch are creating or are you talking about NASA's SLS rockets? Gordie.
 |With experience, you could build an average sized high power hobby rocket in a week, although the more you rush, the easier it is to make a mistake.  The lifecycles of NASA rockets varies from several months to many years, depending on the type, size, and mission. -Eddie.
[I'm asking about NASA's SLS rockets.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25250r/small_rockets_to_big_rockets_ask_our_nasa_team/chcx9hm?context=5)|To make one rocket doesn't really take that long.  Back in the Shuttle days we could start a new rocket segment every week.  (Remember the Shuttle rocket had 4 segments stacked on top of each other.)  It took about 1-2 months to complete everything, including safety inspections, on each segment and then ship them to Florida to be stacked.  The SLS rocket has 5 segments but it would still only 2-3 months to get all the parts to FL.  What I did not include is how long it takes to stack the rocket booster in FL (of course times 2 since there are 2 boosters on the SLS vehicle).  The SLS vehicle also includes the Core Stage which I have no knowledge on their manufacturing capability.  The stacking of the whole integrated vehicle then has to occur.
 |Of course I'm only talking about the pure manufacturing timelines.  You still have to take into account all the design and development time up front before you can start building a space vehicle.  That timeline is dependent on the government budget allocated to space and the size of the workforce that can support the program.

[Rockets now run on a new type of fuel, Pancakes or Waffles. Which is it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25250r/small_rockets_to_big_rockets_ask_our_nasa_team/chcx412?context=5)|Pancakes!  They taste better, so they have to be a better fuel, right?  =) Eddie.
 |Well I know I can run off both waffles or pancakes or either, depending on my mood! Gordie.
 |I'm a waffle girl. - Julie.
 |I'm a Waffle house man, no pancakes for me, but honestly I prefer bacon, eggs, and hashbrowns over those.

[Which is more powerful a Liquid or a Solid Rocket?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25250r/small_rockets_to_big_rockets_ask_our_nasa_team/chcxwxu?context=5)|That all depends on how big the rocket is (not dependent on whether it is liquid or solid).  If you are talking current rockets that exists today then the largest solid rocket engine (one SLS booster) produces around 3.6 Mlbf of thrust and the largest liquid engine I can think of that has actually been used (the F-1 engine) creates around 1.5 Mlbf of thrust.  Notice that usually when someone uses a liquid engine they group together 3 or 4 or 5 engines to get enough thrust.  It all depends on what your design requires.
 |Honestly I think the best space vehicle needs a hybrid of both solid and liquid rockets.  The solids will give you the best thrust to get out of Earth's orbit and the liquid rockets to support that and then provide additional needed thrust and maneuverability while operating in space.
 |Gordie.
[What are the big differences in rocket engine designs since the 60's?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25250r/small_rockets_to_big_rockets_ask_our_nasa_team/chcyaf5?context=5)|Hey luizluiz - I'll answer your second question: NASA offers a limited number of opportunities for international participation.  Most projects are only available to students within the United States or its territories; and Department of Defense schools operating on U.S. Military Installations. However, there are several projects that will consider applications from international students.
[I mean, the F-1 engine is an engineering marvel even by today's standards, what are some of the improvements we can make today?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25250r/small_rockets_to_big_rockets_ask_our_nasa_team/chcyaf5?context=5)|One option you may wish to consider as you prepare for college is the NASA Academy.

[How much funding do you need vs how much funding do you get?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25250r/small_rockets_to_big_rockets_ask_our_nasa_team/chcy5g2?context=5)|Hey NorbitGorbit - As much as we can get!!! (I know that's not a good answer, but we went from receiving 4% of the federal budget in the Apollo days vs. less than one half of 1% now).  - Julie.
 |We could all use a little cash! :) Gordie.
 |Honestly it depends on how fast and how successful we want to be.  If the Space Program had unlimited funds like they kind of did back in the Apollo days, then we could get back to the Moon and eventually Mars quicker, and with a vehicle that had every design feature in it that we wanted. Gordie.
[I used to be obsessed with space as a kid - growing up, Sally Ride was one of my biggest heroes, and I was positive I wanted to join the Air Force, be an engineer, and then fly space shuttles or some such. Over time, the normal foibles of life lead me to end up taking my career in a different route, and I've ended up a working scientist, but a Wildlife biologist instead - pretty far off from anything space related! I still have a deep passion for all things space exploration, though, and have wanted to be involved in sharing that interest in space with the next generation; I feel like space inspires people in a way my own field doesn't. Do you have any advice on how an 'expert' non-expert could get involved in outreach and education in that regards?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25250r/small_rockets_to_big_rockets_ask_our_nasa_team/chcx9ni?context=5)|Hey TwoYaks, I understand.  I'm a non-engineeer myself and found a passion for NASA later in life.  The first astronaut I met was Eileen Collins, the first female commander of the Space Shuttle.  What an amazing woman!  My degree was in education, so obviously NASA needs all kinds of people.  I would recommend looking into programs, like the Solar System Ambassador for providing outreach and education.  Here's the site: [Link to www2.jpl.nasa.gov](http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/ambassador/) - Julie.
[Why do we need the new SLS and not use the one that was used during the Apollo missions?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25250r/small_rockets_to_big_rockets_ask_our_nasa_team/chcy04y?context=5)|The technology on Apollo was less than what your cell phone can do now.  We've taken certain aspects of Apollo and Shuttle, developed some lessons learned, and recreated a newer, better rocket.  I usually tell my students when they ask about why we retired the shuttle... ""Would you like to be driving a car that was built in the 1970's?"" (or in the Apollo case... many years before that?) :) - Julie.
[What is the cost breakdown for building and filling the rockets you work with?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25250r/small_rockets_to_big_rockets_ask_our_nasa_team/chcy4m0?context=5)|Generally, the biggest cost of a project, both in time and money, is the development (design stage).  Manufacturing costs less, and the fuel costs less.  Generally speaking...  -Eddie.
[I'm curious about fuel vs. manufacture vs. design costs.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25250r/small_rockets_to_big_rockets_ask_our_nasa_team/chcy4m0?context=5)|I don't know exact percentages but in order the design costs are the greatest, manufacturing costs are the second highest, and the actual fuel probably comes in third.

If it happens, you can sign me up! -Eddie.
[I'm also curious about how allowing SLS a longer timeline to operations has changed the program dynamics. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25250r/small_rockets_to_big_rockets_ask_our_nasa_team/chcwnjc?context=5)|Not sure I understand the question - can you elaborate?

I set a soft budget cap at $1500 USD and this is what I came up with. 

Since it's my first build I figured it would be best to get a little input before I go and buy everything. I'm mainly building it for gaming, but I'm also going to use it for programming, web dev, and some Photoshop work.

I'm also looking for recommendations on a good mechanical keyboard and mouse since my current ones are getting pretty old.

I am a computer science student from the uk. In roughly a months time I will start a 2 month Internship in Chengdu, Sichuan province.

I have been researching over the past month. Unfortunately I am left with a fair few questions despite all my research. I wanted to ask a few questions:

*I am of Indian ancestry (aka brown guy) born and raised in Britain about 5'9/5'10 tall and will turn 19 during the trip. How can I expect to be treated as a foreigner?

*Are there any Mandarin phrases or words which might be essential for getting around and general interaction while I'm in china?

*How would I go about striking up conversations and making friends with locals? 

*Are there any places I should go to for entertainment and to meet new people?

*Women?

*Anything I should avoid doing?

Thank you,

253l0p,1,2014-05-08,"I'll be doing really well, and BOOM! I have an ""off"" day that culminates in a panic attack. I don't really know how to approach this.",[deleted],Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/253l0p/ill_be_doing_really_well_and_boom_i_have_an_off/,"I'm just wondering if this is something that you guys deal with. I don't entirely have it figured out, but it's happened twice in the past two months, and I have a feeling it will continue to happen. I was feeling really great this week. I actually socialized and kept myself busy and exercised on both Monday and Tuesday. But by Wednesday, I just felt really sad. I was on the verge of tears all day, and I kept crying for no reason. I went out with my friend hoping that I could stave off my sadness with some fun, but at the bar, I just felt even more depressed and alone. We went in her car and I just started sobbing and hyperventilating, it was like a mini panic attack. Last time this happened, it was full blown. 

I do have anxiety issues, but panic attacks haven't been too common for me (until recently) and the tricky part was, I couldn't pinpoint exactly why I was so damn sad. But each time, I had this morose feeling all day. I can't get myself to eat anything and I just have this feeling of existential sadness and doom. Then it just builds up to a panic attack where I'm crying my eyes out and barely able to breathe. I'm on antidepressants right now (Wellbutrin) but I think I want to try an anti-anxiety med or SSRI. My psychologist is reluctant to medicate me and it's frustrating because I think that's what I really need. I've had these problems since I was a little kid. I'm just trying to live my life and I want them to go away.

Do any of you guys deal with this too? I haven't really explored my anxiety issues outside of my depression and I think it's a whole other problem I have to figure out. There are some things floating around that are kind of stressing me out and making me anxious (internships, roommate troubles, etc.) but I didn't feel like those things were really what was getting to me. 

Honestly, it seems like my recent panic attacks have had to do with my dad. My parents are older, and while they're both healthy and happy and loving and smart, I love them so much that I worry about what my life will be like without them. My dad just got hearing aids and it made me realize that he's getting older. Sometimes when I think about him or see him, I just want to cry, because I'm often away at school and I don't get to see him as much and I feel guilty about it. Ugh. I don't know how to handle this. I'm actually crying right now thinking about it."
253onj,3,2014-05-08,Sex with someone who is 19 years older than me... is this okay?,zaq1xsw2cde3vfr4bgt5,sex,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/253onj/sex_with_someone_who_is_19_years_older_than_me_is/,"I apologize in advance for the lengthy story.. But I would appreciate any advice on the matter because I feel like I don't have anyone to talk to about this. And I do my best thinking when I'm talking with someone about my thoughts. 

A few years ago, I contacted my old high school teacher saying that I needed an internship. He put me in touch with one of his old friends who is a CEO of 2 different companies plus invests in a lot of things in SF. Me and 3 of my friends ended up getting hired at the real estate company for three months. The office was a small one. In the office there was only 3 full time staff, plus the four interns. (He had more employees working for him, but they weren't in the office) During those three months, we'd always go out to eat, we are close with each other and talked all the time. He'd include the other interns but they always joked that we had something more or that I was spoiled by him. At the time he was married and he has three kids. We always flirted, but I have such a flirty personality. I'd flirt with 80 year olds without thinking about it. Side note. His wife also accused him of having an affair with me during my internship (which is hilarious because I never crossed the line with him but she ended up cheating...)

After my internship, we still talked and we still went out to eat every time I came into town to visit. We'd always make the effort to try to see each other if we were in the same cities. About a year ago, his life fell apart when he found out his wife had been cheating on him (emotionally). I was one of the first few people to know, he filed for divorce and has been recovering ever since. And somehow we started to talk about our chemistry one day, we both felt like we could tell each other everything  and then he said that he always thought we had chemistry but never could do anything since he was married and loved his wife. 

Fast forward to last weekend, we wanted a night to smoke and drink with each other because it was way over due. I flew into SF as a layover and he booked a hotel room for us. He booked one with two beds, and always assured me that if I didn't feel comfortable we didn't have to sleep together in the same bed. We got into the hotel room really late, and stayed up all night just smoking weed and having a good time catching up. One thing led to another, and we started kissing. We kept it at that, and fell asleep together. The next day, we both worked all day (him in an office, and I work from home so I stayed in the hotel room.) Then for dinner, he took me out to a fancy restaurant, we kissed all night and strolled the streets of SF without a care for in the world. I gave him a blow job on the balcony overlooking SF, we kissed, we touched each other but we didn't have sex because auntie flo was in town. After the night was over, we promised we'd see each other again and we're making plans to see each other in the future. We also promised each other that we would never tell anyone about that weekend/future events because A- we think that we'd get black listed if anyone ever found out. We're a part of a small community that's very judgmental. B- He's a CEO, it doesn't exactly look great when he's hanging around a 23 year old. 

We have major chemistry, he's hot, he's smart and obviously successful. I'm only 23, and he's 42. There's a 19 year age difference. Even though we didn't have sex, I can tell he's going to be 100x better than any of my previous partners because of his experience and our chemistry. But before I actually cross that line and have sex with him, is this really the right thing to do? Is it really okay to be fucking someone who is 19 years older than you and to keep that a secret? I don't go running around telling people my list of sexual partners but am I shooting myself in the foot by screwing up our relationship by having sex with him? I understand I'm probably the rebound girl (he has fucked two other girls since the divorce) and this won't be anything serious. But a little part of me can't help but think ""what if"" we could be together, how sexy we'd be together. I should probably stop that considering the fact we can never be together. Should I just enjoy the ride and see how far it goes or should I cut it off now? Also, another thing about two years ago my ex boyfriend and I broke up. We still fucked for another year (basically together without the label). Since then, I've moved to two different cities, I tried dating other people and realized that I'm still not ready to give up my independence. I'm at a place in my life where I want to be successful in my life, be a better person, and be independent. I feel like if I have sex with this guy occasionally, I'll get the best of both worlds. Sex &amp; my independence. Should I just go with the flow and enjoy the good life. I'm also known to over think things quite often. Am I over thinking things here reddit? 

Sorry for the rambling. I'd appreciate your thoughts on this. "
253s3k,1,2014-05-09,Question regarding drug tests...,[deleted],trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/253s3k/question_regarding_drug_tests/,"Hello,

So I am a college student. For about a year, up until March 10, 2014, I would probably smoke daily. I stopped at that point because I was searching for internships. Fast forward to April 1, I smoked maybe a gram within about two days; I then stopped. April 25, I took maybe 4 hits off a dro-joint.

Anyways... I got an internship. I was hired around March 26 (by phone after we interviewed in person, etc)... My boss told me my first day, which will be May 14. He never mentioned anything about a drug test-- he just told me 'We'll see you May 14th!""... 

My question is this: Would I already have known about any upcoming drug tests for this internship? It is a relatively smaller firm, and as far as I know, I will be the only intern for this branch. To my knowledge, when drug tests are administered, do they not tell you of them prior to telling you your start date?

I am a little paranoid that I may be tested on my first day. If so, what are my odds of passing this test? I have a relatively high metabolic rate and low fat content.

Please help a paranoid ent out.

For more informatin, this is an engineering internship."
253tld,3,2014-05-09,"Feeling bullied at work. What to do, how to cope?",[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/253tld/feeling_bullied_at_work_what_to_do_how_to_cope/,"So, a little background: There are quite a number of times where I have felt singled out by a particular person at my workplace. I work as a technician in a pharmacy (one of the grocery chains) in the northeast. This person bullying me is a staff pharmacist, but technically not my boss. She is my 'boss' when my manager is not present, which is most of the time. Two pharmacists rarely ever work together at my store. We do less than ~300 Rx's most days. 

Isolated incidents: 

1) I received an Rx from a customer that had a questionable notation for the directions. I had never seen it written that way before and wanted to clarify before sending the customer away. I get an eye-roll, a sigh, and a Jeez Louise! from the pharmacist in front of the customer waiting and another technician. As I walk away, I can feel eyes staring at me and whispers about what just occurred. Apparently the question I had was unwarranted and stupid. So embarrassing. 

2) Anytime I ask the pharmacist a question, it seems like she intentionally conjures up a confused look on her face and says, ""wait, what???"" Like she had no idea what I just asked her. If it happened on occasion, I might think nothing of it. But honestly, every, single, time. It seems like she is pretending to have no clue to make it appear to other people around us that I ask vague questions, questions that don't make sense, etc. 

3) I have been told directly from this pharmacist that 'I do stupid shit.' 

4) She entices other coworkers to gang up on me. In these situations, there is usually some laughing and joking going on. I feel like I have no choice but to join in and laugh at myself. If I don't, they may think I am taking something personally, and I want to seem unaffected by this bull shit.

4) She forced me to wait on customers out of turn when the tech who was assigned to be running the register was available. She and the tech went to the back of the store and began talking, after she told me to 'please wait on that guy so he stops staring at me.' 

5) Did not fully explain her reasoning behind her decision to refuse a fill for a customer I was waiting on. I had no better explanation for the customer than 'she said no and I am doing what she told me to' sort of answer. She pulls me aside in the middle of my shift and accuses me of throwing her under the bus. I have a fully detailed post that I put up several months ago about this situation. To this day, I am still confused about why she wouldn't do it. I genuinely feel like she set me up to fail.

6) I offended a customer by accident. The whole situation was really fucked up. I feel terrible for it, but the customer clearly had some issues that needed addressed. This pharmacist was so pissed at how I handled the situation that she yelled at me to move!! out of her way, yelled asking 'why would you say that?!?!' In front of other customers, the upset woman, and other coworkers. Very traumatic and unnecessary. 

7) I was waiting on a customer while I was still a fairly new employee. The customer was asking me a question that I simple didn't know the answer to. Before I could even ask for help, she came up behind me, grabbed me on both shoulders (like upper arms) and MOVED me aside, so she was standing directly face to face with the customer. I almost tripped. Like, get your hands off me bitch!

There are many other situations that have occurred. I am honestly afraid to go to work sometimes. I dread pulling in and seeing her car in the parking lot instead of my boss's. Every time I work with her, I feel stressed, over worked, unappreciated, and just stupid when I come home.

Question: How to deal with this situation without jeopardizing everything I've worked for? I am starting pharmacy school in the fall and would like an internship with this company. This pharmacist may end up acting as my preceptor. I don't want to go to HR. That seems really stupid at this point. I can't quit. I could transfer… but would that look bad? Other than finding a way out of this store, how to cope? Help!"
253usx,1,2014-05-09,Need help making a post-grad job decision!,Zaahman,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/253usx/need_help_making_a_postgrad_job_decision/,"I am currently deciding between two job offers and I am looking for perspective. The first job is exactly what I want to do with my career, at a medium sized health system, working with some fantastic people. The problem is it is in my hometown, at the same place I did my internship for the past three summers. I desperately do not want to move back in with parents and I will feel embarrassed and defeated by doing so. That being said, its obvious that the position is probably best for my career. 

The second job is in the area I went to school, working at a small health system doing some of the work I want to do, but a lot of stuff that doesn't necessarily interest me currently. The positives are the salary is most likely higher(haven't received that info yet), I would be able to stay around 10s of thousands of young people and would not have to live with my parents. 

The question is, do I sacrifice my career goals for independent development or do I suck it up, work the better job for a year or two and then reevaluate?"
253v2b,2,2014-05-09,I just need to say some things.,[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/253v2b/i_just_need_to_say_some_things/,"I'm a rising senior in college. I have always done fine in school, and I love what I do. Everything in my life is beginning to happen so quickly, and I am finally beginning to realize it. I have high expectations for myself, and I plan to achieve my goals. I have been raised to expect the best of myself, make others around me better, and above all else, give 100% to complete what I am doing at the time.

First off, I have a possible internship lined up in my field that was referred to by by my father, and I could not be more excited. This is a huge opportunity for me, and this will be the first time I'll be experiencing the environment that I could possibly be working in for a good chunk of my life. Working inside such an environment both fills me with hope and nervousness. I have a strong feeling in the pit of my stomach that this will turn out to be the beginning of the next chapter of my life, and I embrace it. Despite all the hope, I can't help but to shake the idea of myself disliking it and how I may be wasting my time with what I've been doing with the past three years of education and all the money I've spent in the process. I suppose it may just be the pressure of everything, and I sincerely hope so. I have high hopes for myself, and I have every intention of fulfilling my dreams. 

As well, I am becoming more confident in myself, I'm starting to get into shape, but I still have a good amount to go before I'll be completely happy with myself. When it comes to my body, I have always taken care of myself, but within the last year or so, I have let myself go more than I would like to admit. I have taken the first steps of a healthy lifestyle for the first time in a while, and it has been hard more than anything, but I won't give up. I take my health very seriously, and I believe that life is too short to be anything less than what I could have been.

On the romance front, I have had almost no luck with women. Coming out of high school, I was, ""A late bloomer"", and that has always been a rough spot on my confidence. I understand that from a biological standpoint that I had absolutely no say in what my body does. I was 17 when I started puberty, and wasn't done until just about last year; of course the confidence has been gained back and being so late has virtually no damper on my confidence now, but it has limited the amount of time that I've had to be romantic with a woman. That being said, when I finally did get a real girlfriend for the first time, she cheated on me. I understand these things happen, but between all of the other issues I'd had in the past, I couldn't help but to wonder if it was me that was the problem. I took a long break from even showing any interest in women, because I had to honestly look at myself and improve myself before I would be comfortable giving myself to a woman again. I have had a couple dates since then, but nothing serious, I do not plan on settling for anything less than I personally think I deserve. I am a firm believer in how a relationship is based on making one another better, not holding each other back.

That's all I have for now. May update. Thanks for reading!

253vc5,3,2014-05-09,Always living in the past?,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/253vc5/always_living_in_the_past/,"So I have SERIOUS issues with moving on from the past. I know it's common for people to always think about their past and things they regret, but I take it to a whole new level. I will think about things that happened 5 years ago and be depressed about it. Every morning when I wake up, I think about an event that occured a year ago, and it depresses me like no other. Literally things from the past bother me so much that it interferes with my studies. Sometimes I become so enraged by things that happened ages ago to the extent where I can't control my anger.. when no one else even remembers, or if they do, they don't care. 

All my good friends from high school are now more than half way through their degrees, getting internships, and basically building a life for themselves. And then there's me, living in the past.. It's so embarrassing and I know that people would look down on me if they knew how bad it is for me, yet I can't change it! My brain is just completely obsessive Idk... Also, I often get super depressed when I think back to certain things.. to the extent where I get suicidal. Wtf is wrong with me???? I know I'm supposed to let go but HOW?

Also, does anyone else ever do this: Talk to someone about someone else as if you're friends with them when you are not? For instance, I was talking to someone at my college who went to the same high school as me. We never knew each other back then.. Anyway we began trying to see if we had mutual friends and he mentioned people and I'd say stuff as if they're my friend when in reality I only talked to them a couple of times before, like 3 years ago or something. I realized I do this quite frequently and thought about how embarrassing it would be if he talks to them and brings me up, assuming we're friends :/ "
253vue,2,2014-05-09,"What to do, what to do..",LongandLanky,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/253vue/what_to_do_what_to_do/,"Background: 

So I'm currently a junior in college pursuing a Finance Degree. I am way ahead of track and have a pretty good GPA at 3.67, even though it will go down some after this semesters grades come in. I am pretty far ahead in school and after this semester I will only have 12 hours left to complete my finance degree. Since the beginning of this school year I have been interning for a large telecommunication corporation in the Business Finance department. I get paid pretty decently for a 21 year old and am working almost 40 hours for a week and taking 12 hours of classes at night. I have been doing pretty well at my internship, and my boss has asked me a couple times when I graduate and told me to keep up the good work, pretty much giving off the vibe that I have a full time position waiting after I graduate. 

Issues: 

First off, even though I love the atmosphere at the corporation I work for, and I really enjoy the people I work with, the work itself bores me to death. I sit on excel/sap/access all day creating or modifying different financial reports. Most of the time I'm just clicking buttons that I've learned to click in the past. I get that I'm an intern and I have to do the grunt work, but I see full time workers doing the same type of work that I am doing and I just know I couldn't do this for the rest of my life. 

I have told my boss that I am planning on graduating in December and he currently thinks thats when I will be able to go Full Time. Technically I could graduate at the end of the summer if I wanted to, but I don't know if I want to graduate until I figure out what I want to do next!

Recently I have taken an interest in studying abroad next fall and being a kid one more time before I graduate. Technically my planned graduation isn't until May of next year, so this plan would entail interning till the end of summer, then study abroad in the fall, then comeback and try and intern at the same corporation I was working for in the spring semester as well as apply for other jobs. 

If the study abroad idea doesn't work out (currently in the middle of filling out a bunch of applications, already been talking with the school) I have considered getting a minor in Geosciences from the school I go to. I don't know how much this will help me in the future, I just feel like this gives me a better chance of getting a job in oil finance or possibly a job in land management or some other field. If I got my geosciences minor I would graduate next May. If I did this I could continue on with my current internship while looking for other jobs. 

I've also been thinking that I am incredibly lucky that I was able to get through the different interviews and able to find a team in the Finance Department that likes and respects me and that I'm taking this all for granted. My last idea is to take all my last classes this summer and then go full time starting this coming September. From a financial perspective this would be best for me as I wouldn't lose a lot of money from studying abroad and would have a full time job a year sooner than I normally would. 

The last thing I have to say is that I don't really like Finance at all. I originally picked this as my major because I like to make money, but soon learned a Finance Degree was more about accounting for money than actually being out there making it. Part of the reason I might especially dislike finance is because at my current internship half the things I do involve products you can't see or hold, I might enjoy it more if it was a product or service I was actually interested in. At the same time, I am a pretty extroverted person who enjoys working on projects and using my creative mind. I like to interact with others and enjoy finding solutions to different types of complex problems. I now see myself getting a finance degree because it shows I am pretty decent with numbers and have a business background, but don't want to sit behind my computer making different pivot tables my whole life..  This is also why I'm considering the Geosciences minor, I was hoping this minor would help me having more opportunities when it came to different types of jobs I'm qualified for. 

What should I do!?! 

tl;dr 

Should I graduate early and go full time at a job that doesn't really interest me, or should I go study abroad for a semester and come back in the spring and finish school up and search for a new job, or should I not study abroad, stay in school and graduate on time, and get a minor in Geosciences.

253w82,15,2014-05-09,College Struggles,[deleted],aspergers,https://www.reddit.com/r/aspergers/comments/253w82/college_struggles/,"I hate going to classes with more than 20 or so people in them. I hate Power Points. I hate how obnoxiously slow lectures feel, I feel as though if the professor simply printed out their entire lecture on a piece of paper I could absorb it in 20 minutes as opposed to 2 hours. It feels pointless to sit in a room with 200 other people, and as a result, often end up ditching.

I have an above-average GPA. My problem is that I lack all motivation to perform at an A-level. My classes aren't interesting or stimulating, my major is one that I am good at (Computer Science), and have gotten good internships in, but I find that I learn much better hands-on.

My parents want me to do a Master's. I think this is highly unnecessary for CS. The only way that I'm going to do more school is if it's an online Master's that I can work while I do.

Does anyone else have troubles in college? How do you/did you deal with them? How do I do better?"

I have already submitted most applications, however I am experiencing some complications. I started at a community college earlier than most of my peers so as a result I accumulated many more units. By the time I transferred to a 4-year school, I was considered a ""junior"" and after the completion of this semester I will be a ""senior"". However, as far as the computer science program goes, I am still at ""freshman"" level (according to the official CS roadmap) having just completed a Data Structures and Algorithms in Java course. 

I am really hoping that this doesn't put me at a serious disadvantage when applying for internships. Do you think recruiters will expect me to have way more experience than I already do because of my ""senior"" status? Also on a more practical note, do you think I would have the level of knowledge at this point to be successful in an internship or should I be waiting to intern after I complete higher-level coursework?"

Nevertheless I just need to vent and/or ramble. Apologies for disorganization.

---

preemptive tl;dr - my life was previously a train wreck, I got through to stability on the other side with a lot of help, I desire a companion to share life with, I'm failing to find one for various reasons, I'm frustrated.

---

I grew up a bit of a loner, the only friends I really had were those made through my far more socially adept younger brother. Once I went off to college on my own, I was quickly miserable and struggled to fend for myself. I lost touch with anyone in my graduating high school class who I had any proximity to, later fell into academic suspension, and eventually was diagnosed with depression after basically hitting a rock bottom and experience suicidal ideation. I'm lucky in that I was able to recognize that I needed help and was able to reach out for it, not everyone is gets that sadly. Even with medication and counseling, school was still a mountain I struggled to climb. Part of that is my fault, at times I thought I was ""better"" and would stop taking my meds, then steadily slide back to right where I was before I started treatment without being able to fight it. I learned the hard way over the course of about three years of this cycle that I have a very real and chronic mental health condition - depression and social anxiety - which I can't afford to not stay on top of.

The one saving grace in my college career was a drive I've had since high school to make video games. In a rare moment of social bravery I was able to get involved with a video game club, which led to me getting a summer internship, which led to me getting a full-time job which I hold to this day, despite attempting to go back to school multiple times and the company all but folding at one point when money ran out following poor treatment from a publisher. For some reason I had blind faith that everything would turn out okay insofar as this company goes - I got in on the ground floor via a summer internship helping to make their first big game with three other guys - and somehow it's worked out. There's been some luck there too, as I would have never met any of the guys I work with now had I just gone through four years of college in-and-out like everyone else does.

I think I'm reasonably mentally stable now, given that I can hold a job and perform reasonably well at it. I am relatively independent at this point, I pay for my own apartment in the city, I just bought a new car, I can buy things I want on a whim (within reason), and I'll be able to live comfortably and continue saving money while paying for all those things. But I'm still alone. I'm alone in that no one in my office really hangs out with anyone after hours. I'm alone in that I still haven't found any sort of extracurriculars outside of work to engage in with other people. I'm alone in that despite four years of membership at several online dating web sites I've met exactly two girls for one-off dates, neither of which amounted to anything.

Which I guess brings me to my greatest frustration at the moment - of my entire life really - I want to be more social. I want to date people. I want to find a girl who's attractive, compatible with me / brings out a better side of my personality, and is looking for someone. I want to have the confidence to find that person. I want a damn chance. Hell, I just want a hug. That shouldn't be too much for a 27-year-old American male who gets to make a living doing something he's passionate about, who has a few outside hobbies and things he has the freedom and opportunity to partake in (video games obviously, but also guitar, an obsession with the NFL, the WWE, occasionally singing, and owning a cat), and who isn't a disrespectful asshole (referring to basically the brazenly open solicitations by some guys online basically treating women as objects) to ask.

I readily accept that I'm at least part of the problem here in that I've got to find a way to get myself out in front of other people and be more comfortable in my own skin. I've never done well in a dive bar, for example, and approaching a girl on a whim is still something I fail miserably at; I become a nervous wreck and just want to get out. I've always done better being introduced to a person through someone, or with a step of abstraction in between for the first bit to establish some sort of rapport (i.e. the online thing). But with respect to the online dating thing which again I've actually been able to handle, it's incredibly frustrating when I try to send out a first message to try and start a legitimate conversation with a girl based on something she's written about herself and just get absolutely nothing back, which has happened countless dozens of times at this point. It's repeated blows to my self-esteem and any attempt at my establishing validity to my identity as a male human being. I'm not exactly Bradley Cooper or whoever the in guy is these days, but I'd like to think I'm not repulsive.

I just don't know what to do, where to start, or anything to that end at this point. I'm frustrated and honestly a bit exhausted with my failures at the whole online dating thing. I continue to be absolutely terrible trying to initiate social contact on my own absent a layer of abstraction behind a keyboard. I don't want to go to a dive bar, drink my face off, make a drunken ass of myself, and throw myself at someone I'm not honestly attracted to at last call. I don't want to go to a strip club and pay money to have my male identity validated in some fake form. I don't want to otherwise throw money at someone to feign attraction to me. I just want to find someone attractive, smart, level-headed, and single who is attracted to me too and anything and everything that comes with that. I'd like to not be the only single person in my office any longer. Is that too much to ask?

So yeah, there's my whining. Constructive feedback and/or suggestions are welcome. Happy Friday!"

I graduated college a year ago with a degree in Marketing. I hate Marketing. I think it's important to mention that. The only reason I didn't quit was because it would cost me too much to do another course. I would have had to fund it myself, and there was no way I would have been about to pay the €7000 with my minimum wage job. 

Anyway, for the last year I've been working my part time job and in the meantime moved out of my parents house and started renting with a friend from work. 

I've been looking for a job for the last year with no luck. I've had interviews for paid jobs but nothing came out of them. 

I realised that the only was I can progress my career is to do an internship to get experience. So I got an internship with a good company doing their digital marketing. It's an unpaid 6 month internship (no expenses paid). I'll be keeping up my part time job in the meantime. I'll be working about 45 hours a week altogether. 

I just started the internship this week and I already hate it. I'm pretty much doing the social media side of things which I already know how to do. It doesn't look like I'll be learning anything new. I was hoping I'd be doing some market research, which is the thing I wouldn't mind doing in marketing. 

The people in the office aren't nice at all. As soon as I walked in the door one of the other interns said to me ""Oh another intern? Your gonna hate it here"". She been questioning me as to what I've been doing for a year, and why haven't I got a job out of my degree already. As if it's easy. And why am I doing an unpaid internship, as if it's a stupid idea. It's getting to me. 

I really want to quit already, which is not a good sign. I don't want to waste my time in there. And I don't want a career on digital marketing in the long run. Should I quit?"

254nb7,1,2014-05-09,Software Engineering intern here. Was handed a set of wireframes for a web-UI... And I have no clue what to do with them,BlackoutBen,web_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/254nb7/software_engineering_intern_here_was_handed_a_set/,"As the title suggests, I am a software engineering student on an internship where I have been tasked with creating a software control solution for one of our product lines. My project manager preferred a web-app design as opposed to a standalone application, so I've sort of been rolling with that. While I have a fairly decent programming background from classwork and such, I know very little about web design.

The result was a web-app that had all the right functionality working (the actual ""control"" stuff was done with python scripts on an Apache server that the webapp would send requests to via AJAX), but which looked like crap. It was usable, and it presented visual feedback based on the responses from the scripts, but my project manager put it best when he said ""It's pretty clear this is an engineering-designed interface.""

So he got one of our marketing people to draft up some wireframes in Axure and send them to me. They look awesome! BUT I have no idea how to implement them, or essentially how to go from wireframes to a working UI. I tried basically yanking certain elements and their corresponding styles from the wireframes and popping them into a new html document, but it took me two days to get even the ""shell"" around the page using this method.

In a 5-minute-meeting with my PM and another marketing guy with a background in web design, he implied I was going about it totally wrong, and offered to build the interface for me, saying he could do it very easily. While that takes a whole lot of pressure off of me with regard to the project and its deadline, I won't be learning much about the process of building a UI this way, which is something I was very interested in. Unfortunately the guy who offered to build it is also ridiculously busy, so there's really no good time that I could sit down with him and talk about how I should have approached it, what the proper way would be, etc.

So I guess my question is this: What is the ""proper"" or most efficient way of building a user interface from a prototype? Was I going about it right, but just taking a long time due to my inexperience working with this sort of thing, or was I just completely off the mark in my approach?"
254rwy,6,2014-05-09,Stack ranking and performance reviews at large companies,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/254rwy/stack_ranking_and_performance_reviews_at_large/,"Throwaway account, for obvious reasons.  This isn't something that I've noticed is talked about often on /r/cscareerquestions, but it's something that's really important for prospective employees, especially those that want to join the Big 4 companies, to know about ahead of time.

For people that are unfamiliar with stack ranking, it's effectively grading your employees on a curve every single performance review period.  There are often different buckets you can be put in, such as ""top"", ""good"", ""average"", ""below average"", and ""poor"", with a different percentage of employees supposed to be in each bucket.  Often, promotions are only given to those only in the top few buckets, and those in the lower buckets are often targets for layoffs.

A lot of larger tech companies (Amazon, Facebook, Paypal, Yahoo) - as [described in this article and others](http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2013/11/11/StackRankingWhyAreAmazonFacebookAndYahooCopyingMicrosoftsPerformanceReviewSystem.aspx) implement some form of stack ranking.  Microsoft supposedly got rid of it recently, after years of people complaining about it, but many other large tech companies have always had it silently.  Yes, the companies' official stance is that ""they don't have formal buckets"", but that's almost always bullshit, as anyone who's a front-line manager knows.  There are always ""recommended distributions"", and you'll need a damn good reason to not follow the recommended distributions.

It leads to a culture of competition, and talented engineers not wanting to work with other talented engineers, since they simply can't compete with each other when trying to get promoted. Work-life balance gets severely fucked up, and that's the main reason you see companies wanting to hire new grads - you pay them cheaper, and they have less commitments to family and their personal life.  It's also one of the main reasons you see less actual engineers as people get older - if you need to work 70-80 hour weeks to keep your job, that's just nearly impossible for most people with a family.

My personal experience - I've been an engineer at one of these larger companies, and I've never been in one of the lower buckets, partly due to my skill sets, but mostly knowing how to show my work off to management. I've been on multiple teams, and on each team, I've seen extremely talented engineers just either quit or get laid off because of not knowing how to play politics within these companies. The smarter ones just go to teams with much worse engineers, but the ones who are the best know to never (officially) work together.

Remember, this happens at the companies that everyone wants internships or jobs in. Definitely check Glassdoor before knowing what you're getting into.

To keep it in the spirit of /r/cscareerquestions, I'd definitely like to hear about other people's experiences with stack ranking and performance reviews. Honestly, in my opinion, it's a shitty system, and I strongly believe that tech companies need something like the Writers Guild of America to help expose these issues, rather than just complaining on Glassdoor.

**EDIT**: Clarified my statement on a guild for software engineers."

NOTE: **I will NOT be taking off Eagle Scout**  It has gotten me both the internships I did (my first was unrelated to my current field) and I feel that it shows dedication and character.

That being said, any and all pointers and critiquing are greatly appreciated!  "

Please help been looking for months!,skafool,tampa,https://www.reddit.com/r/tampa/comments/2554v1/places_to_rent_a_2b2ba_for_under_900_please_help/,"My friend and I currently live in Spring Hill, FL which is about an hour away from Tampa. 
We both live with 2 other roommates, our lease is ending soon and we dont want the 4 roommate deal anymore. 
We really need to live in Tampa, at most 20 minutes away from USF since we are tired of making the hour long trek nearly every weekday for class. 
Our budget was around $750/800. If the rent is closer to $900 we would want at least some of the utilities included. 

We have been searching for months and we either find cheap apartments in really ghetto places like E. Fowler where a weave tumbleweeded into the apartment the manager was showing us and doors had graffitti all over them along with half naked toddlers running off into different buildings with no parent any where in sight. 

OR 

the apartments were nice but way too expensive and didnt include any utilities what so ever.

We started looking for houses to rent but they all want us to take over mortgage payments. 

Ive been looking for months, the end of our lease is in a couple months and we havent found anything.. I am getting more and more disheartened and stressed out betweenmy internship, two jobs, summer school and still not finding a place. 

Can someone please please please help us? Let us know if there are other options im just not seeing or maybe theres apartments or condos or whatever that I dont know about?! I could really use some help

**TL;DR : Roommate and I need an apartment/house/condo/th/whatever under $900mo located at most 20 minutes away from USF. Our lease is ending in July. PLEASE HELP!**

I just fucking love mathematics and I think this shit is fun.**

I'm a relatively well-geared Barb (I can solo T6 relatively easily). I am looking for one more piece of Earth gear so I can have the hoppy 'I Win' Barb Build.

Upon seeing the post with the Legendary drop chance I decided to do some calculations just to see how RNG influences my chances of getting my Pull of The Earth gloves I want so badly. Here goes:

**For those that don't give a shit about the mathematics just skip to the TL;DR**

Base assumptions:

1) There is a 85% chance any drop will be Smart Loot and a 15% chance it won't be. This is why I will sometimes get a WD drop on my Barb or a weapon with MS Dex roll. This means that this 15% will be absolutely useless to me so it doesn't even factor into my calculations.

2) I am looking for a Trifecta roll for the Pull of the Earth. While I'm dreaming big I also want to titfuck Kate Upton. But we won't even go into those odds because my life is sad enough as it is. (I'm writing a fucking odds analysis for a bullshit digital item from a video game that I want so badly to feel good about myself...that's sad as shit)

3) This calculation only takes into account what the legendary will be. It does not take into account the chance the legendary will drop. (If you want to take into account all of it figure out what the drop rate is from the torment you play on the most and multiply that by the final number)

**Here we go:**

For the Barbarian there are 27 classes of items out of the 42 total classes of items that are usable. By this I mean 27 items are of classes like mighty weapons, belts, necklaces, etc. The other 15 are things like crossbows, mojos, orbs, etc. shit that is completely useless to me.

**1)** our first calculation is the chance that when the legendary item that will drop will be in the class of Gloves. The chances there I will get a pair of Gloves that will roll Smart Loot (i.e. Main stat is STR) are:

*(1/27) x .85 = 0.03148 or 3.148%*

**2)** our next calculation is the percentage chance that from the gloves that dropped, they will be the Pull of the Earth. From the data, there is a 8.06% chance that Barbs will drop a Pull of the Earth when Gloves drop. This now brings our total chances of finding at PotE to:

*0.03148 x 0.0806 = 0.002537 or 0.2537%*

**3)** as I said before ~~tits~~ trifecta or GTFO. The PotE gloves are guaranteed 8-10% Critical Hit Chance and as I said before these are smart loot so for Barbs they will roll 626-750 STR. Then there are 4 Random Magic Properties; 2 primary, 2 secondary. Since I don't care about the secondary properties, I will be focusing on the 2 primary properties: Critical Hit Damage and Increased Attack Speed. These will randomly roll from a pool of 9 remaining Random Primary Properties:

* IAS
* Armor
* Regen
* Area Damage
* LoH
* CDR
* Resource Cost Reduction
* Vitality
* Critical Hit Damage

These are Dependent events since the second magic property depends on the first magic property. Imagine the bowl of marbles analogy: **There are seven huge piles of shit and two green marbles. What are the chances you draw a green marble on your first try, then without putting it back, draw a green marble on your second try?**

This calculation is: P(IAS and CHD) = P(IAS or CHD) x P(CHD | IAS or IAS | CHD) = 2/9 * 1/8 = 0.02778 or 2.778%

Keep in mind that this is just the chance FOR THE GLOVES.

If we take into account the chance for the gloves to drop in the first place, our new number is:

*0.02778 x 0.002537 = 0.0000705 or 0.00705%*

***This means that the chances that any given Legendary you find will be a Pull of The Earth set Gloves with STR and a trifecta of CC, CHD, and IAS are 0.00705% or a 1 in 14,184 chance***

just for fun, here are some things you have a better chance at than finding a Pull of The Earth with a Trifecta:

1. ~~Getting injured from fireworks: 1 in 19,556~~
1. ~~Becoming a Pro Athlete: 1 in 22,000~~
1. Person in the military ~~winning~~ being awarded the Medal of Honor: 1 in 11,000
1. Winning an Academy Award: 1 in 11,500
1. Bowling a 300 game: 1 in 11,500
1. ~~Chances **OF BEING FUCKING MURDERED: 1 in 18,000**~~
1. ~~Chances of being **FUCKING MURDERED WITH A GUN: 1 in 25,000**~~
1. ~~AIDS: 1 in 18,000~~
1. ~~Flipping a coin and getting heads approximately damn near 14 times in a row~~.



**TL;DR As a Barbarian, you have a ~~57.6%~~23.4% better chance of winning an academy award~~being murdered in real life~~ than you do of finding the Pull of The Earth Gloves with a Trifecta in a digital game....HAPPY FRIDAY!!!**

Lastly, there have been questions asking me of what gear I'm running so here are some links to my current build of my WW/Frenzy Lightning build.

[**edit 3**]: Changed wording from feedback from /u/guilty_pleasure: ""You don't **win** the Medal of Honor, you jackass."" I edited this mainly because he had a very good point and he asked in such a nice, polite way that wasn't douchebagdickish at all.

[**edit 2**]: from /u/ksion: But the pedant in me requires me to point out that you have an error in (3). You are calculating the odds of specifically IAS followed by CHD -- that is, you implicitly assume it matters which is rolled first. In reality, you are as fine with IAS and CHD as you are with CHD and IAS, but you're only accounting for the former.
So you need to multiply the odds by two, which yields you the final result of 0.00704%, or 1 in 14,188. Better odds than being murdered, fortunately, but you might still want to prepare the speech addressing the Academy

**[edit 1]**: there are a lot of comments regarding enchanting (and titfucking Kaley Cuoco) with the thought that you only need one of the two stats to roll. So here are some more odds.

take the base chance for PotE Gloves to drop and then since you only need one of the two IAS/CHD to roll then your are now looking at 0.002537 x 2/9 = 0.0005638 or **0.0564% which is a 1 in 1773.75 chance**.

Nothing. No gifts, no Skype calls. Nothing. 

After this I did something I probably shouldn't have, and that was look up her Facebook page. It's just none of my business what she does. But a post from a few months ago says she's coming back for a visit this month (nothing about LO, just about being in state again), and as far as I know she hasn't contacted my SO about this or possibly seeing LO. I don't want her to see LO and say ""Oh I'm your mommy but I have to leave again in a few days! Nice seeing you! Okay, bye."" 

I just don't want her to hurt LO again. Should I tell SO about this? Is it my place to do so? He leaves at the end of the month, so he will still be here if she actually does end up visiting.

I've recently been taken on as an intern for a newly emerging tea company tasked with driving sales for the product. As 1 of 6 interns, there is heavy competition as to who can create the best account in order to win the job at the end of the internship. Now, here's where the problem begins... My strategy to win the customers (and ultimately land the position) has been to create well designed, original content aimed at brightening up followers Instagram feeds and generate love for the brand. This strategy has been going well so far gaining me a strong follower base, however other interns have had far more success using a much cheaper tactic; reposting pictures that are already popular on Instagram and posting supposedly funny memes that are vaguely relatable to the product. The message I've been getting from my boss is that the internship will be won purely by the person who can gain the greatest number of followers on their account. However I feel that I would be cheapening myself by copying other interns approach to achieve this, whist also alienating my current followers by downgrading the professional style of my posts. What do you believe would be the best strategy for me to take from here? And exactly what strategies can I implement that would increase my follower count but without me having to changing the current ascetic of my posts? Any advice on the matter is very much appreciated.

255gnr,0,2014-05-09,Is Software Engineering Manageable Without Prior Programming Experience?,Stoic17,uwaterloo,https://www.reddit.com/r/uwaterloo/comments/255gnr/is_software_engineering_manageable_without_prior/,"Hi all,

(Semi-long post ahead) Two things to ask about: if SE is manageable for someone without prior programming experience, and if it is, should I pick SE or CS. I've been admitted to both Waterloo CS Co-op and Waterloo SE Co-op. I was more or less set on going for Waterloo CS Co-op until my SE offer came yesterday (wasn't expecting an offer since I didn't have any experience), and now I'm considering SE as an option as well. My concern is that SE requires prior programming experience while I have none (other than a summer internship doing QA for a software firm - I only played around with their apps and didn't do any coding). I plan to start learning over the summer but I don't know if a summer's worth of coding can qualify as ""prior experience.""

1. What are the first year programming courses like in SE?

2. Would someone be able to manage catching up with the class if they're going in without any prior programming experience?

3. Are there any SE students/alumni who went into SE without prior experience who can share their experiences?

4. If anyone can offer some insight to help me decide which program I should go into, that would also be wonderful.

I have done some research on the differences between CS and SE but am still very undecided.

Software Engineering:

* Smaller class that stays together
* More focus on systems design
* More group work
* More practical work
* CE and CS courses both included

Computer Science:

* Different people each semester
* More focus on specific algorithms
* More individual work
* More theoretical work
* Flexibility in choosing electives/minors

Thanks!

TL;DR Is SE doable for someone who doesn't have prior experience (but plans to start learning in the summer)? If so, SE or CS?"

I know for certain that I want to get involved in software development, there's no wavering there, but I'm not certain on how I should target things academically.

I was shooting for an Associates of Science in Computer Science but learned that that might not be the optimal way to plan my trajectory and that it's better in most cases to get generals out of the way with an AA and finish up with a BS at a well-established university.

I don't care much for generals but if it's the ideal way to handle this, then I don't really see much other choice.

Could someone tell me if this is the right thing to do? I'm pretty stressed over this. Not to mention clueless. I'd appreciate any advice.


One of the other things was: I'm worried that I'll have less time for CS outside of classes, and also that my chances of getting an internship will be decreased with less CS-focused courses for my resume."

I'm finishing junior year at a very good school, have a bunch of leadership experience, have taken quite a number of upper division CS classes. My GPA is atrocious (2.4), but whatever. I left it off the resume.

The thing is, I got through the lower division classes by working with very smart people. I wrote a little bit of code but not too much. Upper division classes were very theory heavy, so I didn't code much. There's only one personal project I listed on my resume but it's a work in progress. I haven't written any code for it, but designed the overall structure of the program and the exact specs of its functions.

Not gonna lie, I'm bad at programming. I mean, I can do simple exercises that are taught in basic CS 101 classes and FizzBuzz type of shit, but I haven't committed enough time or effort to be proficient at it. I'm just afraid I'll show up for my internship and not know how to do anything, and feel bad for being deceiving them and wasting their time. "

Early 2009 everything goes to shit as interns and contractors are laid off and people are offered early retirement. In order to fill vacation positions and to fully push this ERP IT Project, they were moving people onto the project from other teams. I was on the low end of the totem pole in my group so I got moved and started working as a System Analyst. It was either that or be out of a job. I chose the new position as my wife was three pregnant and I couldn't be out of work for an uncertain amount of time. Long story short, I hated it…awful team, incompetent boss, incompetent project management, taking orders from consultants, low morale, etc.  HR and management assured me I would be moved back to my old System Admin job (that I loved) after a year. It became apparent this was never going to happen and HR confirmed it.  I almost left, but was offered a 7% raise to assume the duties of a co-workers who was leaving. I was the only one else on the team that knew what he did. This also was around the birth of my second child, so I stayed. I worked with a lot of bitter, miserable people who weren't that much older than me (ages 32-34). In 2013, I felt miserable and displayed it enough that two co-workers mentioned it to me. I knew then that I REALLY had to leave or I would end up becoming like the co-workers that I never wanted to become.  After nine months of trying to move, I moved to the IT Security team in September 2013 processing security requests for the application being deployed in the ERP IT Project. It was  nice to be off that old awful team, but I hated the work and I was mentally gone at that point. Every little thing was getting to me. Something had to break. In December I interviewed for another large company as a System Analyst in a more interesting industry/system and  I was sold. I started in January 2014. So far, everything at the new place has been nearly the opposite (in a good way) than at the old place. A little salary increase and pretty much the same benefits.

 

Four months in and I am wondering if this is a “grass isn't always greener on the other side” moment.  I like what I do now, but feels boring already. I was only in that IT Security position for four months and I wonder if left too soon and didn't give it much of a chance. The kicker is my associates and bachelor degrees are in a related field to IT Security: Computer Forensics and Network Security. I have an interest in having a career in those fields or related and I feel if I would have stayed at my old job, I would then have IT Security experience that I could leverage later in my career. Now, it is only four months’ worth. The place I am at now has an IT Security department but I can’t move anywhere until January 2015, but there is no guarantee that department will have openings anytime soon. I eventually plan to get certifications in that field but I just don’t have the time right now.  Did I make a mistake or am I just overthinking? Should I just give up having a career in that field and carry on my current path or try a new company next year to see if I can get a Security job?

 

Sorry for the length. I just wanted to have air my thoughts out. Thank you."

I think in a lot of ways he's immature (ha, funny right?) and doesn't appreciate me.

I love massaging my hardworking man- always have, and taking care of him w/ food and love because since I dont work (a light internship and school) I thought I could help however I could. I have done it with the few SO's I've had and my BF was no exception. I do stuff specifically for him also, if I dont think to, he asks and I do.

What bothers me is he **never gives it back**. He some times may rub one shoulder for a literal second, but thats it. Nothing for me, and he doesn't even think twice. Even in bed. What starts bugging me is I feel as if he's playing mind games. My internship is in a prestigious kitchen and I do stand for eight hours some days, and I tell him im exhausted before we really start to just spend time together. He later asks for something of me, be it sex, a massage, or something physical. I tell him no and once he finally gets that Im not playing hard to get (he always assumes I am) he turns over and literally pouts. Then I feel guilty and start things up. *""You dont have to""* he says but I know in the back of my head id rather him be happy rather than pouting and wasting my entire night.

Going along with the mind games, he loves looking at my phone. I dont care because I have nothing to hide and I know he's **insecure** because his ex cheated on him, so I allow it. But he knows there are two places he cant go- my notes and my recordings. My notes are basically like my diary but in poem/song versions (cheesy Im aware) and him not respecting my wishes has led me to delete things in fear ill be embarrassed or he'll find things no one can read about,like what a certain uncle did to me in the past. The other night he teased me, going to my recordings. I had one left and only kept it because I liked the melody I came up with. I tackled him and he dropped it, it was playful. It went on to him plugging my phone in to his giant speakers and blasting my shitty singing throughout his building. I died. Im a teenage girl and he decided to do that to me. The worst part? When I was still upset after a minute, he started calling me a 'grumpy ass' which was strange considering he's never called me anything with a foul word in it before, then he decided to pout and **I** started feeling guilty. *What?* Then I ended up giving him a BJ. As a strong woman who prides herself in *keeping* my pride, I was humiliated and disgusted with myself.

Last big thing, he's embarrassed of me which I will NOT put up with. I have higher self esteem then most, including him, and it just gets under my skin. He makes fun of my body, saying I know he's 'only teasing', but am I laughing? No. He wants me to dye my hair, acting excited what I talk about it, bummed when Its later rather than sooner. He tries to get pictures of us where I look older. I used to always have curly hair now all  do is straighten it for him. If he's embarrassed of my age and my braces then why be with a younger person? I thought he knew the multiple risks he was taking.

We've had talks, and probably the only great thing about us is that we're connected mentally. If ones thinking it the other is too, usually only with serious topics though. I've told him I dont love him and skipping to afterwards he always seems hurt. ""Im sorry"" I say. ""Why? You just said you dont care about me at all."" Which was a bit mellow dramatic. That night we told each other we care for each other, and I said how I wanted someone to be in my phone as ""The babe &amp;lt;3"" as cheesy as it was, and he said the feeling was mutual. He asked if I wanted to break up each time (We've had this talk before) and I said no because that would make me sad. He said he'd rather be with me than alone, at the time I agreed but I started to realize I could do better than him on different levels, and that I wont be alone no matter what. 

The thing is, though, im starting **not to care for him.** At all. Im starting to resent him and I feel like our relationship is only about sex, which he jokes about a lot. It has to be, right? We have no romantic feelings toward each other and he always feels like a brother, a little annoying brother with constant hard-ons.

What makes me want to make up my mind about ending it are two things. First, he's moving to the city, and as a teenager with a car but without a license and the city being 40 minutes away, it doesn't seem worth it to me. I think it would feel even more like friends with benefits. The second reason is because there's a boy in school I had a crush on long before meeting my Boyfriend. Everyone and everything is telling me to dump the insecure little man and go be happy with someone closer to my age and someone who makes me happy. I find myself rather being with this boy than my BF. Now, being faithful is no issue for me, dont get me wrong, but I just think I rushed into this relationship too fast.

The cherry on top is this Bf is whom I lost my virginity to. After a week of 'dating' (making out and grinding) it wasn't a big deal to me which tells me I dont love him and there are absolutely no chances of that happening. Now whenever we have sex I feel sick. 

Along with him acting like a little kid, never able to settle down, being annoying and being aware he is, and me getting the feeling he compares me too much to his ex, I think it's ready for me to end things, but I need second opinions.

**Sad thing is...I think I've made up my mind...**so im wondering if I want you guys to change it. Is that the mind games and slow brainwashing he's had over me or is that true feeling? I want to stay friends with him because I know we have a friendship, but thats it.

For a man with no friends, Im not very fit to fill everything he needs from people.

---   
**tl;dr**: Should I break off a dead relationship to run to another in a cliche teenage way or should I give a shitty relationship longer and see if anything sparks? (Please try and skim the entire thing.)"

I'm a freshman college student and am going to have my first office job as an intern for a congressman in capitol hill. After talking to past interns, it appears wearing a suit everyday is the norm.

The most formal pieces of clothing I have are 2 Uniqlo OCBD's and [this](http://www.uniqlo.com/us/men/outerwear/blazers/dry-comfort/men-dry-comfort-jacket-092146999.html#03) blazer.

I'd love any help I can get on what type of suits to get, what brands to look out for, and how to avoid looking repetitive while being limited to ~2 suits. I also need to find a good pair of dress shoes. After lurking through some footwear albums I've really grown fond of brown wingtips and captoes, but I don't know if it would be appropriate/easy to match with the type of suits I'll be wearing. I'd also need advice for types and designs for ties! I'm about 5'9 and have a slim build (145lbs).

I'm a complete novice when it comes to this topic and don't know anyone I can personally turn to when it comes to work wear fashion, so please excuse my ignorance."
2565kn,1,2014-05-09,Student looking for some advice,[deleted],ITdept,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITdept/comments/2565kn/student_looking_for_some_advice/,"Hello,

I'm an IT student about to start my senior year at a fairly large university, and around 6 months ago I scored a very nice student worker position in the desktop support department that deals mainly with staff members and university executives (which are handled by the full-timers of course). 

I love the job, and the bosses, but that's the problem I'm having. I have somewhat of a dilemma; I'm getting very comfortable with the job to the point that I have been hinted at being hired full-time when I graduate. Apparently, all the IT major student workers in the past have been hired full time when they graduate, starting around 40k salary. To me, that sounds great especially because I would be able to go for my masters paid for by the school. But, I don't have any other experience on my resume right now, and to be honest I'm pretty sure I don't want to do desktop support for the rest of my life. Am I shooting myself in the foot by choosing not to do an internship this summer and just working where I am now full-time? Part of me says any experience is better than no experience, and I definitely have a few solid references for the future, but the other part says I should be seeking internships at larger, more well-known companies. 

I'm mainly here to ask for advice because I don't want to end up stuck later on when so many other aspects of IT interest me as well. What do you think?"
2565t5,56,2014-05-09,"Know it all coworker is driving me insane at internship, am I handling this okay?",throwawayannoyed22,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/2565t5/know_it_all_coworker_is_driving_me_insane_at/,"I am an intern at a tech company doing coding for engineers (matlab, excel stuff). I'm a ChemE so my coding knowledge is mostly in those two programs. My boss works in the quality department so stuff always gets shipped in and I have to enter it into a spreadsheet before I do coding stuff. I sit next to the HR lady who hired me and she led me to believe she was my boss the first month I worked there (she never told me the guy I was doing a project for was my boss, and she always tells me what to do if I talk to her). I didn't question it because she sometimes enters data into spreadsheets and her intern used to do data entry into quality department spreadsheets so I thought I was doing the excel coding for her. I sit near her and her intern, and we are the only people who sit in that region. There are no cubicles so I'm stuck in their enviornment so to speak.
 
Well I ask her a month later, who is my boss? I was aggravated she didn't tell me initially, but my boss is very relaxed and just didn't care that I didn't talk to him. He lets me set my own hours (15-20 hours a week whenever I want), as long as I come in everyday. And super appreciative of things I'm doing. So I learn to ignore her because she obviously has power issues.

I sit near her and her intern and just stopped talking to them other than ""hi and good nights"", because whenever I talked to her she would ask me what I'm doing, and interject her retarded advice. She has no computer skills but expects me to follow her advice on whatever I'm doing. I wrote macros in excel that were pretty complicated but she doesn't like excel so she wanted me to do redo everything in google spreadsheets which uses javascript and it sucks. This would have taken up all my time and it wouldn't have worked well anyways, and I wouldn't have time to do matlab projects so I ignored her request. My boss hates google so why would I even do that? And I have no experience coding in anything other than matlab or excel (which I'm working on, but I don't care about javascript).

She also tried to stop an engineer from giving me busy work one day because it was ""sexist"" that he was giving busy work to the female intern. While sexism exists, I don't think he was being sexist and I am afraid he was scared off from asking me for help ever again (maybe for something useful like matlab). I also don't know if she made it known I didn't want to do it, which I'm afraid she did (I had no problem doing it, it was just making some copies for an hour). She also is crazy and will never shut up about the fact that I ""need to leave by 6"", even though I have never stayed past 6 unless she was talking to me.

I ended up just not talking to her about anything work related for a few months, then this week she put something on my computer. A note to follow a ""process"" that would be ""helpful"" for me. Which included ""asking people for advice, even if they aren't coding experts"". God damn it how do I get her to leave me alone? Her advice is useless and she expects me to follow it, and will ask me every day if I've solved the issue using only her ideas. Fuck that, but I don't want her to badmouth me because I'm ""cocky and think I'm better than her"". She also is convinced her intern works ""really hard"" and has a ""ton to do"" even though he just comes in for 4 hours a day and watches youtube videos (I sit 2 feet away from him). Sigh.

Ignoring her meant I could do matlab projects for two other engineers, and an excel project for another engineer. She would have me doing everything in google spreadsheets, I am not a computer programmer and only know Matlab and Excel. And chemical engineers don't use Javascript, so it's useless for my resume. Her ideas are terrible but she tries to get her nose into everything.

Am I handling this okay? I'm only there for a month longer before I start a new co-op, but I want good references and I'm afraid she talks shit about me. She talks shit about a lot of people though so it doesn't surprise me if people roll their eyes at her."

256lft,11,2014-05-09,My mother [55F] is kicking me [22F] out because she found my cigarettes and because I'm gay. Am I making the right decision?,_clevermeals,actuallesbians,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/256lft/my_mother_55f_is_kicking_me_22f_out_because_she/,"Hey, ladies of r/actuallesbians. I've got a huge problem, and I've decided to come to you guys for help.

Here's some background of what's been going on:

I'm in my final year of university, living at home -- because my mother won't let me move out. I'm on scholarship, and I finish in December. My mother is very Catholic, and she's suspected for a long time now that I'm gay, but I've always kind of refrained from bringing it up with her, because she always says things like, ""Oh, you can tell me *anything*."", and then proceeds to get really upset and abusive about the whole thing. This has happened over failed units at university, late nights out, etc.

Anyway, about a month ago, she went through my bag (did I mention that she does things like that?) and found some weed that I had in it, so she put me on lockdown for about a month. She's been starting to ease up, but this morning, she went through my bag, found my cigarettes, and started a shouting match with me. She threatened to hit me if I kept talking, and to cancel the internship that I have lined up for next month.

I asked her not to do that, and she basically told me that I have two options -- either I stay at home and listen to everything she tells me to do, without fail, or I move out and never come back home again. I called my cousin, and asked her if my dog and I could move in with her for a couple of weeks, until I sort my shit out, finish my semester, defer the remaining semester, and move to the UK to be with my girlfriend -- who was the one who suggested this plan.

I managed to sort that out, and she agreed to let me stay for the remaining weeks, until the end of the semester. My mom isn't too fond of this cousin, and I know that by going to stay with her, I'm going to push my mom away, even further.

So, ladies of r/actuallesbians, am I making the right decision here? Do you have any words of advice or wisdom to throw my way? Do any of you know anything about moving to the UK, and about bringing pets with you?

Honestly, I don't think it's actually hit me yet, because I've been fairly calm about this whole situation."

The other pays, but very low and will look amazing on my resume.",psychie,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/256tc3/i_just_graduated_and_offered_two_separate_jobs/,"This doesn't sound like a serious situation, since I am lucky to have been offered two jobs. I need to figure out by Monday what job I had to take. Let me explain the two jobs so someone can help me figure out which one to take, because I am stuck. 

The first job pays $30,000 a year, which isn't so great for an out-of-college job. However, I will be doing basically 'bitch work.' I will have to drive an hour away from where I am about twice a week or so. They will pay for my gas though. I have to market the company. The company is a doctor's practice, though. I don't want to pursue this field at all. It's normal hours, M-F 9 to 5.

The second job is... more an internship. It's relevant to my field, but not exactly what I want to pursue. I only get paid commission. I will be making from maybe $500 to $2000 a MONTH. It will only be two months though. If they like me, I will get a job there (which I would accept since although it's not something I want to pursue, it's something that is related to my field). It's a really big and notable company. It'll be marketing the company, just like I want to pursue, but not in this exact field. I'll have an office desk and will work on a computer -- which I am totally okay with. It's normal hours as well M-F 9 to 5. 

I am leaning towards the second job since it's high risk, high reward. I'm not guaranteed the job at the end, but I'd put my all into it. My bigger dilemma is my mom. She isn't happy with the second job because I will not really be getting paid. I'm not paying rent and I'm living under my parent's roof, but she doesn't think it's better for me to do the second job. I know she's only looking out for me, but I don't know if I'm being irrational to jump to the second job/internship. I feel like the outcome would be better and look better on my resume... for when I want to apply to my field.

Today we'll be hearing from - 


-------

**The Art Conservator** 

**/u/art_con:** I work at a well known university museum in North America. Essentially, I help fix and maintain the paintings collection at the museum that I work for. Primarily, this involves preparing paintings for loans and exhibitions. I have also helped teach undergraduate classes and workshops related to the technical examination of art work, given gallery talks, and helped with condition surveys of large gifts to our collection.


I was always interested in both science and fine arts. I ended up deciding to go to a liberal arts university that had a decent fine arts program because I did not feel comfortable limiting my options by attending an art school. I ended up attending a university that offered an undergraduate degree in art conservation, learned about the field, and realized it was the perfect marriage of my two areas of interest. I have pursued a career in art conservation since then. I now have a masters with a focus on paintings conservation.




**The Museum Pros**



**/u/therewillBsnacks:** I have a BA and MA in Art History with special interests in contemporary art, participatory practice and art education. I have worked in community-based nonprofits for several years doing public programs- especially art-based initiatives which led me to work at a few art museums. 

The museum I'm at now is one of the largest in the United States, where I work as an educator (lead tours and art programs) but I'm also responsible for community outreach.

**/u/BellsBastian:**  I have a BA in History, but my background is in journalism. I took an unusual route to the museum world -- I was a military journalist and television news producer for 8 years, before I became an assistant curator at a small history museum in the US two years ago. 

As with most small museums (full-time staff of two!) I wear many hats -- in addition to collection management, I also do all of our marketing and public relations, program development, and exhibit planning. I also manage all our part-time staff, volunteers, and interns.

**/u/cpatterson:** I am currently working at the 9/11 Memorial Museum, which is tangentially art-related (I'm in Collections/Exhibitions dept) but mostly memorial. I handle all day-to-day administration of the Collections and Exhibitions departments, assist the heads of each of those departments, and coordinate various projects within the Museum as needed.  

I grew up in the US but completed my undergraduate (art history degree) and graduate (arts management MA) education in the UK. While in the UK I worked for some large art museums (Tate Britain, V&amp;A), a conservation/heritage charity (The National Trust) and a small gallery. Moved back to the States about a year ago and worked for the Indianapolis Museum of Art, then I moved to NYC very recently and just started my new job at the 9/11 Memorial Museum. In all of the above, I have been an administrator/coordinator within various collections, exhibitions and projects departments.

You can address questions to one person in particular, to type of job, or to the panel at large, whatever you’d like. We've got a number of others who've kindly volunteered to participate in upcoming AMAs about their art history related jobs so you can look forward to those as well, and if you'd like to be on a panel yourself feel free to message the mods!

The thing is, I have some years of experience in Technical Support in a specific field that's not so easy to find people who are good - at least here - and involves web development, and I just got an offer from a company that's starting its operations in my country.  
  
My plan was to get a (mobile) development internship~&gt;job because I know that there are more chances to find a position somewhere else, and of course, I like it. I've been to US and I know the downsides and the difficult to get a visa there. I don't have a specific country where I want to go, I do have some countries on mind (US, CAN, AUS or GER), but I'll try to at least spend some time in some of those places before decide.  
  
I have some questions:  

Do you guys think that if I accept this offer, is it ok to ask on interview if there is some possibility to the company reallocate me after some years or can it make them turn me down?  
Is it possible to migrate to a developer position even if you study by yourself and don't have a job that relies specifically on it? Or would it be better to get a job where I can improve my dev skills and forget this position?  
  
Well, I'd like to hear if you guys have any advice that can help me trace a wise path to help me have more chances to get outta here in some years.

Once the daily [REDACTED] screech sounds, nobody will be allowed to enter or to leave.  Once the closed sign is put up, the place will be demolished, and in it's place will be a General Zoid's Burger Blast restaurant.  Terribly sorry for the inconvenience, it saddens me deeply to have to announce this.

After the recent mating season, the stock room was barely able to contain all the hydra, and with the new Cobra Hydra and Hail Hydra, we had to make decisions, either destroy a large section of inventory, or upgrade.  So I am pleased to announce that as of tomorrow, Hydra House will have not one, but two new locations!  In Sector 31, just left of the Laughing Lobster Comedy Club, will be a regular Hydra House, and in Sector 86, right beside Pizza Planet, will be the location of the new Hydra House super store.  The super store will have all of your favorite head=regenerating creatures, plus we will carry top of the line armor, weaponry, lab equipment, intern augments, and more.

Since this is such an exciting event, I felt like making it more exciting!  At any of our locations, when you use the coupon code ""NEWSTORE14"", you will be receive 35% off anything in the store.^*  This offer is only available for one week, so take advantage of it while you can!

257bkc,2,2014-05-10,A cop pulled me over last night and accused me of being high.,josephgordonreddit,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/257bkc/a_cop_pulled_me_over_last_night_and_accused_me_of/,"Before anyone flies off the handle and does a tirade against all policemen in the United States, read what I write.

It was 2 AM. I was tired; I wake up at 7 every day, go to the gym, do some work (for which I'm not paid), and on the rarest of the rare occasions do I actually go out. I texted one of my best friends that I was bored; he responded by saying that he's going bowling with some of his old high school friends and that I should join. Obviously, you know my answer.

The other guys drink, I don't; alcohol doesn't sit well with me at all. Fast-forwarding through an unusually raucous bit of bowling, I'm driving home. It's foggy out; so much so that it's hard to see about 100 feet in front of the car when the street lights are on. 

I'm going around 65- I'm absolutely tired, after all, and I want to go home. I'm nearly there, too, when I see the lights glowing inside my car. I had seen the two cop cars a few miles back, pulling someone else over, to which I thought, ""sucks to be that guy!"" and drove on. Now I was that guy. 

The officer, who was bald and shorter than I am (which is saying something; I'm 5'8.5 on a good day), gets my license and all that good stuff. He asks me to step out of the car; when I ask him why, he doesn't give a reason. On a day when I wasn't feeling so exhausted, maybe I would have kept being a bit more, ehem, litigious, but I wanted to feel the warm comfort of my bed, so I stepped out. 

He asked me how much I've had to drink, to which I answered honestly, absolutely none. He then asked me how much I smoked today, which took me by absolute surprise; I've never smoked anything in my life, except for maybe some steaks back when I wasn't a vegetarian. I, again, answer honestly, except he doesn't believe me. 

He says that my 'eyes tremored' when I held my head back and closed my eyes at his behest. Now that I recall it with a clearer head, I realize that I was trying not to fall asleep, or at least fall over. 

Another officer comes along, says my car smells of both weed and alcohol. I'm starting to think that they're looking to incriminate me, but again, in this sleep-deprived state, it's hard to tell. I, riskily, offer for them to search my car. Who knows, if I had been someone else, slightly tipsy, or maybe even not white, they might have taken me up on it and planted something in my car. The only thing my car smells of is moldy carpets, which, last time I checked, is very far from weed. 

I ended up getting an $85 ticket, which, to me, is a shit-ton. I don't have an income (interns, hooray), and since there's enough documented evidence of me going 65 in a construction zone, there's nothing much to fight. I didn't see any signs because of the fog, but that's not much of an excuse.

It's weird to think that, even when I was being completely honest, the cop kept insisting that I tell him about any weed I've smoked during the day. Slightly scary as well.

EDIT: Officer also said I had a ""green tongue,"" which, upon checking my tongue in the mirror, wasn't true."

257twu,6,2014-05-10,Concerns about a job offer...,internable,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/257twu/concerns_about_a_job_offer/,"I could really use some career advice. I have been working as an intern at a small start-up that is doing research and development for about six months now. In addition to going to school part time (mechanical engineering) and working this internship, I have a full time day job, a wife and two kids. Recently my day-job boss decided to make everyone’s work schedule more regimented. So I felt that I would not be able to keep working at my internship (I have been working spilt shifts to get my time in at the internship). When I gave my two weeks notice, I was offered a full time job. So, I need to choose between my current job, and this new job.

A little background about me: I’m 33, and have been a machinist for the last 13 years. The shop I work at (until recently) was focused on doing repair work for manufacturing plants, and so every day we had some new problem to solve. Probably less than 5% of our work was production work, and less than 5% of that was in quantities greater than 12. I started working on a ME degree a couple years ago, and I’m still at a sophomore level in my coursework. I applied to the internship just to get feedback on my resume, because I was certain that they wouldn’t hire me; I got a call back the next day, and was hired at my first interview. I’m not saying this to brag, I just want to point point out that in some ways this seems like a job that I am a very good fit for. My current job pays well for a machinist’s salary, and has good benefits (health, dental, clothing allowance), the new job pays slightly better with no benefits. Like I said above I have a wife (stay at home mom) and two kids (both &lt; 6 yrs. old). Maybe the most telling fact about my work history is that I had only ever worked for one company (except for a job at a deli when I was in high school), until we were bought out a few years ago. I’ve never applied for a job, and I’ve always been able to trust that my boss was actually looking out for me. (not that this has made me naive, just a little lazy when it comes to skepticism)

What I need advice on is this: what kinds of questions should I be asking my prospective boss to ensure that this new job is a good fit?

He let me know right away that a job with his company would have some big risks, IE they may not have funding a year from now, and therefore I may not have a job a year from now. Although that is a daunting prospect, it’s not a deal breaker. He told me that if they were going to let me go, they would give me two or three months notice. I think I’d be able to find a job in that time. Should I be more concerned about this?

Other concerns I have: am I going to be able to do all that is required/expected of me? Will I be able to take time off/work flexible hours so that I can finish my degree in a reasonable amount of time? Since the new job has essentially zero benefits, will the new healthcare exchange be able to provide me and my family with affordable insurance? How can I determine if my personality is a good fit on a long term basis? 

Of course, my biggest concern is that there is something I should be asking about that I don’t even know to ask about. So please don’t hesitate to ask “Aren’t you worried about X, Y, Z…”

EDIT:

I want to thank everyone that has taken the time to reply to this post; I really appreciate your advice. But I also want to make a clarification about what I'm asking. I'm not really asking about whether I should take the new job or keep my current one. That's a decision that I need to make for myself. There are a lot of factors besides ""stable vs. risky"" and ""benefits vs. none"" when it comes to choosing between the two jobs. For instance, I'm not sure that I will be able to continue going to school if I stay at my current job. My current job is at a pretty small firm, and the owner has started to make changes that may lock me into a schedule that will keep me from taking classes during the day (which is workable for gen. ed. classes, but now that I'm getting into higher level classes I'm going to have a hard time finding a Thermodynamics I class that meets on saturdays or is online...) What I was really hoping to get advice on is this: what kind of questions should I be asking my prospective employer? Like I said above _i've never had to apply for a job_ (outside of minimum wage jobs) and I need advice on how to find out what a full time position at this job would entail.

Also, I think that the replies to this post: http://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/256l46/advice_for_a_new_graduate_in_a_startup_company/ are kind of diametrically opposed to the replies I've received. What gives?

2580b3,9,2014-05-10,School choices,Rico_B_Suave,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/2580b3/school_choices/,"I am about to get out of the Marine Corps (Intel Analyst) and would like to pursue a CS career - security field. I have no programming background and as far as computers go, I can build them and do basic troubleshooting, so this is definitely a new field to me.

I have basically 2 choices in schools, both because of their proximity to family and jobs in my spouses field. 
* [University of Tennessee at Chattanooga](http://catalog.utc.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=10&amp;poid=1271&amp;returnto=233)
* [University of Maryland University College](http://www.umuc.edu/academic-programs/bachelors-degrees/cybersecurity-major.cfm#)

Basically, I am just curious on what you experts think or if there are any other options. UMUC looks like it doesn't offer much programming, which I don't consider a bad thing since I am not looking to become a programmer necessarily, but would that hurt me in getting a job? My goal is to complete my degree as quickly as possible so I can start working, however - I would like to pursue at least 1 or 2 internships with the NSA or similar.

Any knowledge/help you can provide will be greatly appreciated! I have been researching for the past week or so and have a bit of information overload both bad and good.

EDIT: I should add that even if I do mostly online at UMUC, at least 1 class per semester will be in person, for the GI Bill... Also, at UMUC, I will get about 2200/mo for rent (and will live with family for 200-400/mo) whereas at UTC I get about 1200/mo, and rent would be 800-1000. Job at UTC will be more flexible to my hours however unrelated to CS, at UMUC I would pursue some type of IT job or at a minimum work part time somewhere. Money does factor in but is secondary to education quality and job prospects in the future."
2583rl,71,2014-05-10,"Dear Texas, it's been an awesome ride(interesting? story inside)",Jerzdevil,texas,https://www.reddit.com/r/texas/comments/2583rl/dear_texas_its_been_an_awesome_rideinteresting/,"Dear Texas, 
       I just want to thank you for your experiences. Whataburger, mechanical bull riding, H.E.B, Rudy's, North Gate, 6th street, driving on the beach, helping friends with ranch work, I could go on for days of the memories I will cherish for a long time. I only wish I had more time to spend in places like Austin, College Station, Houston, and Corpus Christi.
              I originally came here on crazy circumstances, and I only have about 14 weeks left till I return to my home up north, and won't be able to return for a long time. It all started with a kid named Serhan, a Turkish foreign exchange student. 
He was very good at stocks, specifically currency exchange. When his dad gave him some money to play with, he turned 4k into 60k within a year or two, and bought himself a corvette. Probably about 6 years ago, he was at a night club in Houston, and when the valet brought his car up front, someone tried to carjack him, and ended up shooting him in the face and the arm. From there, he spent about a year in northern New Jersey at his Uncle's house, to have his jaw replaced with an Iron Bar, and his fore arm fixed as well, in a prestigious hospital in NYC. This is where I come into the story.
        As he stayed with his Uncle, who happened to be my neighbor, he sat outside most days, fairly bored on his porch. My buddies and I invited him over to hang out, and we ended up becoming best friends with the guy. At the end of his speech therapy and recovery, he went back to his school at Texas A&amp;M Corpus Christi.
     Meanwhile, I lost most of my friends in High school, sadly for neglecting them for my whore girlfriend, who cheated on me and dumped me. Worst part, I graduated early so that when I was done with my associates at a local community college, she would be graduating highschool( she was in the grade below me) So here I am all by myself, gf is gone who I dedicated my time to, I graduated early, my class won states for football my senior year which I missed, and then most people I knew went away to college. Within a few months I was heavy into drugs, specifically painkillers and hallucinogenics, and I was sleeping in my car for getting caught with drugs at  my moms. After a few suicide attempts, and getting pneumonia from sleeping in my car during a blizzard, I decided things need to change. I met some columbian girl, who, had a bf, and he was sorta known to be a little crazy. Long story short, I was jumped by him and a few of his friends, and when my friends went to his house to stick up for me, his family got involved, along with one kid that was mutually friends with me and the bf. The family all got charged with assault and my friends got let off on account of the family having weapons. For the record, this dad punched my friend in the face because he wouldn't get in the car, and to started a huge brawl. I felt horrible, I never wanted for anything like that to happen just because I was spiteful towards love from my previous gf. I was being threatened of being used by the family for causing ""gang violence,"" I was suicidal, a drug addict, and I was hating every second of my life. That's where you come in, Texas.
      My friend Serhan told me to pack all of my stuff and get away from everything to the beautiful waters of Corpus Christi, so I did. Sadly, within a few months, his gf got in a huge fight with him at out apartment, breaking stuff, and throwing stuff at him. When he threw, and I mean threw her out cause she was kicking and screaming, she got a bruise on her elbow and her face. From there she exclaimed, ""HAHA, now I'm gonna get you deported!"" She did, one day homeland security knocked on his door with plane tickets, and he had 5 days to leave the country. 
      Because of him, and the love Texas has showed me, I got my act together, will be finished with classes Tuesday, and graduating in August after I internship at a hospital downtown. 
   So thank you, Corpus Christi, and Texans all over. ""The jersey devil came to the body of Christ, and got redeemed"" my friends always say. But really, I wouldn't be here today without this state and wouldn't be looking at doctorate schooling for Physical Therapy without you all. If there's anything I should try and see in my last 14 weeks, please let me know. It's been a great four years, and I will always have a place for Texas in my heart."

258kvw,49,2014-05-10,"*UPDATE* Well, it finally happened...I was called a bad, neglectful mother",[deleted],Mommit,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/258kvw/update_well_it_finally_happenedi_was_called_a_bad/,"[original](http://www.reddit.com/r/Mommit/comments/250oj1/well_it_finally_happened_i_got_called_a_bad/)

This update is very bittersweet. I've been interning for 5 weeks on Monday, and I have absolutely been in love with working as a medical assistant. Everything had seemingly come together for me. And then I had the blow-out with my brother and his girlfriend. I took a half-day that day and asked my superior if I could go home, giving only fundamental details. She said it was no problem. So, I just went home and I chewed my brother out. I let out all of my anxiety, my anger...everything.

It's been affecting me everyday since. He won't take responsibility for anything that happened. I keep going over everything in my head. And yet, all I keep coming back to is that this young woman who I let into my home (sometimes all day and all night, literally), who would use my kitchen, use my amenities and whatnot, she was just watching me and picking up every little mistake I made and secretly held it against me. She would camp out in my home, seemingly just preoccupied with my brother but really she was coming in and secretly judging me. That is slowly sinking in and it's really really disturbing me. 

After a while, I knew she didn't like me. One of the very common things she would do, that kind of went over my head, was greeting my son then feeling his diaper, declaring it full and then just looking at me. I guess looking back, she thought she was the baby police. 

I can't blame her too much for her actions because my brother is more at fault than anything. He's abdicating taking responsibility for what happened. All he says is that he doesn't agree with what she said but, ""she's her own person and there's nothing I can do"". 

Unfortunately, this had lead to him showing me more disrespect. Today, he told me that before work he was going to hang out with her. I reiterated that she is NOT coming in our home. He just scoffed at me and said, ""I'm not talking about this anymore, you're going to have to suck it up"". So, I drew up a roommate agreement with all of my stipulations and I'm forcing him to agree with them or he's got 30 days to move out. I'm starting piece together that he's more in agreeance with his girlfriend than he is with me. 

Unfortunately, as a mother I feel like I cannot subject my son to all of this. I've been so much better about picking up around the house, I've gotten a better dish/laundry schedule going, and I'm going to start eating healthier and more at home. As a bonus, I got offered employment from my internship site, and I'm accepting. I'm just burnt out on all the drama and I kind of just want them both out of there because it just doesn't feel like very positive energy. I can't deal with my brother being dismissive and probably judging me/my home himself. I can't trust him. That's a horrible pill to swallow. 

Now, I'm incredibly sensitive and excessively worried about being a good mother to my son. I look at him everyday and it just tears me apart that someone would say that he doesn't deserve me, that I don't care about him or that I neglect him. 

I've taken a lot of the previous comments to heart and I'm going to try to move on as much as I can. "
258vlw,0,2014-05-10,Can we do this again? New Grads 2014: What was your offer? Hard Numbers Please!,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/258vlw/can_we_do_this_again_new_grads_2014_what_was_your/,"This topic was a big success last year, as found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1oiwc2/new_grads_2013_what_was_your_offer_hard_numbers/), so I figured I'd resurrect it. I kept the content the same.

&gt; As some of you are no doubt aware, Glassdoor data for new graduate positions is highly unreliable, and many universities don't publish signing bonus and equity numbers alongside salary in departmental surveys, or don't make the information available until late in the year, long past offer deadlines.
&gt; 
&gt;I thought it might be worthwhile for us to have an informal survey here in CSCQ to get a better idea of what we should really expect when interviewing and negotiating.
&gt; 
&gt; In the interest of making it at least semi-structured, I propose something like the following format:
&gt; 
&gt; For each commenter:

 
* Target School: Yes/No
* Level of Education: %w{Bachelor Master Doctorate}
* Major/Concentration: 
* Number of Internships: For the privacy conscious
* OPT: Interned At:
* Significant Personal Projects: Yes/No

&gt; and then for each offer on hand:

* Company: $name
* Location: 
* Position Title: e.g. SDE, PM, SWEII
* Salary: 
* Signing Bonus:
    * Caveats or Obligations: 
* Equity or Stock Grant:
    * Vesting Period/Earn Out:
* Application Method: How you applied to the company. Was it via on-campus recruiting, a career fair, internal referral, their careers page, etc...

* Application Process: Something as simple as a date range, e.g. Applied: 9/25, Offered: 10/12 or a detailed explanation of the interview process. Whatever you feel works best!

&gt; To save you reformatting the above, here's the raw markdown:

    * Target School: Yes/No
    * Level of Education: %w{Bachelor Master Doctorate}
    * Major/Concentration: 
    * Number of Internships: For the privacy conscious
    * OPT: Interned At:
    * Significant Personal Projects: Yes/No
    
    * Company: $name
    * Location: 
    * Position Title: e.g. SDE, PM, SWEII
    * Salary: 
    * Signing Bonus:
        * Caveats or Obligations: 
    * Equity or Stock Grant:
        * Vesting Period/Earn Out:
    * Application Method: 
    * Application Process: 

&gt;Target School: UWaterloo, MIT, CMU, UW, Caltech, Oxbridge, Edinburgh. Essentially, be near the top for at least one computing discipline.

&gt; If you're uncomfortable with sharing the details under your regular name, no one would doubt you for using a one-off account.

Everywhere in Sunnyvale goes from $2500-3000 for a damn 3 month lease so I've started looking in San Jose instead. The thing is I can't really tell whats good and whats not since I won't really have a chance to visit the place before I lease (coming from out of state).
     
I checked out 101 San Fernando and it turns out its $4000.. for a 3 month lease. Does anyone know of any nice apartment complexes like San Fernando that won't make me go broke?    
If I can't find anything, my last resort is SJSU intern housing but i'd really rather not live in dorms.   

Any help is appreciated, I've spent countless hours trying to find something reasonable.

Santa Clara is also a possibility."

However, today we got a call form Michael Rosales saying that he was in town and wanted to come over and host an impromptu event. Needless to say he stopped by and it was a great time. After enjoying the CoTM, Michael showed me another called the Intemperance BA XXI Envy. Its the same blend but in a short perfecto (5x50). It was a amazing cigar, if I had the funds I would have bought a box right then and there. It had one of the smoothest draws I have ever experienced as well as a almost perfect burn. Flavors included a wonderful spice with tones of cocoa and chocolate. The Brazilian binder and Nicaraguan/Dominican filler made for an very complex and satisfying smoke. If you like the cigar of the month, then I would definitely recommend picking up one of these! The event was great and Michael Rosales was an excellent guy, making me all the more likely to continue purchasing his cigars. "

What I’m looking for this time around: someone with a genuine interest in getting to know me and building a stable relationship (platonic or otherwise) where we can open up to each other (aka not a  situation where we talk for 2 days just out of boredom).

i'd prefer someone semi-local, and if not local, then someone willing to commit to make the drive to meet up if it ends up working out. (bonus points if you're near Conshohocken and wanna get drinks sometime)

also i realize that what i'm looking for is kind of a long shot, but i've found it before on here (as short lived as it was) and i'd really like to find someone to build that kind of connection with again. no harm in at least trying, right?

about me:

* i'm 21 years old.

* i'm a college senior, but home from school for the summer and starting an internship on monday.

* i eventually am hoping to get a job in technology consulting and software implementation. 

* my favorite restaurant is the cheesecake factory (lol).

259djy,1,2014-05-11,Can I use early withdrawal to MAKE money with the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP)?,BUTnothingHAPPENED,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/259djy/can_i_use_early_withdrawal_to_make_money_with_the/,"I have an internship this summer where my employer will match 100% of 3% of my pay and an additional 50% of the next 2% (i.e. if I contribute 5%, they'll match 4%).

Say I put in $500 over the summer, and my employer matches $400. Then I withdraw the money at the end of the summer. This withdrawal is taxed as income, so I'll lose ~20% after federal/state taxes (at least until my tax return...). I would also incur a 10% early withdrawal penalty, and be barred from contributing to the TSP for 6 months. All in all, I would end up with .7*900 = $630 after taxes, if I'm correct. In contrast, I would have only made $350 without the TSP. The 6 month barring won't affect me since my internship only lasts the summer and I won't begin work again until the next summer. Is this a loophole, or am I missing something?"
259g9i,5,2014-05-11,Everything fucking sucks. Nothing is going to get better.,fuckeverything0,MMFB,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMFB/comments/259g9i/everything_fucking_sucks_nothing_is_going_to_get/,"I'm a college student who has lost all reasons to be optimistic and I don't feel as if anyone supports me. I know that my problems are nothing in the scope of the world and that in 20 years I'll look back at all of this and not care, but I don't have that luxury right now. I've tried therapy but it was a huge fucking waste of time and I ended it this week. 

I'm trying to keep everything as confidential and anonymous as possible since I don't want anyone I know possibly seeing this (even if it such a small chance). I'm an externally happy person, but internally I'm a mess.

1. After repeated efforts, I wasn't able to get a paid internship this summer (and I've interned a lot). There are unpaid ones I could do, but I've found a lot of them really don't teach me anything - my current internship is  unpaid and it has be do a lot of errands, including some that take 3-4 hours. I know that in my paid summer internships are harder to get since generally they're given to the kids of those already in the industry, but I feel it's a sign that I'm not going to be able to find a paid one in fall (and plus I know some people at my school who have paid ones). I'm convinced I'm not going to be able to find a job after I graduate next year since I'm not going to be interning this summer. I tried looking for a paid retail job but that's not working either.

2. I'm searching for a new place to live, but  I'm not sure if i'll find any place that I'll like. I've tried posting on Facebook groups and have done everything I can, but no one's biting. People are probably procrastating until August, but there's nothing good (and no living on my option is not an option)

3. Today we had a mixer about senior project, but I found it frustrating, awkward, and it actually me want to cry. There are various capacities that I have to perform as part of senior project, but it was awfully difficult. I had been talking to a friend of mine about working on his project as a lead person, but he chose another lead. Since I was looking at a whole bunch of projects to work on as lead (not just his), I felt that was fine. I asked him if I could be his second in command, but he said that decision was for his lead. I let the lead know about it, but I think she's looking at other people. The whole situation was awkward as fuck and Apparently this made my eyes tear up. Apparently out of all the times I wanted to cry this past month it was now. In front of people. I guess he saw and apologized for the awkwardness, but I felt like a complete fuck-up. I was able to keep it together and get home, where magically the tears went away.

long story short, I transferred to the same college that she attends in order to be together.  Ever since I've gotten here I have been under the impression that our relationship has become more serious, something which I was not necessarily looking for.  I have serious feelings for this girl, yet at the same time, I am in college and I feel like we are drifting apart in terms of what we want from this relationship.

My GF is in the business school, and has already gained an impressive internship for the summer, while I am taking summer class, and plan on washing dishes for another summer.  Our relationship has been fine up until the point where she has become upset that I am drinking too much and using too many drugs, which I feel is perfectibility acceptable, seeing as I just turned 21 and have always enjoyed experimenting with drugs. 

as I approach my senior of college I am stuck wondering if I should stay with my gf and see what happens, or break up and venture out for my last year of college.....

tl;dr - 5 year relationship with gf throughout high school and college, should i break up in order to have the true college experience? or stay together with fear of the relationship becoming too serious??"

This may be because I told them I had home experience maintaining a Linux-based server during the interview, which is not strictly speaking true (my friend has an elaborate home server and he showed it to me, but I myself am inexperienced with computer technology and have no idea how it works).

They told me any problems will mostly have to do with Internet connections (wired and wireless). So my question to anyone who can help me is: what should I know/expect? Can you point me to any simple resources? If a connection is lost, what do I do? Do I reset the router? Or even the modem? What should be my basic course of action to solve any problem??

Anything helps! Thank you for your time!

EDIT: Just to clarify, I wasn't actually hired specifically for tech support. They simply happen to include that responsibility in the list of things I'll have to do because I'm generally good with computers. There are several interns, and they divided the jobs to do among us, and of all the interns, I seemed to be the most qualified. So the fact that I said I had some experience with server maintenance doesn't really change anything; I still would've ended with tech support. That being said, I don't think I'll be doing the work of a system administrator, just some low level Internet connection troubleshooting and the likes.

259s0j,7,2014-05-11,Need Advice: Continue Summer Internship vs. Summer Classes?,pygmy-giraffe,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/259s0j/need_advice_continue_summer_internship_vs_summer/,"Hey guys I'd appreciate advice on this matter: I'm conflicted between continuing an Internship that I did last summer and taking summer courses at my university for this summer. 

Background:
I'm currently a 2.5/3rd year student who switched over to CS from Civil-E at the start of my sophomore year and I was also a part-time student during that fall. So technically, I'm quite behind in terms of my CS classes and expect to graduate a semester or two late. I've only taken an OOP/Intro to Data Structures course so I'm still quite new to the curriculum, and the following CS classes are only going to get harder/more time consuming (I don't think its too smart to take 18 credits of all hard CS/ECE/Math classes just to graduate in time).

In order to prevent this, I plan to take 3 summer classes to lighten up my course load next Fall. The courses are Differential Equations, Statistics, and Digital Electronics. I'll be taking DiffEQ and Digital Electronics together in the 1st session and then Stat in the 2nd. I'd also like to mention the professors for these 3 summer courses are good teachers and many of my friends in CS/Eng. have gotten seemingly easy A's in their classes. However the professors in the Fall for these same courses all seem to suck. 

The downside is the first session courses will end in late June, and the second will end July 22 (it overlaps ~3 weeks with the first session). Stat will be in the 2nd session during the evening hours twice a week. So technically after late June, I am free to work full time while taking the Stat class. Alternatively, I could take only 1 class (Stat, because it's in the evening) and work the rest of the time, but this would further delay my graduation.

The internship I would continue is in RD at a big defense contractor, and comprises of mostly System Admin duties Sometimes I will be assigned a project to work on that relates to some coding/development but usually has to do with menial documentation, most of the time I will be testing capabilities of various software/services on cloud platforms (so scripts, Sys. Admin stuff, etc.). There's not much pressure in the job, most the people I work with are nice, and it pays $20 an hr. 

My main concern is, after taking the summer classes, I will be drained. The past two semesters have been probably the most stressful times of my life; my father had a heart attack and went through a triple by-pass, I was VP of my fraternity while taking rigorous courses, basically never slept, cut down time going to the gym and loss about ~20 lbs, broke up with my girlfriend and my uncle passed away.

I feel like I should just take a break relax for the rest of the summer instead of working, spend more time with my dad, go fishing with him, focus on my own physical health, hit the beach with friends and maybe do a trip to California a visit some more friends/family. Yet at the same time I feel obligated to work in order to pay for school (especially with graduating a bit later), and don't want to lose out on future career opportunities. 

I already have 4 months interning at this company last summer and 5 months working as a Sys. Admin for a small server company my junior/senior year in high school under my belt. Will it hurt my resume and/or post-grad career prospects if I don't work/intern this summer? In all honesty, even if I worked/interned again, I feel I would still learn way more if I were to dedicate the same amount of working time to taking a few CS/developer MOOC's and working on side-projects on my own or with friends. Is it worth continuing a mostly IT, sometimes software engineer/development internship as a CS major? Am I naive to pass on this opportunity?

TLDR;
Will employers look suspiciously at a gap in interning? Is one internship sufficient to be competitive as a candidate post-grad? If not, How many internships should an ideal graduating student have (and for how long)?

25a5bb,2596,2014-05-11,TIFU by using the Pornhub app too much,mas0518,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/25a5bb/tifu_by_using_the_pornhub_app_too_much/,"This actually happened a couple of days ago.

I am an engineering intern and was invited to go to a seminar with a bunch of other engineers from my company.  This required about a 4 hour road trip.  My smartphone was on the verge of going over my allotted 2 GB of data per month, with a few days to go until a new cycle, so I knew this was going to be a long boring trip with nothing to do.

About an hour into the trip, feeling bored, I jokingly announced, ""can someone set up a wifi hotspot with their phone, I've reached my data limit"".  The engineer sitting to the left of me said that he had problems with going over his data limit as well until last month when he changed some settings on his phone.  He asked me to open up my app settings to determine which applications were using the most data this past cycle.  This is where I fucked up.

I had forgotten that I had gone without wifi at home for a couple of weeks because fuck paying bills.  After a few days in without internet, I had not had any happy time, so I decided to look some stuff up on my phone.  However, my phone for some reason will not stream videos from porn sites.  I can stream youtube, liveleak and many others, but any porn site that I try to watch a video on, my phone tells me I can only download it.  Well, I did not want to download porn onto my phone, so I decided to find a pornviewing app and stumbled upon Pornhub.  I had heard a few days before on Reddit that Pornhub would plant a tree for every hundred videos watched, so I felt like I was doing some good in the world everytime I used this app.  Which was multiple times before I got my internet turned back on.  

So back to the van on our road trip, I bring up the list of apps that had used the most data the past cycle.  I should point out that I have a Galaxy Note 2, which has a very large screen.  To my surprise, because I had forgotten, right at the top of the list was a big Pornhub emblem and a green bar that said it had used about 1.2 GB of data.  Unfortunately for me, the engineer on my left, and the engineer on my right, and the chief engineer sitting behind me were all watching me while I did this.  To make matters worse, as soon as I realized what was at the top of the list, I tried to slide it off the screen to make it disappear, but in my nervousness, I ended up tapping on it which opened up a screen to give more details about the app, as well as enlarging the icon for all to see.  The engineer to my right started laughing, and wouldn't stop for about 10 minutes, the engineer to my left stated ""well this is awkward"".  And the chief engineer behind me would not make eye contact with me at all for the rest of the day.  I overheard the story being told multiple times during breaks in the seminar with the other 6 engineers on the trip, so now everyone in my office probably thinks I'm some sort of perv.  I am not looking forward to work tomorrow morning.


Edit:  Wow, this kind of exploded today.  Thanks for all the great responses.  I'm sure that Everyone will have a few good laughs at my expense tomorrow which I think I can handle.  I imagine all of the engineers in the office will be jealous as shit though when I tell them that [u/Katie_Pornhub](http://www.reddit.com/user/Katie_Pornhub)  responded to the thread.  That's almost like real life contact with a female.  We all know who I will be thinking about tonight when I arm wrestle with my one eyed vessel  (☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞


tl;dr:  Showed a few engineers that I am interning for that the number 1 data using app on my phone is Pornhub :("

25af9e,0,2014-05-11,He said he loved me and fueled a fantasy. Now I feel terrible when he set me straight.,[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/25af9e/he_said_he_loved_me_and_fueled_a_fantasy_now_i/,"**TL;DR: After a year he tells me he loves me and I realized I loved him too. Over the school year I broke-up with my boyfriend and moved closer to him for the summer. Then he reminds me that for now we are just friends with benefits.**

**How it started:** 3 years ago I got a job at a summer camp and I loved it. So much in fact I went back the next summer even though it is halfway across the country from my hometown. That summer I met him (Let's call him Bill). Over the summer I started falling for him and made my intentions very clear I was attracted to him. Over the course of the summer I started falling for him. We kissed and some other things, but we didn't have sex. By the end of the summer he made it clear he could not really handle a long distance relationship. A few weeks after the summer we kept in contact and even tried to maintain this ""long distance friends with benefits"" thing. After awhile we sort of stopped talking and that winter I started dating another guy that actually went to my school (Let's call him John). 

Once summer rolled around Bill and I knew we would be working together again so we started talking casually. The first few days were fine but then I started relying on him for emotional comfort that eventually lead to us fooling around again (I knew I was cheating on John). With about 2 weeks left into our summer together Bill told me he loved me. It shocked me and I after a few days I realized that I never stopped loving him from last summer. When we finally said goodbye he told me that if ""there was ever any logic in the universe we will be meet again"". 

Once school started I continued to date John (I never told him, *please don't lecture me about this I know it was a bad thing to do*) and I actually went through a terrible 6-week break-up with him because it wasn't fair that I loved someone else and I was just staying with John to make him happy. The entire time being romantic with Bill long-distance.

Then during spring break I drove 8 hours to be with Bill. It was almost magical. I was so happy at it felt amazing to spend intimate time with him without worrying about the distance or worrying about someone else. I knew we weren't official but whenever I was sad he would tell me to look towards the future, that in the end we could be together. 

I worked to be able to spend my summer in near him. I got a different job and internship for the summer and I would be a short train/car ride away. I could actually know if a relationship with him would be worth it. If we didn't have to worry about distance what our relationship could be like. 

**The Twist:** less than a week ago he told me that he started a ""possible relationship"" with a long-time friend (let's call her Jamie). Bill and Jamie weren't dating they were just seeing if they could work as a couple. Bill tried to reassure me that our plans were still on track for the summer, but I couldn't help feel betrayed.

He told me that Bill and I weren't official and that we didn't have obligations to each other. And I understand that, but I just had no idea why this had to happen now. Bill admitted that he was an asshole and that he was wrong in feeding me this idea of relationship for so long when he wasn't as attached (because of the distance). But, I still feel terrible. Jamie will be away while I am in town so Bill told me that our plans can continue uninterrupted. 

In the end this summer I will be in a city I love and I can still have fun and be around friends other than Bill, but he was probably the main motivation. I want to spend time with Bill over the summer the way that *we* planned. If things change in the future I would still want Bill to be in my life, even if we were just friends.

But now it just hurts so much. I know I shouldn't worry about his possible relationship with Jamie. If they end up happy I want him to be happy. But, if it doesn't work out and we happen to meet up after our last year of college I would see where we could go. 

I just can't stop this terrible feeling in the pit of my stomach.

You lovely people are so comforting and wonderful I'm just looking for advice or guidance or anything really. I mostly needed to type this out."

I work extremely hard and have the highest marks/GPA in my class while double majoring in two engineering majors (electrical and mechanical with a minor in Physics too). Just in this passed school year, I worked part-time with my previous internship, am an officer in a campus club, received acceptance into an honors fraternity, received funding for a start-up company I'm doing on the side, and maintained a healthy relationship with my girlfriend of over five years. I don't know how, but I did it and worked my ass off. 

I started my internship search for this summer back in December and have applied to 97 different positions, locally and all around the country. This isn't my first time seeing I've already had two summer internship experiences. I thought with all my experience and skill, I would have the best chance to get a great internship. It's been five full months and counting and I have yet to solidify a position. I've had a few phone interviews but nothing much came from it. Every day I'm applying to more places and revising my portfolio/resume but nothing good is coming out of it. Last year I had eight in-person interviews and accepted a position at a great company which I was pleased with. They loved me there and even offered me the summer position for this year, however I turned it down thinking I would not have the difficulty I am now trying to get a position (I wanted a new experience and my manager understood completely). I don't know what it is, I just can't seem to get lucky. Last year I had no problem being offered interviews and hearing back from companies. This year it feels like I'm being ignored. All my friends have jobs, my girlfriend got her first internship on the second place she applied to and my freshman brother got a position his first try. I'm stuck 97 applications deep with more than 80 already declining me and no more summer positions being posted. And if I don't get a position, I may not graduate next summer due to my school's internship requirement. I'm a bit quiet when you first get to meet me, but I don't see how it's that bad. 

I don't feel talented anymore. I don't feel like I can be successful at what I do if no one can notice me, even when I'm working my absolute hardest. I've watched my parents struggle because of financial problems. Money has always been tight with my family and after my dad lost his job, we lost the house and had to move through apartments for the time being. Took him 20 months to finally get a new job after his own intense search. He now works almost 80 hours a week just to make ends meet. Four years later, the bank is still dragging us down. We're good, hardworking people who just can't get a break. We don't have fancy cars or nice things, just what we need to survive. I don't want to end up like them, but I can't even get a job. 

I know this isn't as bad as many other things posted here, just needed to say it and get it off my chest. I wish hard work did pay off. "

I see a lot of posts about math in CS, I know there is a lot of math involved but my question is, to you computer scientists, how does math apply to your job or whatever it is you do?

I ask because in my previous jobs, the people with a bachelors in computer science were always ""Project managers"" or even just help desk... I never seen how they would use even algebra in their daily tasks.

This may sound overzealous, but I want to do more than help desk and simple IT stuff, I want to be proud of the work I do and see results or some kind of completion. Luckily the school I'm going to has internships with JPL and other companies, but I am mostly interested in working with JPL. I hope this could be a good starting point.

I used to be really bad at math in high school but recently found out I am actually pretty good, I just needed to apply myself. (Thanks to my GF who is a math tutor) So I feel my chances of success have gotten better. BUT, I want nothing to do with help desk.

Is it worth it for a college student to try to get a sport/recreation/private pilot certificate? I really only want to fly for personal pleasure. I've taken sample FAA exams and have gotten ~90% and don't think that I'll need more than the 20/30/40 hours of flight time required.

The class is a Computation Theory class, and is a requirement for my major. If I don't take it now I'd have to take it senior year. This class is normally a very hard class, but its supposedly easier in the summer. And its not exactly a subject I'm looking forward to, so it'd be nice to get it out of the way. I checked with my internship and they said that they'd be able to get me out of work in time to make it to the class--which meets at 6PM twice a week. The class lasts for 3.5 hours. I'm a bit concerned because I've just come off the most intense, draining semester of my college career, and am not looking for more burnout this summer. It's hard to tell how much work internships are. Is it normal to take work home from or stay late at an internship? I'd like to take the class if I can handle it without sacrificing sanity, but it's hard for me to tell how difficult/draining the internship itself will be. Anyone have any thoughts or suggestions?"
25b8il,6,2014-05-11,Internship tax question. File as Dependent or not?,pf_tx_hlp,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/25b8il/internship_tax_question_file_as_dependent_or_not/,"Basic facts:

21 y/o, college student

Home State: Pennsylvania

Internship State: Arizona

yearly wage: ~52k

Ok so I'm on this internship for around 7 months, ending this August. So that's around ~30k before taxes. I filled out the W-4 when I started in January and been having the ""FED withholding"" and state coming out of my paycheck so I end up seeing ~25% go to taxes. 


I'm completely oblivious as to what to do about filing taxes so I see the max amount of money returned. I was wondering what would be the better option. Being claimed as a dependent by my parents or not. I realize that being claimed as a dependent helps them with taxes but would that be a better option to see the most money returned and then I could split the difference with them? I would really really appreciate any guidance. I wish taxes were taught in school, because I feel completely lost and overwhelmed with all the different rules and regulations. 

Thank you in advance.


Edit:

So if I file as single (not dependent) I fall into the [highlighted bracket.](http://i.imgur.com/xdCeEjF.png)

-being taxed as the bracket lower for the 30k ≈ 5,300

-actual amount after 30k reported ≈ 4,000

And as a dependent that'd be $3,900 exemption on my parents. 


Follow up question: what would the tax rate be as a dependent? The same as single tax bracket?"

I am desperately looking for advice as of now

I am a transfer student from community college, this is my senior year, I got into UCLA as a chem major, however after a semester I realize chemistry isn't what I want to do, but I can't change major as a transfer, so I started taking CS classes and found that CS is indeed what I want to do for the rest of my career

I finish all the CS lower division classes and took advance algorithm, machine learning, networking and security class with overall CS GPA of 3.48.

I have 2 personal projects one in search optimization/recommendation and another one in android, in addition I have two research experience with one web development and another one doing NLP. 

I am also doing a summer intern this upcoming June, but the thing is there is an absolute chance I am going to fail 3 chemistry classes this quarter as I am taking 5 classes this quarter, so dismissal from UCLA is a high possibility. 

Taking chemistry classes is absolutely a nightmare for me as I don't understand it but I love CS to the point I self learn and did little projects in Haskell, Ruby on Rails, Angular.js, did some code in R, matlab and is proficient in python java and C. So my question is, is it possible to get a CS job without getting a degree at all?

Any advice if any will be much appreciated "

I know that I'm a couple years away from it mattering, but it worries me a lot.

I can get the assignments done, but I haven't done much programming outside of school. Whenever I look at sites like StackOverflow I get cold sweats because I feel like I don't understand even half of what the discussion is about. When it comes to the more theoretical side of Computer Science I'm at about the same spot, I know some of the basics but I don't know much more than that.

I'm afraid that I'm only good at being a college student (doing assignments, taking tests) and that once I get out of here I'll be totally unprepared or that I won't get a job.

I'm starting an internship this week, but it is only barely CS related and is with the school.

Am I worried over nothing and what can I start doing so that I can be sure to have a place to go after college?"

25bk2r,1,2014-05-11,Am I deluding myself?,haHAnothingmatters,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/25bk2r/am_i_deluding_myself/,"Hello fellow people,
I have recently felt much like I am flying around with very little control over my relationships or my life. I have decided, two years into my undergraduate education at a rather expensive private American university (and an enjoyable(?) semester abroad through said university in a large European capital) to withdraw from the American university and apply to the public universities in this country instead. I am a language student and came here mainly for the immersion and simply can't see myself justifying spending another two years of this ridiculous tuition in the united states for an academic career that would simply happen spontaneously if I stay here. I am an EU citizen, so the university tuition here... let's just say it would take me ten years of university in Europe to spend half of what I would be spending finishing my degree in the states. I have done everything very cautiously, and have kept my options open, so come August if none of the universities I have applied to here do not accept me I can restart the semester at the american university as if I had never left. 

I love Germany, and I feel as though I would never want to settle down in the United States. I just want to stay put for a while. Growing up I had to do a lot of moving around and my ultimate dream right now is to have the ability to sign a piece of paper binding me to a specific apartment for at least the next couple of years. Most people my age are obsessed with travel. I just want to stay here and study and work and start saving money. The truth is though, I keep finding myself realizing that ideally I would want to do this with someone by my side because I'm really afraid of the risks I'm taking.

I met a guy here a couple of weeks after my arrival. The first time we went on a date was a wednesday, I was so giddy and I could tell he was really into it. We kept hanging out every day after that until that Sunday he made it really clear that he didn't want a relationship, and somewhat shittily used my locational volatility as an alibi. He made it about the fact that I might not be staying here permanently. I also found out pretty quickly he had been involved in a variety of weirdly abusive relationships before I came along with women he would meet on online dating sites for casual sex. One of them was a girl he's actually made quite good friends with, and she is in an open relationship. Long story short, he has been having casual sex to no avail for the last 5 years and is pretty fucked up by it now I think. We started having sex and it was really great. I would sleepover and it would just happen and it felt really natural I think. 

Half a month ago we met up with the idea that we would discuss exactly what was going on, feelings wise. I really love him and care about him probably a lot more than I should. He admitted to being confused about feelings for his ""flatmate"" (who had been giving me dirty eyes ever since I stayed over for the first time in February) and I just told him I already knew about that because it was pretty obvious to me from the first day I saw them interacting that there was something there. I don't know where I stand with him at all anymore. He told me he needed time to figure things out and that it felt wrong for him to keep having sex, and that he doesn't want to have sex with anyone for a bit until he's sorted himself out. I guess I'm just really selfish and need to give him that space. The thing is, I'm leaving to visit my parents and friends for a month on sunday and have no idea what could happen when I come back here. Somehow, it could be great to just get the fuck out and let him breathe out whatever issues in summer air, but I also see there being a chance that I'll come back and any semblance of interest in me in his mystery of a brain will be a corpse.

Meanwhile, I have a situation that is somewhat of a timebomb waiting for the right moment to explode in Ljubljana. I met him three years ago now and we were long distance for a year. He came to the states, planning to live with me for 4 months during the summer, but everything turned sour really fast after the boston marathon bombings and they tightened regulations for his visa only a couple of months before he arrived. We were both completely devastated; he had to go work a shitty job the government recommended for him in the middle of nowhere while I was in New york working at an internship I got my hands on by some miracle. We spent a week together in new york before he had to go, and then another week when he came back to get his original flight home to JFK. We were so angry, and  only had each other to blame. I am getting tears in my eyes just thinking about how disappointing it felt and how horrible that summer was, and the feeling of being denied romance by him when he came back because he knew better than to keep adding coal to our masochistic fire. 

I don't know when I'll be able to see either of them again, I don't know how it is possible for me to love two people so much at once, I don't know why I am writing this instead of finishing my essay on freud's horribly depressing utopia.

I just want to finish the fucking semester and hug my mom and have a fucking place to live in that I know I won't have to vacate within half a year. 

what an interesting world we live in, where I can essentially write a diary entry and have people tell me what an asshole I am. thank you to anyone who was bored enough to read my blaabbing. here I attach my favorite gif because I've never made a post to reddit before and I feel it would be satisfying to accompany my inauguration with Libby.

I'm 22. I ended it because I'm gay.

I have 4 main guys in my life right now I hang out with. They are the world to me. I'm only attached because it feels good to be, they are supportive, not because I have to be attached to them to cope, but they mean a ton and I love them around.

One of them is my best friend I've known for 4 or 5 years now. We are insanely close, more so than the others, talk every day, hang out multiple times a week, rely on each other for a lot, always supporting and sharing every detail of our lives.

He has a girlfriend, she doesn't care, she jokes and calls me his boyfriend. My ex-gf never cared either, after her, I would spend almost the same amount of time with him. After him, I would spend a ton of time with my other friends too.

Now that my relationship is ended my friends are all I got. Well, now my ex-gf is my friend too, she's cool with our relationship being over (she realizes now it never worked properly, I never lied to her, I always said I was unsure).

-----

I feel really guilty, because any of these guys I would date. Especially my best friend. I have a crush on him. I've never done anything to make it more than what he can give though. I don't want to lose a friend over it.

I'm really worried about the future. I'm only casually dating people, not doing anything serious. Is it wrong when I find someone that I want to date to have these feelings about my other friends on my mind? I feel like I would need to lose them all in order to have a fair relationship with someone else. Especially my best friend, being that we are really close, and I have a crush on him.

-----

I work full time at an internship, 4 out of the 5 weekdays I have a friend lined up to do something fun with. On the weekend I always have things planned. I'm always texting friends. Is this too much being I am attracted to them?

Right now I'm having a blast and a lot of fun, am I doing anything wrong right now just putting these feelings aside? In the future do you think this guy can still be my best friend? Or no?

We've known each other for a few years and only recently become more than friends. 

She's awesome. She's crazy smart and has been doing lots of different research in her field, biology. She's really into Jazz and knows a ton about it, and music in general, and she has taught voice lessons. Last Fall she was away in Africa doing research on animals and stuff. She has like 4-5 different groups of friends, all our age, and she regularly goes out to cool and unusual bars throughout the week. She's graduating this week and spending the next month or so finishing her current research on people's smoking habits. Then in August she's traveling around Europe, then in September moving to another city that she's applying to Fellowships in. She's a vegetarian, a really good runner, and decently health-oriented. 

These are all good things. The issue here is me. 

Next to her, I feel woefully inadequate and just plain boring. I'm a computer science major, taking 4.5 years to complete my schooling. I have an internship with a pretty decent company, but I'm kind of selling out. I'm fairly sociable, which is pretty much the only thing I've got. I really don't have any passions (I like to read and play video games casually) and my group of friends is mostly just my Fraternity, almost all of which are way younger than me, or people I know but don't *know*. I'm the type of person who's never really been bad at anything, but never really all that good at anything either. I've always done the bare minimum to get by and that's worked for me, up until now.

She has all these passions and hobbies and is good at a ton of things - not just passably good, like *really* good - and has a ton of friends and always goes out, while I watch TV or play video games or read mindlessly for hours and then go to a bar on campus or something with one or two people. 

I'm afraid I'm just too boring of a person to hold this girl's interest for more than a few months, and I don't know what to do. Have any of you ever felt this way? Is there anything I can do to make myself more fun?

P.S. I've been in this sub long enough to know a ton of the responses are going to be ""I do [this hobby] and I love it! You should try it out!"". I'm not *not* looking for those kinds of responses, but my major issue is how to motivate myself to get out there and be a more fun, active, well-rounded person. Thanks."

25bq2m,1,2014-05-11,"This isn't as serious as the other stuff here, but I've never felt so disrespected ...",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/25bq2m/this_isnt_as_serious_as_the_other_stuff_here_but/,"I'm 22. I got dumped back in February and the feeling is still stuck with me. It's not like I even care about the girl or anything, it's just ... what she said, and *how* she said it pissed me off so much. It's bothering me ever since. I've had some dramatic break-ups and also some pretty tame ones. But this one was just a slap in the face.

&amp;nbsp;

So I met her back in September, we hooked up in October and then started going out. It wasn't that serious but I was pretty content. We'd snuggle and talk for hours, and that's exactly what I wanted.


She took an internship in January, somewhere far away. Like a 15 hour bus trip away. Not bad, but the relationship wasn't serious enough to prolong. We decided to stay together anyway and solve the distance problem by skyping.

&amp;nbsp;

It wasn't really going well. Skyping was rare. We texted sometimes but I tended to get irritated at gaps in communication. For me, it was either constant communication, or no communication with only scheduled skype dates. A few years ago I was in a long distance relationship that was super serious, and that crashed and burned. I guess I thought of this new girl as a chance to redeem myself. To show myself that I can handle distance. This relationship was about me, and I guess that was Problem #1.

The whole thing was pretty unhealthy. I wasn't happy with it but I tried to work it out and talk it through with her. I told myself that breaking up with her was giving up. If we had a problem, then we could work through it. So every time I felt we had an issue, I would bring it up. But she'd always say she didn't see an issue.

I asked her if were doing the right thing, like maybe we should stop talking and reconvene in May when she gets back. But she said ""You're a cute guy I love talking to and you make me laugh. How could this not be the right thing?"" That settled it for me.

&amp;nbsp;

In February she had asked me if we should send each other gifts for Valentines Day. I was pretty happy about that, because she hadn't been putting any effort into the long distance relationship so I was glad to see some initiative.

A few days later she texted me and asked to skype. Not like ""We have to talk"", she was being playful about it. More like ""hey I miss you, wanna talk?"" I was happy to hear that, again because she hadn't been putting much effort in before this. Combined with the Valentines Day thing, it got me excited.


&amp;nbsp;

I logged onto skype and called her. I asked her ""So what's up?"", and she answered with ""I think we should break up."" Sudden, but expected. The relationship wasn't healthy -- an LDR requires communication but we didn't really do that. She said that once she started thinking about Valentines Day, she realized that she wasn't that into this relationship after all. Makes sense, I mean she wasn't putting much effort in and that explains that.

I just said ""Well, okay."" She added ""By the way, I have herpes so you might want to get that checked out."" At this point I didn't really know what to say, so I said ""Uh, okay, sure."" Then she said ""Can I hang up now?""

And so ... she hung up. I really tried to work through our problems. Every time we had an issue, instead of just suddenly skype calling her and dumping her, I'd bring it up with her and try to be reasonable. Seems like she didn't really have an issue, she just didn't like me -- despite that ""cute guy who makes me laugh"" comment she made, which was just two or three days prior to the breakup!

But she didn't want to talk about anything. She didn't give me any time at all.

&amp;nbsp;

*""I think we should break up. By the way, I have herpes. Can I hang up now?""*

That still rings in my head, three months later. I felt so disrespected. I'd tried so hard and this is how it ended. After I had tried to work through all our problems, the whole relationship ... *I* was the one who wanted to dump her, but I didn't because I thought we could work through things. She was right to break it off -- that's not hard to admit. But FUCK the way she did it. *Fuck* her.

&amp;nbsp;

After that skype call, that was it. I haven't talked to her since. No closure or anything.

I've had much worse break-ups than this, in terms of drama. I realize that this is bothering me mostly because it's recent, but it's just bothering me so much now that I know she's back at school, even though I haven't seen her around campus. I dread seeing her at a party because I have no idea what I would say. Would I play it cool? That would feel so wrong, since deep down I know I'm pretty pissed at her for the way she handled that break-up. So I'm really not cool with her. But there'd be no point in talking to her about it any further.

So I just had to get this off my chest. I know it's not really an out-of-the-ordinary story, but thanks for reading."

:--|:--
[I watch your channel alot and your videos have helped me understand engine concepts and alot of other car related engineering substantially better than textbooks and other written sources have! For that, I am grateful.  My question is, since you call your channel ""engineering explained"" do you ever plan to do videos on non car-related engineering subjects? Hydraulic systems for example...water-pumps...etc etc?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chf92f3?context=5)|The original goal of the channel was to be fairly vague, just covering anything engineering related (Here's a strange example: [Link to www.youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hq5D4EQaJkE)) My passion kind of took over, and I started getting pretty in-depth solely on automotive topics.
[Also just a minor sub-question:  Are you employed as an engineer? If so, what is your job title and what day to day activities do you undertake? I am a design engineer at a heavy plant manufacturer for the quarry industry.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chf92f3?context=5)|I work as a test engineer for a forklift company. Day to day is a bit of research, hands-on testing, and some data crunching/documentation. Sometimes a quick test can provide engineers with a great amount of useful info, so that's where I come in. 
[Thanks for replying, i looks forward to many more videos. Have you done a video on power steering ? (either you have and i've missed it, or you havent but im just too lazy to look...it is Sunday after all\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chf9dze?context=5)|Sundays are meant for relaxing, I'd recommend watching it tomorrow. :)
[Hi, thanks for doing this, will definitely be looking at some of your videos later. What is your experience of making money from youtube?. Ideally how much you make and on what payment structure?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chf905a?context=5)|Making money via YouTube is definitely not easy. I've had my channel for nearly 3 years now, and only recently has it consistently paid for rent (and a little extra). It's against YouTube's terms and conditions to say how much you make, but with a little Google dive (or YouTube ranking websites) you can get estimates, which throw out a very general number of about $2 per 1,000 views. It's a rough estimate, and depends completely on the topic you post about, as well as the time of year (There are more advertisers in December than January, for holidays). 
[Something I've always wondered... if, after 5 seconds, I ""skip"" the pre-roll ad...do you still get paid for an ad impression, or do you get nothing and the advertiser pays nothing? I'll stop skipping ads on my favorite channels if they don't get paid for me skipping it. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chfa5cr?context=5)|If you skip, no $$ for the channel. I'm not sure if the advertiser still pays, but I don't believe they do. I always have the option of skipping ads, because frankly ads are annoying. Of course, there are other solutions to not having ads, but I still feel like the option to skip should be there for those who don't use these solutions. 
[The 5 second ""skip"" countdown can be disabled by the channel? Also, good to know, thanks. There are some youtubers out there that I really like and from now on I won't skip their prerolls! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chfacpi?context=5)|Yes, you can force the ad to play in its entirety. Probably would make more money doing so, but at the risk of losing viewers. I typically don't watch videos that force me to watch the whole ad. 30 seconds is a long time if you're only somewhat interested in the video. 
[But if you get no money from people skipping, and assuming just about everyone skips the video (since they're often 30+ seconds long, while skipping can be done after 7 or so\), that means you're showing people ads without getting money for it? Wouldn't it be better to have the ads be on (and non-skippable\) every once in a while?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chfi0on?context=5)|I suppose, though the only option YouTube shows is to allow skipping or to not allow skipping. 
[I can see that, considering the theme of your channel its harder to find a good network, its way easyer to find a good network in gaming market etc.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chfk0pk?context=5)|Well, there are dozens of networks out there, and plenty that are automotive based. But honestly they just want a 80/20 split and none can prove that they'll provide any real benefit. ""Higher CPM"" but none will guarantee it. ""More views"" but none guarantee it. You'll notice a lot of bigger channels move away from Networks, if they ever joined them in the first place.
[Thank you for the great channel and tutorials, it's awesome to see some fairly complex concepts explained in a thorough yet concise manner.  You have mentioned being a test engineer; could you please describe your role and general day to day activities? Would you recommend the avenue to engineering students who are leaving university, or is it a path that requires more experience to get into? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chf9i7z?context=5)|I think test engineering is probably one of the more exciting positions an engineer can have. I've only been in this position for 2 months, as I recently switched positions in my company. Day to day means applying various tests to the equipment I work with. Does it overheat under x conditions, can changing y variable improve efficiency, can said item handle z load, and what will the deflection be, etc. It's learning with physical objects, rather than purely simulation, which makes it interesting for me. I'd recommend it to any engineer.
 |Edit: word.
[That's really exciting to hear, I'm starting a 12 month internship as a design engineer this summer but my graduate paths are still very open to me and I'm not really sure what field to begin in.  Test engineering does look like good fun and very varied, thanks for the insight :\) ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chf9v0j?context=5)|Awesome, best of luck with your internship!
[Does youtube ad split pay the most or corporate sponsorships? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chf97l0?context=5)|Solely YouTube ads, at least right now.
[Would you rather take up sponsorships to control the ads and ad experience, or are just happy to have youtube deal with it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chf9iuj?context=5)|Well, one thing some people don't realize (though likely everyone here is better informed) is that ads are targeted to the viewer, not necessarily the channel itself (though this can happen to). Google will do a much better job of showing you things you want to see (and buy) then say an automotive sponsor. If I had my way, I'd live off of donations, and get rid of the ads, but I don't believe that would work.
[Have you considered giving Patreon a try for the donation thing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chfxif2?context=5)|I will have to check that out, I've never heard of it to be honest!
[ off, I love your videos! I've learned a ton from them...more then I ever imagined. I think most of my car knowledge comes from them. Oh, btw, I'm the guy who suggested the Aerodynamics videos-thanks so much for taking the time to make them!  Do you have any advice for me, academics-wise? (Like how much of my attention should be on school vs work/internships, and is Formula SAE worth my time? Like, a LOT of people do it...\)  I really want to get a job at a performance division (SRT, ///M, Nismo, etc.\) What types of jobs could lead to a career with them? Or is it not all that feasible/there are better alternatives?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chfah4k?context=5)|Very welcome for the Aero videos, thanks for the suggestion! On that topic, I'll have a video very soon on the Nismo GT3, explaining all of the aerodynamic bits on it. I think you'll really enjoy it, as it's probably more of what you were looking for (splitters, side skirts, dive planes, hood vents, naca ducts, etc..)  This is the best advice I can give regarding academics: [Link to www.howdoesacarwork.com](http://www.howdoesacarwork.com/p/should-i-become-mechanic-mechanical.htm) Also, you want a balance. Don't put all your focus on grades. Unfortunate as it may be, there are plenty of high GPA engineers out there looking for work. To set yourself apart, I think there are two critical things you have to portray to whoever is hiring: A. You can communicate well. Not just on engineering topics, basic conversation, be personable. B. Work on something related to your interests outside of work, and talk about it during interviews. Mine is YouTube, I bring it up in interviews every chance I get. People want to know you're passionate about what you study - having side projects shows this! FSAE is completely worth your time.   I don't have all the keys here unfortunately. It's challenging, which doesn't mean it's impossible. When I was in London with Nismo I met a 23 year old who had just joined their team as a race engineer. He had an internship with them, and went to school for motorsports engineering. Just don't stop trying is my best advice. People become complacent and this prevents them from moving forward. Maintain passion and you'll get there. My girlfriend and I are good examples. We work constantly towards our goals. I spent a recent three day weekend (which I get very few of in the professional world) completely working on YouTube videos.
[What would your dream job be if money wasn't a concern?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chf9o0j?context=5)|I'd probably own a race track, and do tests and comparison with today's vehicles, and also test different items and show whether or not they do what the claim to do. Ex: tire testing - which tires stop the fastest, hold the most lateral g's, have the lowest rolling resistance, last the longest, etc.. But with everything, not just tires. If someone wants to donate a couple billion to make this a reality, I'm in. 
[This would be great for my Potty Racers technique.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chfp1lf?context=5)|Always trying to improve my experience on the potty. I hate that word.
[How's the Youtube business working out for you? Some say it doesn't pay, some say they're gold.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chf9m0r?context=5)|It's not a simple get rich fast business, but it has steadily grown since I first created it. I do recommend making a channel to nearly everyone, as what's the worst that could happen? It's free! 
[*what's the worst that could happen?*  Ugh. So many bad ideas germinate with that phrase.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chfpzx1?context=5)|Haha, but seriously what is the worst that could happen when making a YouTube channel that goes unrecognized? Time wasted. But not really, you'll probably learn something from the experience. 
[So...who's the greatest engineer throughout all human history?  (no 'depends' allowed\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chf9loe?context=5)|Well, a couple obvious choices would be Newton or Tesla. But it's the 21st century, so what the hell. I'll say the greatest is Elon Musk, simply because of his ability to foreshadow a problem, think of an all encompassing solution, and actually follow through with the creation of his solutions. He's an incredibly inspiring man, and if you haven't yet watched the Bloomberg Risk Takers on him on Netflix, I highly recommend doing so. 
[Have you ever met any famous Youtuber, like in vidcon or any other places?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chf9ezz?context=5)|I have not attended VidCon, though I thought about it last year. I don't know how amped people would be at an event like this, for an educational channel. Never met any famous YouTubers, though I've messaged with EricTheCarGuy and Saabkyle04 a bit on their success and building their channels. 
[Just watched one of your vids, loved it! You won another subscriber! :D.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chfa51i?context=5)|Thanks for subscribing! It's looking like collaborations may start becoming more common. Here's a video I just did last month with Nismo's channel: [Link to www.youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qz4eDaC5vCc)
[My question is the following - have you ever thought of doing a mashup with other popular channels, like /Drive or Motor Trend (I haven't watched all your vids, excuse me if you already have!\), something like EpicMealTime did with Jay Leno? I think it'd be awesome!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chfa51i?context=5)|Collaborations can be challenging though. It's difficult to get someone's attention, and your channel has to be fairly successful for people to be willing to try it out. 
[Loved that video! Looks like binge-watching is in order :D.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chfapr2?context=5)|Thanks! Don't watch too much, some of them contain math and are absurdly boring. :)
[I love your videos! any plans for videos of yo working on your new car ? i love the theory videos but would love to see that too ! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chf8zwg?context=5)|Thanks! Glad you like the videos - I do have big plans for videos on my cars. I'll be starting with the Integra, as I feel it's a good place to start learning - don't want to break my new Subaru! My Integra is going to be the project car of my channel, with anything being a possibility - this video hasn't been uploaded yet, but will in the next few months. That's where I'll be taking suggestions for what to do to it. 
[Hey man, really enjoy the videos. Do you have any engineering qualifications or just a keen interest?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chf90fn?context=5)|I have a bachelors of science in mechanical engineering, from NC State University. I currently work as a test engineer. 
[Did you ever think the channel would get as big as it has, when you first started?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chfagz4?context=5)|Absolutely not. I just wanted something that I could put on a resume that shows I invest some of my free time in educating people. I think when I first started applying to jobs I had somewhere around 2,000 subscribers. It's awesome how well received its been, and so long as people continue to enjoy the videos, I'll continue to make them! 
[What are your plans for the sti? In your review video you make it kind of seem like no mods are in it's future...is this the truth?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chfbxor?context=5)|Though eventually I will modify it, it probably won't be soon unless a third party gets involved and wants to collaborate. I'm going to enjoy the warranty on the STI for now, and start messing around with the Integra (as a learning tool). I'm sure one day I'll get the itch, and have some fun with upgrading the STI. :)
[Hi, I'm currently studying mechanical engineering (study break for finals right now\) and I was wondering what sort of advise you have upcoming engineers, what helped you the most in order to get where you are now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chfh3j6?context=5)|If you haven't yet read this, I'd recommend it. [Link to www.howdoesacarwork.com](http://www.howdoesacarwork.com/p/should-i-become-mechanic-mechanical.html)
 |If you're about to hit the interview process, here's my advice (quoted from above) -
 |You want a balance. Don't put all your focus on grades. Unfortunate as it may be, there are plenty of high GPA engineers out there looking for work. To set yourself apart, I think there are two critical things you have to portray to whoever is hiring: A. You can communicate well. Not just on engineering topics, basic conversation, be personable.

People want to know you're passionate about what you study - having side projects shows this!
[Hi, I have a huge appreciation for your videos! They're very informative and well laid out. What inspired you to start making youtube videos?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chf95jh?context=5)|I wanted something other than a GPA to put on my resume, in hopes of one day getting a job. I can't say job searching is easy, but YouTube definitely helped me get a job! 
[Do you need a special account on youtube to get paided? Lets say i made a page today and uploaded 3 videos and got a million hits on each and a million followers. What would be the next step to start getting paid?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chfa3mh?context=5)|Not anymore. You used to have to be accepted into the partner program, ""back in my day."" Now anyone can monetize their videos I believe. So if your hypothetical situation worked out, you'd probably pocket a few thousand dollas. 
[If you could have gotten the EVO X instead of the STI, would you have taken it? You really seem to love the STI, so I'm guessing not.. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chfcqk9?context=5)|Considering they're both in the same price range, it was definitely an available option. I went with the STI for a few reasons.
 |Hatchback.
 |Six speed manual.
 |Subaru is doing well in the US. They have a solid reputation for reliability, and aren't going anywhere. Mitsubishi's not doing well in the US at all. (But mostly the first two reasons). 
[Im thinking (seriously\) about engineering studies. I do not know what to choose mechanical engineering or transport engineering. Do you know what is the difference between these two? (I LOVE cars and everything, that has an engine\). I would be thankful for your answer :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chfed9m?context=5)|Here's some advice I have to give: [Link to www.howdoesacarwork.com](http://www.howdoesacarwork.com/p/should-i-become-mechanic-mechanical.html)
 |Regarding mechanical vs transport - mechanical would be studying the engineering of any moving machines. Transport would be more similar to civil engineering - city planning for efficient routing, etc. 
[Do you watch car reviews channels on Youtube?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chf90fs?context=5)|Such as? I enjoy Motortrend, Nismo actually has a really cool channel (regardless of the fact that we've collaborated) - gets an in depth look at their racing programs, Red Bull, Go Pro, and... well... I watch my fair share of kitten vines. 
[Hey EE no question here just wanted to say you're awesome keep up the great work also can you squeeze in a video on how emergency brakes work? Also fuel pumps and why the liter per hour is important :D *username relevant to your new car ;\)* ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chf9356?context=5)|Hopefully one day! Loving my UEL headers!
[I appreciate if you cannot answer this, but how much money do you make? Every YouTube AMA this either never gets asked, or never gets answered. I'm curious.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chfq2j1?context=5)|The reason it never gets answered (I do believe it always gets asked haha) is because it's against YouTube's terms and conditions to disclose how much you make. It pays my rent is about as detailed as I'll get, and the very basic $2/thousand views. It certainly depends for every viewer, but if you go to socialblade.com it will provide estimates, and generally you'll be somewhere within the estimate (I'm closer to the lower side, than the higher side).
[Hmm interesting. Link to www.youtube.com was auto captioned ? AFAIK, auto captions don't show up when a video is loaded at the start unless someone hits on the Captions button. Hence was curious!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chfkwk7?context=5)|Ahh, I think you've found the only one that is not auto captioned. I didn't make them though, a subscriber did and simply sent me the file (very kind). There are a few others with captions in different languages, but the vast majority are just auto. 
[How much do you make?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chf916d?context=5)|See response to ""Donotscratchyoureyes""
[Hi Jason, can you do more diesel/truck videos? Perhaps you can talk about emissions control equipment, fuel systems, air brakes, suspension. Also do you like or have you ever owned any diesel engines? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chfkce7?context=5)|Diesels are awesome, wish they were more common stateside. More videos on the subject (as well as trucks) may be in the future - suggestions are always welcome so thanks. 
[How do clicker pens work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chfp1u3?context=5)|Too advanced, no idea.
[Who much is your rent?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chft4vu?context=5)|I live with my parents. 
[I was honestly hoping for this response.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chfpipw?context=5)|Excellent, because I was pretty nervous of the backlash. I certainly don't have all the answers. 
[So you make enough to pay your rent which is $00.00 per month.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chg61c8?context=5)|There may have been a small amount of sarcasm in my comment to which you replied.
[I have tried to help my friends at ""Donnie Does"" become big.  The response has been mixed but enough people have been asking for more videos that it has been growing.  My question is how do you manage your social and do you find that it makes a large difference to update social repeatedly to keep people engaged?  Also, Have you done any collaborations to help channel growth? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chfpto5?context=5)|Minimal collaborations, but hoping that this changes as my channel grows. My first collaboration with another channel (aside from displaying featured channels, I'm talking videos) was with Nismo, and these videos have just come out.
 |Regarding managing social media, I'm probably not the greatest. I just post things that interest me, as well as my videos on Facebook. It's more of a ""Oh I saw this thing on cars and thought it was cool, others might as well"" rather than ""I should update my social media page today.""
 |That said, I think there are much more effective and engaging methods, I just really can't find the time to manage it all.
[How did you grow a following off youtube? I know people always say put up qualitiy work and people will come.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chg9vh8?context=5)|Post consistent material, with consistent timing. Have a theme, and try not to vary much from it. If you want people to follow you, your channel has to have it's niche. Quality work is good, yes, but it's important to be consistent. I post a video every week on how cars work. It's one sentence that very predictably tells my audience what they're going to get, so if they like the topic, they may end up following.
[This doesn't have anything to do with the engineering portion of this AMA and probably should be posted in an ELI5 post, but I'm curious how having a youtube channel gets you money, is it the ads? Thanks! And congratulations on your success!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chfj9fq?context=5)|Yes, you can play ads before the videos, or have advertisements to the side of the videos. If people watch the video, or click on the ad, the video owner will receive ad revenue. 
[Hey dude, really appreciate your videos, they're what really sparked my interest as far as automotive engineering is concerned.  Was just wondering - were you ever involved in formula SAE, or any other student projects? If so - did you find them useful as a learning experience?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chfydnw?context=5)|I was not, but I do highly recommend doing it. You'll learn a ton, and employers like to see this kind of thing. It also gives you something to talk about, ownership-wise, in interviews. 
[Where did you go to school?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chfp4ge?context=5)|NCSU! Wolfpack!!
[Did you get to drive the GT-R? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chfpcuq?context=5)|No. :( But that's not to say it won't ever happen!
[What's the best careers advice you can give?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chfqyfz?context=5)|If you haven't yet read this, I'd recommend it.

[A little late to the party.  Just wanted to say that I really enjoy your videos!  If you see this, what do you think of the new Corvette?  I was considering an STI hatch (awesome choice, btw\), but decided I'd put up with my current car for a few more years and put the money towards a C7 next year.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25aec5/i_created_the_youtube_channel_engineering/chgu56o?context=5)|Definitely incredible cars, and awesome for the money. That said, I think it's pretty lame that GM upped the price by $2k simply because it was selling well, during the same model year. I made a quick video on it: [Link to www.youtube.com](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PnC6NZ0Hsk)

Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using. 

* Running newer games like Watch Dogs, Skyrim, Battlefield 4, etc at High/Ultra settings. Also running programs like Visual Studio 2012, VirtualBox, Photoshop &amp; Dreamweaver CS6, and generic web surfing.

* What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes? 

* $1500 max budget.

* When do you plan on building/buying the PC? 

* Three or four weeks from now. Once that first paycheck from my summer internship comes in.

* What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc) 

* Everything except for the OS. I'm starting from scratch and this is my first build. I'd like to have two 1080p monitors (21.5"" - 23"") and I don't really care about keyboard and mouse right now. One of those $20-$30 combos will do until I can spend some more money.

* Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location? 

* Virginia so unfortunately I'm not near any Microcenter locations.

* If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated. 

* Not reusing anything.

* Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU? 

* Overclocking is not something I'm interested in right away. Maybe a few years down the line.

* Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc) 

* I don't have access to ethernet so I'll need WiFi. 1TB hard drive will be fine and I'm on the fence about the SSD. Is it worth it?

* Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components? 

* I don't care much about the case. Preferably I'd like it to have a window if the budget allows for it. But otherwise I'd rather spend the money on the other parts.

* Do you need a copy of Windows 7 or 8.1 included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference for one or the other?  

* Still unsure if I'll be doing Windows 7 or 8.1, but I don't need either as I can get it for free through my school's engineering department.

* Extra info if required:

I've been doing some research here and there for a few months now but I'm really interested in what people here would suggest. I've been leaning towards an Intel processor (i5) and I don't really have a preference right now on AMD vs. Nvidia for the GPU. 8GB of RAM should be plenty I would think."

I have ~ 20K ~~saved up~~ invested in a money market account for the remaining semesters of college, plus an additional ~5K that I will make in a paid internship this summer (IT work), and finally ~1,500 for regular expenses. Mom and dad help me out by paying the mortgage/rent/whatever on a condo that is strictly in their name but they're letting me live in. I am single, able to say ""no"", live very frugally, and am also very sensible with money.

My goal is this: I want to get out of college debt free, which I think is *totally* doable. I also want to invest/save money early on, because the sooner you invest in, the more you get out.

For my internship in an IT-company they asked me to do some research regarding a Multilevel Puppetmaster setup. E.g. A puppetmaster that controls other PuppetMasters that control their respective nodes.

Now I've done some googling and found some interesting links that have done similar setups before. 
But most of them talk about scaling though(peermaster setup)

Even though I haven't graduated yet, the company that I did my internship with has gladly decided to hire me full time (I'm only left with that project anyway). The company itself is involved with mobile applications on both iOS and Android. 

My internship was very iOS intensive and I learnt a lot from it. I can now confidently say that I would not have a problem building simple to medium level applications in Objective C. 

When I told my team leader about my project idea and what platform I was building it on, he made his concerns about Android heard. He says that he strongly advises I stick to iOS because:

1. The framework itself is much more robust and developer friendly

2. Developers should spend more time fixing business problems rather then technical issues. According to him, going down the Android path means dealing with problems such as why X and Y can work on Device A and B, but it's broken on Device C while only works partially on Device D

3. I've already learnt quite a bit of Objective C, so doing the project on iOS would be a shortcut. (of course the team leader wants me to be the least distracted as possible) 

How valid are these points? I've always wanted to learn to code on Android, but these points are making me think twice. Am I setting myself up for a big headache? "

Starting June 1st I'll be starting my internship. It will last six months, until December.

I am a male, currently weigh 195 lbs, 6' 1"" height. My BMI is 25.7. So I am rather healthy, but I can use some weight loss and muscle gain. Last year my BMI was 23.7 and so I'm rather disappointed in myself.

I want to look fit, not just lose weight. If I were to spend 1 hour per day at the gym (focusing first on endurance, then strength), and assuming I work out and eat as I should, how realistic is it for me to have a six pack? 

Now I'm not hoping for a full-on ripped body, but just fit enough to where my abs can appear. 

Your thoughts are appreciated. Thank you

**TL;DR** I am a male, my BMI is 25.7 and I want to be fit enough to where I can see my abs, in a time frame of 6 months."

I apologize if there's a post like this already, I just didn't know what to search for.

So: my boyfriend of almost 3 years has an internship for the summer on the east coast and I'm in the midwest. I have been crying on and off almost every day, and when not crying I'm usually pretty down. He hasn't even left yet! How can I stop getting so upset in anticipation of him leaving and instead enjoy the time we have left (without thinking about him leaving the whole time I'm with him)?

I need to nip this in the bud now--it's been a problem since the beginning of our relationship (my first ever) when he'd go away on family vacations for a couple of weeks. I'm flying out to visit this summer for about 10 days and I really don't want to spend that whole time thinking about having to leave him again!

I really hope someone can help, I'm at my wit's end pretty much. Thanks in advance!"
25d01l,11,2014-05-12,Should I return to University?,[deleted],findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/25d01l/should_i_return_to_university/,"I'm a 21-year-old  3rd year student at University of Glasgow doing accounting and finance (Bachelors of Accountancy). I won't be progressing to honours and will be leaving with an ordinary degree. As far as I can tell, an ordinary degree will not be good enough for graduate-level schemes and jobs that require a degree usually ask for a minimum of 2.1 with honours. I was originally planning on graduating with a 2.1 and finding a training contract for professional accountancy exams to become a chartered accountant. I don't think my ordinary degree will count for much given that the large majority of students on my course graduate with honours. I don't want to continue with accountancy because if I can't achieve an honours degre in it, it's very unlikely I will enjoy/be able to get a professional accountancy qualification. I didn't really socialize with people at the university as my attendance was poor and my group of friends from school still live locally. I think I'm capable of getting a 2.1 with honours, I just failed in being motivated and taking it seriously.


I've enjoyed the finance courses and loved the financial analysis and statistical work. My original plan for university was to study maths or computer science but I changed this after I tried an accountancy course in high school which was new to me and I felt I was naturally good at it. In my free time I enjoy strategy/card games which require mathematics and logical reasoning. I find almost anything with probability or statistics interesting. I feel like I would be more suited doing a maths &amp; stats degree. Failing to graduate with an honours degree was a personal failure and I want to correct it. 


**TL;DR I'm leaving my accounting and finance course early with a poor degree and no longer want to be an accountant.**

**I want to work as a data analyst, preferably in the public sector**

I have a year before I can apply to university and so I will try to find a job or I will volunteer somewhere. My dilemma is whether or not to reapply to university.

Pros:

* Personal satisfaction of achieving a degree.
* Potential graduate-employment schemes.
* Would be able to make full use of internships, experience, extracurricular activities and other resources that I'm now aware of.
* Work during university and within university to build CV.
* Could enter a career that would take 4+ years to reach from entry level in another field.
* Opportunity to get more involved.
* Have a better understand of how the system works - what courses to take, what is required of students etc

Cons:

* Risk of failure, potentially wasting another 3 years.
* No guarantee I will be able to enter a career in analysis/statistics.
* I would be 22 (maybe 23) when I start the 4 year course. Don't like the idea of being in higher education until I'm 28.
* Not done maths in a long time, may not be cut out for the difficulty of the course.
* Very little programming experience.
* Lower income while at university.
* May not be closer to where I want to be compared to working 4 years.

Any advice on my situation would be greatly appreciated! Sorry for the rambling."

My situation is aptly described by the title: I'm getting a late start into my cs education. This year(my junior year) I took a cs intro course and loved it, proceeded to take data-structures the following semester and loved it also. Next year, my current plan is to take as many cs courses as I can probably manage (Fall 2, Spring 3). I'll be coming out of this with a minor.

So here's my question: what can I do this summer to get me ahead? An internship isn't an option as I've already committed to a non-cs internship. My options appear to be either work on a project or take coursera courses. Would anyone know what sort of project would be managable for a summer or which online courses are worth taking or even have other ideas for how to sharpen my cs skills over the summer?

Appreciated."

How can I break into a marketing career?,taicrunch,marketing,https://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/25dh93/ive_been_working_in_customer_service_for_years/,"A little about me: I'm 26, I've been work in a roadside assistance call center for a year now, and it's literally driving me crazy. I'm becoming depressed and I'm developing some sort of anxiety. But I'm not here to give you a sob story. I have a good idea what to do and where to go, I'm just asking for advice and pointers on how to get there.

Of course, my goal is to get into marketing. I'm leaning toward the digital marketing and design side of things, but there's nothing I'm not willing to learn.

I actually do have a degree in communications with a public relations specialization, and a minor in marketing. So at least I have something to go on! I've done a few relevant class projects: I've created a media relations kit for the Tennessee Emergency Communication Association, a public relations campaign for my university's Health Services department, a fictional ad campain for a Jimmy John's Restraunt that had just opened at the time, and a fictional public relations campain for a local nonprofit that provides underprivledged kids with food who may not eat over the weekend. I have a few of those things still saved somewhere on my computer. But is it okay to use school projects in a portfolio or resume? After I polish them up a bit, of course.

My only official internship I've had was at the University Recereation department at my school. While I enjoyed it and I would love to work at an athletic center in the future, I didn't really do much in my internship other than busywork. Making copies, shredding papers, front desk work, stuff like that. I made a kickass Homecoming 5K flyer once but unfortunately I don't have it.

Despite that, I do have a bit of volunteer experience with my local running club as the Public Relations and Sponsorship committee chair. What I'm doing right now is approaching local businesses for sponsorships for our annual 5K/10K race in June. Last year, which was also my first year doing it, I nearly doubled the amount of sponsorship dollars from the previous year, with this year going just as strong. I figured I could show off the race's T-shirt with the list of contributing businesses I gathered.

As miserable as I am at my current job, I'm actually great at it. Basically what I do is take inbound calls from insurance company and OEM warranty customers who may need a tow, jump start, flat tire change, or whatever. We take their information then we dispatch tow truck drivers in their area to get some help out. We're measured on average call time, call quality, and customer service scores, and I'm consistently one of the top performers on the highest performing team in the company. There just isn't much room for advancement other than to something like supervisor, which I don't have much interest in. Anything toward the corporate side, including marketing, would relocate me to Boston, which right now isn't feasible at all.

Before that, I was a lifeguard. It started off as something to do over the summer when I was in high school and I kept working my way through college. I did the typical lifeguard thing, taught swim lessons, and eventually made my way up to lifeguard instructor and trained the new kids. For swim lessons I carved out a bit of a niche for myself teaching kids with special needs and triathalon training for older adults. I loved it but it didn't pay the bills, and again there wasn't anything for advancement, and I had to take the call center job.

I've had 3 years retail experience at Kohl's, too. Typical retail sales associate part-time thing: stocking and cleaning up merchandise, customer service, checking them out at the register, pressuring people into getting the store credit card. 

Learning basic programming in my spare time whenever I have a chance. Looking at HTML, CSS, and JavaScript right now. I know my way around InDesign and I know enough about Photoshop to at least be able to manipulate pictures.

The last job opening I saw that I longed for was for a digital marketing coordinator at the Nashville Zoo. I never bothered applying because I figured I wasn't qualified, so now this is my main goal. What are some tools and resources I should be looking at to make me more marketable? I've been looking around this subreddit, and I still have access to a Lynda.com account that I've forgotten about until just now. I keep seeing suggestions for everyone to make a blog and market it. I've been wanting to start up a cooking and food blog, and I could market it on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Pinterest. Would that be appropriate?

I apologize for the wall of text, I'm just very excited.

**TL;DR I have a lot experience but not ""formal"" marketing. Looking for a nudge in the right direction, and how I can use what I already have to my advantage.**

I HOPE to be making around 75k-90k a year before tax (and if I somehow miraculously get into google, then around 100 ish). Of course I don't exactly know where I'll be and how much I'll be making after I graduate, but an obvious lucrative option for me is the bay area and/or San Jose. However, one of the things for me is that I need to live alone. No sharing apartments/rooms.  
Just as a muse, I decided to look up studio/single bedroom apartment prices, and got distraught because it seems like living alone in SF would leave very little money for* my kind of expensive hobby (anime figure collecting).  
How do people afford living alone in the area, and is it financially impossible to live alone comfortably for a newly employed person on average (I know starting software engineer salaries are on the higher end)?

25dm95,1,2014-05-12,Life as a Charity Intern,andiking,Charity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Charity/comments/25dm95/life_as_a_charity_intern/,"What do I, Steve Jobs, Steven Spielberg and Bill Gates all have in common? Although some of you probably believe the answer to be that we’re all geniuses, the response I was looking for is… once upon a time we were all interns! Yes, even some of our world’s greatest minds started their careers out as interns, in search of valuable experience and mentors in a specific field that ignited their passion. Seven months ago I set out on a similar quest with TEACH with the hope to gain valuable hands-on experience in international development and specifically –project management. From research assignments to menstrual cup training, time has flown by and here I am a month past my original return date to Canada. My time with TEACH has proved to be hugely mutually beneficial and as such the opportunity to stay on longer and start employment with them was an exciting and obvious answer for me to accept. Below you can read a personal reflection on my advice for any other interns out there (now that I am a seasoned veteran) as well as my top ten Moshi memories thus far.


**Advice FROM an Intern TO an Intern**

**Laugh at yourself:**
Other than the fact that life is too short, a little humility can go a long way. When interning abroad you are bound to find yourself in countless situations where the best option is really just to laugh. Not too long ago my colleague Goodie and I were doing some research on bee farming. Unfortunately the weather that day took a turn for the worse and we were stuck (for a number of hours) in a kind Mama’s cooking shelter waiting for the roads to become somewhat passible. Although this meant we had to cancel other meetings and engagements for the day it resulted in lots of laughs and some bonding time for me and my colleague.

**Have Confidence in your Skills:**
Many interns believe their newfound position leaves them at the bottom of the heap, destined to complete random duties to prove their worth till the end of their allotted time. The reality can be far from this if you choose to speak up and demonstrate your skills. Interns are fresh, hardworking and often have new and innovative ways to tackle issues. Get involved in the organization, explore work areas out of your immediate assignment and namely ask questions. In doing this I have had the opportunity to visit different project sites and take on tasks that weren’t originally in my job spec that have further advanced my overall understanding and skills.

**Enjoy those you work with:**
I can confidently say that I know more than just the job title of all my colleagues at TEACH. While some people are more private than others there is a professional way to get to know your colleagues beyond the standard hello in the morning and goodbye at night. My TEACH colleagues have not only proved to be my Tanzanian friends and family but also the people I come to for help and advice. The sharing of stories and experiences has taught me many things about the culture, my field of work and living a productive happy life here in Tanzania.

**Explore:**
Just coming off a long Easter weekend in Karatu, this adventure is fresh and prominent in my mind. Take the opportunities to explore the area, meet new people, try new food and see the beautiful country you work in. It is equally important to get comfortable and get to know your prominent area of work but time always goes quicker than you think. So pair up with friends or go solo, do hikes, have picnics, swim in any body of water you can and take it all in while it lasts!
 
**Top 10 Best Memories (in no particular order)**
-Any field/ research days with Goodie
-Thanksgiving potluck
-TEACH Staff end of year thank you at Haria
-Orphans Christmas Eve/Day
-New Year’s vacation in Lamu, Kenya
-Zanzibar Music Festival
-Friday night ‘TEACH House &amp; Friends Of’ get-togethers
-Lazy camping weekends at Lake Chala
-Conducting &amp; Finishing the BTC Baseline Study
-Sunsets at Railway

I am thrilled that lessons learned and experiences here with TEACH will continue to grow with my new position but am also confident that the hard and practical skills I have learned thus far will be transferable in future job endeavours. Whether you’re reading this because you have to (Hi Mom &amp; Dad!), are interested in becoming an intern at TEACH (email: ACT@teachafrica.org.uk) or just happened to stumble across it, I hope it sheds a bit of light on what a valuable experience an internship abroad can be.

As for right now, we have 10 cats and 1 dog. This number has been kept the same for around 2 years. 7 of my cats are older and 3 young ones.


Me and my mom are the ones that takes care of them, cleaning, feeding, medication, etc. My dad provides for all of us: my mom is a stay-home mom, I'm in college (4th year veterinary medicine) and my brother is going to college at a different city.


Things between my mom and dad haven't been great for years but they tolerate each other inside the house, until last year: my mom decided to leave the house and go live with her new boyfriend, not too far from where we lived. She would come home and help me with the house duty because I'm away during the whole day a couple days of the week to do internship at the hospital.


But now, she decided she is moving away to another city, leaving me and my dad on our house. I don't know how many of you have pets, but having 10 indoor cats and 1 dog (min pin but still), it is a LOT of cleaning. I'm no crazy OCD cleaner but I like a decent clean environment. Plus, I have now 100% of the house duties like cooking, dishes, washing clothes. My dad doesn't help, it's a pain to make him clean his own dish after he eats. I have talked to him about we surviving together without my mom and we would have to help each other, but talking haven't done much. I gave the idea of hiring a maid to help us but he doesn't want to, he is embarrassed of having 10 cats.


Well, and me, I've been dating my boyfriend for 4 years and we plan on getting married as soon as my school finishes (December of next year) and I'll be moving with him overseas, pursuing to continue my education (masters, doctorate, etc)


As for my cats: My mom's boyfriend doesn't like cats, my dad is unable to take care of them and I'll have to move out of his house some day.


My ideas: 

1) **Take the cats with me**. I don't know how much they would charge me to ship 10 cats on a 16 hours airplane trip, but I know it is a LOT, and I would have to take 1 or 2 at the same time only, demanding a lot of money that I do not have, since I'll be fresh out of college and newly married, and probably more broke than I already am since I'm going to have to pay for my school financing, AND I'll be moving in with my boyfriend that lives with his dad in a big house, until we have money saved to buy our own house. Btw I can't let my boyfriend pay for this. He is already going to have a lot of expenses when we move in together and he will support me until I find a job. He is saving almost all his money to buy a house for us.


2) **Donate the cats:** Well, my dad said he is going do that if I leave, but I refuse to let that happen. They're animals but they're everything to me. Some of them have been with me since I was a little girl and I just can't let that happen to them, I care about them more than anything, they're old and are going to start getting sick, no one is going to take old cats, which leads me to my option 3


3) **Don't leave**. Break up my relationship, do not pursue the continued education I have always dreamed of and find a job, work, pay for my financing while living with my dad. I'm willing to do this if there is no other option.


4) **Wait**. Well I can wait some more, ask if my boyfriend would wait some more until I find a job here, gather money to ship all of them with me while he buys a house for us. I don't think it's fair to him and it would probably lead to a break up, and I would be back to option 3.

**Orr**, if anyone has any other idea I would appreciate it so so much!

(sorry about my English, not my first language)

---   
**tl;dr**: Mom and dad separated, she left. There are 10 cats and 1 dog living with me and my dad and I have to move overseas. My dad cannot take care of them, neither my mom. What do I do?!"
25dplz,22,2014-05-12,Old Habits Die Hard,NOFAP_THROWAWEIGH,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/25dplz/old_habits_die_hard/,"I've been masturbating since maybe 4th grade (9 or 10 years old). I remember being very young, and touching myself until I started twitching uncontrollably, and it felt really good. I didn't fully understand what was happening - but I loved it. Soon after, I began to discover porn - my parents wouldn't really let me use the computer when I was young, except to write book reports for school. I wasn't too familiar with the internet at the time - but I discovered that if I typed in www.&lt;something here&gt;.com, I could put a link on my Word document that led me to that site. So I tried every female body part, or sex related thing I could think of. I tried boob.com, sex.com, you name it. Somehow - since the internet was not as developed at this point, I didn't find anything I wanted.

Eventually, I told my friends immediately about my discoveries. They told me about a site they've heard about that has what I'm looking for. Feverishly, during the next book report, I typed in their link, and lo and behold, I was introduced to the wonderful world of porn.

I felt so ashamed that I only let myself briefly glance at the pictures. There were so many words and categories that I was unfamiliar with. I clicked on the coolest-looking one that I could find; 'Hard Core'. I remember blurring my eyes as I looked at the pictures because I didn't want to see too much. I then exited Internet Explorer, finished my book report, and cried. I'm not sure now why I was crying. I probably didn't know then either. Maybe it was because I felt bad for the women, and I thought I was invading their privacy. Maybe it's because I knew I lost some innocence. Maybe I had a premonition that the rest of my life would be enormously impacted by that one little session. But soon, I wanted more. [Lactation, Lesbian, Anal, BBC, etc...](/nsfw) - To a boy at that age, these links meant nothing to me - so I started exploring. I clicked on each one - always a little frightened at what I might see. But I soon found my niche - I fell in love with [lesbian, and cunnilingus](/nsfw) porn. For a year or two, one site, and the daily video or two they would post would satisfy any desire I had. As I went through middle school, and puberty started working it's magic - my desires began to increase. I started fantasizing about the girls in my school. I remember this first time I actually ejaculated - I thought it was pee (I avoided any male porn with dicks in them, it made me sick) - and I wondered if any girls were into that.

As my fantasies grew in extravagance - so too did my addiction. I was older now, and the Internet was as well. By the time I was a freshman in high school, there was an enormous selection of porn available - and I had gotten into normal, hardcore pornography. Even worse, I had my own computer now. I could fap whenever I wanted to, in the privacy of my room. And fap I did. Throughout highschool my desires expanded exponentially. By the end of highschool, I had seen every type of porn, and it was all very old to me. I started getting in to weird things too. I went out of my way to find things that were taboo - [rape(not real), jailbait(I was &lt;18 at the time, so it's not too weird), violent porn, fisting, and](/nsfw) anything that made me feel guilty. I even tried [gay,scat,bestiality](/nsfw), but I didn't even enjoy it while I was watching it. I only watched it because I knew it was so wrong (not that there's anything wrong with that), and that it was messing with my mind. I was turned on by the extent of my addiction. 

And I was definitely aware that it was an addiction - I kept semi-trying to quit. Or rather, every time I would finish, I would say to myself ""That was the last one"". But it evidently was not. I also kept saying things like 'when I get a girlfriend, I can stop' or, 'Once this semester is over, I'll no longer be stressed out and I can stop'. Or, 'once school begins, I'll stop'. But I never did.

Then, I went to college. In my freshman year - this subreddit was made. I was one of the first people to lurk here - and that was the first time I made concentrated efforts to stop. I realized the extent of the damage I was doing to my body and mind. I realized that the reason for so many of my character flaws could by originated in this cancer of an addiction. In the next year, I had my longest streak of not fapping - nearly a month! It was refreshing and empowering. I felt a little bit more freed from my addictions, and I was disgusted by my previous behavior. But, old habits die hard. One relapse, and I was back to my old habits. I had forgotten about this sub. And continued on my journey into self destruction.

Here's where it gets worse. I'm going to be a Senior this coming Fall. In the past two years, the porn I've gotten in to is a lot worse. Desperate to get my fix, I moved on to weirder things. I started masturbating to [dead people. Yes, pictures of dead women. Something about it was *so* disgustingly taboo, that my addiction desired it. My facination with bestiality grew as well - the idea of a woman and an animal was appalling enough to enjoy. I crawled around on 4Chan, sometimes partaking in the CP that was posted. I also started searching all over for distension porn - and I developed a very strong desire for this obscure fetish. Overall, I just became entrenched in ](/nsfw) horrible porn. But that's not the worst part. Soon, watching women being subjected to whatever carnal whim I had was not enough. I continued to become desensetised by the porn I was seeing, and wanted to move onto something that not only looked like it had an effect on the people, but had an effect on me. 

I had always avoided for the most part, gay [as well as trap, sissy, shemale, etc...](/nsfw) porn. But I wanted to really destroy myself. I wanted to lose my own mind, by changing my sexuality. I started masturbating to porn like [Massive Cocks, Cross Dressers, Shemale, Cuckold, Pegging](/nsfw), anything that conditioned me to either be submissive, or desire the male form. I discovered captions [(Porn images with words written over them)](/nsfw), and soon after found [sissy captions](/nsfw), made to get the reader to become more and more interested in sex with a man. As my addictions grew, I started watching [CEI](/nsfw) vids. These are videos where a woman [talks to you, and then requires that you eat your own ejaculate. I realize how ridiculous this sounds.](/nsfw). I loved the idea that I was psychologically reprogramming myself. I also of course at this point now have a smartphone, so every night I can easily open up the entire universe of porn on my phone. This sometimes keeps me up until 3:00 in the morning, because it now can take me forever to find 'the right clip'. My school and social life has been suffering because of the lack of sleep, motivation and energy.

##~~                           ~~

I just ended my Junior year, and I have a very nice 9 to 5 internship lined up this summer. I'm afraid that my addiction to pornography will keep me up late, as well as sap my motivation and energy - and my work will suffer because of it. I also really hate what I've done with my mind, conditioning myself to only be turned on by extreme porn, and porn that doesn't match my sexuality. I want to stop, but I'm deathly afraid I'll never be able to. I've managed to be fairly successful academically - as well as landing a really high-paying internship - and I feel like if I can accomplish the amount that I have while bogged down debilitating addiction - I can do astounding things if I overcome it.

I don't know what I hope to accomplish by posting this. I've lurked here a lot - I know all the tricks - I know the benefits of quiting - I know the damage I'm doing. I just needed to write it out for all to see, I guess. I've tried quitting a million times. At this point, I feel as if there's no hope.

EDIT: I just read through this. I feel disgusting. I am disgusting. I didn't even mention the [incest](/porn) that I've gotten into as well. Not just fake stuff - the realer the better. The reason I wrote this is because this morning was the first day of my summer break - I start work in about two weeks. I spend about three hours this morning fapping. What a waste of time - not to mention I [finished on my face](/nsfw). Why the hell would anyone do that? It's disgusting and weird. I nearly threw up after. I hate what I make myself do. Also, I additionally spent maybe two hours last night fapping. My dick honestly hurts right now, because in the past 12 hours I've masturbated for maybe 5 of them. I need help. Reading this little report - it reminds me of something I'd read in a serial killers journal. Or Jeffery Dahmer's notebook. What the hell is wrong with me.

**TL:DR:** **Please read the whole thing. You can hit back and not read it, I realize this is pretty long, I wont be offended in the least. But I hope at least somebody reads this. I really need to get it off my chest.**

##~~

EDIT: Just over 24 hours in, and the cravings are really immense - mostly because I'm home alone and bored. But fate is now shaking her cruel fist at me - an attractive female friend recently partook in a nude protest, and posted a selection of pictures on facebook."
25dwpv,5,2014-05-12,How to negotiate a shorter work day? Any stories/experiences?,Mouse47,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/25dwpv/how_to_negotiate_a_shorter_work_day_any/,"I'm a CS/Math major graduating in December, and I'm starting my second internship in a week or so.  This company is a local company with ~50 people in a city with a fairly low cost of living, and as of right now they seem at least satisfied, if not impressed, with my work (been working remotely from school).  For the summer, I'm willing to work the standard 40hr work week, but once graduation rolls around I really, *really* want to reduce my work week to 5 6hr days, maybe 5 7hr days.

How do I go about doing this?  Having a shorter work day is something that is very high on my priority list, since I like to have plenty of down time to exercise and relax, and do things other than work.  I'm familiar with the research on software developer productivity in relation to hours worked, but the manager who's likely to negotiate the terms of my employment is about 45-50 yrs old and I'm not sure he will be open-minded enough to accept such an offer...  I'm even willing to take a pay cut if that's what it takes.

Am I delusional for thinking about trying this?  Will this hurt my prospects for raises/promotions in the future?  I'd like to hear stories from anyone who's managed to do this, as well..."
25dxr8,66,2014-05-12,Henry's Exposure Therapy - Patient Profile from The Three Lessons I Learned Pursuing A Career in Psychology,Human_Gravy,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/25dxr8/henrys_exposure_therapy_patient_profile_from_the/,"Link to previous story: [The Three Lessons I Learned Pursuing a Career in Psychology](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/252cnv/the_three_lessons_i_learned_pursuing_a_career_in/)

Users have asked for details about my therapy sessions with my old clients from the internship. I was hesitant to release details of my patients and their treatments but the therapists I console have shown a great deal of interest in my treatment methods. They only asked that I use different names for clients and not to reveal anything that will make them easily identifiable to avoid lawsuits and maintain professionalism. Otherwise, these writings can be considered case studies. 


In the comment section of my first post, I described an experience with a veteran returning from an overseas conflict. If you have already read this comment, you know how the story ends but I have included more details in this entry and gotten some help from fellow therapist with information the case to shine a light on what really happened, if that still interests you. Otherwise, I shall begin with “Henry”, my first client. 


Henry phoned into Dr. J’s office where I interned doing administrative work and scheduling appointments. Unfortunately, Dr. J was booked for the next two weeks and Henry’s request was for an appointment as soon as possible. The closest appointment I had was in a month’s time after Dr. J returned from a conference in Arizona. There was something in his voice that told me that he wasn’t being impatient but desperately needed help. My instincts are rarely ever wrong when it comes to matters of psychology so I invited him to the office after hours so that we could have a session. 


After getting ourselves settled into Dr. J’s office, I asked Henry the purpose of his visit. As I reached for my pen, Henry jumped across the table and grabbed my arm. The look in his eyes told me that was in panic. It was a result of being afraid of something. I asked him to release me as I was only going to grab a pen. He held on for a few moments before releasing his hand from mine and sitting back on his side of the couch. 


He seemed embarrassed but asked that I not write anything down of our sessions. He didn’t want to leave a paper trail behind of his visit to the therapist. That’s when he revealed to me that he was in the armed forces.  He didn’t want to use his insurance plan because it would be reported and noted on his permanent record. He’d never be considered for advancement again. I respected his wishes and told him we would discuss payment later. Always remember rule number three: Always discuss your salary before starting a job.


I was feeling hesitant before about scheduling the appointment but all that disappeared the moment Henry told me he was in the armed forces. Deep in my heart, I knew that I was doing my duty as a citizen of these United States and a psychologist to assist this young man in his time of need. We must always support our troops! 


The session lasted three hours before we finished. Getting Henry to speak about his problems was as difficult as pulling teeth on a patient with no anesthetic. Henry was guarded to the idea of discussing his service time overseas in combat. Most veterans of war do not like to speak about their experiences. It is understandable so instead we talked about his symptoms. He had extreme difficulty sleeping as he experienced flashbacks of his time in war during the night. The anxiety of awaiting an attack did not allow his mind to rest. Along with lack of sleep, this was causing a hypersensitivity disorder making him prone to emotional outbursts and bouts of rage. He was self-medicating with narcotics and alcohol to put himself to sleep.


As Henry spoke about his symptoms, I could see it in his face that he would be haunted for the rest of his life. Wartime calls for men and women to perform unspeakable acts of violence and horror to each other. It was a clear cut case of post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and drug addiction. What worried me the most was Henry’s admission of contemplating suicide then lifting his shirt to show me that he was currently armed. He slept with the gun under his pillow and felt unsafe if he didn’t have a weapon in arms reach at all times. It was shocking but I am not there to judge the man. I didn’t feel threatened by him.  He wanted my assistance, unlike the others I tried to help before. 


As my treatment options were limited, I believed that the best option of treatment was exposure therapy. Henry was a young man haunted by the demons of the past and he needed to confront them without facing any real danger. How do you send a man to war without putting him into danger? In a flash of brilliance, I prescribed Henry a form of exposure therapy that would be exactly what he needed. The young man did everything as I prescribed him, except for only one part that he did not follow.


To confront his demons, I had him watch the opening scene of the Allies soldiers storming Omaha Beach in “Saving Private Ryan”. To stimulate the parts of his mind still hurting from combat, he would need to turn it up as loudly as possible. The simulation of actual combat would allow him to relive those moments of war so he can come to terms with his fear. He would realize that he was safe and that his time on the front lines was finished. Henry would also need to have his gun nearby as it would serve as an anchor of safety to reality. It would serve as the protection his mind needed against the demons of war. 


In my original comment, I guessed about what happened after the point of where Henry began to watch the film. With some corroboration from the therapists at my facility, they have informed me that my guess was almost correct.  Henry suffered a flashback or re-experience scenario where his reality became storming Omaha Beach in World War Two. I was wrong that he discharged his weapon at the television screen in his delusional state. Instead, the neighbors called the police about a noise complaint because Henry was using a surround sound system with the volume extremely high. 


In the middle of the movie, the police pounded on the door in an attempt to get Henry’s attention and unfortunately, they did. In his delusional state, Henry must have believed that German combatants were attempting to break down his door. He surprised them when he opened the door and fired his weapon into their heads at point blank range. The officers never had a chance to react. More police were called to the scene as a result of the gun fire and there was a stand-off between Henry and the police. Henry took cover inside of his home and began to fire out the window. With no other options, the police fired back at Henry and he was killed in action. 


Finding out that this was the reason Henry did not return for our next session was heart-breaking but getting back to lesson number two that I’ve learned: You cannot blame yourself for client failures. And as to the one thing Henry did wrong, I don’t remember if I exactly mentioned it to him but I’m pretty sure that I told him to unload the bullets from his gun before he started the movie.

25e0tb,2,2014-05-12,Have it made. Want to die due to my shy personality.,throwaway198420__,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25e0tb/have_it_made_want_to_die_due_to_my_shy_personality/,"Seriously, some people would probably wonder why I would ever want to kill myself. I found the perfect girl, we're getting married this year. I just graduated from college with a 4-year degree. I have a family that loves me, friends, people say I'm ""attractive"", but I want to die. I've wanted to kill myself for a very long time now.  
 
I'm 29, just graduated with an IT-related degree after going back to college. I've always been extremely shy. Had friends throughout middle and high school, but I didn't talk much. I was picked on by the ""jocks""/older kids for being awkwardly shy. Most people just assumed I was gay. Even my friends and family did, whatever.  

Went to college, smoked a lot of pot with some new friends, eventually was just made fun of by them for being shy. 2nd year of college I moved in with a few friends from highschool. They would frequently throw house parties and I was so asocial I would stay in my room the entire night. Even pissing in bottles I would later throw away just so I wouldn't have to show my face if I had to use the bathroom or something. If I got hungry I would just starve until the party subsided. Basically I locked myself in my room for a year and played video games and smoked weed. I stopped going to class and eventually just failed out and moved back home with my parents for 4 years. I started thinking maybe I was schizophrenic.  

For the next four years I worked a full-time job while living at home. This is probably my loneliest point of my life as all of my friends had moved on. I would work, come home, smoke weed and play video games. I would occasionally go visit some of my old high school friends down in ""college town"" and during one party decided maybe it would be best if I tried moving back there out of my parent's house. I sure as hell wasn't accomplishing anything by living at home. 
So I started a new job, moved in with a friend (even though he and most others were now graduating soon). Really, I had just gotten sick of living with my parents and was embarrassed with myself for being such a loser. A year later, at 25, I met a girl and we really hit it off. I also finally lost my virginity at this time. We have so much in common so things are great there. I decided I didn't want to be a ""bum"" working minimum wage if I actually met an awesome girl to spend my life with so I decided to go back to college.  

The next four years are pretty good. We eventually moved in together, I proposed last year, I opened up a bit, but I'm still socially retarded. It's so hard for me to speak to people. This is really where all of my depression is coming from nowadays. I mean I hardly speak a word when I go to family functions. I sometimes, but rarely will get a wind where I actually am able to speak to people, but most of the time if I speak I fuck up sentences or questions when I go to ask them. It's hard for me to pay attention to people. You can speak directly to me and a lot of times I won't have a single clue what you just said. I have had an internship for the past year that I basically blew off. I was always too afraid to speak up and ask questions if I had them. I would sit at my desk for days/weeks before my boss would finally ask if I was alright with my current task and would eventually have to help me along. I could have been answering the help-desk line but was afraid to because I was afraid I wouldn't be able to answer the question/help the other person. It really showed too when I went to an interview for an IT related position the other week and couldn't answer a single help-desk related question because I basically had zero practice due to my shyness.   

I've seen a psychiatrist, I've tried probably 5 different anti-depressant/anti-anxienty drugs, but nothing really helps at all. I was diagnosed as having ADD/anxiety/depression, but my fiance seems to think I have aspergers as well, and I have to admit I do have just about every symptom. I really feel like I wasted my time getting a degree. I know that any big-person job I get I am just going to completely fail due to my inept ability to work with other people. I can't even see a Dr. right now cause I have no insurance. I was fired from my job 2 months ago after working there for 6 years. Basically got fed up with my boss and didn't do something he asked me to. My boss at my paid internship has graciously allowed me to continue working there for the next month since I don't have another job started yet. I think he just feels bad for me. I mean it's no secret I have been a horrible intern, but people always say I'm a ""nice young man"".. Okay maybe it's the old ladies that speak that line specifically.  

I don't know what I want to do with my life anymore. All I know is I do not want to work weekends/evenings/holidays anymore. I've been doing that the last 10 years and I hate it. My fiance and I like to keep our weekends free to go do things (it's really the only time I'm happy), even though we're broke right now from the upcoming wedding and honeymoon. I don't even care if my job is computer related. I do know I only look forward to coming home after work so I don't have to be near anyone anymore. When I am home I'm bored out of my mind thoughs and don't really enjoy doing much anymore. I really just feel like an empty shell. So much so that I don't care about the good things in my life anymore. I really am just a shell. I've never had much of a personality. I'm 29 now. I've had pleeeeennnty of time to try and fix my life, be more social, enjoy shit more, I don't see it getting much better in another 10 years. It's gotten to the point where I'm once again searching for suicide methods and have one picked out. My fiance knows I'm suicidal and now I'm thinking about calling off the wedding because I don't see the point anymore. No point in her trying to make a life with me if I'm eventually just going to kill myself anyways. Might as well start closing things up so I can get this shit done with for once.  

Sorry that this is so long... I know many people won't want to take the time to read something this long, but I really could go on and on. I'm just trying to get others to understand my situation and how asocial I truly am despite having several good things going for me.

25e7jb,1,2014-05-12,Applying to an MBA during my MD - Prosects,[deleted],MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/25e7jb/applying_to_an_mba_during_my_md_prosects/,"Hello r/MBA - I recently stumbled onto this subreddit, and I was hoping you guys could help me out with some  questions and by giving me an idea of what my prospects might be!


I graduated from a top 3 undergraduate university with a 3.65 GPA (magna cum laude) with a B.S.E. in Computer Science.    I'm currently a second-year student at a top 20 medical school (pass-fail, like most medical schools).  I didn't take any time off in between.


During undergrad, I spent a summer working for Google and another summer researching medical imaging techniques.


Presently, along with medical school, I intern part-time at a tech startup involved in community healthcare (currently unpaid), where I do a bit of everything, from organizing testing, to supervising data science projects, to heading up our push to get into international markets.  I also am involved in hospital operations research.  This summer I will be doing both (and will be paid for my startup internship as well as research).


I have not taken the GMAT yet (I will this summer), but I got a 36 (97th percentile) on my MCATs.  I usually test pretty well.


I plan to apply for the next round, and so, by the time I apply, I'll have spent 2 years (post-undergrad) in classes and 1 year interning in the hospital full time.  This is right after my third year of medical school (I am currently 24).  I plan to do my two years in B-school and then come back to medical school and finish that + residency.  Long term, I want to be involved with healthcare technology and/or startups.


My questions are as follows:


-- I'm worried about my lack of work experience - although I have had summer jobs and work part-time right now, by the time I apply I'll only have a year of ""work"", which is really me rotating through the hospital on various medical teams.  Is this something I should be concerned about?


-- Since I have a year to round out any corners in my application, do you have any suggestions?


--  Thoughts on applying now vs. after I have my MD/have finished residency?  I only want to apply now because I am more diverse (I'll have a lot less time for extracurriculars next year/during residency).

25e8qa,0,2014-05-12,Applying for an MBA during my MD - Prospects?,AnxiousMD,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/25e8qa/applying_for_an_mba_during_my_md_prospects/,"Hello r/MBA - I recently stumbled onto this subreddit, and I was hoping you guys could help me out with some questions and by giving me an idea of what my prospects might be!


I graduated from a top 3 undergraduate university with a 3.65 GPA (magna cum laude) with a B.S.E. in Computer Science. I'm currently a second-year student at a top 20 medical school (pass-fail, like most medical schools). I didn't take any time off in between.


During undergrad, I spent a summer working for Google and another summer researching medical imaging techniques.


Presently, along with medical school, I intern part-time at a tech startup involved in community healthcare (currently unpaid), where I do a bit of everything, from organizing testing, to supervising data science projects, to heading up our push to get into international markets. I also am involved in hospital operations research. This summer I will be doing both (and will be paid for my startup internship as well as research).


I have not taken the GMAT yet (I will this summer), but I got a 36 (97th percentile) on my MCATs. I usually test pretty well.


I plan to apply for the next round, and so, by the time I apply, I'll have spent 2 years (post-undergrad) in classes and 1 year interning in the hospital full time. This is right after my third year of medical school (I am currently 24). I plan to do my two years in B-school and then come back to medical school and finish that + residency. Long term, I want to be involved with healthcare technology and/or startups.


My questions are as follows:


- I'm worried about my lack of work experience - although I have had summer jobs and work part-time right now, by the time I apply I'll only have a year of ""work"", which is really me rotating through the hospital on various medical teams. Is this something I should be concerned about?


- Since I have a year to round out any corners in my application, do you have any suggestions?


- Thoughts on applying now vs. after I have my MD/have finished residency? I only want to apply now because I am more diverse (I'll have a lot less time for extracurriculars next year/during residency).


- What are my chances of getting into a top 5 MBA? I particularly want to go to Stanford (because of the proximity to Silicon Valley/focus on startup technology).


Thanks for the help!

25eekg,3,2014-05-12,I am a community college student who is about to transfer after 3 years to ucsd or uci for Computer Science.,evilraider13,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/25eekg/i_am_a_community_college_student_who_is_about_to/,"Hello everybody, Like the title says, I got into UCSD and UCI for computer science. I am deciding between the two. SO far I have interned for my mother's company for two years. She specializes in web development, mainly CMS (content management systems). 

At Sd, I would need three more years to graduate which would make it a total of 6 years for cs degree.
At UCI, i would need 2 more years to graduate which would make it a total of 5 years for cs degree 

Do companies care if i spent 6 years to attain a degree if i had internships and the college is ranked pretty high for computer science?

I also want to go to UCSD because i would get to move out and intern at other places and gain different experiences. If i went to UCI, then i would continue interning at my moms.

Thanks a lot for reading and for any inputs."
25egkt,47,2014-05-12,"Do's and Don'ts for bike shop customers, also former bike shop employee, AMA!",VITALY_CHERN0BYL,FixedGearBicycle,https://www.reddit.com/r/FixedGearBicycle/comments/25egkt/dos_and_donts_for_bike_shop_customers_also_former/,"**Introduction:**
Hello Internet, I am a former bicycle shop employee.  I have worked on and off at bike shops since high school.  I'd estimate that I have 7 or 8 total years of experience.  I have also raced mountain bikes for several years, worked as an intern for a major mountain bike publication, and worked as a freelance photographer for a couple smaller ones.   I am familiar will all sorts of bikes and disciplines of cycling, but I'd like to center the discussion around bike shop etiquette and fixed gear bikes.  

**Reason for This Post:**
It's no secret, bike shops do give preferential treatment to their favorite customers.  Said customers get discounts, fast turn-around on service and repairs, and will be greeted by their first name when they walk in the door.  
There are also plenty of customers who get referred to as ""that guy,"" as in, ""oh no, not that guy.""  Nobody wants to be ""that guy,""  he pays the list price for everything and gets told that he will have to wait 2 weeks or a month for his bike to be repaired.  
I want to give you a few pointers on how to fall into group-A.  Having a good relationship with a bike shop important for having a good experience as a cyclist.  
I also want to give you guys a chance to pick my brain and ask any bike, or bike shop related questions you might have. 

**DO'S &amp; DON'TS:**

* DO: pick a favorite shop, try and give most of your business to that shop.  It's perfectly fine to give business to competing shops if you need something your favorite shop doesn't have.

* DO: buy your bike from a bike shop if you are new to cycling.  It's tempting to save some cash buying used, or from the internet.  If you get a bike from a shop you will be sure you are getting a bike that fits.  Also most shops offer 30 or 90 days of free tune-ups and adjustments to your new bike, it's like having walk-in tech support.  There are loads of other perks.  

* DON'T: Buy *everything* from the internet.  My rule of thumb is ONLY buy things from the internet if you know EXACTLY what you need.  For instance, if you want to buy cycling shoes, it's really uncool to a shop to find out what brand/size you want, then buy them on PricePoint.com.  However, if you know exactly what tires you want and there is a discount on Nashbar, then go for it!

* DO have your bike serviced in the winter.  It's a little late for this tip, because right now is the busiest time of the year.  Typically in May-June shops run a 2-4 week backlog on service.  

* DON'T expect them to bump you to the front of the list.  2 week wait means 2 week wait.  ""That guy"" always whines about it.  Good customers DO get faster service, but they never have to ask for it.  

* DO clean your bike before you bring it for service.  This mostly applies to mountain bikers and triathletes (tri-racers pee on their bikes.)  Mechanics respect customers that care about their machines, and some shops will turn your bike away or charge a cleaning fee if it's caked in mud.

* DON'T ask for a discount on Labor.  Most shops are pretty firm about it because that's where a good chunk of their profit comes from.  If you want a discount, ask for a discount on parts.  They usually charge a high mark-up (100% profit is standard) and it only takes a minute to order a part from a catalog.  They are more likely to discount objects than time.  

* DO learn to work on things yourself.  You can learn to do just about anything on YouTube.  Knowing how to do this http://youtu.be/tP3uAy1YQpQ will save you $20 every time, and if you are interested, I can tell you how to do it without even taking your wheel off your bike!

* DO ask about the shop's return policy.  For example, most shops WILL NOT take a bike back after you have ridden it.  Most shops WILL take returns on saddles because it's hard to know if you'll like it until you try it.  They might even offer you a ""demo saddle""  to try for a week to see if you like it.  

* DO tip the employees.  I am not talking about money.  Tip with something they can share.  A 6-pack hoppy IPAs is great example, ask the manager first, but bike shops are usually pretty lenient about drinking on the job.  If they happen to have the lamest boss ever, naked goods like cookies or donuts work too.  It's a guaranteed way to score some points, and they will remember who their friends are when you need a discount or fast service.  

* DON'T act like you're shopping at K-Mart.  Remember, bike shops are usually mom&amp;pop operations and the policy is usually Employees first, Customers second.  Bike shop employees take pride in their job and tend to be jerks to customers who rub them the wrong way.  

* DO talk to employees who are into the same kind of riding you are.  Take a peek in the back and see if any of the employees rode a fixie to work that day.  Find out who he or she is.  That person will be more knowledgeable and more excited to nerd about fixies with you.  

* DO find a shop that deals with fixed gear bikes.  There are plenty of shops where employees know zilch about fixed gear bikes.  I hate to say it, but lots of employees are sort of prejudiced against them too.  It's a good idea to be up-front about it and ask if there is an employee there who rides fixed gear.  

* DO ask for a job!  If you are in college and looking for something to do part-time, it's way more fun than flipping burgers.  It's also an excellent way to make friends with other cyclists.  Right now is the time shops are looking for extra help, drop off a resume now!  Bike shops are picky about who they hire, but I can provide some tips on getting your foot in the door if you are interested.  

**AMA:**  
Go ahead, ask me anything!  **I'll am most helpful with:**

* mechanical advice

* cleaning/maintenance

* questions about dealing with bike shops

* applying a job at a shop

* gear/clothes/shoes

* should I get a steel, aluminum, ti, or carbon frame

* making your bike more comfortable/fit better

* choosing stuff like tires, handlebars, grips, bar tape, pedals, etc.

* will this part fit on this bike?  (I might ask for numbers)

**Not so interested in answering questions about:**

* is thing better than this other similar thing from a different brand?

* questions about non-fixed gear or single speed bikes (actually I'm glad to help, but send a note) 
 
* where can I get the best deal on this thing?

* what do you think of this bike I found on ebay or Craig's List (I might be willing to answer specific, informed questions about a used bike though)

That's about all I feel like typing right now.  Have at it!

25egsm,18,2014-05-12,I didn't cry when trying on new clothes today.,LemonyArtist,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/25egsm/i_didnt_cry_when_trying_on_new_clothes_today/,"Hello. 

I'm a fat 19F. I've spent most of my life hating myself and how I look. I yoyoed from 360 to 230 to 280 again. Now I'm at 270 with a light diet, but unfortunately have developed an eating disorder. I cant eat more than once a day without having horrific self hatred.

However, with my clothes on in certain outfits I feel like I look nice. I carry my weight well and my legs are muscular from sports as a kid plus walking several miles a week. My boyfriend lovingly insists he finds me ravishing and regularly kisses my belly when I feel glum. But in general, my clothes are old, ill fitting, and ratty. Not something a young starting business professional type person should were. (I'm considering myself an entrepreneur and an artist) 

Today, another plus size, older friend of mine took me clothes shopping. I had no idea what I was doing and she helped me pick out bright, workplace appropriate clothes that I felt pretty in. I sold my 3DS and pokemon X [ :( ] and had some money to play with. She took me to a thrift shop called 'one more chance plus' an d she helped me pick out cute business professional clothing since I had got a very awesome internship at a very notable art gallery in my city. And I got so many pretty things to wear. Two button ups (with no gaps on my boobs), light, flowy shirts, a perfectly cut to my size plum blazer, a black pencil skirt, a black a line dress and pearls. In total 8 or 9 garments that I can mix and match with my exisiting wardrobe to have a fun, business casual look that I so desperately want to achieve, all for about 100 dollars. 

And while trying on those clothes and looking in the middle, I hardly let my eyes linger on my stretch marks, or my floppy boobs in ill fitting bra (I know I'm not a DD, but I can't afford bras that fit), or my arms and the way they swelled.. instead, I saw how these cute outfits I thought girls like me couldn't wear, totally wearing it.

And I didn't cry in the dressing room for the first time in 3 years. "

Graduated last year with a B.Com in finance.
Trying to go the marketing route and get entry level marketing position like ""Marketing Coordinator"".

My experience so far is lacking. 3 month internship as SEO(mainly link building) for a website called wallstreetoasis. I did this to put anything on my resume. I wasn't into marketing back then.

Just recently I finished a 3 month account management internship overseas at JWT. I will be going back to Canada sometime before the end of the month.

I'm not really sure how to proceed at the moment as I'm finding job hunting to be incredibly tough.  I was wondering if anyone can provide insight on how I should proceed to start a career. I'm looking into temping as an option if I can land roles to start. Going to try to networking as much as I can as well. 

Any insights would be awesome.

Thanks!"
25emit,1,2014-05-12,Being a vegetarian is NOT a disability,Lobo_Marino,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/25emit/being_a_vegetarian_is_not_a_disability/,"Yes, being a vegetarian is my choice. Yes, I understand that there are some social sacrifices I will have to do with this decision. Yes, this limits my choices in restaurants and menus critically. I'm aware of this, and I continue to do so knowing this.

No, I will not push my beliefs on you. No, I don't expect people to make special accommodations for me over it. 

I work at an office with only about 13 people here. We recently hired this new secretary who has been a sweetheart since day one. She works hard, is funny, and tries her best to keep everyone happy. We couldn't ask for more.

Yet, this kinds of things do sort of strike a nerve sometimes. Today is the perfect example.

Our office (sans her) is a relatively ""healthy"" one. Nobody (but her) is obese whatsoever. We bring our own lunches, and when we eat out, you can tell the people don't lean towards the heaviest meal. I don't expect to see my coworkers at a Taco Bell any time soon, basically. 

So we hired a new intern, and we usually go to lunch to get to know them and so. Since today was a rainy day, we decide to stay in and eat here. She has the idea of ordering pizzas, and we're just like ""yeah sure, whatever"". So she starts ordering them, but then singles me out and goes ""What kind of pizza are you going to want to eat? Because you're the special one!""

This just fucking irks me. I appreciate the effort she is trying to do. If she didn't care, she would just order whatever, and I would not get to eat it. I understand she is trying to include me, and that's really nice of her to do that.

... but this is not a fucking disability! You're about to order a bunch of pizzas, and a cheese pizza is THAT out of the question? Or heck, you think I'm really the ONLY one who would eat a pizza with veggies? That everyone will just go for the meat lovers, or something?

So we sit down, she mentions what pizzas she got (obviously with a remark made about me when she mentions the vegetarian one). She puts down the meat lovers' one in the main table, thinking that it's going to be the most popular one, or something. Only one slice was taken from that one, and guess who took it?

Anyway, we eat, and everything is fine. Whatever. A bunch of pizza is left over, which is usually lunch/dinner for whoever wants it. 

So now I have to stay late at work, and I'm like ""yay! there's pizza left over!"" Guess which are the only pizzas that are already gone? -_- And I'm willing to be $100 that the meat lovers one and the pepperoni ones will spoil before anyone (but her) touches it again.

I don't want to bring this up at work because people are going to think that I'm ENTITLED to the non-meat food, or something. I don't want to try to ""educate her"" about like... Hey! Omnivores actually eat vegetables too, and people don't HAVE to HAVE meat on each of their dishes, unlike her. 

Again, I understand these preferences are on me, and this circumstances are more my fault than hers. It's just REALLY annoying when I run into her, and she goes ""I was thinking the other day of making a lasagna for the office, but then I remembered you don't eat meat, and I couldn't anymore."" Like... I guess sorry I foiled your plan, or something? ""Well... if you are set on ever making a lasagna, there are also cheese lasagnas..."", ""Oh, there are? I would've never thought about that!"" 

Jesus!

All I can do is slowly try to get her to see that our office eats relatively healthy, and she is more willing to please us if she goes 50/50 veggie, instead of 90/10 (like she is at the moment). The microwaveable meat she buys is slowly spoiling in the fridge/freezer, while people have taken on accident my veggie meals because they are more drawn to it than ""HUNGRY MAN"" boxes. 

tl;dr I'm hungry, and this fucking lettuce lovers ate all my food."

25eojv,1,2014-05-12,can i just rant for a second?,holy_shit_throw_away,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/25eojv/can_i_just_rant_for_a_second/,"

the story begins when I first started college.  I had everything figured out: I was going to be an engineering major, get by all my classes and land a great job making tons of money.  Here was what I ended up doing though.  One night I decided to switch over to Nursing as a major.  I wanted a career that would allow me to help people in the most positive ways possible.  I went in and talked to my adviser about changing majors and I was warned that nursing would be very competitive because you had to be accepted into the program in the beginning of your junior year after you had completed your prerequisite classes.  I decided I would do it.  I worked my ass off getting decent marks, A/B averages in the toughest of classes.  I was proud of myself and learning a lot.  Then the program changed, the prereq classes went from being things like anatomy, physiology, nutrition, microbiology and chemistry to things like english, sociology and other gen ed types of classes.  So what did that mean for me?  Competing for 1/100 open slots with 400 people who had worse marks than I did in the hard classes, but higher marks than me in the easy classes.  I didnt make it into the program and the only way for me to get in was to restart college.  yeah completely restart from ground zero.  

So what did I do next?  I changed my major over to psychology and graduated 6 months ago and now all my friends are starting families, buying houses and driving their new cars and I cant even afford to use my AC in 95 degree weather.

During college I had to work 30+ hours per week while taking classes full time in order to stay ahead of the debt.  I got an unofficial internship being a file monkey at the national archives but that ended when I graduated because I had to be a student to continue to work there.  I now make $10/hr putting grills together in the back of a big box hardware store while my $40,000 piece of paper goes to waste.

I have filled out countless applications.  I follow up, I call the HR offices and i never hear back.  I have had 3 job interviews this year which all ended up with getting emails saying they hired someone else.  I have a few friends who graduated with similar degrees saying telling me they filled out 6 applications and landed decent paying jobs.  When I ask how they got them its always the same thing, they knew someone.  These same people did not have to work during college so they had all the time in the world to network and do these internships that have helped so many people land employment.  I have the hardest time understanding how being a coffee getter and a photocopier for the supervisors for 3 months holds more weight than someone who worked their ass off for the duration of their college career.  

I probably have a bad attitude about this whole thing but at this point I am just frustrated with the whole process.  I will most likely end up living back at home in the next few months unless something miraculously turns up for me.  

For the past couple of months have shown little to no real emotion and carry a feeling of melancholia all the time.  I hide it the best I can, but when Im caught off guard I always get asked ""whats wrong?"" by the people who are close to me and I absolutely hate it because I can never answer without making myself look like a sad sack.  

its not even like my expectations are high at all for my desired job.  All I want is to be responsible for things more important than getting this guys grill put together on time.  

I try to explain my situation to my parents but its hard for them to understand.  Neither of them went to college, joined the air force directly after high school and were home owners within just a few years with more money than they knew what to do with.  


this was more of a rant than anything.   I know I am not alone in this shitty economy where only tech degrees are praised.  Anyone have any success stories or advice they can give me to help me with my life?"
25eqrh,1,2014-05-12,"I'm tired of not doing anything and I'm tired of being depressed. I really need some blunt, honest advice.",fk_sad,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/25eqrh/im_tired_of_not_doing_anything_and_im_tired_of/,"I don't know where to start... 

I'm a 17 year old introverted Indian kid living in America and a junior in a magnet High School. I live with my parents and brother (now that he's come back from college) in the suburbs. 

My typical day starts off with me waking up at 6:30, having my dad drive me to my school that's 40 minutes away, eating some goldfish crackers on the way there because I neglected to eat breakfast, sitting through hours of boring, repetitive lecture, taking the 40 minute commute back home by bus, getting home and browsing the internet/playing video games for basically the rest of the day until I sleep at like 2:00. Weekends aren't much different then what I do after I get home from school; I just fuck around the whole day until I promise myself I will do shit the next day. 

Basically I have two problems:
 
* I don't do anything productive in terms of bettering myself (sleeping earlier, exercising, hobbies, homework etc) which fucks me over in how I feel about myself. 

* I fucking hate myself because I don't have any willpower, motivation, or any particular reason to feel happy.

So basically this already seems like an /r/getdisciplined plea for help in accomplishing things, but it's not. 

I read all of the /r/getdisciplined posts. All of them. Everyday. Not all the time to the point where I'm browsing reddit all day just looking at the posts, but the point is, a lot. I've tried doing a lot of things highly suggested by them, but I always end up quitting after a few days of somewhat success from using them (for example: taking cold showers, using a timer to be productive)
and never come back to them.

In addition to this bullshit, I also get depressed like all the fucking time. I don't think it's manic depression, but whenever I have a bad day, I'll just be depressed for the rest of the day and I just wallow around feeling sorry for myself. I am constantly reminded and haunted of embarrassing and regrettable shit that has ever happened to me. Like for instance, I'll just remember about how in 7th grade I fucked myself over by trying out for the basketball team when I was absolute shit at it, even though it happened 4 years ago and isn't even relevant. It sucks. 

Along with the depression, I'm super fucking hypersensitive. Like if I'm talking face to face to a person and they insult me or something, that insult sticks to me like glue. But it might not even be an insult. It might be me fucking having my phone alarm (Do it Now by Mos Def which is REALLY FUCKING LOUD) blare in the middle of class and just having that embarrassment for like a week. I still can't listen to that song even now because I keep thinking about how uncomfortable and stupid I felt.  ALSO I think I might be ADD, but of course, taking an online ADD test isn't an actual diagnosis but still. I have an INCREDIBLY hard time focusing on doing homework or anything that requires mental effort unless I'm completely alone and away from everything (which is stupidly impractical and a really hard environment for me to find, considering I don't even have my driver's license and can't just drive somewhere secluded to do my homework), so my grades suffer. 

Also I get jealous a shit ton. Like I'm always jealous of my friends who have girlfriends. And also there's this one kid in my class who's pretty built who used to be the short, fat kid in middle school (who was also my friend and still kinda is). I remember I even jokingly called him chubby back then, but now the tables have turned because from being the sorta skinny kid in middle school, I've become overweight and he's become a fucking health nut. I get jealous because I see shit all around me and realize how I could have easily changed myself the same way (by getting a girlfriend, or getting a top-notch summer internship, getting ripped, and whatever the hell else) but I wasted my time jerking off the whole time. I have so much fucking regret about everything. The fact I'm kinda overweight now has also been a real reality check in how far I've let my laziness go. But everytime I convince myself to run for a day, I don't have the willpower to consist

Also, my parents hold the ""Asian standard"" of getting high grades and such. It doesn't help that my brother got #2 in his class when he graduated from high school, does a shit ton of volunteering, fundraisers, and other overachieving things. I haven't done shit to impress them. I'm a solid B student and the reason is because I neglect to do schoolwork even when I really try and I also am just straight up shit at remembering things so exams always fuck me over (especially the AP exams that are going on right now, fuck my fucking life). I don't have anything I can really write on a college application or a resume for that matter, so the prospect of going to college and whatever the hell else I need to do after high school scares me shitless.  

My social life is pretty shitty. I have like 1 close friend who was also cool about listening to the shit I've actually vented throughout this whole fucking block of text one time. The rest of my friends aren't really close with me. I'll talk to them about random shit but I never talk about serious real life stuff with them. I really wish I had a girlfriend to fill that void in me, but I don't. It sucks especially because I feel like such a fucking attention whore because I'm always yearning for people to notice me and to talk to me. Every facebook post or twitter post that doesn't get at least 20 likes really disappoints me (Which is stupid and shallow, I know). Like I want people to go out of their way and come talk to me, even though I know in my head that if I really want people to talk to me, I have to talk to them first. But being an introvert, small talk and idle chat are STUPIDLY FUCKING HARD for me. They ruin me. Therefore everyone who isn't an ""acquaintance"" or my close friend pretty much never talk to me. Including my teachers which sucks because I have to get teacher recommendations for college. Fuck.

I've been going to a therapist for the past couple weeks and telling her a few of the things I've mentioned here, but I'm also trying to appear as sane and polite as someone as internally fucked up as me can, which is why I can't bring myself to tell a complete stranger everything shitty about me. But at least on the internet I retain my anonymity (unless someone I know can figure out who I actually am in real life). 

Also, I'm an introvert and bubble all my thoughts in my head and can't ever express anything to anyone including my parents (except my close friend). So that's why I'm venting this all on a throwaway here. I try to tell my parents, but I feel like they would think I'm an absolute nutcase and be irreversibly changed about how they think of me if I told them the whole truth.

I'm sorry if reading this melodramatic 1st world problem bullshit made you want to rip your hair out. I know my grammar is shit and I use the word ""shit"" and ""fuck"" a lot, but writing the post resulted from a stream of my pretentious consciousness.  

Is it the hormones? Is it my pedantic teenage angst? Fuck, I don't know, I've just been feeling like shit for the last two years because of this.

I just want to find a long-term solution to my problems. "

How do big cats truly differ from our pets, besides size?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25d962/i_am_dr_alan_rabinowitz_one_of_the_worlds/chg0uyr?context=5)|This is a great question.  In truth, small cats are just like the big cats.  They show the same behaviors, the same emotions, and often the same kinds of vocalizations.  Anyone who has watched their pet cat cough up a hair ball, hide itself in some dark corner, or rub its body against a person's leg has, in fact, watched the same behaviors as those of a big cat in the wild.  I have seen tigers and jaguars do the same things.
[How do you feel about Savannah cats? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25d962/i_am_dr_alan_rabinowitz_one_of_the_worlds/chg1ls6?context=5)|What savannah cat species did you have in mind?
[I guess just the whole crossbreeding a wild cat with a domestic one. I have read that some people don't think it's a good thing. I personally think they are beautiful. Especially the bigger cats (F1.\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25d962/i_am_dr_alan_rabinowitz_one_of_the_worlds/chg1t0p?context=5)|Okay, I didn't understand your question.  I have no strong opinion about crossbreeding cats for pets except that people must understand that these animals have more wild instincts than just pure domestic animals and can be vicious, even dangerous at times.  It is not their fault.  Also, such cats do nothing to help the situation for wild cats.  If we are crossbreeding species that don't naturally crossbreed in the wild than we simply playing games with animal's lives for human pleasure.
[Have you ever chilled with a liger? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25d962/i_am_dr_alan_rabinowitz_one_of_the_worlds/chg0vt4?context=5)|I have seen one liger in captivity in my life.  Quite an impressive animal.  I can't say that I felt too ""chilled"" in its presence.  I have, however, chilled with tigers and jaguars, sitting very close to them and feeling their intense energy.
[What kinda big cat expert has only seen one liger? Use that status, bro!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25d962/i_am_dr_alan_rabinowitz_one_of_the_worlds/chg1ydn?context=5)|The kind that deals in the real world, bro.
[Yikes. I'm just saying the world is what you make it. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25d962/i_am_dr_alan_rabinowitz_one_of_the_worlds/chg216d?context=5)|You are right and perhaps I misunderstood what you were saying.  The world is indeed what we make it.  But if we put money and efforts into creating fantasy animals like the liger, we have that much less to save the few real tigers and lions that are still out there.  People who care like yourself could really be a strong force in helping change things.
[Of course, I can see that. It's important to make sure all big cats (and all endangered species\) have efforts being made to preserve their growth.  What are your thoughts on ligers, though? I know the likelihood of them existing at all is extremely small without human intervention and they can't reproduce on their own. Would you discourage lions and tigers being kept together in captivity to prevent their creation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25d962/i_am_dr_alan_rabinowitz_one_of_the_worlds/chg2hn1?context=5)|Good question.  No I wouldn't, no more than I would discourage humans who perhaps shouldn't breed with one another, from breeding and trying to have a good life.
[So I guess since tigers and lions exist naturally and can continue their own species in ideal environmental conditions and without human encroachment, they're slightly more important to protect than ligers, yes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25d962/i_am_dr_alan_rabinowitz_one_of_the_worlds/chg32xf?context=5)|That would be my take on it, yes.  You seem to love big cats.  
[I often hear zoos described as ""genetic arks"" for big cats and other charismatic species. Are zoos an important part of the strategy for protecting big cats? Is it at all possible to give a zoo lion or zoo leopard a fulfilling life? How hard is it for zoo cats to adapt if released from captivity?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25d962/i_am_dr_alan_rabinowitz_one_of_the_worlds/chg1168?context=5)|Most zoos are not good genetic arks.  The best genetic arks are those few facilities that are actually trying to harvest genetic material from large numbers of individuals of large numbers of species.  Zoos do little to protect big cats in the wild.  The animals in zoos cannot usually be reintroduced.  They are genetic dead ends.  Animals, like people, need to be taught how to hunt and take care of themselves.  It is not instinctive.  As to the question of whether or not a captive lion or leopard could live a fulfilling life, I am afraid I don't have a good answer for that.  I would ask a person whether they could lead a fulfilling life if they were under house arrest for their entire lives.  Perhaps some people could, while others, including myself could not.
[I have your National Geographic documentary on DVD. You talk about a bad cancer scare. How did experiencing what you figured was an expiration date at the time affect your work? Did you find yourself cramming as much in as possible?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25d962/i_am_dr_alan_rabinowitz_one_of_the_worlds/chg3sl0?context=5)|Yes.  I still have the cancer but it is slow and chronic.  What that means is that I just have to work faster and harder before my time is up.  If the cats can fight, so can I.
[At what weight can a really really fat house cat be considered a ""big cat""? Thank you.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25d962/i_am_dr_alan_rabinowitz_one_of_the_worlds/chg1ros?context=5)|A ""big cat"" is very broadly defined as a species averaging more than about 45 kg or almost 100 pounds.  I have never seen a house cat reach that size.
[You doing really great work.You have mentioned that animals saved you. May I know how? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25d962/i_am_dr_alan_rabinowitz_one_of_the_worlds/chg103z?context=5)|I am a stutterer and it was debilitating to me as a child.  I closed off from the world of humans at a young age and my only sanctity were my little pets at home that I could talk to at night, in the darkness of my closet.  For my entire childhood I thought I was broken because adults thought I was broken, even putting me into special classes for disturbed children.  But animals let me be me, they gave me a normal world.  To this day I feel more comfortable in the world of animals than the world of people.
[Great answer. What is one thing about wild cats that impress you. Any secret that very few people know about them that you know as well.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25d962/i_am_dr_alan_rabinowitz_one_of_the_worlds/chg2492?context=5)|They are incredible gentle and caring beasts with an indomitable spirit.
[Your description of the broad areas of importance sound not dissimilar from the type of work I can be involved in as a civil engineer.  What graduate programs can you speak on behalf of that would be highly recommended for continuing education, whether US or abroad?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25d962/i_am_dr_alan_rabinowitz_one_of_the_worlds/chg22sj?context=5)|You are right.  Your job as a civil engineer could indeed play a big role in helping save wild cats and wild places, given the right focus.  I am sorry that I cannot recommend any particular programs because my work keeps me mostly in the field.  I am not up to date on what is happening in the academic world as much as I used to be.  But there are numerous good schools and good programs in the US.  What I have seen among the best people I have worked with is that it is not the school that matters as much as the passion of the individual.
[Thanks for your very informative reply! I've read about the work of Lion Guardians and the seemingly successful projects aimed at tiger conservation in Nepal. Inspiring local communities to help protect the big cats seems to be hugely important. It also seems that key community members are the ones that need most investment. What techniques have you found that worked best for engaging those key community leaders?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25d962/i_am_dr_alan_rabinowitz_one_of_the_worlds/chg378e?context=5)|People asked to protect or live with wildlife, particularly potentially dangerous wildlife must see benefits to their own lives and that of their families if they are to be expected to do what is asked of them.  This is why people living with or protecting wildlife in key areas need to have special benefits such a better schools, scholarships for the kids, extra jobs as rangers or community patrol leaders, etc. - all of which are clearly linked to the continued survival of the animals.  
[What have been some of your favorite big cat stories? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25d962/i_am_dr_alan_rabinowitz_one_of_the_worlds/chg0tux?context=5)|Some of my favorite stories have been about the man-eating tigers and leopards and lions of Africa and India.  I wanted to know why these cats killed people and what happened to finally stop them.
[Thank you for your response. I think you're right - education about conservation is the key to protecting what we have. I know you have worked a lot with the Snow Leopards - do you feel like we have done enough to save such a beautiful animal? Also, in species that are facing certain extinction, are we as a human race taking measures to preserve their DNA in the eventuality that cloning techniques become viable? Is this the right thing to do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25d962/i_am_dr_alan_rabinowitz_one_of_the_worlds/chg31ex?context=5)|Panthera is launching a big snow leopard initiative.  The good news is that there are more than we thought because they occupy such vast remote areas where people don't live in large numbers.  Now that we are surveying more of these areas, we are finding more populations.  But the biggest range of habitat is in China which remains a challenge for conservation.  Regarding the DNA, you are right on target.  This is hugely valuable and there are a few projects and a few facilities trying to collect and store DNA of not only endangered species but all species.  I truly believe this is the right thing to do.  If humans cause the extinction of a species, why not try and bring the species back when we are able.
[Long time admirer of your work. I too was considered the dumb kid growing up and found solace in animals, and that appreciation has never left. I feel like I owe them something and I'd like to work in the field, be it conservation research or animal care.  I was an NIH-funded clinical research specialist w/ 13 yrs experience at UPenn and Pitt. The rug was pulled out from our industry when congress cut $2 billion in NIH research and I've had trouble finding regular work since, so now's as good a time as any to switch careers because I have literally nothing to lose in trying.  I'm a 36 yo fit and healthy Philadelphian, and will work for free since...well...I'm not making money consistently right now anyway. Any advice to get my foot in the door? Office work, field work, whatever... ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25d962/i_am_dr_alan_rabinowitz_one_of_the_worlds/chg227i?context=5)|I admire your tenacity and I also think someone should move towards what they are most passionate in life.  This is a tough road but I never met anyone who didn't get what they were after in my field if they continued to persevere.  If you can afford to do so, start volunteering or taking internships for any zoo or wildlife organization in your area.  Get to know people and make contacts.  Someone else who recognizes your passion will find a way to help you.
[This may be outside of your area of expertise, but I am wondering if you have any knowledge about the possibility that the mountain lion (a.k.a. catamount\) is returning to northern New England.  Sightings have been reported, but the state's Fish and Wildlife people believe that these sightings are lynx or bobcat, not mountain lions.  Are they secretive enough to remain unseen?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25d962/i_am_dr_alan_rabinowitz_one_of_the_worlds/chg2yke?context=5)|Yes, I am absolutely convinced that there have been and probably still are some mountain lions in northern New England.  Where I live, 60 miles, north of New York City, I have been shown tracks of what can only be mountain lion.  I know bobcat well and I have them on my property.  There have been enough good mountain lion sightings in my area by reputable people to convince me that they are likely re-colonizing from the west and midwest.  People often say, why haven't I seen one if they are here?  I ask them how many bobcat they have seen, which are here in good numbers.  Usually the answer is none.  Cats are very secretive and very capable of stealth.  There is enough good forest in the NE for them to remain mostly unseen.
[I'm amazed that mountain lions would have a range only 60 miles from NYC.  The sightings here in Vermont have been sporadic and, AFAIK, all unconfirmed so far.  I *have* seen a bobcat.  Once.  It didn't see me.  :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25d962/i_am_dr_alan_rabinowitz_one_of_the_worlds/chg3m2h?context=5)|We have a lot of green in this area.  In fact coyotes have made their way into Central Park in New York.  Cats have shown themselves to be amazingly resilient.
[How often are you recognized on the street by the general public now? Any interesting fan stories? Thanks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25d962/i_am_dr_alan_rabinowitz_one_of_the_worlds/chg2hxd?context=5)|I am only recognized by people who care about wildlife conservation and especially big cats.  Perhaps the most interesting fan story is that of a young woman musician who dedicated an album to me.
[Conservation obviously has many challenges, but what's something the average person (i.e. me\) can do to help out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25d962/i_am_dr_alan_rabinowitz_one_of_the_worlds/chg1gpk?context=5)|There is no average person.  If people as a whole truly pushed for politicians and legislation that created protected areas and protected endangered species more, than my job and that of others would be so much easier.  It is up to the children now.  People must truly understand that a world without wild animals is not a healthy, stable place for us.  When politicians or others say that we can't afford to have a cleaner, better environment they are part of the problem not part of the solution.
[Your picture book is a great way to introduce your work to kids! What have you found most rewarding about the process of writing and publishing a book for children? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25d962/i_am_dr_alan_rabinowitz_one_of_the_worlds/chg3nkr?context=5)|Writing for children has been the most difficult writing I have ever done because I had to go back to the sad, broken boy I once was.  However, it was also inspiring and rewarding because I could speak with complete openness and honesty - no masks, no barriers.  You speak with children the way we forget to speak as adults.
[How have your experiences working with big cats influenced your picture book, A Boy and a Jaguar?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25d962/i_am_dr_alan_rabinowitz_one_of_the_worlds/chg25h2?context=5)|A Boy and A Jaguar is an autobiography.  So everything in that book, and much more actually, happened to me.  The stories I have about being with big cats are endless.  I find comfort in their world, and I find meaning in helping save them.
[I didn't get it when you said world won't be healthy if there are no wild animals. can you explain.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25d962/i_am_dr_alan_rabinowitz_one_of_the_worlds/chg2cbr?context=5)|The forest and the wildlife that inhabits it are the equivalent of computer firewalls for the human world.  Most of the emerging or re-emerging diseases that we are now dealing with (ebola, sars, west nile, lymes, etc.) are zooinotic, that means they have an animal host.  These are not new diseases, they have been around a very long time.  But what has kept them and other diseases from sweeping across the human landscape has been healthy forests and healthy wildlife populations.  If big predators like cats are wiped out, and smaller animals like deer, civet, rodents or others get out of control, that contributes to the spread of disease.
[Pantera rules!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25d962/i_am_dr_alan_rabinowitz_one_of_the_worlds/chg20q4?context=5)|I guess they do.  I hear their music is good.  But Panthera rules also.  I hope that is what you meant.

All I know is that it is supposed to be research based, so I'm curious what research in cyber engineering entails."
25ex4e,10,2014-05-12,"I'm dropping out of college to go to Silicon Valley, and I'm worried.",mostuncertain,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/25ex4e/im_dropping_out_of_college_to_go_to_silicon/,"**TL;DR** I'm paying my own way through college, but my wealthy father's income increased, and now I will get no financial aid and have to drop out of this unaffordable Ivy League university. Interning for a great tech company this summer, and taking a ""year off"" to work hard and see what happens. I'm mostly worried about the change in opportunities not having a degree will cause for grad school and future employment and doing what I love.
____
My ultraconservative parents disowned me during my last year of high school -- from then on, I would live on my own and receive no financial support from them.

I was working a research-heavy programming job at a big company that payed $12/hr, so I loosened up focus on my already-pointless senior year of high school and worked long hours -- I was going to a fancy Ivy League university in the fall. My financial aid was based on my parent's income, which was high, so I needed to come up with about $20,000 to pay for my first year of school. No matter -- I worked longer hours and freelanced in my free time, took out federal loans (I have no one to cosign private loans for me), and I came up with the money for my first year of school. $20,000/year for a top-notch education is reasonable. I figured I would just intern over summers and work on the side and come up with the money every year after. I even won scholarships. It would all work out.

My father's already-six-figure income doubled this year, according to the financial aid office. I am no longer eligible to receive financial aid (I haven't received the final numbers yet, but it's ugly -- I would have to come up with at least $40,000 by the best-case estimates). 

The financial aid office still refuses to consider me an independent student, despite living alone, paying for school on my own, filing taxes as an independent, and so on. I won scholarships, but my university doesn't use them to lower expected contributions out-of-pocket payments remain the same. I live a more frugal and responsible life than many of the ""adults"" I know -- not out of a sense of elitism, but out of necessity. But no, I would not be considered independent for institutional need-based aid, and I could not appeal that decision.

I had a similar scare towards the end of last semester -- I wasn't sure if I'd be able to pay for my Spring Semester. It took a toll on my studies. I barely scraped by with the cash after freelancing another project and working over winter break. But here I am in finals week again, and I feel the same mix of dread and apathy. I don't know if I'll be back here next semester -- how can I study a damn thing? I haven't turned in a single problem set for some of my classes all month. It's impossible to think about meeting four-year major requirements when the numbers say I can't come back in the fall. I simply cannot afford it.

Starting next week, I'll be interning at a pretty amazing tech company in Silicon Valley. The hours are long, the work is challenging, and the pay and perks are amazing (I might make about $15,000 after the obscene costs of living are factored in). This will be an amazing summer.

My plan for the fall is to take a year off -- not to study abroad, but to work at more tech companies in California, simply because I can't afford to come back here without financial aid. My student advisor said listing ""stress"" as the reason would allow me to take a year of medical leave, which would make coming back an easier process (I wouldn't lose on-campus housing, for example).

I told a few of my closest friends, and they're sad I'm leaving, but ultimately excited for me. To them, this is the romanticized story of Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Zuckerberg. Instagram, Snapchat, WhatsApp, Tumblr, all worth at least a capital-B Billion dollars. Anyone with an idea can raise capital. We've all seen The Social Network.

What they haven't seen is the other 999,999/1,000,000. The people paying $1,000+ a month to sleep on a couch or mattress in a room with all the other soon-to-be-billionaires, coding in relative poverty.

I'm not afraid of being homeless, because for a short while last year, I was. I'm not afraid of living poorly, because I've already had to for months before college. I ate ramen, corn dogs, rice, beans, whatever had calories in it and kept me from starving while I saved up for college. Come fall, I'll probably have another well-paying internship at another fancy tech company. I don't think I'll be broke again, but if I am, I can deal with it. I've deal with worse for longer.

I am afraid of not being welcomed back into academia later on. I've always wanted to go to grad school and just become a researcher. I can't be a scientist having dropped out of college. I may take up side research at Stanford during my ""year off"" or transfer somewhere more affordable, or just officially drop out and work full-time for a company after the year off. Is that even possible without an undergraduate degree? Grad school certainly isn't, even with the right research and work.

The uncertainty of what comes next isn't new, but it still worries me. I'm confident in my skills and my persistence that have gotten me this far, but I'm worried about losing out on the experiences and opportunities of the next three years here (and potentially at grad school). I am mostly self-taught (again out of necessity), but there's so much more to college than the courses.

I'm aware of the opportunity in the tech industry right now, and I'm going to work hard, but I'm worried about not having the stupid credentials. I just don't know what's going to happen.

(Also, I don't mean to sound entitled or elitist or anything throughout all this. I understand I'm in a privileged position just by being here right now, and no one is entitled to a fancy education... I suppose I just misinterpreted the whole ""meeting 100% of your financial need"" bit.)"
25f3g8,2,2014-05-12,Feeling so frustratingly stuck; the next forward step seems as close as rock bottom does. Please help.,serotinelle,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/25f3g8/feeling_so_frustratingly_stuck_the_next_forward/,"(Hoping this is the best place for this, but please direct me elsewhere if you can think of something better.)

I am at a weird point in my life. I'm in my mid 20s, moved back home after attending school in another state for three years, have one more credit to go before completing my degree (which I was supposed to officially have done two years ago, oops). I was going to take a class online to finish that out, but that fall ended up being a dark place for me, and I ended up dropping the class the last day of class (after not completing enough work and wasting all of my money, of course). So, that college credit, and then obvious going to college at all means student loans, et cetera…all that stuff have been stressors, and straining my relationships with my parents on top of that.

(I had several health complications pop up while in college (seizures, after which came a diagnosis of and treatment for epilepsy [though I was un-diagnosed 3 years later; that still meant 3 years of unnecessarily being on a strong neuroleptic], and then narcolepsy my senior year) on top of the ebb-and-flow of dealing with depression/anxiety-related issues, as I have for the vast majority of my life. Had some other very serious personal issues pop up my senior year, and on top of me overworking myself {over the course of my 3 years, I completed 4 internships, held an on-campus job the whole time I was in school, and was president of my major's on-campus student chapter} and being burned out, all of these things culminated together to cause my grades to slowly plummet, which is why I was in that tenuous situation academically to begin with.) 

When I originally came back home a year and a half ago, I was applying to jobs with fervor, went on one interview, but the longer things kept not happening for me the deeper I sunk at that time. I started doing some minor housecleaning to bring in a little money, and I'd had the good sense to look into volunteer opportunities alongside the jobs I was applying for, so I was getting out of the house a lot and being able to look outside myself and my problems until I (hoped) things would blow over and look more in my favor.

That didn't happen, and I spent the next several months trying to get my health back on track. Meds, therapist, blah blah blah, and once I felt like I'd ""solved that problem"" (as if compartmentalization or a laser-like focus on your health ever really works out to begin with), and then it was six more months of me not employed and not a college graduate. I'd lost that (however naive) sense of confidence I had at the beginning of my job search, and even though I feel like I'm in a way-better place, it's basically been a year and a half since I've applied for any jobs relating to my career, I still cannot technically say I have a college degree since I'm one credit away, and working on other career-relevant items I need…they've all just gone by the wayside. All of these things, I haven't touched in so long, and another day just turns into another week and so on.

So, finically for a year and a half it's been getting money together piecemeal. One of the volunteer opportunities (with a young special needs child) ended up turning into a little bit of babysitting then something more with her family, and I'm providing care services for her for usually no more than 15 hours a week for the last several months. I'm feeling so burned out of the little amount I do work, because I'm at a point where it's hard to keep giving yourself to others when you feel like you've got so little left to give. This is not what I went to school for, and even though I love her and her family, I need to start my career and I need a real job. (So, there's some additional anxiety about that, too; this family, who have enough struggles of their own, see me as a ""godsend"" and often remind me how much I mean to them, so the more I think about how much I really need to stop doing that job the guiltier I feel. I don't know, aaa. Anyways.)

I know this is quite rambling and vent-y, but I just needed to start somewhere, and put it all down in one place. There are a lot of other little pieces that make up my puzzle, but I think I covered most of it. I just feel stuck. I feel like I'm at a crossroads, where a lot of things are moving in some direction that I'm unaware of, but moving nonetheless, but I want to move faster. I feel like a failure, but I still have bouts of hopefulness, and this itching restlessness is getting to a point where I have to do something about it. But, yes, stuck…that sums it up. I don't know how to un-muck myself; even if I see glimpses of it here and there, nothing seems to stick.

I'll finish there, but thank you for taking the time to read, and I appreciate in advance any advice or words of kindness you might have."
25f3yl,7,2014-05-12,My Boyfriend [21/M] of 2 years just broke up with me [25/f]. Completely confused.,punkinkat,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/25f3yl/my_boyfriend_21m_of_2_years_just_broke_up_with_me/,"We started out as a long distance couple after meeting during an internship program.  Over a year ago, he moved to be with me.  We've always talked about a forever.

He is four years younger than I am, so he's always been up front with me that he wants to marry me, but not yet.  I've always understood because of our age difference. We've talked about when we get married, some day having kids, moving closer to our families together. We've planned a future.

This past week he started becoming a little distant, and when we finally sat down and talked about it, he said he just can't see being with me forever, and he needs a break to figure himself out.  

At this point I'm just confused as to what happened.  He says he still loves me, and still cares about me, it's just that as of right now, he can't see us being together.  At first I had hope that this is just a fluke of sorts, and in a couple of weeks he'd be fine.  We'd be fine.  Now (it's only been a day, but I have obviously thought through everything. twice) I just think he's just done with me completely. 

I've realized that space is what we need at this point, but we still live together and he keeps treating me like nothing happened.  (Bringing ice cream home for me, browsing reddit with me, etc.) He's in the process of moving out but seems to be dragging his feet.

Is there anything I could or should be doing? I want him back more than anything.  He's my best friend, and the love of my life.

I have an internship in Atlanta this summer and I'm looking for a place to live from this Friday until mid August. I'm pretty flexible about the last part if you need your place back. I want to live somewhere near the campus of Georgia Tech which is why I'm posting here. 


I've had 2 different subleases fall through and I'm kind of at my wits end. I'll be at work 9-5 and probably out of town most weekends. I study electrical engineering at Florida State University so I can understand the importance of studying if you require peace and quiet. 

Let me know if you personally have a place you're looking sublease and hopefully we can work something out.

25f6th,11,2014-05-12,"I need to vent. I’m a frustrated IT security job seeker. Sorry, long post...",mnwild1985,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/25f6th/i_need_to_vent_im_a_frustrated_it_security_job/,"I need to vent. To be frank, I have good job. It pays decently, has good benefits and I like the organization I work for. However, it's become a dead end job. My current job as well as my last serious job never got me completely into security where I want to go. I left my previous job to come to my current job where I was promised a role in the security team they were working on building. That team was awesome. When I was on that team I was happy and loving my job. 

Apparently, management’s spending priorities changed. Instead of a dedicated security team, we now have one dedicated security person, IT (but it’s not their priority) and a new director that doesn’t care about security because we aren’t “producing money”. Despite countless discussions on the values security provides, they don’t want to spend money to help mitigate dangerously sever risks posed to the organization. It’s their decision to make but they won’t be able to get by much longer without serious issues. 

The one security guy is awesome but he’s gone through the phases. Initially he was very excited to still be a part of security and wanted to make a difference. He quickly came to realize the work was really all on him so he became very stressed and regularly worked 60+ hour weeks trying to get everything done. That lasted about 2 months. He was desperately trying to get help but management wouldn’t approve bringing me or anyone else back. We both saw management not caring. They continually expected him to get more and more done than he ever could and kept adding to his workload. He worked a couple 80 hour weeks and then he was just done. He’s still great, and he works hard when he’s here but he stops working after 40 hours now and doesn’t check back in until next week. That’s been the case for about a year now. Every now and then he gets yelled at because he's not getting enough done but he doesn’t really care anymore. He’s looking for work as well. 

Several managers and other people that are at least somewhat aware that I’m looking for a new job keep telling me things are in the works. I pretend to be happy and excited that things will work out but after saying that for a year, I don’t expect that to pan out. I’ve been actively looking for new job for a couple months and passively asking around and networking for several months prior to that. 

I don’t have enough direct experience to get into the entry level security roles I can find but I’m over qualified for intern roles. I have a BA in Information Security, 5 certifications Security+, CHFI, CISSP, GSEC, OSCP and I’m studying for web app pentesting now because I don’t know what else to do and that’s what I enjoy most. 

My options seem to be to leave out huge portions of my qualifications to appear more “qualified” for intern roles. This is what I’m currently looking at. Or embellishing my qualifications and hoping that I can make up the difference in experience before I get fired/laid off. 

My last several interviews have boiled down to them wanting a super Linux security admin, firewall configuration expert, Incident Response, Pentester for either network or web and SIEM. I have some experience with all of that to the point that I’d almost be confident in picking up a couple of the roles and running with them. The people hiring disagreed. Plus they’re probably able to find someone that has more direct experience than me. So I was disappointed but I understood.  The most recent was a security internship that generally gears candidates for web pentesting. I was practically drooling when I found this role. I thought I would be perfect for this. As aside from vulnerability assessments my closest actual pentesting experience was the OSCP and I really love pentesting.  I love learning and I’d be more than happy to learn everything as an intern knowing that I’d have a place in a pentesting role.

After about 10 hours’ worth of interviews and assessments, they decided that I was overqualified for the internship role. They thought that I would get bored and want to move on. There’s some truth there but I’d of been happy. I’d likely hit things I already knew. However, I think I’d learn a lot too. I’m bored at my current job but I still work my ass off and smile at a job that I’m starting to hate. I only want to leave because I want a job in security. I explained this but they had already made up their mind. Not wanting to let this die, and since I was “overqualified” for the intern role, I asked about their open pentesting role. I was told I was under qualified for. To their credit they did point me to resources to study and asked to follow up at a later date on my progress. 

When I went back to college to get my BA, I went because I wanted to get into security and I didn’t have the experience. I thought that by getting a degree and some certs that I could get into a career in security. I certainly know a lot more than I did then and I’m able to actually get interviews now. However, now instead of just under qualified, I can now be over and under qualified at the same time. 

Thanks for reading, I know it was long. I feel better putting this out even if it doesn’t change my situation. I’ll be doing the only thing I can think to do….have a few more drinks and hack things. /cheers"
25f8eu,1,2014-05-13,What should a scholarship college student do to put himself in the best financial position?,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/25f8eu/what_should_a_scholarship_college_student_do_to/,"Hi y'all. Firstly, thanks for reading this and responding.

I am a 17 year old young man (about to turn 18), and I want to make a plan for improving my finances. To summarize my situation:

* I'm going to a top-level school in the U.S. (I'm also a U.S. citizen).
* I have two scholarships from private institutions that, combined with my school's financial aid package, covers all costs of attendance (tuition, room &amp; board, travel, books, and incidental costs).
* I have just over $2800 in a CD that matures next month.
* I have a little over $2100 in a checking account.
* I have invested in a stock that I put $1000 in and is currently worth about $500. It does not make interest or dividends. I've held this stock for about 3 years.
* I have invested in a mutual fund that was worth $6900 and is currently worth $6400. This fund gives a yearly dividend averaging about $1000 in December. I'm not reinvesting the dividends (they are the in CD). I've also held this investment for 3 years.

Now, I need to explain my scholarships. They will cover everything my school puts on the bill, and I will likely be provided a stipend from each. I don't have confirmation of it yet, but I know for certain that a stipend from one scholarship can reach $6250 per year. The other will give me $1000 that will be distributed in $200 allotments my first three years, and then $200 each semester of the 4th year assuming I graduate in 4 years (I plan to do so). Unless there are major changes to my school's financial aid package, all of it is in grant form, and my family will not be forced to pay anything as long as my scholarships cover my costs. In the event of that my school does require my family to pay (under an Expected Family Contribution), one of my scholarships will allow me to take out a loan that they will pay in full, including interest, upon my graduation, as long as I maintain good grades. I am not using the full value of my scholarships, but they will only cover what my school doesn't give me in grants.

My scholarships require I maintain a 3.0 GPA, good standing, etc. - all things I know I can do. An important note is that one of my scholarships strongly recommends that I **not** work during college because they are already giving me the larger stipend and have more stringent requirements (mainly academic). This scholarship will also give me stipends for studying abroad and summer internships. If I do work, they want me to limit it to no more than 15 hours per week Additionally, my school will not grant me work-study status due to my scholarships. This means that I can't take the jobs specifically reserved for work study students, but there are opportunities for normal work. 

My plan is to focus on my academic work. I don't want to work during school, at least not at first, because my school is very difficult. My scholarships intend to give me the freedom to focus on schoolwork without financial stress. Because of the stipends I receive, I believe it is much more important that I maintain good grades. I intend to pursue a PhD, and my field of study (humanities) should allow me to receive fellowships for my further study, but I need to build up a strong academic career. I plan to spend my summers interning/researching/studying abroad. I will live on campus all four years, so those costs will remain covered.

So, onto planning. I believe that I need to get my money out of the stock currently worth $500. I don't foresee its value increasing in the near future. Any suggestions with this?

I'm not sure if I should stick with the mutual fund: the dividends are good, but the value fluctuates a lot, around 20% in the course of the past couple of years, and the value has not reached the price at which I bought it. If I do stick with it, should I reinvest my dividends?

Next, I have the CD coming due, and I don't plan to allow it to roll over since the interest rates are so low right now. I also have a fair amount in my checking account. I think I should set aside about $2000 for an emergency fund (my home is far away from school so things like travel get expensive). 

Finally, I'd like to get some kind of long term investing/retirement fund set up. Because I'm not planning to work, I won't be able to do a 401(k), but I think I can set up an IRA, and a Roth IRA seems to be the better choice. I can sock away at least a few hundred dollars in there every year. In terms of long term investments or diversifying my portfolio, I have no idea. 

Thanks for your help!

I'm looking to find an internship at a pretty big company next year, hopefully near SF/silicon valley, since that is where I would eventually like to end up.

Should I give applying online another shot, even though it has never given me any results? And are companies even looking for interns in August/early September?

I graduated in the fall of 2010 with a degree in industrial and systems engineering and was hired in the winter/spring of 2011 by a large and well known company for a traditional IE role (although my title was process engineer).  Although my degree is in ISE I very much enjoy programming. At my job I had requested projects that suited my skillset; an IE related project that involved programming. After practically begging for quite some time, I was finally given a project that I was very enthusiastic about. Unfortunately about 2 weeks into it a major departmental change went through and I was yanked off of it. I was put on other projects that felt more or less like mindless busy work so I started looking for work elsewhere. I received a response from what seemed like my dream job (SpaceX). I passed several rounds of phone interviews and was flown out for an in person interview. I felt like the interview process went well, but I was told I didn't get the job because I was told they were looking for someone with experience in a very specific focus (which I only had minimal exposure to). 

Following this a very good friend and mentor of mine had just purchased a few new businesses and was looking to organize things. He knew I was bummed out about not getting hired at SpaceX and disliked my current job so he suggested I work for him. We worked out the details and a month later I quit my job (just under a year ago from now) and I started working for him developing software for his businesses. I've very much enjoyed my time but it's almost been a year and my duties here are starting to wrap up. 

I'm just as comfortable working as a programmer as I am in an IE position. I had 2 internships while in college in manufacturing positions, 2 years of professional experience in a manufacturing position and the last year doing web-based software development. I'm not opposed to traditional IE roles, but I like the software/control side of things of manufacturing. I have minimal exposure to PLC's, but I'm very comfortable with other IO embedded devices like arduino/raspberry pi. I'm also very comfortable on web stack environments (mostly LAMP, but I also know ROR, Django and front end frameworks like Knockout.JS and Angular)

With all of that in consideration, what kinds of fields or positions could use an industrial engineer with programming experience that I may have not considered? I could go either way: IE or programmer/web developer, but I'm trying to find some options that I may have not considered. I have minimal exposure to PLC's, but overall I am very comfortable with programming. Are there any controls/automation jobs that I would be suited for, or are employers looking more for EE/CS graduates and engineers?

**tl;dr**

Studied industrial and systems engineering and have been programming for a long time. Worked for 2 years right out of college at a very large company in an industrial engineering position, got bored with work. Friend/mentor hired me to work for him doing software development. It's been almost a year and my duties are starting to wrap up. Looking for opportunities (especially outside of traditional IE roles) for an ISE graduate with a few years of IE/manufacturing and programming experience. "

Because of some personal/ family issues, I ended first semester with a cGPA of 2.82, and sGPA of about 3.65. I literally wanted to die, since I avidly follow this sub-reddit, in addition to my unhealthy obsession with reading admission statistics from the med schools I want to apply to in the near future, and know that you don't have a whole lot of room with the GPA when the averages are like 3.7 ish. 

BUT, hallelujah, I just finished this semester with a 3.84, over a whole point jump in cGPA, also finishing with a semester-sGPA of 4.0. So maybe my life isn't over after all, since I know I'm bright and I know undoubtedly that my passion is in the medical field. 

Tomorrow morning, I start my internship with a successful practicing Dermatologist (my ideal future niche in the medical field, as far as I'm concerned this early on in the game), which will last for the duration of the summer (4 months). 

THINGS ARE LOOKING UP! And after a restful summer, I'm excited to hit O-Chem, Physics, Bio, and genetics as hard as I can next semester. I just wanted to give you a little depiction of how things are going for me, to offer hope to anyone hitting some roadblocks! Remember that we're all only human, and we can't have the perfect application or the perfect life and perfect grades, but damn it we can work as hard as we can to get as close to perfect as we can! And WHEN you slip up a little, shake it off and come back stronger than ever! 

Encouragement aside, I was also wondering if anyone had any advice on what my next steps should be over the course of the next three years. I want to do something unique, not just for my med school app, but for the sake of my life and experiencing incredible things. If anyone has some suggestions on what my next courses of action should be (for the sake of always having a plan for the future), please let me know. 

In the meantime, for those getting out for summer, congrats on making it through another year! For those who still have work to do, fight on my brothers and sisters!

25fp2v,1,2014-05-13,I can't go to sleep because my mind keeps writing my suicide note,[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25fp2v/i_cant_go_to_sleep_because_my_mind_keeps_writing/,"The suicide note is bringing up bad memories.

I'm pretty sure the biggest contributing factor to the fact that my mind keeps writing my suicide note is finals stress. I have 3 consecutive finals starting in less than twelve hours, and I'm going to do poorly on all of them. I've been an irresponsible fool all semester long, ruined my grades, and learned virtually nothing. Instead of just taking a math midterm, I got shitfaced and didn't turn it in. Instead of going to class for multiple weeks throughout the semester, I annihilated my sleep schedule to the point at which I woke up after my last class was over. I know that in six months time, I won't give too many shits about what grades I get tomorrow, but telling that to myself isn't helping.

The fact that I've been having a shit time at what I imagined to be my dream college ever since I got here probably isn't helping. I stupidly expected my social life to be as vibrant and interesting as my junior and senior years of high school, my grades to be as effortless, myself to be as assertive and confident as I was by the end of high school, and to be having as much fun as I did at the end of high school.

UC Berkeley was my dream school. I've been an uber-liberal atheist since I began thinking about religion and politics in 7th grade. Obviously it was going to be easy for me to find my place at one of the most liberal schools in the country.

I had plenty of friends from my high school's class of 2012 coming with me, including the closest friend I've ever had. My oldest friend, from a neighboring high school's class of 2011, was already attending, and doing well. Not to mention the many friends from my own high school's class of 2011 who were attending Berkeley. Obviously I would have prebuilt connections everywhere that would make finding more friends insanely easy.

I had glid through high school with pretty much straight As and A-minuses and was nearly a valedictorian. I had taken and passed so many AP tests that I would start college with Junior standing, making registering for classes much easier. I was our school's Academic Decathlon captain and highest scorer, and was among the top ten scorers in county, despite the fact that our team barely tried and never took the studying seriously. I had scored a 2320 on the SAT and a 35 on the ACT, both higher than the average freshman accepted into Harvard. Obviously the academics, even if challenging, wouldn't be too much to handle.

Furthermore, the last two years, my Junior and Senior years of high school, were socially fantastic. My reputation preceded me--people I had never met before had heard of me, and had heard interesting and mostly positive things about my intelligence and personality. I had made friends in tons of varying social groups, hanging out with stoners and jocks in addition to the geeks and nerds with whom I had always fit. I could make most people laugh. In AP Government, my presence in a group project nearly always presaged my group's winning the class popularity vote. In my extracurriculars, I was always a leader. None of this was true two years prior--those two years were a natural uphill climb as a result of a highly increased confidence and a burgeoning social IQ. Obviously I would be able to fit in with any club at college, my social circle even wider, and my social skills would continue to improve.

Nope. None of those 'obviously's ended up being even remotely true. Looks like I peaked in high school. My freshman and sophomore years of college have been pure downhill. I tried joining some liberal and atheist clubs, along with some activities I excelled at in high school, but the inconvenient hours and slightly uninspiring people turned me off. I was no longer taking all the same classes as my best friend, and we both knew that we needed to hang out with strangers to build new social lives, so we grew somewhat apart. I meshed ok but not great with my roommates or the rest of my dorm's floor, so I didn't make any close friends there. I probably hung out with the people I already knew before entering college a bit too much, so that didn't help either.

Every dimension of my life is considerably poorer than they were two years ago, on the cusp of graduation. My social IQ has definitely diminished. I've grown farther from all the people I knew before I came to college, and the few new friends I have made are about as close to me as the people I considered close acquaintances in high school. I'm fucking up academically--I'm definitely failing Linear Algebra this semester, and doing extremely poorly in my two philosophy classes. I have 3 finals for which I am woefully unprepared coming up in less than 10 hours.

Berkeley sucks. I'm not smart enough to make a ton of friends through classes. I'm not fratty enough to join the Greek system. I'm not motivated enough to tryhard. I'm not good enough to get any research. I'm not responsible enough to look for internships.

The future is no longer bright. This fucking school has made me realize how dumb I am compared to virtually all of the human beings who will contribute meaningfully to humanity. If I continue on my current path, I will be become a shitty code monkey working at a company with low standards, doing nothing for the world and committing suicide as soon as my grandparents die. My grades are too shitty to go to any legit postgrad program. There's no way I have the endurance and determination to become a scientist, as I once dreamed.

When I try to go to sleep, my mind keeps writing my suicide note. It's racing through my head, with a tentative layout already built. I'll start with a Dear Best Friend letter, which will thank him for making my high school years the best years of my life, lament our growing apart in college, and say sorry for the times I have used him, which definitely outnumber the times he's used me. It would proceed with a bunch of thank yous and sorries to all the friends I can remember who made me happy at some point in my life, with longer messages for those to whom I have ever called close. Then there would be a bunch of thanks yous and sorrys to all the K-12 teachers who I remember.

At this point, I would explain why I am committing suicide. My future is dark, yada yada yada, blah blah blah, a few of the problems in my life may be fixable, but I don't have the fortitude to fix them, blah blah blah generic suicide reasons.

I would save my family for last. I would thank my grandparents for all the love they've given me, and give condolences for burying myself before burying them. I would thank my cousins for the times we hung out together, all of which I've enjoyed. And I would save the worst for last. I would thank my father for paying for my last two years of college and for being solidly middle class, which has surely afforded me a large number of advantages and opportunities not given to those less economically fortunate than my family. And then I would start the ""Fuck You"" section of my suicide note.

I would say, ""Fuck you for not being there when mom abused me as a child. Fuck you for not knowing what she would become. Fuck you for marrying her. Fuck you for not divorcing her when I asked you to at the tender age of 8. Fuck you for doing nothing when you knew full well what she had become. Fuck you for allowing her to live in our home. Fuck you for caring more about your love for her than for the abuse going on under your roof. Fuck you for fucking her and conceiving me. Fuck you for allowing me to be born. On top of these things which you can at least partially blame on mom, fuck you for being a below average father in general.""

As I started the note with a letter to my best friend, I would end it with a letter to my mother. Dear Mom, ""Thank you for the memory I have of looking up at the night sky with you, sitting by the poolside of one of the hotels we stayed in on our move from Texas to California. That is one of my earliest memories, and it is also the only memory in my brain which is both happy and contains you. Fuck you for being the reason I could never bring classmates over. Fuck you for the mental, emotional, physical, sexual abuse you inflicted on me when I was too young to understand or fight back. Fuck you for denying that any of it happened. Fuck you for implicitly acknowledging that it happened when you say, 'Everything mommy did for you was for your good.' Fuck you for being crazy. Fuck you for locking me up in the bathroom for 'making bad noises' which were actually just your hallucinations. Fuck you for saying that my breathing was too loud which was actually just your hallucinations. Fuck you for slapping me for moving my lips 'incorrectly' when I was never actually moving my lips at all. Fuck you for forcing me to repeat the same word or action for hours on end, whether it be picking up a pencil, saying a word, merely opening and closing my mouth, letting tears streak down my face, or countless other random movements you thought I was making 'incorrectly'. I would always ask you 'What do you want me to do?' and you would always answer 'You know what you should do'. Fuck you for doing all these things and worse, countless times throughout my elementary school life. Fuck you for being mentally ill. Fuck you for your delusions. Fuck you for continuing the emotional abuse through middle and high school. Fuck you for being the source of the vast majority of my life's misery. Fuck you for raising me instead of aborting me.""

And now I have 9 hours until my triple final gauntlet begins. And I'm still writing this post instead of going to sleep. I don't even care that this post isn't on a smurf, even if this post contains way too mu'ch of my life story. Maybe having spent three hours writing this post will make me tired enough to fall asleep. I doubt it, but I must try. Plus, I think I'm approaching the 10k character limit.

The previous software employee set up a server for the guys to do backups and run the intranet etc. It is also hooked up to prototype wireless receiver system for benchmarking that the guys use occasionally.
The hardware receives data packets every few seconds and drops them into a MySQL database running on the server. The intranet site can be used to graph the data that is stored in there.

Which would all be great except for one problem, there doesn't seem to be any constraints on the data being graphed, it's graphing everything. The system has been running since about 2010, receiving packets every few seconds, it's graphing, what I can only imagine, is several million data points. So if anyone tries to graph anything the server grinds to a halt for 10-15 minutes and the intranet freezes up, I've been asked to see if I can fix it.

My programming knowledge is limited to some VB, Java and C#, from my rummaging around on the server this system is set up using a combination of Python, Django and Javascript (which is why I wasn't sure which subreddit to ask in). I'm trying to figure out what I can but it's slow going with no one to ask for help. I've been going trough the python and javascript stuff I can find, seeing what references there are and get a rough idea of what each script does to see if I can narrow down where to look.

Ideally if I could find where the SELECT query for the graphing is written I'd just modify it to put some limit on the data, but I don't know where to look.

I think I'm on the right track looking at [this piece of javascript](http://jsfiddle.net/RrD5F/), but any pointers or suggestions on where, or even what, to look for would be most appreciated.

Thanks for taking the time to read this wall of text!"

i'm not sure when i started noticing it. there were several traits that she had; several responses that i've never seen in anyone else i've talked to/worked with/lived with. i've also been suffering from untreated low self-esteem and anxiety issues my whole life, mainly from my parents pushing me to compete with the other ethnic kids who went to the same public schools, even after high school graduation. i distinctly recall many examples of not being ""as good as Mrs. X's kid"" even though our test scores and grades weren't that far apart.

i'm on an internship for the summer (college), living away from home. it's been weeks of not being exposed to my mother. i've been around my fully-functional coworkers (especially my boss, he's emotionally stable and fair) and building great relationships. i actually enjoy the work i'm doing for my company and learning a whole lot.

last night, i called home and talked to (mainly) my mother for the first time in a couple of months, to make sure she got her mother's day card, how was life going, etc.

and then she starts asking about my career choice, how it was never to her liking (she wanted me to go to med school, not engineering), how working for a relatively small company was detrimental to my career development; how i needed to get into a large corporation (like her's - it's a fortune 500) in order to have a ""good life"".

i asked her specifically why she wanted me to go to med school, and what part of living a ""good life"" comes from being a doctor, and what kind of lifestyle a doctor leads that would make a ""good life"" and she always reasoned that she always referenced meeting Mrs. Y at a party whose husband is a neurologist and he lives in a ridiculously large mansion and they always seem to be having fun.

cut a long story short, instead of just listening to her and say that i'll apply to more well-known corporations and try to climb the corporate ladder, i tried to communicate my thoughts to her on my current position and how much i'm learning and how great the environment is...

...which ended up, as usual, in her attacking me on several fronts, me being close to tears, feeling like my accomplishments and achievements (while never stellar) are inadequate, and me reverting to a defensive attitude (something i've noticed myself doing especially around my parents - i've been habit-picking it out and making great improvements on it at work/school and with my roommmates). 

as i've gained more financial independence from my internships and work experience and university life, i've been able to break many annoying habits, like being defensive, trying to appease whoever i'm talking to (appeasing my angry mother was the go-to answer at home - never talk back to her), and feeling extremely self-conscious at every single little thing i do, asking if it'll make mother angry later down the road.

i took a day off work today, not gettng much sleep last night. whatever sleep i did get was plagued by really bad nightmares. 

i was really in a bad spot last night mentally, trying to make sense of what the hell just happened. maybe i'm a really bad kid and just provoked my parents wrong. 

i started browsing reddit and read up on a couple of bad parent-child relationships, and believe me it's never been as bad as the sob stories i've been reading, but i came across this sub after a little and gathered enough courage to post this.

i want to deal with this the best i can, i'm open to answering any questions that won't leak my personal details, i just really need some answers."

25g9ke,4,2014-05-13,"Higher paying summer internship, or take a class and keep lower paying job?",oncea,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/25g9ke/higher_paying_summer_internship_or_take_a_class/,"For the past 4 months I've been working as a part-time programmer on campus. I also wanted to take a class this summer so that I could hurry up my graduation date. I started my major late, and if I take summer classes, I will still be graduating a year late. 

My dilemma is that I've just been offered an internship with a (seemingly) great company and I can't help but be tempted to take this internship. The repercussions of accepting the offer would be that I'd have to quit my current, lower-paying, job and I would probably have to add another semester even though I'm already going to be a year late,  or squeeze more classes per semester. 

I've just completed 3 semesters of my computer science major, and I think it would be impressive if I had this internship experience early on in my education. 

Here's a summary of pros and cons of each choice:

**Take the internship**
-19$/hr
-Great experience in signals processing software
-Not specifically interested in signals processing, but 
i think it'd be cool to learn about
-Taking it would mean I would have to delay my graduation or take 
really big course loads throughout the school year. 
-Opening up more doors for me in general, since this experience would give me an edge I think

**Stay in class and keep part-time job over the summer**
- 11$/hr
- I would be able to work towards my CS degree and not delay it any further
- Schedule is more flexible
- I would maintain good relations with the people I work with on campus since I wouldn't be leaving them over the summer (Summer vacation is starting next week, so it would be short notice to tell them I can't work for them anymore)

So what's more important? Getting the internship and experience early on? Or graduating in a timely manner and maintaining a good relationship with present employers?

Users have asked for details about my therapy sessions with my old clients from the internship. I was hesitant to release details of my patients and their treatments but the therapists I console have shown a great deal of interest in my treatment methods. They only asked that I use different names for clients and not to reveal anything that will make them easily identifiable to avoid lawsuits and maintain professionalism. Otherwise, these writings can be considered case studies. 


In the comment section of my first post, I described an experience with a veteran returning from an overseas conflict. If you have already read this comment, you know how the story ends but I have included more details in this entry and gotten some help from fellow therapist with information the case to shine a light on what really happened, if that still interests you. Otherwise, I shall begin with “Henry”, my first client. 


Henry phoned into Dr. J’s office where I interned doing administrative work and scheduling appointments. Unfortunately, Dr. J was booked for the next two weeks and Henry’s request was for an appointment as soon as possible. The closest appointment I had was in a month’s time after Dr. J returned from a conference in Arizona. There was something in his voice that told me that he wasn’t being impatient but desperately needed help. My instincts are rarely ever wrong when it comes to matters of psychology so I invited him to the office after hours so that we could have a session. 


After getting ourselves settled into Dr. J’s office, I asked Henry the purpose of his visit. As I reached for my pen, Henry jumped across the table and grabbed my arm. The look in his eyes told me that was in panic. It was a result of being afraid of something. I asked him to release me as I was only going to grab a pen. He held on for a few moments before releasing his hand from mine and sitting back on his side of the couch. 


He seemed embarrassed but asked that I not write anything down of our sessions. He didn’t’ to leave a paper trail behind of his visit to the therapist. That’s when he revealed to me that he was in the armed forces.  He didn’t want to use his insurance plan because it would be reported and noted on his permanent record. He’d never be considered for advancement again. I respected his wishes and told him we would discuss payment later. Always remember rule number three: Always discuss your salary before starting a job.


I was feeling hesitant before about scheduling the appointment but all that disappeared the moment Henry told me he was in the armed forces. Deep in my heart, I knew that I was doing my duty as a citizen of these United States and a psychologist to assist this young man in his time of need. We must always support our troops! 


The session lasted three hours before we finished. Getting Henry to speak about his problems was as difficult as pulling teeth on a patient with no anesthetic. Henry was guarded to the idea of discussing his service time overseas in combat. Most veterans of war do not like to speak about their experiences. It is understandable so instead we talked about his symptoms. He had extreme difficulty sleeping as he experienced flashbacks of his time in war during the night. The anxiety of awaiting an attack did not allow his mind to rest. Along with lack of sleep, this was causing a hypersensitivity disorder making him prone to emotional outbursts and bouts of rage. He was self-medicating with narcotics and alcohol to put himself to sleep.


As Henry spoke about his symptoms, I could see it in his face that he would be haunted for the rest of his life. Wartime calls for men and women to perform unspeakable acts of violence and horror to each other. It was a clear cut case of post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and drug addiction. What worried me the most was Henry’s admission of contemplating suicide then lifting his shirt to show me that he was currently armed. He slept with the gun under his pillow and felt unsafe if he didn’t have a weapon in arms reach at all times. It was shocking but I am not there to judge the man. I didn’t feel threatened by him.  He wanted my assistance, unlike the others I tried to help before. 


As my treatment options were limited, I believed that the best option of treatment was exposure therapy. Henry was a young man haunted by the demons of the past and he needed to confront them without facing any real danger. How do you send a man to war without putting him into danger? In a flash of brilliance, I prescribed Henry a form of exposure therapy that would be exactly what he needed. The young man did everything as I prescribed him, except for only one part that he did not follow.


To confront his demons, I had him watch the opening scene of the Allies soldiers storming Omaha Beach in “Saving Private Ryan”. To stimulate the parts of his mind still hurting from combat, he would need to turn it up as loudly as possible. The simulation of actual combat would allow him to relive those moments of war so he can come to terms with his fear. He would realize that he was safe and that his time on the front lines was finished. Henry would also need to have his gun nearby as it would serve as an anchor of safety to reality. It would serve as the protection his mind needed against the demons of war. 


In my original comment, I guessed about what happened after the point of where Henry began to watch the film. With some corroboration from the therapists at my facility, they have informed me that my guess was almost correct.  Henry suffered a flashback or re-experience scenario where his reality became storming Omaha Beach in World War Two. I was wrong that he discharged his weapon at the television screen in his delusional state. Instead, the neighbors called the police about a noise complaint because Henry was using a surround sound system with the volume extremely high. 


In the middle of the movie, the police pounded on the door in an attempt to get Henry’s attention and unfortunately, they did. In his delusional state, Henry must have believed that German combatants were attempting to break down his door. He surprised them when he opened the door and fired his weapon into their heads at point blank range. The officers never had a chance to react. More police were called to the scene as a result of the gun fire and there was a stand-off between Henry and the police. Henry took cover inside of his home and began to fire out the window. With no other options, the police fired back at Henry and he was killed in action. 


Finding out that this was the reason Henry did not return for our next session was heart-breaking but getting back to lesson number two that I’ve learned: You cannot blame yourself for client failures. And as to the one thing Henry did wrong, I don’t remember if I exactly mentioned it to him but I’m pretty sure that I told him to unload the bullets from his gun before he started the movie.

I was on site and got a chance to chat with what I was hoping would be someone who was interested in learning or education. I hope this spurs some discussion as well.

This should be good.

&gt;Intern #111: No, no. I mean, how easy is it for someone to HACK my email.

&gt;Me: What is hacking to you?

&gt;Intern #111: Like, a criminal. On the computer.

&gt;Me: As long as you only use your email at work you don't have to worry. We keep the hackers out.

&gt;Intern #111: So if someone was using their email outside of work you could hack it?

&gt;Me: As in, stand over their shoulder and remember what they typed?

&gt;Intern #111: No, as in HACK it. Like, with a flash drive!

&gt;Me: Sure, I don't see why not.

&gt;Intern #111: Could you hack someone for me then? I need their emails.

At this point, I should have seen where they were going. But I thought it would be bad manners to just walk away. So I continued...

&gt;Me: Sure, but I charge $1000 per hour.

&gt;Intern #111: Wow, that's a lot. Hold on a second.

The user turns back to their computer, and goes to bing. They types in the following:

2 times 1000

&gt;Intern #111: It would only take you less than an hour to get to them and less than an hour to get back, so if you did it I'd be able to pay you next paycheck.

&gt;Me: Look, I'm not going to judge. But did you honestly just require a calculator to find out the final pay of 2 hours work at $1000 per hour?

&gt;Intern #111: Oh. Yes.

&gt;Me: Essentially, don't ask staff to hack random people for you. That's illegal. I'm going to pretend like you were joking and just write this off. I was joking about being able to help you, because I only hack systems I have permission to hack.

&gt;Intern #111: I wasn't joking. 

*cue deadpan stare, and a pause*

&gt;Intern #111: My emails at home got hacked and sent out spam to my contacts. I think it was my ex and I want to hack them back! I'm just computer illiterate.

The next 30 or so minutes involved me and Intern #111's cubicle neighbors joining in and getting a talking to from me about common Hollywood hacking myths. It seems like incompetence with technology pairs commonly with incompetence with all skills requiring critical thinking. "

All I really need is for someone to tell me that I'm going to be okay. 

I'm a good student. I never miss lecture, always turn my homework in on time, as well as study hard for all of my exams. Lately, my exam performance has been less than desirable. I feel like every time I get to an exam, I look at it and my mind goes blank.

The fact that I work hard, yet still do not do as well as I hope has led me to believe that I am just not smart enough. Im a very highly motivated person who truly truly loves engineering, but I'm constantly afraid of getting to my Junior/Senior classes and simply failing them. 

I don't want to graduate with a garbage GPA, so to compensate I've been building my resume like crazy (research internship, technical projects). Adding to my frustration is the fact that I hear of students not doing their homework or even coming to lecture, yet they still manage to get better grades than me.

tl;dr My lack of academic success is making me feel inadequate, and I just need a confidence boost.

My problem is that I don't have work experience. In college, I wasn't allowed to have a job during the school year (coach's rule) and track went well into the summer so I was never able to apply for summer internships. Instead of internships, I would do manual labor for people I knew, work for my grandparents, work for my parents, etc. But now, it seems like not having work experience relating to engineering has really hurt my chances of finding a job. Here lies my question.

Should I pursue an internship? Can you even apply for internships when not a college student anymore? 
This would allow me to get some work experience for an actual job. 
I would just like some advice on what I should do.

Some relevant info:
I have already talked to Career Services on campus many times. They aren't the most helpful to say the least.
I'm in Texas and I'm hoping to stay in Texas.
I know people who are high up engineers in various firms trying to help me find a job. So it isn't for a lack of knowing people.


The only thing I can point my finger to is work experience.

I am a college junior and my MCAT is Saturday and I am worried I will not do well.  I am thinking about my summer plans in case I do poorly.  If I have to retake the MCAT, I will apply to medical school NEXT cycle (not this cycle).

I won't know until June 15th what my score is, but I have to make summer plans now.

I have 3 options:

1) Do a full time (40hr/week) paid internship that will count as a course for one of my majors.

2) Take an easy online course the first summer session and do a 10hr/week unpaid internship (counts as a course too).

3) Do just the online course or just the 10hr/week internship.


I ideally would like to do the paid internship as I'm broke, but I am afraid if I do poorly on my MCAT, when would I retake the MCAT because it'd be hard to study enough with a full time job?  I need to take it before next December because after that the MCAT changes and I have studied for this version.  However, I'd ideally like to re-take it in September if I do badly because I don't want to forget what I have learned already.



Should I choose the unpaid internship in case I don't do well on the MCAT?  But if I do well enough, I'm gonna be pissed on passing up the paid internship because its with a very reputable company.

I am fairly new to using Linux for technical things. I am an intern and my coworker has me using Kali Linux to mess around with virtual web servers and boxes, testing vulnerabilities and the like.

However, I have been trying to compile c code from exploit-db and have not been able to do so. 

The error messages says ""asm/linkage.h file not found""

I believe there are other headers that are missing, but it's on my work computer and I am home currently.

Any advice/information on how to rectify the missing headers would be appreciated.

25h7k4,1,2014-05-13,At what point do I change strategies? Does it just take time or should I start looking for something different?,AhhhBees,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/25h7k4/at_what_point_do_i_change_strategies_does_it_just/,"About five years ago I had a job I really liked as a Marketing Associate/ Customer Service Manager. I had been in it a few years, found it really interesting  and wanted to grow. I decided the best way to do that would be to finish my degree. So I quit my job (once it became unworkable due to conflicting class times and lack of employer flexibility) and finished my degree. While I was in college I worked part time doing customer service and logistics for a small business. Just before I graduated I got another part time job as a receptionist at an investing firm. It was originally a three month project, but because of some staffing changes, they took me on full time and I’ve been here about 1.25 years now. The position has no work. The company has no work. I’ve tried to grow my role, but no one has enough work to do as it is, let alone any for me to try to help with. The company let me know at my December review, that they would like to eliminate my position by summer. Great! A lot of notice! I could just start looking. 

I started looking in January for entry level marketing and sales positions. I’ve sent out a ton of resumes and have a pretty good interview rate. I would say for every 8 resumes I send out, I get an interview. Some have gone great (at least that’s what I thought) and others not so great. Either way, no offer has come my way. I find that I am either too experienced and they are looking for someone they can “mold” or I am not experienced enough. 

I am a little frustrated with the process and am not sure what is the best way to go forward. Am I being unrealistic in the jobs that I am looking for or is the job market such that this is just going to take a long time? I know I would have a better shot with an internship (which makes no sense because I’ve already held a paid position) but I can’t tell if it’s worth it to work two part time jobs, just to do an internship.

25hpmd,4,2014-05-13,"I'm addicted to gambling and the only thing that stops me is being overdrawn, help?",SoThrowed,addiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/addiction/comments/25hpmd/im_addicted_to_gambling_and_the_only_thing_that/,"I'm an otherwise normal 27 year old guy. Finished my second degree earlier this year. I have drank and dabbled in a few drugs but have never in any way ever even craved them, let alone become close to dependent. I am otherwise not impulsive and believe I had a normal childhood where money was not comfortable but never needed to come up.

However, in late 2010 my coworker and my two roommates all turned out to be big sports and somewhat big blackjack players. It was a frenzy that overwhelemed me because I liked the rush, the money, and the struggle of trying to beat the book.

Initially it was great, I won so much money. Now, for some reason, I fear I still negate my negative experiences that have come with losing so much gambling b/c of the hope that I can get that first high I had when I first started. I liked being able to fly myself all over the world, buy clothes and useless shit, and not worry about money.


Obviously that did not last long, but even though I ran myself dry from time to time I was never too bad. However, the past year and half have been different. Besides a few times when I get a huge lump sum of money, I am practically always under $100 in my account and sometimes overdrawn for a few days or weeks. I think about it constantly since I often watch ESPN or watch a hockey/football game. 
I have told myself a million times I am going to stop, I tried to ban myself from one site(then I just signed up for another), I made my self swear to god I would stop, I even decided to give someone else my money in a shared account (which I then just went and withdrew the money secretly). I've come across a few problems, luckily nothing in the legal system. I have lost a few friends, my roommate kicked me out of the apt after I sold my gifts to bet on college bowl games and was left with no money. At this point I'm considering hypnosis or something like that because I recently received a bonus that I have to use to move cities and put down a few months of rent on and use to live until my paychecks can float me. Even knowing this I really don't think I can control myself. Sometimes I'll go for a week or so with no impulse, then I say I'll just do one. Then either I win and want more or lose and try to make it back, and there comes a whole long, terrible cycle after that. I had a summer internship last summer and despite knowing the money they gave me was for rent, food, and gas, I completely blew through my money mainly on gambling. 

I really think since 2011, I have lost something like $15-25k

This is primarily online sports betting so whenever I see a sport, a tv, or computer/phone I receive a reminder. I also, even last month, have won money and withdrawn, but inevitably I come crawling back and lose it all. 

TL;DR - I can not stop online sports gambling and I'm coming up on a large lump sum of money which I need to support myself for a few months and I need to know what to do to help in the long term and short term."

- The place is practically brand new, only a year old

- Large kitchen with dishwasher, large fridge, microwave, electric oven/stove

- washer and dryer in the apartment

- fancy security system with camera aimed at the front door and visible through a wall monitor

- 2 **full** bathrooms

- You would get a large room with ample closet space AND I'm offering to throw in some furnishings such as: desk, chairs, full queen size bed, bookshelves (I can move them if you don't want it)

The price will fall between $530- $550 a month, which is a deal compared the rest of the area. You could move in as soon as you need to.

The roommates are great guys, clean, business majors, and respectful.

Once the room is yours feel free to do whatever you wish, we live in a free country... just don't break anything.

In their email, they said they needed me to create some applications, but beyond that they did not elaborate.  I have a lot of experience with Java, PHP, Python, and a few others, along with moderate experience in Obj-C, C, and ASM.


What would be the best approach for learning Visual Basic in just a few days?  I start on Monday, and despite the time constraint, I feel confident I can do this.  Last summer I interned at the same company, and they had me learn php in 5 days so I could get their website up and running. 
 

Can you recommend any books or specific websites for tutorials?  I will be going through the Microsoft docs tomorrow, and want a good book/site to use after that.  


As a side note, I am unsure whether or not we will be using ASP.NET for web apps, or if I will just be making Desktop Applications.  Perhaps recommend resources for both?


Thank you in advance for any advice y'all can give me."

I'm so confused and don't know what is right or not. I'm 21 and male.

I didn't have many friends in high school, and spent a lot of time alone. I had one friend. She was my entire life. We still are best friends. We spent a LOT of time together and talked all day at school, and texted every time otherwise.

When I went to college, I met some other people. My social circle is pretty small. I have that girl, plus my male best friend, and 3 other guys I talk to and hang out with.

I'm working full time right now at an internship. Right now I still text that girl, and my other best friend all day on and off, usually every day. I text the other people occasionally too. I usually have someone to hang out with 6 out of the 7 days in a week. I love it. I feel really guilty about it.

The thing is, people think its weird enough I do this as it is. I'm sexually attracted to men. So any of these guys I hang out with I would date if they asked. None are gay, so I don't try.

I feel like this attraction part towards them makes it wrong for me to involve them in my life so much. I feel fake knowing I'm attracted to my closest friends sexually.

I try to distance myself and an unhappy, but when I let myself do what I want I'm always told to watch out that I don't break my heart. Or I get told its wrong to harbor feelings about friends that you won't get back.

these friends are totally willing to reciprocate, its not one way. I'm just told because of my feelings this is all wrong.

when I get a partner of course I would hang out with them and talk the most, but there is no way I ever see myself not loving everyone else a whole lot to.

Is this OK? Is it fine to love people like this? They make me feel so good and warm. Having an emotional connection with them makes me feel so good. I don't know if this is normal with friends, or only because I'm attracted?"

25iaal,10,2014-05-13,I never want to live in student housing again.. A long ongoing air condition battle and a rant.,[deleted],badroommates,https://www.reddit.com/r/badroommates/comments/25iaal/i_never_want_to_live_in_student_housing_again_a/,"I've lived in an off campus student apartment complex for the past year and a half now. Last August I planned on living with one of my friends from back home in this same complex, but due to some really shitty circumstances, she wasn't able to move in with me. It didn't really effect me though because each roommate signs their own lease for their own room. I expected a random person to be assigned the second room, but no one ever showed up. I had the place all to myself. It was fantastic. I assumed no one would be moving in at all. 

One day about two months later, I woke up to find an asian couple in my living room. Okay. You would think someone would notify me as to whether someone else would be moving in later but whatever. She told me she wasn't a student but moved to Florida for an internship. Her husband was going to stay for the week and then he would go back to wherever they were from. I'm not sure if her husband spoke english because I only saw him that first day and he didn't say anything to me, but I just figured he was shy maybe. I didn't care that he was staying, they were very quiet. Didn't see her much because we both spend most of our time in our rooms. We didn't have and issues until the winter.. 

Every time the temperature outside was below 60, she tried to turn the heat on during the night. It was sort of an unusually cold winter for Florida, but I would never think to turn the heat on in the apartment. The temperature inside was never below 65 degrees on even the coldest days. I told her to please not keep the heat on at night because I cannot sleep when I'm hot. We discussed it MULTIPLE times. I didn't care if she turned the heat on for a little bit, even though I didn't think it was necessary, but to please remember to turn it back off. There were several occasions where I woke up sweaty at 6:30 am because she would turn the heat on when she woke up and would forgot to turn it off when she left for work. One night around 3am I turned the heat off because it was fucking hot, and she came out and immediately turned it back on, I went out to turn it off again after 5 minutes and she came back and turned it right back on again. This happened a couple of nights.

It's summer time now and it's getting really hot out! We have giant windows in our room which bring in a lot of heat. I don't have curtains, so I just cover it with a sheet in the daytime. Even with the window covered, it gets very hot in my room. I keep my fan on full blast and I like to have the air condition set to 'auto' at about 73-72 degrees during the night. It gets to 69-70 during and I think that's comfortable to sleep in BUT my roommate however does not. She has told me that she ""wakes up in the middle of the night because she is freezing"" when it is 70 degrees. It's not my fault that you are too stupid to put a blanket on.

The past couple of days I have been coming home to find the air condition turned 'on' and set to 76 degrees. I don't know what she is trying to accomplish, she's constantly complaining that she's too cold at night, so what's the point of keeping it on? It's not blowing cold air, it's just like having a fan on. Before she moved in, I accidentally left it 'on' and running one day and the AC unit broke. I had one of the maintenance guys tell me to keep it on 'auto' or else it will break. I have also told my roommate this but she absolutely refuses to believe me.

Last night really did it for me... Again, the ac was set 'on' at 76. I keep turning it off and trying to come out and catch her putting it back on so we can talk about it, but she's too quick. We went back and forth. I would come out and set it to 73 on 'auto' she would come out and crank it back 'on' to 76. This is an ongoing battle. I got so fed up with it at 3 am that I put a note on next to the thermostat asking for her to PLEASE PLEASE not keep the ac running all night long because it will break and at least have it below 75 at night and suggesting to close the vent in her room if she got too cold. Today I came home from 2 notes from her on the thermostat. She used one of those page holders to show me what the actual temperature is...As if I am not aware. And another asking to keep it set at least at 75 degrees during the night so she does not freeze and that she cannot close her vent because it is noisy.

My issue is.. You can put on more clothes or cover up more if you're cold but you can't do much about being hot. I'm not even home everyday. I spend about half of the week spending the night at my boyfriends house. Is it too much to ask that we keep it cooler when I'm there? This isn't about the electric bill either because all of our utilities are included in our rent, we never ever have to pay for it. I am planning on moving into a real apartment with my boyfriend after the summer and I would like to enjoy not having to pay for the cool air while I live here. 

I realize that this may not be as bad as the other stories on this sub but she is really getting on my last nerve and A LOT of the things she does annoy me. I feel like she does things just to spite me. One time my boyfriend accidentally used 2 pieces of her bread to make a sandwich. I apologized and told her it was a mistake, he wouldn't do it again. This was the only time we ever used anything of hers. After that she started tying her food up in plastic bags..A few weeks ago, I was taking a nap when I heard her using my bathroom. There's no reason she should have been in there. She has her own bathroom, IN her room. Mine is across the hall from my door. I saw her later that day and she didn't say anything about it and I chickened out about asking her because I don't like confrontations. I stay over at my boyfriends a lot and never think to lock my rooms, so I wondered, is she always using my things when she thinks I'm not here? Is she going into my room?? She locks her door whenever she leaves the apartment even if it is just for 10 minutes, it's not like I would ever enter her room, but is this because she is suspicious I will do the same to her? Also whenever she is out in the kitchen, she is ALWAYS running the sink. It will be on for 15 minutes straight. It doesn't sound like shes washing anything, it's just running. I've heard it running while she was slamming the cupboards and fridge door. Why is it ALWAYS ON? I am so so thankful we don't have to pay utilities because I cannot imagine how much money she would be wasting. Also last night I also found an entire egg shell in the garbage disposal. I have never actually heard her use the garbage disposal, there's just food in it I guess. She also started using a small plastic bag as her trash can. It was on the counter and now it hangs off the oven. I just don't understand the things she does. 

Another issue, unrelated to my roommate is the people that live above me.. I am not exaggerating when I say that they are CONSTANTLY moving. It sounds like an elephant running around. I can't imagine what they could possibly be doing up there or how any human being could move that much. It's like theyre jumping instead of walking. It lasts all night and day. I don't know when they sleep. I've been woken up by their booming at 4:30 am before. I thought the people that lived above me before this apartment were loud, but this is way worse. 

I am counting down the days until I can move out of this god awful apartment building. 75 days..."
25iha5,1,2014-05-14,Officially booked my tickets! 18 days in Japan beginning Aug. 29! Please help me plan out my trip,[deleted],JapanTravel,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/25iha5/officially_booked_my_tickets_18_days_in_japan/,"Hi everyone,

I posted here a little while ago talking about an internship I'm doing in China after which I'll be going to Japan. I've officially bought my tickets (my university paid for all airfare!) and now I'm trying to plan out my trip before all the accommodations get booked.    

Here are the details I have so far:

Landing Aug 29 evening at KIX    
Departing Sep 15 afternoon from NRT

Outline:
SOLO TRIP! I've been told I should spend half my time in Kyoto and the other half in Tokyo, so I guess I could plan on spending 8 or 9 nights in Kyoto with day trips to Osaka and Nara and whatever else is there, and the other half in Tokyo. However a lot of the japan-guide itineraries suggest ""spend x days at y place"", in which case I'd rather not be paying for both a hostel and accommodations elsewhere. I'll also have luggage from a 10-week stay in Shanghai (I'm hoping to pack light).    
    

One option I've considered is spend a few days in Osaka soon after I fly in and then go to Kyoto for the rest of the first week. Is Osaka worth staying in for a few days or would I be better off in Kyoto, simply making a day's trip to Osaka?

Housing: I've heard great things about K's house so I think I might just go with them for both halves of the trip. Seems like people book pretty far in advance, so that should be my top priority. If anyone has other suggestions, please enlighten me (but they're the cheapest I've found). 

Transportation: Seems like it would be smartest for me to get one of those 14-day JR passes. Any other suggestions? The Seishun 18 ticket will be in season and it's pretty cheap but I think it lasts only 5 days.    

Cost: I'm hoping to be on the (very) cheaper side of things.

Things I want to experience for sure:    
-Onsen    
-One of those ramen stands    
-Check out some shrines/temples    
-Fushimi Inari :)    

Aside from those, I really have no idea what I should be looking for. I know the language so I shouldn't have trouble getting around.

Itinerary (here's where you come in!)

* Day 1 (Fri Aug 29)    
 Landing in KIX at 6:30pm. Hop on a train to Kyoto hostel    

* Day 2-5 (Sat Aug 30 - Tues Sep 2)    
Explore Kyoto
    
* Day 6 (Wed Sep 3)    
Osaka day trip, probably check out Osaka castle and Dotonburi. (how late can i stay before trains stop going back to kyoto?)

* Day 7 (Thur Sep 4)    
Nara day trip? Seems like everyone does that, must be cool.

* Day 8 (Fri Sep 5))
Morning: Check out of Kyoto hostel, get on a shinkansen to Hiroshima and find a hostel there    
Explore Hiroshima    

* Day 9 (Sat Sep 6)    
Explore Miyajima

* Day 10 (Sun Sep 7)    
Morning: check out of hostel and head to Tokyo hostel. Looks like a 5-hr train ride.
    
* Day 11-13 (Mon Sep 8 - Wed Sep 10)     
Explore Tokyo?    
Akihabara?

* Day 14 (Thur Sep 11)    
Asakusa and Odaiba from japan-guide

* Day 15 (Fri Sep 12)    
Kamakura from japan-guide...maybe. Seems a bit far.

* Day 16-17 (Sat Sep 13 - Sun Sep 14)    
Keep exploring Tokyo?

* Day 18:    
Head to NRT, leave japans :(

Please tell me if I'm spending too much or too little time in certain places or if there are additional places that would be cool to visit. Again, I'm not particularly attached to this itinerary. I just have to begin at KIX and end in NRT 18 days later, and preferably not spend too much money. As you can see, there's a lot of work to be done. I'd appreciate some help/suggestions. Back to scouring japan-guide!    

EDIT: I don't meet the drinking age in Japan, so I guess bars and stuff won't apply    
EDIT: Added some suggestions. Think I should get the 7-day JR pass.    

Thanks! :)"

He is trying to change for better but I [20 F] don't think I can take much more.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/25ilay/my_22_m_boyfriend_blacks_out_and_doesnt_remember/,"My boyfriend has always been a free spirit, doesn't really get into relationships, and has always been on his own. I know this because I went to his high school, but we never interacted until we met in Miami when I was on vacation with another boyfriend at the time of 2 years.

We had an immediate electric connection, so much that I could not stop thinking about him and I ended up breaking up with my SO of the time because that is not fair to him. I have been together with my boyfriend every day ever since (about a year).

I broke up with him a couple weeks ago because whenever I look at his phone I find shady things (ex snaps with ex hookups). He is depressed and when he drinks he blacks out every time. He is currently getting help for his depression.

Since breaking up he is trying, but I still find a few things I don't like, such as today I saw he was in contact with a few girls I don't like and I know want to hook up with him. What really killed me and the rest of our relationship was one day, he went out drinking and came back to his house (where I was staying) completely trashed. 

He was being shady with his phone, so I took it out of his hands and it was a pic of his face with the words ""tits or gtfo"" and he was about to send it to a few girls. I broke up with him right there. He claims ""tits or gtfo"" is a ""saying"" and a joke. 

In about 15 days, I am leaving for a 2 month long time to Indonesia for an internship. We will still be broken up when I go because if I am worried about these things when I am in the same house as him, god knows what could happen when I am halfway around the world. I'm I am afraid of him moving on, but I know that nobody else will put up with his bullshit the way I do. 

I know that one day he is going to look back and wish he had never lied or been shady to me, because drinking and doing stupid shit is not worth losing what we have, and he knows it.

I am going to come back to a world that will not be the same. I love him so much but I don't know how much more I can take.

Any advice would be helpful. This is a really hard time for me and I don't want to ruin my experience in Bali because I am worried of what he could be doing at home. We are so in love, he loves me so much but his drinking is erratic and makes him into a different person.

**tl;dr**: Boyfriend blacks out, doesn't remember actions, I am sick of it and don't know what to do."

I have worked as a cashier at a supermarket for the last eight years of my life because my career as a graphic designer left me poor, with perhaps a few freelance jobs here and there, an unpaid internship, and little else. I have done so little for so long, and have felt like a miserable failure for a long time now. My shame has left me feeling pathetic to the point where I don't know who I am anymore. I even broke down crying at work a few weeks ago because I was at my end; I had failed at life.

But I don't want to feel like this anymore.
I want to believe that I'm capable of changing my life.
I don't want to be afraid anymore.
I want to feel like I can fail and keep going, no matter what.
I don't want to feel like a failure anymore.
I want to be happy.
I want to believe that I am worth something.
I want to feel like myself again.
I want to laugh and smile once more.

And maybe I'll figure it out. I will finish my Masters in Computer Science a little more than a week from now. Even though I don't have a proper job lined up, and don't have the desired work experience, I'll figure it out. I know I will. Somehow, someway.

And maybe all I really want is to just forgive myself for my failures. That's all.

Or maybe... maybe it's not forgiveness that I need. Perhaps what I need most is to make a promise to myself, and to fulfill that promise, no matter what.

I promise... to do the very best I can, and to remember that I'm not perfect, and that I will make mistakes; to always get back up, no matter how many times I fall; to praise my efforts, rather than pity myself for my failures; to take responsibility for what I do or do not; to remind myself that there is always a way to get to where I want to be; to know the difference between strength and anger; to remember that ultimately I am the master of my fate, the captain of my soul.

I will live by these words throughout my days, and remember them always. This, I promise."

Anyway, I've decided its about time for me to serve up some beetus for you lovely folks and tell you the tale of Production Ass aka PAss. 

Let's set the table.


&gt;be me: LuLaLuo, 23, 5'6, at the time 180,(becomes relevant later) chill, hardworking little production assistant, alpha as fuck.



&gt;you could be: RED, 27, my sarcastic, smoker, 5'4 130 pound, lezbefriends. Former classmate, all around kick ass. Associate of PAss.



&gt;NEVER EVER EVERRR FUCKING BE: PAss, 30, 5'6, 280, turtle faced, LAZY, rude associate of RED. My Cow-worker. 


Little LuLaluo, fresh home from doing a six month LA internship workin' in dat Hollywood. RED calls up sayin' she's on a job now working a *le gasp* cooking show. Another Production Assistant is sick and was sent home they need more helps. 

Lulaluo interviews over the phone with the Production Manager and was hired to work the next day. 

YAY. 


&gt;Datfreelancelife.jpeg [ohyeah!](http://imgur.com/gallery/nQCKkbH)


So I show up to set to work the next morning. Me and RED kill it, having worked together before. I was helping wash dishes (all the dishes, pots, etc) and stayed on top of it along with all my other tasks. I'm also a very pleasant, hardworker. Cooking staff loved meh, production office also loved meh, crew love meh. 

LULALOU WAS HIRED BACK FOR ANOTHER DAY! 

&gt;[likeaboss](http://i.imgur.com/GBgXd.gif)

Day 2 is where our fun begins.

Show up to set first, as you should as PA. P. Manager arrives and I start setting up Breakfast for the crew. All is well in Lulaland!

Suddenly, the ground shakes. The cups rattle off the table. Over my shoulder I see her. PAss [waddling](http://i.imgur.com/mp5RmrI.gif) up the drive way. PM points out she's another PA.

Oh goodie, more help(or so I thought)!!! The dishes soaking from last night need to finish getting washed. 

She gets to the garage and I introduce myself. She looks me up and down, says hi and grabs a bag of chips from the craft table and starts eating. PM says she hired me because of PAss being sick. 

PAss hacks into her arm at that moment. 


&gt;mrw[NOPE!](http://i.imgur.com/AeMDSt3.gif)

I head to the washer room to wash the pots and she says finish the breakfast stuff. 

Mmkay, cool. She's been here longer. Off I go. 

Now in film/tv its common to work 12 hours a day, actually that's what you expect. This show was shooting 16-17 a day, so RED who has been working these hours already for a week straight got to come in late. 

Now nothing has actually happened yet with PAss and me but something is off with the way she interacts with me. You know the [feeling](http://i.imgur.com/NQnoMGb.gif) .

While washing dishes:



&gt;RED: Sooooo about PAss, she can be a little difficult to work with. Just a heads up. She gets a lot of work out here so, yeah, be cool. 



&gt;ME: You know I get along with almost everybody Red. 



&gt;RED: True. 


Now the day progresses, dishes are a bitch but everyone pitches in. Producers to PA's. I wash and people come help dry. When you need a pot/plate for a scene, it happens. 

Well PAss decides she's my [boss] (http://i.imgur.com/zCtbl.gif). Delegating tasks to me while she sits on her ass, kissing up to the producers. Because her [knees] (http://i.imgur.com/VVNVXBr.gif)....

End of day, all wrapped out washing dishes while everyone is eating dinner. Red helping me out. [Us](http://i.imgur.com/tBJa1.gif).


&gt;ME: No offense but I don't think I like your ""friend"". I don't know if we're going to get along. 


&gt;RED: She's not my friend and I figured you wouldn't but it'll be OK.

FAMOUS LAST WORDS.

Bonus: Lulalou was hired for the rest of the show! YAY. [MONEY](http://i.imgur.com/YmPDkwq.gif)

25imgs,10,2014-05-14,"When there is a reboot of the Spider-Man franchise in the future, here are my story ideas for the first two films.",SuckaFreeBaust,Spiderman,https://www.reddit.com/r/Spiderman/comments/25imgs/when_there_is_a_reboot_of_the_spiderman_franchise/,"Please let me know what you think and what ideas you may have.

First film:

* The film begins months after Peter is bitten by a genetically modified spider on a field trip to Oscorp Industries. Peter is in his senior year of high school with his best friend Gwen Stacey (whose father Captain Stacey was assigned to the Uncle Ben murder case), Flash Thompson, Liz Allan, Randy Robertson.

* Spidey catches criminal Herman Schultz, second in command to Mr. Big, who escapes (accompanied by flashbacks of letting the burglar who would kill Uncle Ben escape)

* Peter and Gwen read an article from the Daily Bugle about “Mr. Big’s crime ring” and also an article about Wilson Fisk’s philanthropy. At school, Wilson Fisk makes an appearance to give a speech about success in the business world.

* Rather than going through the trouble of finding Mr. Big and forcing him to give up his crime rackets, the Kingpin negotiates Schultz’s release from prison. Kingpin offers Schultz a job alongside his Enforcers if he reveals the identity of Mr. Big and if he takes care of Captain Stacey, who has been meddling in his affairs. Gives Schultz the (Shocker) suit “from his friends at Oscorp.”

* Peter and Gwen start dating. When Captain Stacey (who is a widower) picks up Gwen at the Parker home one night, he shows an interest in Aunt May (based on the USM version, she is in her mid to late forties) and sets up a date

* Mr. Big is an ordinary guy named Frederick Foswell. The Enforcers capture him.

* On their way home, Captain Stacey is killed by The Shocker, while he spares Gwen. 

* Peter consoles Gwen and reveals he is Spider-Man. With flashbacks of the night he tracks Uncle Ben’s killer, Spidey finds and defeats the Shocker.

* The Enforcers bring Mr. Big to the Kingpin, who he kills with his bare hands. Peter takes pictures from outside the building as Spider-Man

* Spidey defeats the Enforcers/Kingpin in Wilson Fisk’s office

* Peter sells pics of Spider-Man and the Kingpin killing Mr. Big to the Daily Bugle/J. Jonah Jameson

* Film ends with Captain Stacey's funeral, Flashback of Uncle Ben's conversation with Peter about ""great power, great responsibility"" just before his death, Gwen's speech at graduation.





Second film:

* Begins after the first movie, during the summer before Gwen (who is an intern at Oscorp) and Peter (who works part time at the Daily Bugle) go to college. Spidey captures small time criminal named Abner Jenkins.

* At the Daily Bugle (with J Jonah Jameson, Robbie Robertson, Betty Brant) journalist Eddie Brock questions how Peter always gets exclusive pictures of Spidey. JJ sends Peter and Eddie to Oscorp for an unveiling of their new “Venom project.”

* Aunt May is having financial difficulties and contemplates selling the house and moving in with her friend Anna Watson when Peter moves away for college in a few months.

* At Oscorp, Otto Octavius uses his mechanical harness to handle the symbiote from a distance. In another department a few floors away, Curt Connors (who has been experimenting with the genetics of lizards) mutates into a giant Lizard himself and causes a huge lab accident. 

* Peter changes into Spidey to save Gwen, and the other Oscorp employees. The Lizard defeats Spidey before escaping, spraining his arm (a nod to the comics). Doc Ock is melded to his harness and chemicals damage his eyes, forcing him to wear googles because his eyes are now sensitive to light. After the battle, the symbiote attaches itself to Peter.

* When Peter and Aunt May have dinner at Mrs. Watson’s home, he meets Mary Jane and is immediately attracted to her.

* Peter wakes up in the middle of the night to find himself fully healed and patrolling the streets in the black costume. He once again meets Abner Jenkins, who now wears a poorly constructed Beetle costume. Spidey then proceeds to beat him viciously. 

* Doc Ock, who is driven nearly insane by the accident, wakes up from a coma and blames Norman Osborn for his condition. He intends to return to Oscorp.

* Intending to write a breakthrough article, Eddie Brock begins his search for the identity of the Lizard. Brock questions Gwen, who worked under Curt Connors at Oscorp.

* Under the influence of the symbiote, Peter uses the events at Oscorp as an excuse to breaks up with Gwen because “it’s too dangerous for her to be in his life.” Peter then starts pursuing Mary Jane.

* The Lizard ultimately returns to his home to gather the rest of his research notes. Spidey arrives and severely beats the Lizard in front of his wife and son. Realizing the negative effects of the black suit, Peter decides he needs to remove it from his body. Eddie Brock witnesses this and takes pictures as evidence, immediately posting online that “Curt Connors is the Lizard! Story to come.” Spidey takes his phone/camera and destroys it, leaving Brock without any evidence.

* Spidey arrives at Oscorp to protect Norman and Gwen from Doc Ock. The battle is taken outdoors, where there is a lightning storm. Spidey leads Doc Ock to the roof of a tall skyscraper in the middle of the storm. Gwen notices Doc Ock’s vision is impacted by intense light and assists Spidey. Peter realizes the symbiote is weakened by electricity and intentionally exposes himself to it. Peter loses the black suit while Doc Ock is blinded by the lightning allowing Spidey to defeat him.

* Peter realizes he still loves Gwen.

* The black suit finds its way to the newly fired Eddie Brock, carrying the knowledge of Spider-Man’s identity to Brock. Film ends with Brock fully encased in the symbiote as Venom.

I'm aware that Amazon is well-known as a place where you're worked really hard, but I don't know what that really means in terms of programming. Should I be expecting to spend hours a day trying to learn what I need to in order to perform ""simple"" tasks? Or should I be prepared to be producing lots of code all of the time? 

Thanks in advance for any and all of your guys' input. I'm mostly just nervous as I haven't done any real work outside of academia, and have no clue what to expect. "
25irb8,8,2014-05-14,Rant Alert! Hate the way the Indian side of my family treats their daughters.,angryhalfdesi,ABCDesis,https://www.reddit.com/r/ABCDesis/comments/25irb8/rant_alert_hate_the_way_the_indian_side_of_my/,"Hi everyone,

I am not sure if this is the right sub, but I think many ABCD's can relate to this.  I am a 19 yr old female - half Indian (mom) and half White (dad).  Obviously, when my mom married my dad 23 years ago, it caused massive amounts of drama.  She was ""disowned"" by her family until I was born.

Well things got better and I went to India every summer to spend time with my Indian family and learn the culture.  I always enjoyed it and loved being spoiled by my grandparents and other relatives.  It's summer again and I am in India right now.  I came here 5 days ago and only plan on staying for 2 more weeks before I start an internship back in the U.S.

Now that I am older I am starting to see how horribly my female cousins in India are treated.  I guess I was too young and stupid to notice it earlier, but the difference in the way I am treated to the way they are treated is glaringly obvious.  

The main reason is looks.  I admit that I am a pretty even blend of Indian and white features.  I am way lighter than mom, but darker than dad.  I am also 5' 9"" while my cousins are around 5'2"" to 5'4"" - pretty standard for Indian women.  My grandmother is downright cruel to my cousins because they are ""dark and ugly"" or ""so short that no one will marry you.""  She even says crap like ""I wish you looked like angryhalfdesi.""

Umm how ridiculous is this?  Why are they being held to my standard?  It's more than likely that my height and skin color can be attributed to my dad's genes.  Why are my poor cousins expected to look like a half-white person?

The comments are especially vicious because it's summertime in India and my cousins are more tan, while I am not.  I intervene and try to call them out on it, but it's pointless.  I gave my 18 yr old cousin a pink dress from BCBG that she wanted so badly and her own mom says in front of my cousin - ""Why did you pick this color, you realize that she is too dark for it right?""  It's awful and heartbreaking!  

Why are we(yes, I do consider myself Indian) so obsessed with light skin? Why are we ruthlessly destroying the self esteem of our girls by picking on things that they cannot change without crazy surgery or dangerous skin lighteners?  I am really want to come back.  I can't stand this.  I hope my cousins get the strength to deal with this.  From what I see here, it's not like they can move out for college or work.  Rant over.

Edit - There is no such comparison between my brother and our male cousins.  His being light skinned and tall seems have no effect on the way our male cousins are treated.  Such hypocrisy!"

My school year is rumbling to a rough end, but I always have to remind myself that I'm still young and can still make something out of myself. I have some huge finals coming up, but my driving force is what I want to get out of my life over the summer. Sometimes I lose myself and start forgetting who I am; I start giving fucks and get sidetracked from what really matters in life: Myself. 

I am a very goal oriented person, and setting goals for myself gives me clear direction with what I want out of my life. I am printing this out tomorrow, and taping it above my laptop, and it will stay there until the first day of classes of Fall 2014. I just wanted to share my list with you all:

Goals for the Summer:

Make a daily schedule to do the following (Priority Order).

1.) Complete the Internship. Do your best, be the best.

2.) Learn a code language. MATLAB, C++, whatever. Learn at least one. 

3.) Continue working out. Finish that 5K. Get cut. Get sexy.

4.) Write 1 Melody a day. 

5.) Write 1 song a week. Finish 1 song a week. Finish 12 songs by summer end.

6.) Release 2 EP's. 

7.) Visit SP. Be with friends, don't be a loner.

8.) Visit Home. Don't forget your family. 

9.) Get over her. She's your friend, respect that. Everything is going to be okay. 

10.) Have fun.


I just wanted to share my method of not giving a fuck about things that don't matter in life, and taking a grip on shit that does. If this helps even one person, this post will have fulfilled its purpose. 

I also wanted to take a quick second and thank HTNGAF for helping me out through some really rough times: Thanks. "

I'm doing an internship I need to create a new database and populate it, using certain data from a different database.

In this case, I have 1 table in the other database called SAT_RESOURCE.

In this table we have a LOAD_DATE and an LCR value.

I have a FACT_MAIN and a DIM_DATE.

In the fact main I have a DATE_ID which should be the same as the DATE_ID in the DIM_DATE. And an LCR value, which should be the same as the value in the SAT_RESOURCE.

However, I need to lookup the DATE_ID in the DIM_DATE to match the LOAD_DATE in the SAT_RESOURCE.

Right now I'm using this query to join them together:

USE proberen
SELECT *
FROM [dbo].[DIM_DATE] AS d
INNER JOIN proberenDWH.[dbo].[SAT_RESOURCE] AS r ON r.load_date = d.date_name
WHERE r.load_date = d.date_name


Now my question is; How can I load the result of this query in the FACT table?"

I'm so bored of meeting men/women, being asked what I do as a day job, and get nothing but looks of disgust and condescension. More so than the unemployed or office slaves.

I'm not some fedora toting neckbeard living in my mother's basement jacking off to Linux Monthly. I work out, I eat relatively well, I play and teach guitar, go to gigs all the time, I dress well and my job pays me enough to be able to travel regularly. It allows me to pursue my interests and have a good life.

Despite this, working in IT seems to be a black mark, and I've un-pulled girls after having great conversation, kino, eye contact, jokes to be shoved away at the last minute after being asked what I do during the day. What to do? The only options seem to be ""So what? I make more money than you, enjoy your unpaid internship, asshole"", plain lying, or saying I teach guitar part time and sort of half assed mention that I mainly work with computers.

Mentioning that I find it interesting, and that it affords me a good quality of life hasn't gotten me anywhere.

There must be other people who also work in traditionally unattractive jobs finding themselves in a similar position?"

Right now I feel like shit, I really want to drop out, but it's gonna be even worse, no employer would want a college dropout to work for them!Please tell me what you think, I don't care if you want to call me lazy, or tell me I'm an idiot, I just can't do this anymore.I really need some advice ..."

I'm pretty new to this subreddit. (In fact, I'm pretty new to reddit.) So if you could please bare with me, thanks. I'm second guessing my decision to start applying to medical schools at the moment (when you see my GPA, you'll probably will too). However, I am determined to get into med school. Some how, some way and as far back as I remember, I've always wanted to be a doctor.

I graduated recently, just this past November. I'm chemistry major, and I minored in biology. I wanted to shift to psychology mid-way through college (after my devastating semester with organic chemistry), but decided I'd stick with my original major.

I grew up in the military lifestyle, so I moved residences more than couple of times. I am a US citizen and legal residence of California, but I studied and earned my degree in the Philippines at the University of the Philippines, Diliman. Why? My parents, being first generation immigrants, had a lot of doubt in being able to financially support me if I attended college in the United States. We tried to file for FAFSA, but it really wasn't enough to cover expenses. I also was unlucky with the GI bill as my dad's was not the post 9-11 GI bill, meaning he could not transfer the benefits to me. The logical and most sound decision was for me to study in the Philippines. It would be easier on the finances, and (as my parents put it) I would learn the the language and culture of ""my people"".

I'm planning on applying to UCSF, Baylor, JABSOM, and (the dream) John Hopkins. My cGPA is mere 2.8 with my sGPA at 2.7. (The language barrier and culture shock really affected my grades early on.) Some students (and a few professors) were prejudice towards me as I ""came from the immoral west"".

I have yet to take the MCAT; I plan to take it either in August or in January 2015. I have done some research: (1) I was first author and senior author of ""Primary Studies on the Toxicity of Jatropha curcas Linn. Leaves on Zea Mays and Eisenia Fetida"" (my undergraduate thesis), (2) first author of ""Risk Assessment of Jatropha curcas Linn. Extracts"" (which I presented at the 29th for the Philippine Chemistry Congress), and several other as a contributing author.

I have no clinical volunteering (unless the hours I spent in the hospital assisting nurses and the physical therapist with my bedridden aunt who has osteogenesis imperfecta can be be counted), but I've spent some time with (and earned certifications from) ARC and PRC (Philippine Red Cross). I haven't done any physician shadowing.

Other (non-clinical) volunteering I have done include the following: I assisted in relief efforts for both Typhoon Ketsana and Typhoon Haiyan. When our institute caught fire (and slightly exploded due to the heat wave of 2010), I lead several fundraising activities to help refurbish the laboratories (after all I need to, my advisers lab - where I worked - took a bad hit in the fire. Reconstruction of his lab delayed me for almost year!)

As for extracurricular activities, most were church activities; I did a lot of work with Children's Liturgy. Outside of that, tutor and mentored several student from the c/o 2015 and c/o 2016. I'm also a member of the American Chemical Society (ACS).

I was an R&amp;D intern at the Department of Natural Resources and Environment for 4 months (where I worked in the organic chemistry lab and the microbiology lab). In the summer before college, I was a lifeguard at outdoor pool at a naval station in Japan where my dad was stationed. I basically watched over the kiddie pool.

I have no immediate family members in medicine. My areas of interest are pediatrics, nutrition, and infectious diseases. I have no graduate degrees, but planning to finish a certificate course online.

I hope you all can help, give advice, comments and criticism (hopefully, the constructive kind) on my current stats."

Like majority of young Indians,I also belong to the vast pool of students trying their hands on engineering  in not so reputed college. The decision to become engineer was my own. However, despite my full blown preparation and hard work, I could not find my way into IITs  or NITs. Hence, ended up taking admission in one of the private colleges of Delhi . Currently doing b.tech in IT  ( 6th sem)   
I have high aspirations and want to do something on my own. Sadly,all these exam oriented subjects with little or no practical approach, I feel all my past semesters have been utter waste despite scoring well as I hardly remember any of the studied stuff and I hardly know anything about the practical implementation. 
Few nights back,I decided to take my education in my own hands and not depend upon useless course of the college . I did whole lot of research on Internet and within 3 days, I was equipped with the knowledge of current technological trends. I surfed through coursera courses and was stunned by the quality of courses and how primitive the education in my college was. 
I have decided to put my remaining 2 semesters to use and exploit as much of online resources like coursera, udemy, mit OCW, YouTube videos etc to expand my technical and practical knowledge. However, with the summer vacations approaching,I am in a dilemma now. Everybody is doing an internship in some company or doing a course in some institute. I couldn't manage any company as majority of them had their all internship seats filled up or required good jugaad to get into them. I did java from NIT and let me tell you,they were pathetic. The teacher didn't know java well, all the time he was confused between the syntax of C and java,Skipped loads of important topics and didn't help with summer project. I didn't want the repeat of last year. I,therefore, have decided to do the training own my own from home. I am worried about the certificate as I won't have anything to show for at the placement time. I would love to hear you people out about my decision and please suggest me which course should I pick up,I am thinking of either android programming or Web development from coursera. Please suggest me a way to obtain certification through some online  test. Also, I am very dedicated towards making my summer vacations productive and I am ready to study day and night and explore and grab as much as I can from online resources.



edit 1: I did java from NIIT. I,bymistake, mentioned it as NIT. 



Tldr:instead of doing training from an institute, I am planning to study own my own from online resources. Worried about certificate. Planning to do either android training or Web programming from online. "

$0 in debt due to scholarships.
Working an internship for $5000 over the summer. 

Need fast money for: new computer(just broke), finding an apartment, potentially a more reliable car. 

Problem: I'm a deffered action recipient. I have work authorization and an SSN but, as far as I've been told, I'm ineligible for most loans without a cosigner. My bank sent me a letter saying I was pre approved for one (5/3 equity flexli e 10000-50000) though I'm not sure if I actually qualify. 

Question: would getting this loan be a good idea? I also have 2000 in medical expenses I forgot to mention above. Are there other loans/credit cards I'm not aware of that I can use? 

Thanks sorry if this question is too moronic for Wednesday.

However, the job has been a pretty big disappointment and I'd like to see what I'm able to land in the job market right now.

I've been applying like crazy and have gotten several follow-ups but wanted to see if this would help at all.

Bit about myself: graduated with a degree in supply chain management and an IT minor exactly a year ago. Been working in basically a QA/ops role since then. I have 2 solid internships under my belt in supply chain and worked during school in supply chain and another job in IT.

I know it's a reach as the field demands experience, but I'd love to get into DW/BI (data warehousing/business intelligence). I've been trying to master T-SQL and the Microsoft SQL Server stack with classes through UW. I'm also teaching myself R and the big data stack of Hadoop+MapReduce+Hive. I'd say I'm pretty proficient in R but still working my way through the big data stuff. I'm a big fan and user of Tableau, so that's one thing I've been trying to really master as well. 

So with all that said, I know a business analyst role would be really nice to get a good mix of everything, but I unfortunately haven't gotten any response (call backs, interveiws) in that field of work. I've got experience with Python and can make programs/scripts pretty well. I know C++ as well, but it's been a while since I last wrote a line of code in it. Another position I'm interested in pursuing is DBA"
25jh9y,10,2014-05-14,I'm done letting weed fuck up the things I care about,I_pirate_cars,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/25jh9y/im_done_letting_weed_fuck_up_the_things_i_care/,"Sorry for the length, I just need to get this off my chest and know there are a couple people here who can empathize. To start, I just finished my freshman year in college. I was a huge stoner in high school, smoked at least a gram a day. My girlfriend didn't care that I smoked but she did not like how often I was high and was very clear about that. I considered it her being controlling and I basically told her to deal with it. I sort of felt like I had ""the upper hand"" in the relationship and didn't think anything would ever come of it. Well eventually she got fed up with that among other things and she broke up with me. I know it was a high school relationship and is something I should move on from, but I'm still not completely over it. I cared about her a lot, and whether or not it was naive and young, I loved her. I should have realized then to slow down. 

Fast forward to my freshman year of college. I smoked less as it was hard to get away with living in the dorms. But I still just always was wanting to get high, prioritizing it over my school work and social life. On top of depression I was dealing with, my constant desire to smoke weed led to (not terrible) but lower grades than I should have got and could definitely affect my acceptance into my school's business program, something I need to pursue the career I'm interested in. With regards to the depression, I was definitely self medicating. Smoking pot made it worse because I began to realize how much control it had over my life, which made me feel more worthless. So I got high to forget about it. It became a positive feedback loop of self destruction. 

I got a really good internship this summer, something I was really excited about and something that would be very beneficial to my future. This would help with my acceptance into the business school that I mentioned before, and had potential to balance out some of the shitty grades I had gotten. Well, there was a drug test for the job. I stopped smoking for a couple weeks prior to the test and was confident I would pass. Well I didn't, I was let go today.

Usually when I'm in a situation like this I would go get high and try to forget about this. But I'm done. I'm fucking sick of letting weed ruin shit that I care about. It's fucked up too many things for me and has no place in my life whatsoever. 

My dad works for the company and has some connections so it is possible I could get retested. Even if I do, I'll feel shitty doing it because I know it's kind of bullshit and pretty much nepotism. It just feels shitty knowing that my only hope of keeping this job is the fact that I ran to daddy and he got me a second chance I didn't deserve. But if I do get that chance, I'll swallow my pride and do whatever I can to fix this shit. If I continue to smoke weed, and not get help with this depression, I will continue fucking up these chances I was fortunate enough to be in a position to get in the first place. I have too much potential and too many opportunities that were just *handed* to me to not take absolute advantage of those things. If I keep smoking, I'm throwing all that away. And that's selfish. There are people that would kill to have my life, people in the world that can't even imagine having the things I take for granted on a daily basis. 

I've tried to quit before and it's been hard, I've ended up just going back into the old routine. But I have a feeling this time will be different. I have no desire to continue my pot smoking habits because it is the worst thing I can do to myself right now. If you read this far, thanks. And if anybody else even *thinks* that weed might be a problem for them, step back and really look at what your life is. I made too many excuses for myself and I saw the consequences. I'm just glad they weren't worse.

25jimx,29,2014-05-14,"Me [21 F] with my BF [26 M], Just over two years, he says mean things sometimes.",insertthrowawayword,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/25jimx/me_21_f_with_my_bf_26_m_just_over_two_years_he/,"Holy cow I didn't realize I wrote so much. Thank you in advance for reading what I have to say. I don't really have anyone else to talk to.


So here is my situation.


Me (21F) and my BF (26M)have been together for just over two years. I know he loves me, and I know I love him. There are times when we are driving and I look at him and think, I wanna have this guys babies.


 I can't see myself being with anybody but him. He does nice things for me sometimes, but he can also be mean when he's frustrated. He has a temper. He was in the army and has PTSD, which is tough to live with for him and myself. 


When we were on vacation in florida he had a pimple on his back that he couldn't reach and he asked me to pop it. I said ""ew that thing is huge I'm not touching it"" or something along those lines because it was really big and gross. And he gets mad and says ""What good are you if you can't pop a pimple"" He said sorry, but he was still frustrated. Not to mention he said this while I was rubbing aloe on his sunburned back. 


Then a couple weeks ago he had gotten a pool (one of those inflatable wall mart ones for 50 bucks) and I was helping him straighten it out so it would lay flat and ants were biting my legs and he was getting frustrated because I wasn't doing it exactly how he wanted me to do it. I had just gotten home from work. I was tired. I say to him ""you're not making it fun to have a pool right now"" and he replies ""well you're not making it very fun to have a girlfriend right now"" he apologized for saying that to.


I just get so mad at him sometimes. But other times I love him to sky and back. 


Sometimes when I get home from work he will say to me ""I'm hungry"" with a pitiful look on his face or he will ask me to make him food. He never says please, which is a big thing for me. I never ask someone to do something for me without saying please. I asked him once if he could say please more often and he replies ""you know, I think when someone says something like 'can you do...' a please is implied"" Sometimes I feel more like a mother than a girlfriend.


I ask him if he can chew with his mouth closed (he's a loud eater) and he gets frustrated and says ""you know, I can't breath when I chew with my mouth closed"" I have allergies. I haven't been able to breath through my nose for more than half my life. I'm no stranger to this situation. He just eats so fucking fast, I'll take three bites and he'll be halfway done. 


When we first started dating we were joking around in the kitchen and he said ""so you cook and clean and I'll make the money"" and sometimes when I ask him to help clean the kitchen he says ""that wasn't part of our deal"" in a cute little kid voice. Well him being in and unpaid internship wasn't part of it either.


But he has good qualities too. For the first six months of our relationship he didn't let me touch door handles. I had to make him let me let myself out of the car. He still opens it when I get in though. His dad raised him to be a gentleman. 


Now here's a bit about the sex life. He gets angrily frustrated when I say I don't want him to put his penis in my buttonhole. Like, I'm already letting you put your finger in there which I don't really care for but I know you like it so I do it anyway, isn't that enough for you? Isn't me giving everything other part of my body that I haven't given to anyone else enough for you? Sometimes it just feels like it isn't enough for him. And I don't like that. 


I just need advice from people who have seen or gone through something like this before. But mostly I think I just needed to tell someone. I don't have many friends outside of him. 

---   

**tl;dr**: BF can say mean things sometimes. It upsets me. He can't take criticism whatsoever. The things he does seem very inconsiderate sometimes. Am I being to sensitive?

All the wells I have been on are horizontals, and the frac can take forever. We had on start on the 5th and it is still going.

[How many times do they have to pull the drilling pipe out to drill and frac a typical well?   and how long does it take to pull a couple miles of pipe... change the bit or end equipment the replace it down the hole?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25jbn4/i_am_an_oilfield_worker_in_west_texas_with_some/chhriul?context=5)|I haven't been with a pulling unit that had to do it, but when coil has to come out from the bottom it can take a few hours. A pulling unit would take WAY longer, which is one of the reasons I don't see them very often.

25jsdl,3,2014-05-14,I now have two job offers. How do I make the right decision?,fruitblender,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/25jsdl/i_now_have_two_job_offers_how_do_i_make_the_right/,"I think I've reached the point where I have to choose the one I'll regret less. There isn't an obvious answer here, at least which I could tell. But I'd love some input that might make this decision easier. 

Both of these jobs are in IT, which is the direction I want my career to go. I currently have a little bit of support experience and am just looking to get my foot in the door and grow from there. On to the offers. 

First position is with a health insurance company. This position is a 10-week summer internship. The duties included in this job are a ""little bit of everything"", as I was told in the interview. There is no guarantee of a job at the end of the internship (which gives me a feeling its very performance based, but I haven't done an internship in a long time-and never one where I was looking for a position at the end, so I have no idea if this is a standard thing to say in internship interviews or not).

Second position is with a telecommunications company. It is contract to hire, and external customer support (read: call center). The call center is located a lot further away from where I currently live-this would give me a pretty sucky commute and I don't have a car, just a motorcycle.

The second position pays just a couple hundred more per month. I'd likely end up buying a car if I get it, which would pretty much cancel out any extra money I'd end up making. The first position is something I'm more passionate about and a work environment I'd feel a lot happier in than the telecommunications one. However, the telecommunications position is pretty much a single track into IT, performance based (which I know I can achieve). Its a lot more ""corporate america"" feeling though, which I find a little impersonal. There's also the added stress of dealing with outside customers instead of just dealing with people in the company.  

So, any input would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!"

25jvzx,1,2014-05-14,23/M Australia -&gt; Europe,[deleted],IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/25jvzx/23m_australia_europe/,"Hi all,


I'm about to finish University here in Australia with a double Bachelors in Law and Legal Practice and International Studies (International Relations and Italian majors) as well as a Diploma in French. From the end of the year I will also be able to practice as a lawyer. 

Because of the massive amount of my law graduates my odds of getting a graduate law job are slim to none. In my current city, it is estimated that there are 5 graduate lawyers for every graduate job and the odds aren't much better for other major cities. Additionally, because the current government has announced 16,000 jobs are to be cut from the public service, I have little shot of getting a job in my other area of expertise despite great grades, good extra-curriculars, great language skills etc. 

In all this was not a problem as I had previously planned to do a Masters degree in International Relations should I fail to get a government job this year in order to make myself more competitive. With the announced uncapping of University fees from 2016 here in Australia, however, it is likely that the cost of this would become excessive (&gt;$100k vs the current ~$43k) and I would never be able to pay it off in addition to my existing student debt. Although I would pay the current rate of $21k/year for the 2015 school year, the odds of the cost blowing out when the uncapping comes into effect in 2016 are quite high.

I’ve studied abroad in France before and travelled extensively. I decided long ago that I would like to move to Europe (ideally permanently) in the future, and these recent developments have sped this up. I would therefore like to know what the chances of me getting a job or paid internship in any European country in my areas of expertise (law, public policy, international relations etc) are like given that I have little professional experience. Quite low, I imagine. 
 
The other solution I thought of was to instead do a Masters degree in international law, international relations, governance or something similar in Europe, as even though I’d have to pay non-EU/EEA rates I’d probably still end up paying less money than if I were to do it here in Australia. I am aware that Germany, Norway and Finland all offer free tuition for foreign students for most programs, but the cost of living might pose a problem in that finding a job may be difficult given that I do not speak the local language. I have considered getting TEFL or CELTA certified and teaching English part time to support myself, but I have no idea about the feasibility of this idea nor whether doing that would unduly interfere with studying. 

So that leaves me with a bunch of questions I’d like some help with:

* Would it be possible for me to find a job in my areas of expertise in any European country given that I have little professional work experience? If so, how might I find these jobs?

* In the alternative, how is it best to support yourself while studying as a non-EU/EEA student?

* For countries that do charge tuition fees, are there any loan or grant schemes in place in any particular countries to aid foreign students? It is unlikely I would be able to pay 12k+ euros upfront otherwise, as I do not presently earn enough to have any savings at all. I do not have any preferences for countries, rather I would prefer a university which is decently ranked.

Thanks in advance!

25jywh,1,2014-05-14,"Frustrated about the past, worried about the future",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/25jywh/frustrated_about_the_past_worried_about_the_future/,"I am concerned about the track my life is heading, both professionally and the relationship with my wife. I'm afraid that in about 10 years Ill be left with nothing. And Im not blaming anyone, it was my own decisions that got me here. 

As far as my job goes, I work in the library field. Lets be honest, states are cutting back on funding and things like libraries and history are the first to go. Added to that, today you can pretty much download any book onto an electronic device. This is only going to increase in the coming years. Why would someone want to borrow a book that somebody's grubby hands have been allover when they can download it and have it with them on their smart phone. I feel like I am in a dying field. Funny thing is, it isnt even the field I wanted to go into. 

When I was in college I wanted to be a history professor, get my PhD and teach. I bought into the ""do what you love"" and ""your major doesnt matter, just that you graduated"" stuff. I was doing ok but then the summer before my senior year my gf (now wife) got pregnant. I had 8 months to get my entire life together. At the time I worked part time at a museum and didnt even have a checking account. Plus I was majoring in something that wouldnt turn into a job at the end of graduation (I had been applying to PhD programs). 

I had to give up on moving across country for grad school because I didnt know what would come next with the baby situation. I was working two crappy jobs and taking 20 credit hours a quarter just to get done with school as fast as possible. ALL my savings went to doctors visits and prenatal medicine. Adding to my stress, my gf would tell me that she planned to move to California (across the country) to be with her sister (a nurse who had shacked up with a doctor twice her age) because there was ""nothing left for her here."" I asked what I was supposed to do and she said ""it isnt a big deal, you can just fly out and visit us."" She turned very cold emotionally and when I would say things like ""I love you"" she responded with ""I dont care."" It was a dark place for me. 

I was trying to figure out what to do with a useless history degree and the department head said that I should go into archives. She said the pay was comparable to teachers and I could go into the school's archive grad program and I would definitely get a job. Mind you, her paycheck was dependent on me signing up for the program. 

I was freaking out about what to do with my life to secure a future for my unborn child and wife, so I went into the field. I got paid internship working at a federal facility nearby. My wife graduated with a nursing degree but decided she didnt want to go into nursing, nope, she only wanted to work part-time as a cashier at the grocery store. So I am supporting three people while making $32k a year. She still does this. I have tried to ask her to get a job that makes a better salary, or isnt for high schools, I mean she graduated magna cum laude. But nope, she just shuts down and tells me that she likes what she does and that its a good job and ""if thats the way I fell, I should take some time to think if I *really* want to be a part of this family."" WTF?!?

I didnt change career fields at the time because my boss at the internship place like my work and said that he was going to get a slot for me to be a full time researcher and in that program they would pay for my PhD. So I stuck with it thinking things were finally coming together. 

Well, then the recession hit and most of the nearby PhD programs shut down. Added to that, the slot I was supposed to get was earmarked for someone who already had their PhD or were close to finishing (ABD). So I was out of luck in that regards. Since there wasnt a future for me there, I was essentially told to move on after I finished the grad degree, which was very shortly thereafter. 

I got a two year grant position back at the university I graduated from. In that time my wife came down with depression and anxiety. She is very much a person who has to be in control of everything (I cant even do the dishes or laundry because I ""wont do them correctly."" I think a lot of her issues stem from her dad who was, I guess, emotionally abusive toward her and her sister (hence the sister dating a doctor the same age as her parents). Her dad is a major ass towards me. he had told her that I was going to leave her (which I had never planned to) and that I was cheating on her when I was spending nights working on grad school papers and working 40 hours a week (I wasnt cheating). Added to that, he convinced her to not let our son have my last name (because I would run out on the family, I guess). 

So Im working in the grant funded position and like everyday I get a call from my wife telling me that she wants to kill herself, this makes life really stressful. She is on medication now. I was luckily after the grant ended to get a job at the library, which I suck at because my grad program sucked. I dont know if the job is going to be here long because of budget cuts and since the library can get old retired ladies to do this stuff for free. 

Basically, my wife is emotionally and physically distant from me. She doesnt like giving hugs or kisses or saying love you, or anything like that. She says I bother her when we sleep together so I have slept on a couch every night for the past 9 years. I cant talk with her about these issues (job, her not being affectionate) because she shuts down and thinks Im verbally attacking her--this comes from her father I think. We have no money because I support everything on a crappy salary. Our kitchen table is held together with duct tape, I dont own a smart phone, the tv we have is the same fat back crt I bought before college in 2000. The only house I could afford was back in my very small hometown (all my friends have since left) and Im underwater on an $80k house. I dont have any friends (I think Ive always been the ""casual friend"" who was never truly part of the group). 

I am worried that as soon as my son goes off to college my wife will tell me she has to ""spread her wings and fly"" and move off to California with her sister where she will shack up with some doctor and live her dream life. Meanwhile I will be stuck in a small town and deadend job that is not marketable and no real prospects for the future. 

Basically, every decision Ive made in life has been wrong. The guys who majored in finance or engineering have amazing lives and can enjoy things, go on vacations, all that stuff. Im not financially secure, I dont know what is going to happen in ten years with my marriage, I am just worried."

Got a BSIS in 2007; Specialized in Network Administration and Security. Had a 6 month internship in 2005 as IT manager's assistant for a medium sized company doing sys adminy things.  Got first real sys admin / tech support job in 2008, had job for 6 months when the market crashed and I got laid off.  Couldn't find a job for 9 months; desperate and starving got a shit call center job doing hardware support.  Stayed there a year and a half, no opportunities for advancement, $11 dollars per hour.  Was offered a contract to hire position for a company that supported in house POS software and server/terminals, fun in SQL.  I was promised to be hired in 3 months, company gets bought and they go on hiring freeze, contract extended 3 months.  Working over nights and weekends, not seeing light of day, no social interaction, starting to go a little crazy I ask to not extend my contract another 3 months and I'm on my own again.  At this point the only jobs interested in me are POS support or customer service.  No Sys Admin jobs.  Nothing ever over 30k per year and all expect me to give up my weekends and in most cases working 3rd shift.  I get a job selling sell phones and all of the sudden I'm making 45k and I finally am offered health insurance.  I only last 6 months because I suck at sales, I'm an IT guy.  Another 8 month block on unemployment, only offers are  customer service call centers. Starting to give up.  Old college friend feels bad for me and makes a position where he works, no benefits $15 dollar per hour data center specialist for a one year contract. I'm told after a couple of months that for budgetary reasons I might have to be let off before my one year is up.

I don't know what to do with myself.  I keep getting told about ""red flags"" on my resume and how I'm not loyal to anyone.  I've been struggling ever since the economic crisis of 2008 and my career has not gone anywhere.  I'm really good at what I do, but no one will hire me to be a jr admin or anything.  I tried selling phones to see if maybe I'm good at something else, but I'm an IT guy.  Right now I'm very happy because I get to work on server administration and maintenance, but theres that cloud hanging over my head that the conversation about the budget is going to happen and once again I'll be unemployed and unemployable to no one but the customer service call centers again.  Taking one of those jobs would be like I've completely accepted defeat and said I'm worthless to my field; I would rather kill myself.  It's been 6 years and I haven't anything to show.  Is it time to throw in the towel and get a job ringing up groceries?"
25k3db,2,2014-05-14,"I fear that one of the offices in my school has acted unprofessionally towards me, what should I do?",ufotofu906,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/25k3db/i_fear_that_one_of_the_offices_in_my_school_has/,"**WARNING: LOTS OF READING AHEAD, TL;DR BELOW**

So I'm a student currently part of the co-op program at my school. For those who don't know, Co-op basically means the co-op office at my school will help you find internships and you swap semesters taking classes and working. One of the employees at the co-op office (not the head) has been acting in (what I consider) an unprofessional manner towards me and I fear it may have jeopardized my relationship with the co-op office as a whole. 

To provide some context, we had companies coming to the school and this specific employee sent an email offering a time slot to various students, myself included. I already had four interviews that day and wanted to devote the time I had to practicing for the positions that I had personally signed up for and wanted. Due to a busy week, I really only had the day before to prepare. Thus, I politely refused the offer though I did not specifically mention why (I wasn't aware how this action would affect me later on). He replied to the email, stating various reasons about how it was a bad move in an mildly agitated tone.  

My friend who happened to be in the co-op office, refused the offer in person. My friend told me the employee was visibly angry, as it appeared quite a few other students had refused as well, and he felt he was being put in a ""lose-lose situation"" as students always ""complain about not having enough interviews"" despite his current efforts. According my friend, the employee said ""he felt like he was gonna punch somebody"". My friend's reason was he had class at the time, and was also already signed up for a fair number of interviews himself but due to the employee's current disposition, thought it was best to just get the hell out of there. 

To set the record straight, I understand the employee's situation, but I believe he also generalized every student who refused his offer and it appears he took it very personally. I do not believe this is a professional way to handle things, especially in a work environment, with student's career opportunities at stake. After my friend told me about what happened, I thought it would be best if I just kept my email brief as I didn't think he'd be very receptive to any reasons I had to say. So I thanked him for his response, and told him I unfortunately had to decline again. He then replied saying how he hoped ""this decision wouldn't haunt me"". 

I was bothered by what happened but I didn't think that much of it. I was sure that he was just caught up in the moment and that this would soon become a distant memory. Unfortunately, next time I was up in the co-op office I saw two fliers (A4 size) with a picture of a doghouse and my name, my friend's, and various others underneath it. To those who don't know, ""putting someone in the doghouse"" is an idiom for saying that you're annoyed with somebody. These fliers were hung up in the middle of the office, not the employee's specifically which made me even more concerned. I had a pretty good idea what it was about, but I didn't want to jump to conclusions so I asked another employee at the office what it meant and she told me to talk to the employee that sent out the offers. He quickly said he was angry but not anymore, so I let it go because I assumed that it was going to get taken down soon if it no longer bothered them. 

A few months later and those fliers are still up. It looks like a new name was added to the list as well. I happen to walk in during lunch so most of the employees are gathered together (though not the employee I'm having problems with). The head of the co-op office is there as well. I bluntly let the group know that I'm concerned if those fliers are impacting my future career opportunities. I tell them I feel like I'm being blacklisted, and I want clarification about what those fliers are about. One of the employees then lets me know that this is a collaborative list that all the employees handle, and they put up students' names that they have difficulties with. This is so the other employees can be aware when they have to deal with them. Or something along those lines. Basically they made it sound like it wasn't a big deal, then the other difficult employee showed up, and I continued the conversation with just him in his office. 

He said the same things about how it wasn't a big deal, and how it doesn't affect my placement with future companies through the co-op office. He then goes on to clarify again about the importance of accepting interviews, which I completely agree with. I also used this opportunity to explain how I had a lot of interviews that day, and it wasn't my intention to cause him so much headache (he had to reschedule a bunch of things due to people rejecting, though in all fairness I wasn't aware of the fact that would happen, and I'm not sure why he would schedule things before people confirmed their time slots). Finally, he said he would take them down but they've been up so long that they aren't really a concern anymore. He even commends me on being one of the students to actually stay visible within the co-op office and notice the fact that those fliers are even up. For some reason I felt that this meant that the fliers were coming down he just didn't have time yet. I unfortunately don't remember too well or perhaps I just confused his statement, but his surprisingly friendly tone put me in an optimistic mood. I left the co-op office feeling like I got what I wanted.

Half a week later, so today, I come back and they're still up. I see him right away, and kind of bluntly say ""the fliers are still up, I thought you said you were going to take em down"". He then gets upset and says ""that's still on your mind? don't you have finals to worry about?"" I tell him I'm not worried about my finals (kind of rude of me but I'm pretty upset too), and he then says ""fine, I'll take em down"", he then somewhat aggressively tears the fliers down and pushes them towards my chest and says ""here take em"", I tell him I don't want them, fold them up, and place them in the trash. Then I left and went back to my apartment, unsure about what will happen the next time I go to the co-op office and what will be of my relationship with the co-op office as a whole.  

That's the last thing that happened.


---


**TL;DR:** Co-op office employee gets upset I refused his interview offer. Takes it personal, puts up two fliers with a short list of names (mine included) and hangs it up in the middle of the co-op office. I confront the co-op office about it. They say it's no big deal and that I shouldn't be worried. Nonetheless the fliers are still up. I talk to the co-op office employee in question, he says it's no big deal too and that he could take them down. Time goes by and they're still up. I bring it up again and he gets upset and rips them down and gives them to me. I place them in the trash.


---


I fear that all the employees are very close, and this includes the head of the co-op office. I believe this is not just an isolated incident with the employee I'm having problems with as the fliers were up for all to see, and not just in the specific employee's office. All the employees say there has been no effect on our job placement, but I feel that their actions indicate otherwise. There is no way of knowing about their true intentions but my current direction is to do my best to find internships on my own, and if they manage to find something for me great, but I don't plan on expecting anything. Is this the best course of action? Maybe I should confront them again? Though I'm afraid I'll just get the same responses, especially if this is something they're all in on. 

Secondly, am I right in saying that they've acted unprofessionally? It just troubles me that it seems the whole office is in on it. I'm not sure who else at my school I can talk to? A dean maybe? 

On one occasion, I've also been referred to as ""that student"" by one of the employees, which greatly troubles me since I had no intention of causing them any grief, but they seem to look at it differently. Any insight into how I should proceed would be greatly appreciated.

I am currently studying Software Engineering(first year) and this summer I decided to find myself a project to work on so I can show it to recruiters for a potential internship opportunity next summer(2015). I have been researching a lot and I read all the ""Developing for the rift;Where to start?"" thread on the subreddit, and I just want a reality check: I know and understand programming principle, I know Java from a class and Objective C from the Big Nerd Ranch book. I have never opened a game engine. My question for you guys is: is it realistic to believe that I can create a small demo, for the rift with my current knowledge and learning C++,Python and Unreal Engine 4?

I have heard that once you know a language, it is at least easier to learn another one (C++ and Python in my case )

Thanks for the help everybody.

25kdlg,4,2014-05-14,Millennials in the Insurance industry - Q&amp;A,monroe23,Insurance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Insurance/comments/25kdlg/millennials_in_the_insurance_industry_qa/,"My most recent blog post:

Let’s face it, for millennials – anyone born roughly between 1980 and 2000 – the insurance industry is not typically regarded as the most exciting career path to follow. But much of this is based on a lack of awareness and misinformation about the realities of working in the industry. I caught up with Derek Dow, Assistant Vice President at Integro Insurance Brokers, to get his firsthand perspective on what it’s like to be a millennial in the industry.

So, what they say really true? Do most people end up working in the insurance industry because they have a family connection to the business or because they simply ‘fell into it’?

DD: In my personal experience, that was true, to an extent. I studied finance and accounting in university, and interned one summer with a forensic accounting firm that worked a lot with insurance companies.  Although I had never specifically planned to work in the insurance sector, I was always focused on a career in financial services. But, as a business major, most of the careers I was exposed to were the more traditional banking and accounting opportunities.

Why did you choose insurance over those other career paths?

DD: I had the chance to intern for a large multinational insurance company in my final summer of university. What I found most surprising was how no two days were ever the same. I was able to use a wide variety of skills – interpersonal, analytical, networking, and so on – while still able to draw upon the business acumen I had learned in school. Since I was never pigeonholed into doing only a bunch of repetitive tasks, my job never got boring. That’s when I knew I was in the right career.

What’s surprised you the most about the industry?

DD: The sheer size of the industry was shocking to me. I feel like for most people, insurance is something you mainly think about for your car or your home. I didn’t really appreciate what a large portion of the financial services sector is represented by the insurance industry because of how little mainstream attention it receives.

On that note, how do you think the insurance industry can better attract millennials away from the more traditional financial services roles in banking and accounting?

DD: With little to no real world experience, most millennials form opinions of different careers using rough estimations of what people tell them – be it parents, classmates, recruiters, etc. For careers in insurance to join that conversation, companies need to do a better job of educating students on what their career path in the industry could look like. I’ve witnessed a push towards this in the last five years with increased on-campus recruitment and dedicated insurance career fairs, but there is still room for improvement. Volunteering to speak at campus engagements, formalizing internship programs, and mentoring are all opportunities for organizations, big or small, to connect with the next generation.

Recruiting is one thing, but retention is equally, if not more important to building a strong workforce. How does the industry manage to retain its young talent?

DD: In my experience, this industry is a real meritocracy. While tenure and experience can work to your advantage, particularly in client facing roles, I don’t think they are determining factors in one’s career success and, ultimately, you get what you put in. There is definitely the opportunity for a great work-life balance in this business, but those who put the extra effort and go the extra mile are usually rewarded for doing so. The fact is, given the ageing demographics of the workforce today, senior leaders are looking for young people to step up and take more responsibility. In my mind, that is a fantastic motivator to keep ambitious people engaged.

You bring up an interesting point.  Stats show that almost 25% of Canada’s insurance sector workforce is expected to retire between 2007 and 2017, and the numbers are similar in much of the US and Europe. How do you think this dynamic affects today’s workplace for millennials?

DD: I’d say the wealth of experience these seasoned professionals have to share is an amazing chance for millennials to learn the business. Many of these people are extremely busy but, in my experience, they are also overwhelmingly willing to mentor and develop newcomers. Sure, with such a big age gap there are generational differences. We grew up on the internet so it’s no surprise that most millennials prefer sending emails over picking up the phone. But, along with our iPhones, we bring fresh perspectives to an industry that could use some innovation. These dynamics create a rare opportunity for our generation to shape what the industry will look like over the next 20 to 30 years.

That’s a good observation. Is there any last piece of advice you’d like to share with millennials who are preparing to enter the workforce?

DD: Take the time to research and understand what different career paths look like, and see how that lines up with your skills and interests.  Above all else, a successful career is one you enjoy.

The role I am trying to acquire is an internship. Now, I do not know what to send. I have little to show (I have just started looking at personal projects/open source work to do over the next year and a half before I graduate) apart from what I have done in my course work. One is quite a large project, but I feel that it does not exemplify my skill set well. I have, on the otherhand, several implementations of classic algorithms that I have coded optimally and commented extensively. One is of a colormatching bipartite graph problem and the other is of Dijkstra's algorithm using a priorty queue. I am afraid if I send either of these it will look like a cop out as both are classic problems in computer science that any student should be able to complete, however I believe both show concisely how I structure programs. I am not sure what the best option is here."

What follows is a fragment of a transcript of an episode of Countdown, which was considered so entertaining that it could never possibly be broadcast, in case people never got over the shock and expected this standard of television every week. The BBC have denied all rumours of its existence, but due to the bitterness of an underpaid and ignored intern, we have managed to acquire this small excerpt.

Nick Hewer: ‘‘So, now we hand you over to Susie in the Dictionary Corner to explain the origin of today’s phrase, one I’ve enjoyed using at countless football games whenever a player has had one too many late night take-aways : ‘’Get your tits out for the lads’ ‘’.

Susie Dent: ‘’ Definitely a phrase I’ve heard quite a few times in my life!’’
(Polite Laughter from all, one or two admiring glances at her chest.   Rachel Riley surreptitiously adjusts her dress around the bosom.)

‘’This phrase has quite a storied upbringing. During World War II, the development of safe methods of encrypting messages became vitally important to the war effort, and all sorts of devious ways were devised in order to safeguard important information. However, these mainly applied to information via radio, and when meeting another operative in person, the old methods of hiding secret messages up your backside quickly became redundant as any captured spy would simply have it removed. Also, the German spy network also had an uncanny ability to guess the passwords used by British Intelligence to ascertain whether the person they were meeting clandestinely were not German spies, they being predominantly based on the names of female characters in the Biggles series of adventure books.
Nick Hewer: ‘’ If only they had used the Flashman books, they would never have guessed. That man was a philanderer without parallel.’’

Susie Dent : ‘’Indeed. This tricky situation led to the startling and ingenious idea that fingers, which have very individual and unique patterns, have an even more useful counterpart in this area, the nipples, or more correctly, the areolas of nipples.

The areolas of nipples have little bumps on their surfaces, called Montgomery glands or areolar skin glands. Their function is partially unknown, but scientists suppose they secrete a liquid that lubricates the nipple/areola area. These little bumps create a ‘fingerprint’, unique to each individual. Each agent would then be assigned a number, based on the sum of the distances from the centre of the nipple to the five largest Montgomery Glands, excluding those on the rim of the areola. This then would be verified by the agent arranging the meeting, by measuring these distances with a callipers and cross checking with the number given to them by MI6 for that agent. The reason why nipples were chosen as opposed to fingerprints were the fact that very few situations call for the bare nipple to be exposed, making it difficult to measure the distances involved without being noticed whereas fingerprints can be obtained more easily. This practice of lifting one’s shirt at the beginning of a meeting became known as ‘Saluting the Fuhrer’, and then more colloquially, ’getting your bits out for the Queen’.
It was only after the War had ended, with the advent of free love and the widespread availability of the Pill that attitudes towards sexuality and sex began to change sufficiently enough that the phrase ‘Get your bits out for the Queen’ could evolve into ‘Get your tits out for the Queen’, the former being thought too stuffy and old hat for that generations swinging new hipsters.

Finally, the pit strikes in the Thatcher era put an end to the phrase in this form, the Queen being damned by association with the ruling Establishment elite. A bold move to reclaim the phrases for the working classes was initiated by no less than Arthur Scargill, who is credited with the first recorded use of the phrase in a speech he gave to a miner’s union in Pontypridd, Wales, in which he recalls all the brave men and women who ’got their tits out for the lads’ to save Britain from Hitler and his hordes of Nazis, and ‘who would stand up and get their tits out for the lads, in this, our most dire hour of need.’
Nick Hewer:’’ An interesting story indeed.  Would I be correct in saying the feminists in the Seventies used the saying as a symbol of male oppression against women, and staged a campaign based on this? I’m reasonably sure something like that happened.’’

Rachel Riley:’’ Oh yeah, I remember my Mum showing me pictures of her and her friends protesting outside a football match with a banner that said ‘Oi!! Fattie!! Get YOUR tits out for the lads’, and them jumping on random lone football fans and pulling their tops off in order to show them what it felt like to be treated like an object. There is even a photograph of my Mum being baton charged, and two protesters lying atop a policeman and suffocating him by squashing his face into their enormous bosoms, supposedly asking him ‘how did he like them now’. Bless.’’

(Again, polite laughter all round, and again one or two admiring glances at Susie Dent’s chest, which she catches and acknowledges with an embarrassed giggle. Rachel Riley stares daggers at her, and mouths the word ‘bitch’ quietly, but not quietly enough as her microphone picks it up.)

Nick Hewer:’’ That was an entertaining story indeed. And now, onto the final letters round of the day. Over to you, Rachel....’’

From what i hear from my friend who does professional tax returns is that i will receive majority of that money back since i am a college student and it was a college program.

I am currently holding the money as an emergency fund for my family as my family isn't in best income situation. 

Here is my expense/debt/income situation

1. Paying off credit card more than monthly. 721 credit score 1.5 years ago and hoping it went up after i kept up with credit cards and payed off private school loan. ( Current $140 credit card)

2. Graduate in may 2015 with projected 30-35k in federal loans(mix of both sub and unsub).

3. Possible 65k job offer in one year?

4. Drive a 16 year old car with 104k miles on it. Runs ok but has $700 needed for repairs. I paid 1700 for it in Dec 2013 with 98k miles. 

5. Car insurance is 1800 yearly(liability)

Just started learning about investment and want to start early in saving for retiring. 

Should i invest in roth ira now or wait till i get full job offer first?

My dilemma is what should i do with my potential 15-18k that i will have by end of graduation in one year? ( working during the school year that covers expenses like food/phone bill. Rent is covered through school since i will be now living offcampus which is cheaper than on-campus.

I see myself as someone who is good in handeling money especially since i grew up in a household with a combined income of ~30k and do not know fully how to approach finance like colleagues at work. They have been giving me tips but, i still cautious.

I have the temptation to buy things like a new car but hesitating because i might make a bad decision?

**Episode 9: Honey, I called the Electricians**

__________________________________________________________

As I walked in today with my coffee and cream cheese bagel in hand I felt a calm that I had not felt in a long time, but I should have known that fate was about to take that calm, throw a burrito at it's face, stick it in a glass box of emotion, and then shove it catapult it back at me.

**2 hours to incident**

Sitting at my desk drinking coffee and reading over the ticket queue, I see a motion in the corner of my eye over by the door. I think nothing of it. Then I hear loud foot steps approaching followed by another motion by the door. Still, I think nothing of it. Next I hear 2 pairs of loud foot steps approaching. This time I look up. I see two men walking by. They are carrying a ladder and one is also carrying a large tool bag. 

Electricians.

I don't know how your electricians are, but the electrician company we use is notorious for hiring and sending us horrible... electricians. (Almost said ""techs"" there for a moment) So my general attitude towards hearing the busy boot steps of electricians in hallways is... oh how do I put this nicely... negative.

I felt a disturbance in the force.

I dropped my bagel, set down my coffee, and walking out of the room I patted USER real quick. (If you don't know who ""USER"" is, read my previous tales) I then went to find IT Head to discover the nature of the visiting electricians.

&gt;Me: Hey, IT Head, what is up with the electricians?

&gt;IT Head: Oh, they are installing some ceiling mounted projectors in the meeting rooms.

&gt;Me: So that means they will be cutting holes in the walls and ceilings huh?

&gt;IT Head: Yup.

&gt;Me:*oh god*

&gt;IT Head: Could you please go make sure all important drives have been backed up today.

&gt;Me: On it, boss.

In anticipation of typical electrician failure (power outage due to lack of intelligence) I set out to back up important images and network drives. Unfortunately we had decided to switch from Microsoft Word 2007 to Microsoft Word 2013 so some of the techs and an intern were busy with the drives I needed.

**30 minutes to incident**

I am finally able to get in to start backing things up. A boring task that I was luckily able to draft my friend who is also a tech and helped me get this job to help me. Unfortunately he was called away to go help some drivers with a work station issue (Read Episode 3) and I was called away to go help some $users in the Marketing department with the new way MS Word looked. They were ""very confused and didn't understand the new layout"" as I was told.

I walked away from my task. Going out the door, I turned and looked back at the room. I could almost interpret the humming of the drives as ""Professor_Derpsalot, please back us up to save us from the electricians!""

**3 minutes and 45 seconds to incident**

After having finished dealing with the Marketing $users I began to fast walk back to my helpless network drives. I walked by one of the meeting rooms and could hear the buzzing of a jig saw cutting dry wall. I had gone down the stairs and was on the opposite side of the level containing the network drives.

*click*

Lights go out, fans stop spinning, and you could hear all the hard drives spinning down.

**Shit**

* Public Relations
* Event Planning (Operations/Logistics?)
* Sales of some kind?
What else??? This is the hardest part for me -- I know SO LITTLE about the specific jobs/titles that would be a strong fit.

Experience (some of these overlap/come from the same job): 

* customer service and food service (2-3 years)
* receptionist/administrative work (4-5 years if you count internships; 2-3 if you don't)
* journalism/editorial/writing work (5-7 years, on and off, but a lot more if you were to count the college newspaper)
* marketing/event planning (some summer internships and such, and for certain events at certain jobs)
* transporting human remains for a funeral home (1 year and 2 months)
* online tutoring/grading SAT essays (i think 3 years)

More about me:

* I love and am good at working with people and with words.
* My written work has been published a lot of times online and in print locally in a major major city, and I've freelance written/reported a teensy bit for two major national tabloids.
* I'm very good with computers and have worked with a LOT of different specialized software programs (music and video editing, e-mail marketing, newspaper layout, more) and will happily use this skill to a point, but I find that too much screen time kills my eyesight, my waistline, and my desire to live.
* Room for GROWTH/CHANGE is really important to me. I like to work my butt off to master every job, and it's really frustrating when that work leads to a whole lot of nowhere.
* I would LOVE to work abroad or to have to travel abroad a lot for work, specifically in Spanish-speaking countries, but I know this makes things a bit harder...especially since my Spanish is only basic-to-conversational.

Any and all suggestions or pieces of advice are appreciated! Please don't tell me this is too general or too wild or that you hate me because I don't absolutely have to work right now. I know I'm privileged and I know I'm asking a lot, but I really need help figuring stuff out. My last post was a LOT less accurate and a lot more scattered and I already got reamed out for that :) Thank you in advance."

2. What is Silicon Valley?

3. What is the pay range for Computer Engineers?

What are some good CS programs in Georgia? Besides Georgia Tech?
I don't really have the grades or the test scores for Georgia Tech (3.7 uw GPA and 1650 on the SAT, 2 AP classes so far, 4 AP classes next year), and I was just curious if there were any other notable programs in Georgia perhaps closer to mid-tier.  I know transferring into Georgia Tech is a popular option, but I was just curious if there were any other solid programs in Georgia just incase that doesn't work out.  I know internships are a huge part of getting a job, any good internship programs in a school in Georgia?

And are there any decent Computer Science schools that are not too selective/difficult to get into around the country?  I'm just talking about a school that has decent job fairs and a respectable computer science program, nothing too prestigious or anything.

25l6k0,6,2014-05-14,I hate myself for being a slave to stupid Adderall.,[deleted],confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/25l6k0/i_hate_myself_for_being_a_slave_to_stupid_adderall/,"[Light]

I'm both worthless with and without Adderall. It's the reason I'm so irritable, emotional, discontent, and unhappy- to list a few.

I can't get out of bed without taking my pills. Then once I'm ""up"" and past the funny heart flutters, I dedicate my ""energy"" to meaningless ""self - improvement"" shit where I scour through 20 tabs of a mix of nose job reviews, local boot camps for exercise, hairstyles on Pinterest, recipes for starting my dogs on homecooked meals, volunteer opportunities, and before and afters of Invisalign patients. Have I followed up on any of these exhausting searches? No.

I'm a 25 year old married woman who just graduated with my bachelors. I've been on Adderall since I was 17. I complained to my psychiatrist that I had zero motivation in regards to studying, so he paired my Prozac with Adderall. Adderall was my life saver- it's how I finished my bachelor's with a 4.0. I've never been good about taking my Prozac, even after all these years. Adderall was enough for me, it was my happy pill. Adderall isn't so bad when I'm out and busy- like when I was doing my internships or taking classes. I've hated my love for the pills for a few years now, but it's definitely worse with the more down time I'm having since I graduated.

I know how stupid I am for not taking my Prozac. It's probably the reason I feel the way I do. I don't know why I'm so stupid about it. I get so frustrated with my husband when he forgets his daily anti-depressant. ""You can't just forget it, babe. You'll send your body out of whack- it knows it's missing something."" I also understand how important it is to practice cognitive therapy- ""whenever a negative thought creeps into your head you HAVE to make the conscious decision to push it out and think of something positive."" I'm this big dumb hypocrite.

I can barely stand up in the shower without my Adderall, my life revolves around it, yet I don't give a shit about my Prozac.

I can't be social without my adderall, but I don't feel like my true self with it, and if I don't take it I don't have the energy to be social. It's a bull shit cycle. I don't even know who I am without it because I don't let myself go without it because how else am I supposed to walk down the stairs and engage in conversation?

I guess I'm just wondering if anyone else has been here. I feel so weak and powerless and lazy and gross.

The project manager reached out to me again this March and asked me if I can participate in another project in May, which I accepted.  However the project was pushed back to late-June.

Today I received a call from the HR at company A, they gave me an offer to their IT department internship, they gave me till next Monday to consider the offer.  On the phone I told the HR about the creative department project that I accepted ahead of time.  I thought its better to let them know about it instead of letting them figure out that I was working in two roles.  

The HR thanked me and said will discuss this will the project manager from the creative department, and said it shouldn't be a big deal.  Since that position does not require me to work onsite and only has a maximum of 40 hours.  

So now I am wondering if I said stupid things...I just don't want this to cause a conflict and want them to know ahead of time.  Will this hurt my internship offer?

25lcxs,1,2014-05-14,How do I bring up my depression/suicidal thoughts to my parents?,throwaway5123612,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25lcxs/how_do_i_bring_up_my_depressionsuicidal_thoughts/,"I'm probably among the some of the luckiest college kids there are in terms of building a foundation for a fantastic career. My parents are helping me pay for my college degree, I just started a full time internship with an IT company over the summer, and when school starts again, I'll move to part time where they will work around my schedule. My parents have offered to let me live at home for free once I'm finished with school, in order for me to pay off the student loans quickly that I had to take out (they couldn't pay for all of it). I'm basically set for a wealthy and successful life come 20 years from now. I'm grateful for everything my parents have done for me, and I recognize that thousands of other kids would gladly trade places if they were given the chance. Yet, not a day has gone by over these last two years that I haven't thought about suicide.

6 years ago, I lost my faith and started to consider myself an atheist. My parents, who are extremely religious, have embraced my decision and don't bother me about it (again, I am so lucky to have such amazing parents). My depression started when I finally realized that if there is no afterlife.....then whats the point of living? Ever since that moment, I've lived in this never ending depressed state; yet I guess you can consider it a mild depressed state. I don't miss class, I keep my grades up, and I go to work every day. But I still welcome the thought of death; the eternal sleep where I can finally stop worrying about all of the meaningless stresses that life throws at you. I sometimes lay awake at night thinking about all of the stupid things that I care about and worry over, such as getting an A on my project, or finishing my report for work. None of it matters in the long run, nothing that I do now takes away from the fact that I will die some day and everything will be for nothing.

The reason I've gone all of these years without a single suicidal attempt is because I don't want to throw away all of my parents hard work they have put into giving me the best shot possible at being successful. But just because I haven't attempted suicide yet, doesn't mean I won't in the future. I am sick and tired of living every single day of my life with the thought that nothing I do matters. I want desperately to be happy, and to get this depression and these suicidal thoughts out of my head. Right now, I only live for the sake of other people, but I want to live for my sake! So I want to tell my parents how I am truly feeling, and hopefully go to therapy or something. Keep in mind they are extremely religious, and I'm not sure how they will necessarily react to the news that I want to kill myself (suicide is a no-no to Catholics). 

What do you think would be the best way to talk to them about finding a therapist?"

25ljs0,9,2014-05-14,I dread my birthday every year because all it does is remind me of how empty my life is.,Figbunz,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/25ljs0/i_dread_my_birthday_every_year_because_all_it/,"**tl;dr: Emotionally neglectful childhood bred a very lonely, empty adult who worries about her ability to make meaningful connections with others.**

Tomorrow, May 15, 2014, I turn 22 years old and I've never had a birthday party. It's been probably 10 years since I got a birthday gift from anyone in my family. Since I never had a party, few people outside of my family ever knew my birthday, so I never got many gifts or well-wishes from anyone. I remember in like 10th grade, coming to school expecting my years-long friends to know it was my birthday, and it wasn't until a teacher called me out that they realized it. It hurt my feelings, but not a lot. I mean, I made it 16 years without anyone caring about my birthday, so why should it change then? It's weird to think that I went to birthday parties all the time as a kid, gave other kids gifts and cards every year, but it never occurred to me that I could have, should have had the same things for myself. But I guess I never felt special enough to warrant that kind of attention.

I remember-- from childhood all the way through high school-- listening for my mom's car to arrive home so I could run downstairs and catch her as she came into the house, desperate for five or so minutes of her attention before she disappeared into her room and me back into mine. I felt silly having to corner my mom for her attention, but I inexplicably did it every day. I had four siblings but we never interacted. I cooked my own meals from grade school until high school when my mom's boyfriend moved in and she started cooking again. I guess you could say I lived the first 18 years of my life ""alone in a crowded room."" In the summer, I could have disappeared for days on end and nobody would have noticed. I know this is true because I spent whole days on end alone in my room, completely undisturbed, unacknowledged even if I passed a sibling on the way to the kitchen or bathroom. I had a few ""school friends"" but I might have seen them once or twice throughout the whole summer.

The worst part is, I didn't know how wrong all this was as I lived it. I thought that everybody lived like I did. You see stuff on TV and in school about physical/sexual/mental abuse, but not a lot on neglect, and virtually nothing on the type of neglect I experienced. I don't know how else to describe it except that I wasn't really... loved? Valued? Nurtured, I think is the word I'm looking for. How is a child supposed to know she's special if nobody tells her? Spends time with her? Teaches her how to share herself with others?

I spent half of today agonizing over whether or not I should text people and invite them to go to the bar with me tomorrow. How could I possibly demand that much attention from people? How could I ask people to go out of their way to see *me* just because it'll be May 15? I'd die before I made a facebook event. *""How conceited would I have to be to do that?""* I think as if I didn't go to 20 birthday parties this year that all had facebook events created by the birthday girl/guy and thought nothing of it. And then I think, *""It's not like anyone would come, anyway.""*

This is my problem. Or the result of all my problems, or something. I can't shake the feeling that I'm not worthless. I don't know how to describe it. Like I know I'm a decent person and a productive member or society, but I'm just not special, just not a part of society.

Sometimes, I feel so alien that I want to scream, but I don't know if anyone would understand me if I tried to explain it, not that I could bear to burden someone's time with my stupid problems. From the outside, I look normal. I'm clean, averagely-attractive, succeeding in school and work. I want so intensely for people to like me, to think I'm normal, to be my friend like I see other people being friends. What kills me is that people in my program (about 110 people in my class) see me as fairly popular-- I can walk up to anyone and talk to them, everyone knows who I am, I got elected to a committee, all that jazz-- but I feel like nobody really knows me. Probably 10 people have my phone number. It blows my mind to think that people just text each other for fun, because they're bored and want to talk to each other. I guess there's so many people out there that nobody really needs to talk to *me*. 

I'm slowly getting better at recognizing my own worth-- every month, I feel like I'm getting better-- but as I become more comfortable with the idea of being worthy of getting close to people, another deep-rooted insecurity crops up: Do I even have the emotional capacity to be close to people?

I would describe my baseline feeling as ""emptiness."" I'm almost totally incapable of processing intense feelings on either side of the spectrum. Anything you'd expect to incite an especially positive or negative reaction short-circuits me straight back to emptiness, with just a hint of the appropriate emotion. Death of my father? Emptiness, kinda sad. Accepted into my years-long-goal program? Emptiness, kinda happy. Got the internship? Got dumped? Friend tried to commit suicide? Lost my virginity? My birthday? Emptiness, kinda _____. Then I realize that I *should* have more feeling about those things and I get just upset enough that I can feel cripplingly ashamed and self-conscious. Shame and self-consciousness are two of the emotions I'm capable of feeling intensely, the others being anger and guilt.

I'm so desperate for affection/attention but also so afraid of it. What do you even do when somebody loves you?? I'm just normal enough to get KINDA close to somebody, but then I balk and either sabotage the relationship or distance myself. I get cold feet just trying to make friends with someone (how even do you do that, become legitimate friends with people?), let alone when I date a guy. I sincerely don't want a boyfriend just because I don't want to shit on some good man because I'm too emotionally unavailable to have an adult relationship.

Will I feel this way for my entire life, or can I learn to feel? Did I miss the boat when I was developing and those abilities are gone forever, or can I still become... totally human, I guess? Can I be just like everyone else and have normal friendships and relationships? Next year, could I make a facebook event inviting people to celebrate my birthday with me?

I can't really say that I love anyone or that I'm confident anyone loves me, at this point. I say I want friends but at the same time, I'm very ""out of sight, out of mind."" I can't bring myself to make the first move in trying to meet up with people because I feel guilty asking for their attention and self-conscious about putting myself out there. And like always before, nobody is gonna go out of their way to include me. Friendship is a two-way street and I can't figure out how to navigate either lane. I could probably go the rest of my life without talking to my family and not miss them. Not in a malicious way, I just don't care about them and they don't care about me. I think I'm mostly fine with that, except I do resent my mother especially for neglecting me so. Not so much because I suffered at the time, but because I'm suffering now and I may suffer forever because she didn't teach me how to love.

I feel like I'm going to miss out on all the best things in life. What do I have to live for if I can't love? I would never kill myself (for some reason-- nothing really is stopping me but I just *know* I wouldn't do it) but what's the point of life if I can't make friends or fall in love? If I can't even feel proud of my accomplishments? Am I just going to keep coasting by on nothingness, hit all the milestones of life and feel nothing, build a family I have no idea how to be a part of? I don't have any answers.

Thanks for your help!
25lv4i,2,2014-05-15,Could use some advice,Gilad1,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/25lv4i/could_use_some_advice/,"So without giving more personal information that needed, here is the situation.

I live in St. Louis, MO.  I'm very interested in IT audit and am pursing a double degree and a minor.  My degrees are in Accounting and Accounting Systems and Forensics with a minor in Information Systems.  I will have 150 hours when the fall semester ends and I am currently involved with my local ISACA chapter and state CPA society.  The only work experience I have is with a law firm that I helped digitalize for a year as well as have the owner show me around the law field since I was considering going to law school at one point and work study jobs.  I am sitting for the CISA in June.  My GPA overall and with both of my majors is around the mid point of 3.1 and 3.2.  My GPA in my minor is a 4.0.

This spring I applied to many places for internships and entry level positions for IT audit, Internal Audit, and External Audit.  This resulted in a total of 5 businesses that gave me interviews with 3 of them going to the final phases of the interview processes.  I did not get a single offer.

Recently I applied to more places for entry level positions and a few part time jobs.  One included a part-time job as a bank teller that they didn't even want to interview me for.  I'm still waiting to hear back on the rest.

Now then, with all of this information given, I could really use some advice // insight on what it means.  I've been a bit bummed out lately because I just feel like no matter what I do, I'm just getting rejected.  Interviews I felt went very well with the places that resulted in final phase interviews, The interviews lasted about an hour each with me taking about 15-30 minutes asking them questions and the interviewers taking about 30-45 minutes to ask me questions.  The 2 that did not proceed to go into final phases I did not interview very well for because I didn't have much interview experience and had little to ask even though I researched the company beforehand because I wasn't sure what I should ask.

Questions that have been circling my mind:
Is my GPA too low?  Is it because I don't have a degree yet?  Is there something wrong with my personality(I know this one can't be answered here)?  What is it that is going so wrong for me that nobody wants me for anything.  I can't even get an interview for a teller position.

Everything I hear from people in this area and all I really hear are: There is a greater demand than supply for IT auditors, it's pretty easy to get into the field, you're doing everything right to start your career, you're doing more than most people are doing at your grade level, etc...

I'm just feel depressed at this point.  If any of that were true, why is it that I can't get an offer and get the constant rejections.

Can anybody help me out on this?

Apologies for how long this is and if it doesn't make a lot of sense.  It's late for me to be typing this and after a long day of work (My workstudy is continuing through the summer before I'm no longer able to work there), dealing with people in regards to my birthday (I woke up with the teller rejection this morning, was a great start), and studying for my summer courses + CISA exam... it's been a rather exhausting day.  I hope this makes sense, I could really use some help here.  I'm not giving up on the job search, just it's depressing to get told basically all positives and have job searches come back all negatives.  It really makes me feel like there is something wrong with me that is causing businesses to reject me.  Let alone the stress of graduating at the end of the year and job prospects are looking bleak based off of this.

At this point I'm just rambling and I'm going to end this massive text wall now.  I'm honestly appreciative of anyone who reads all of this and can offer me any advice.

Thank you for your time,
Long time subreddit lurker."
25lwrk,3,2014-05-15,I'm [21 F] finding myself constantly pissed off at my [21 M] boyfriend,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/25lwrk/im_21_f_finding_myself_constantly_pissed_off_at/,"And I hate it. We have been together officially for about three months (coincidentally the time period in which all of my past relationships have ended for one reason or another), but we've been seeing each other for eight months. I'll try to break this down for the sake of readability...sorry it's still going to be a short novel.

**Some context on him**:
He's five months younger than myself. He is the first guy I've been in a relationship with for almost three years. He's the youngest in his family after three sisters and the only boy, so he's used to being catered to quite a bit. His dad is a doctor and his mom is a nurse. I'm really hoping you guys will be able to connect the dots from here.  

**The good times**:
We were originally supposed to be friends with benefits, by his suggestion. At the time, I was looking for a serious relationship, but found myself in a dry spell, so I went along with it. As time passes, we spend more time together outside of his apartment; I'm hanging out with his friends, he's hanging out with mine and we find out that we actually have a lot in common. As we grew more comfortable around each other, things were fantastic. I was able to be myself, in all of my respective weirdness, around him and vice versa. About a month and a half into the official relationship, he tells me he loves me. I didn't return the sentiment at the time, not because I didn't have those feelings for him but because I wanted to be absolutely sure before I said it. I told him I loved him about a month later. 

**The problem (Brace yourself, it's long)**:
It started getting bad about three weeks ago. I planned to spend dead week with him at his apartment; this was pretty common, I spend a lot of time over there. I would usually clean his apartment for him while he was in class or studying at the library (because I wanted to and I enjoy cleaning). I had an attitude this week because we both deep cleaned it about four days before I came over that week. The place was spotless. I get to his place and I literally can't see his floor, he has three open Oreo boxes *in the bed*, a considerable stack of pizza boxes on his dresser and two full garbage bags next to his overflowing trash can. As irked as I am, I clean anyway. I chose not to say anything about it this time just because I would usually tease him for being messy and it was close to finals week, so I laid off. Throughout the rest of that week, I found myself finding his jokes thoroughly annoying and unfunny, mainly because I started to notice that he will either piggyback or totally copy my jokes...and repeat them. To save myself from sounding like a self-absorbed bitch who tells her boyfriend he's unfunny, I just chuckle and move on, but it's now almost impossible to smile when he makes a joke. I'm upset because the teasing that I used to love in the good times is now sending me over the edge in the complete opposite direction. Think obnoxious younger brother behavior and that's his sense of humor as I perceive it.

When we were FWBs we would have sex twice a day, good sex. Even when we started dating officially, we would still go after each other. Lately, I hardly ever want to have sex; 99 percent of the time he initiates and about 60 percent of the time I actually respond. To twist the knife a little deeper, it doesn't feel that great anymore unless I drink. This week, he came over to my place to hang out. We were both on the couch just playing video games on our respective laptops. He would try to gently scratch my head or rub my shoulders, because I usually enjoy that, and I reacted like an old cat. 

**Why this is a problem**:
I love the kid. He's the first person in two years who I've been this comfortable around. He's smart, funny and sincere. He holds my hand in public, brags about me to his parents, and buys me gifts every once in a while just because. In hindsight, I should have probably spoken about this to someone before it got this bad, but I don't think it's right or just to talk poorly of your SO to other people. 
- - - - - - - - - - - - 
Yet, I feel like if I don't just rage on someone about him, I will snap and lose it at my SO over something stupid. It almost happened already! (WoW references ahead) We were playing together and because we were in a group we had to roll for this super rare piece of loot. He knew I needed it because the stats of the loot were specific for my class, not his. Instead of passing, he rolled and ended up winning the loot. It was soulbound, so he couldn't trade it with me. I immediately shut my laptop, packed my things, flipped him off and left. I don't even react that way when I'm playing with my friends!
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
I'm sickened with myself for how I've been toward him and I desperately want to overcome this. I know that he does so much right, but all I can see is what he does wrong. Even when he makes an effort to fix his behavior, he still manages to annoy me somehow. I feel guilty and depressed about the whole situation.



---   
**tl;dr**: I love my boyfriend, but he also makes me want to punch him in the face...all the time. How do I overcome this? Am I just being an over-analytical douche? How do I not be an over-analytical douche?

EDIT: Just remembered a pivotal piece of information: we both live in Oklahoma, however, he's staying here for school. His permanent residence is in Texas. I'm moving to Florida in a couple of weeks for an internship. Depending on whether or not the company (a certain Fortune 500 company ran by a Mouse) I'm working for is offering me a permanent position, I may or may not permanently live in Florida. He has no desire to live anywhere outside of Texas. I mention this because when I brought all of this to my mother's attention, she told me that I was subconsciously trying to sabotage the relationship to make the decision to move easier. Just something else for your consideration. "

25mepk,5,2014-05-15,[Question]Need advice on following a true cut cycle,sumayah83,xxfitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/25mepk/questionneed_advice_on_following_a_true_cut_cycle/,"Hey Reddit.


After a long break from weight training I started lifting weights 3 months ago, using the starting strength program as a guide.  When I started I struggled with just the bar, but I have made some great gains in the short time I’ve been lifting.  (Squat 110#, Bench 80#, Deadlift 135#, overhead press 60#). I’ve incorporated a long weekend hike (8-10 miles) and some running during the week into my routine as well.  I believe I have put on about 7 pounds of muscle (my weight has gone up from 183 to 190, while my clothes haven’t gotten any tighter and my measurements have stayed the same).

I’ve been happy with the gains but starting next week I’m moving to a new city and starting a 12 week summer internship which will have me traveling Monday through Thursday. Most of the hotels I’ll be staying in will not have a great gyms, so I would like to focus on a cut cycle. I have quite a bit of fat to loose and I think i’ll have a better chance of loosing fat via diet and cardio then continuing trying to make strength gains. I’ll be backpacking through New Zealand January-March and every pound of fat I loose is more I can carry in my pack and farther on the trail I can go in a day.

I have used my fitness pal to closely track my food intake, though not since I started lifting weights. I’d love detailed advice on how to follow a true cut cycle (not just a crash diet). This internship is going to keep me very busy (70 hours a week), so I need to eat enough of the right foods while being on the road that I have the energy and the mental clarity to rock it.

Any advice would be appreciated!  This is my first post so if I have missed any important information, please let me know. 

Stats:
Height: 5’8
Weight: 189 (as of this morning)
Resting Metabolic Rate: 1757 
Diet: Gluten and dairy free (I get really sick, not just a fad diet)"

25mi1n,2,2014-05-15,A Couple of Beginner Questions.,GodWhenDrunk,laravel,https://www.reddit.com/r/laravel/comments/25mi1n/a_couple_of_beginner_questions/,"Hi guys, i'm making a application on my internship and wanted some guidance, super new in laravel/php and angularjs/javascript. Sorry for the english in advance.

The application:

* 3 ""modules""(mini-apps) -&gt; Clients, Providers, Personal.

* Basically 3 CRUDs.

* Each module with a 3/4 tables.

* The modules don't share a single table.

* AngularJs as front-end.

* Single Page application.

* I'm using laravel as a RESTfull api (i think lol), passing json to angular.

The modules would have also different access levels for each user.(read/write/none). 

Lets take for instance the Clients module, in there i have 2 tables, companies and users.  A company has many users, so, my SPA would be a filled form at the top of the page with the company info and a dropdown of all companies, a table with info on all the users from the selected company.

note: I already had most of this implemented but without javascript.

Questions:

* The way i first made this i had a lot of controllers(one for each model, with some exceptions), i'm guessing this is way too much controllers, how should i improve this? 

* Also i had one model for each table, am i doing this wrong? (I'm using namespace to keep things organized but still, a lot of models and controllers)

* With the lot of controllers configuration i had a json return for my tables. Again, using the users/clients example, it is possible for organizing my SPA passing the json for all my users and sort with angular or should i pass a json with all the users from the selected company?

* Should i make a SPA for each module or a huge SPA?

* How should i handle routing, on angular or on laravel? ATM i have a Route::resource for each controller. 

note:I'm making the laravel part of the app first.

I’m back with the possibility of 2014 schedule wallpapers.  If you don’t remember what I did last year or maybe you weren’t on this sub yet, [here is what I did](http://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/1m3m1j/im_2_games_late_but_the_wallpapers_are_finally/).  I didn’t want to copy my last design.  So far these are just ideas, but I’m posting them here to get feedback from the community.  [Here are some quick ones I threw together](http://imgur.com/a/PhtpS).  The first two have players, but then I started playing with the idea of having pictures of team stadiums/crowds instead.  I like the crowd design more so far.  I also used all mascot logos for the schedules last year and haven’t decided if I will do that again or just use normal team logos this year.

I plan on trying to make a wallpaper for every Division I FBS team.  I believe there are 129?  I made extra teams last year that were outside of the Div I list.  If your team isn’t a Div I FBS team then let me know if you would like a wallpaper.  I will have a list of teams to do once I get through the Div I’s.

Unfortunately, there is a chance that I won’t be creating these, which is why I said “possibility.”  I got a big summer internship this year and will be starting it next week.  For obvious reasons the internship will take priority over creating these.  But I feel confident that I can do both, so no worries!  

These should be done by the end of August right before the first games of the season.

TLDR: Maybe wallpaper?

Edit:  I will be going with the stadium style wallpaper.  If you have a stadium picture that you think would be good for your school then post it.  It helps me out a lot because I might not pick the best one.  Preferably good quality so I can resize it well."

25n3lm,4,2014-05-15,Advice Needed for Job/Career Path,Holstein30,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/25n3lm/advice_needed_for_jobcareer_path/,"Hello Reddit,

I just moved to St. Augustine, FL a little over a week ago and have been searching for a job/career path. I am currently 23 and have a Bachelor's Degree in History with a 3.64 GPA (not great but not awful). However, after completing my degree and really thinking about the future I have discovered that I am more interested in a career in technology and have been taking the first steps towards teaching myself computer programming. In the mean time I need to find a job that pays enough to pay the bills. 

This is where I have run into a problem. I am unsure of the best way to go about searching for these jobs. I have been using online resource such as monster, careerbuilder, etc. but since I am new to the area and have absolutely no connections to anyone down here I am having a tough time. I have landed a few interviews that have went well but haven't heard anything back yet. I am also unsure about what the best career path is for me to take. As I mentioned I am more interested in a technology/computer science career now and I am unsure of how to break into this field. 

So far I have come up with 4 options at the moment:

     1. Find a paralegal/legal assistant job (have interviewed for one so far)

•	The reasoning behind trying to find this type of job is because I possess many of the skills necessary for this type of position. (Analytical, Research, and Writing skills long with quite typing skills and a fair amount of computer skills)

•	The con's would include: fairly difficult to land a job (especially since it seems that there are very few positions open in my area), possible lack of interest in job (I would not consider this a deal breaker at all though as it would last more than a couple of years), most likely long hours (once again not a deal breaker as I am young and have the time right now), possibly a rather steep learning curve at first considering I would likely have to become nuanced in whatever aspect of the law the firm covers 

     2. Get a job in retail or go back to working as a server at a restaurant

•	The reasoning behind this path is that it will be somewhat easier to find a job in retail and I'm certain I can find work as a server quickly

•	The con's to this path include the fact that I have been a server for the last 2 years or so and I can honestly say that I did not enjoy it at all. Another con would be the fact that I may not be able to start out with enough money (in retail) to be able to pay the bills.

     3. Enroll in the local community college (http://www.sjrstate.edu/workforce/computers.html) 
     and get an associate's degree in computer science – Or enroll in the University of North Florida  
     (http://www.unf.edu/ccec/computing/Computer_Science_Program.aspx) and get a 
     computer science bachelor's degree

•	The associate's degree would hopefully help me to get my foot in the door for a career in computer science while the bachelor's would certainly help me in starting up my career in the field while also helping me to land internships and other opportunities while enrolled

•	The con's include: how would I pay for this and pay the bills (idk how much I could get from loans for the community college but I would definitely get a job at the same time to help and pay but I'm sure it would not be enough) especially if I decide on UNF, it will take at least a year to complete the degree at the community college, and likely will take 3-4 years for the UNF program 

     4. Go into the military (Air Force or Navy)

•	The reasoning for this is that it would pay the bills, I would get good benefits, I would be able to get training in IT fields and also take courses that would supplement my bachelor's degree and possibly give me the qualifications necessary for getting into a master's program for computer science, and it would either pay of my college loans (I don't have all that much), or I could get the GI Bill and get a higher degree, and I would also have a chance of starting out as an officer since I already have a degree

•	The con's include a four year commitment to a branch (delays life), chance of deployment/chance to die, not being able to decide where I live/being away from my girlfriend for very long periods (who I live with and who is getting her doctorate in physical therapy). 


This sums up everything that I have taken into consideration so far. I would really appreciate any advice or feedback that the Reddit community could give me and I am open to any and all suggestions. Thank you for taking the time to read this.

He needs a method where he can view a computer account in the SBS 2011 console, but not have it apply the Group Policy (WSUS)

From what I have seen on the interwebz, the only way to make a computer show up in the SBS console is by having the computer in the SBSComputer OU. If I need to have the computer in the SBSComputer OU then I need a method that does not apply the Group Policy by computer (not user account)

Is there a possible method where I/he can edit/configure/hack the SBS Console to populate other OU's in the Computer list as opposed to only the SBSComputer account?

Still learning the ropes of networking/sysadmin work so sorry if any of this does not make sense or is unclear.

She's seeing my good friend now a week after the break up",HappeningTOme,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/25n782/me_23_m_with_my_exgirlfriend_23_f_for_45_years/,"Let me first start this by giving a little back story. I have known this girl since 3rd grade but did not start dating her until 5 years ago when we both started college. This was my first ""real"" relationship and I fell in love with her instantly, and it was reciprocated. 

The relationship took off full force and it was healthy. We lived together pretty much from day one and we both loved every minute of it. We had our ups and downs but we always got through them because we knew our relationship was worth it. I am an engineering student and as I got deeper in my coursework, we were spending more and more time away from each other. I got lazy because all I could think about was school even when I was with her. We always had a plan and I told her that things will be different when I graduate and I will have a more stable schedule. It's not like I wanted to think about school either when I was with her, she was the most important thing in my life and I just tried to make her realize that I was doing this for us but all she wanted was a less distant and depressed version of me. 

Last summer I noticed things changed between us when I left for 3 months for a summer internship. When I came back I noticed this person who got along just fine without me and that hurt. We got in a big fight over it but made up like the usual. She apologized a couple weeks later and told me that she is her best when I am around and she is happiest when she is with me. 

By this point in our relationship (4 years), we were more of companions. We shared bills, had 2 pets and a place, very similar to a married couple which was never a problem because that's what we wanted all along anyway.  

Now fast forward to March 14th. We are on our way home from spring break and I reach over to put my hand on her knee and she snaps and tells me not to touch her. I reach over and put my hand on her back and ask her what’s bothering her and she starts crying. I had no clue what was coming, I just thought I did something wrong and she was upset about that. She told me she hasn't felt romantic feelings in a long time (3 months) and she needed time and space. The worst part about this was we were stuck in a traffic jam for 2 hours. She said she couldn't empathize anymore with me about school and that it took a toll on her. 

We finally get back home and she goes to stay with her sister. We had fights before and terms like “space and time,” were thrown out there but we always made up and things were good after that, but this time I knew it was for real. I didn’t want to be alone so I called my friend to come pick me up and asked if I could stay with him for a while. This friend will come up later in the story but for now let’s call him Judas. Judas was one of my closest friends in school and he was there for me initially. The next day another one of my friends caught me after work and told me to come stay with him and his girlfriend. He said he went through something similar and he wanted to help me through this. We talked and he had some good advice. He told me to cut contact with her and give her what she wants and if it works out it does but if it doesn't then not talking to her with make it easier to move on. 

That was just it; I didn't want to move on. I am a fighter; I fought for her every other time so what makes this any different? So I texted her. I was an emotional wreck, I swear to her it seemed like I was bipolar. Back and forth between apologizing and asking her if we can work it out and then getting angry then apologizing some more. I was mess. I went out and tried to have fun to keep my mind off of her. I fooled around with some other girls and that was fun but I still felt like shit. I didn't text her for a month and I could start to see myself feeling better. I still wanted to be with her and was hoping that she would text me that she missed me and we could start over. 

Okay, so now it’s May 4th, the day after I graduated. I was feeling like the fucking man until I got a text from Judas telling me that he and my ex have had a thing going that he waited until after graduation to tell me so I didn't fail my classes and that nothing happened during our relationship and he realizes our friendship was over. I was heated so what did I do, I texted her. A bunch of really just awful texts about betrayal and name calling.  I really couldn't believe that this was happening to me. 

I really could have written a novel about this but I decided to leave out some details. Here is where I am now. Call me stupid but I still want her. I feel like I can forgive her for everything because I believe this person is the one I belong with. I can’t make her feel any way she doesn't want to but I feel I messed up by taking some jabs at her and hurting her. Non-emotional and betrayed me, never wanted to hurt her and I just want to tell her I am sorry for saying the things I did. I texted her last week to tell her that I wanted to sit and talk with her and clear up some things that were said and she replied that after everything I said to her, she really doesn't want to see me again. I told her I understand but if she changes her mind to let me know. I've only known Judas for 2 years so he is easily forgettable but I've known her since I was 9 and took my anger out on the wrong person. I really don’t what to do or how to feel.

25n7zu,1,2014-05-15,On External Cravings vs. Internal Attacks,NOFAP_THROWAWEIGH,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/25n7zu/on_external_cravings_vs_internal_attacks/,"I recently redevoted myself the the /r/nofap cause. About 72 hours ago to be more precise - and I've already relapsed. I guess it would be almost inaccurate to call it a relapse - the term 'lapse' implies something very quick, short-term. But, in the past year, I've spent far more time 'off the wagon' than on it. So in reality, a relapse is merely me, returning to my previous, and far more 'normal' state. If any bit of this journey is the 'lapse' part - it is the part where I am *not* fapping. In other words - my 'lapse' of masturabatory sobriety ended; I 'delapsed'. 

This is far from the first time I've failed to permanently stop this habit - but that's not to say I'm not proud of the small stretch I accomplished. Considering I'm home alone most of the day - in limbo between the end of a school year and an internship - I'm proud that I was able to be alone with my thoughts for so long, yet control my urges. Which leads me to a post-mortem, about the differences between the ways my (and probably most of ours) addiction tries to get us to give in.

 
- - -
###External Cravings
- - -
These are the desires we are prepared to fight against. You see a suggestive image, and your mind wanders. You feel your body heating up - and you want to quench your desire. We expect this, and know how to stop it. In the first few days of our journey, these are the attacks that we fight against. There are numerous suggestions - some very good ones that I've read on this subreddit, such as:

1. Install Web Blockers so that you can limit your triggering input.
2. Before you do anything, just wait a moment, observe the urge. Understand it. You will find it can be like an animal inside you, that you can simply watch from a distance as it recedes.
3. Think for a minute about how important this is to you, and that a moment of satisfaction is not worth it.

When making a serious attempt at stopping this habit - I find these attacks are fairly easy to overcome. There is a rewarding satisfaction of taming the primal urges, and letting your desire recede. It's a battle we are well prepared for, and the one we expect to fight.

 To draw a corollary - when exercising - you expect to have to push against resistance. That is the whole point - so that you can grow stronger by overcoming it. You know it will take effort in your muscles, against the iron or machine, and the accomplishment of doing a set can be it's own reward.

 
 
* *

- - -
###Internal Attacks
- - -

These are the far more nefarious attacks that we (or at least I) do not expect to come against. Instead of being rooted in the outside imagery - or in a emotion that can be controlled by reason, they are rooted internally. A thought will come into your mind; and it can't be easily removed:

* ""I think you're fixed. You've done it - now you can go back to fapping"". 
* ""What's the point? You know you'll never make it to 90 days. Save the embarrassment, just give in now.""
* ""Do you really think this will change anything in your life?""
* ""Even if it did, is it worth it? You'll be losing a nice release that you sometimes need""
* ""It's natural - and probably healthy.""

    **OR**, my personal enemies:

* ""Everything in moderation, right? So maybe just give in now, and will only allow once a week from now on""
* ""Hey, at least you're watching vanilla porn. This is normal. This is what everyone does. Why would not doing this make you better?""

For me, these are extremely hard to fight against - because it's not some obvious emotion of desire that's trying to overtake my mind - it's my own self. It's subtle - and can build up very quickly if left unchecked. It doesn't fight you physically, but mentally - and I have no defense against it. When it enters, it feels like I have become a different person than the one who initially made this commitment, so by giving up, I'm not letting myself down - I'm letting down my previous self. My brain steps in and (intoxicated by it's subconscious desires) says:

*  *""I'm older now, than when I made that choice, and more experienced. When I tried this, I hadn't well experienced both sides of the coin - now I have. I've tried this, but now I'm ready to go back""*.

These are harder to fight back against for several reasons. Firstly, they don't appear right away, so I have less experience against them. Secondly, when starting, I can't imagine how my mind would betray me. It seems as if it would be easy to overcome, given my current mental state.

To go back to the corollary of exercise - you expect to lift weights when you work out. You expect to fight against the resistance of the iron. But it takes far more effort to fight against the resistance of yourself. If the thought *""You've done two sets, that's probably enough. You can go home. Plus, you've got work to do""*, comes into your head, it can be impossible to overcome.

**Does anyone have any suggestions on how to fight this?**

I have friends in East LA (Silverlake, Echo Park etc), but my internship is located in Beverly Hills - so ideally, I'd rent a car. Judging by all I've heard from friends (and pop-culture), living in LA really requires a car anyways. 

Does anyone have any tips regarding renting a car for a month... for cheap? Are there any alternatives to the standard car rental (which, including insurance, is at least $900 anywhere I look)?

Or, if a cheap rental is impossible, are there any things like car pool websites/forums etc I could look into?

Any help appreciated. 

EDIT: Thanks for all the suggestions! I have since arrived in LA and have decided to rent a car (I'm staying with some friends for free half the time, so it offsets some of the costs). First day to work the commute in was 40m, back out was 30m (I finish at 7pm, so after rush hour). 
Thanks again - I'm looking forward tot getting to know this city."

I am looking through craigslist and cars.com, and I can swear that the cars I find through dealers on cars.com are far closer to Kelley Blue Book's estimates than the private owner cars I find on Craigslist. 

Here is [one example](http://www.cars.com/go/search/detail.jsp?tab=summary&amp;recnum=&amp;actLog=&amp;listingId=606439281&amp;paId=606439281&amp;listingRecNum=24&amp;criteria=feedSegId%3d28705%26rpp%3d50%26isDealerGrouping%3dfalse%26sf2Nm%3dprice%26requestorTrackingInfo%3dRTB_SEARCH%26yrId%3d20200%26yrId%3d20144%26yrId%3d20199%26yrId%3d20143%26yrId%3d20198%26yrId%3d20142%26yrId%3d20197%26yrId%3d20141%26yrId%3d20196%26yrId%3d20140%26yrId%3d20195%26yrId%3d20139%26yrId%3d20194%26yrId%3d20138%26sf1Nm%3dmiles%26sf2Dir%3dDESC%26PMmt%3d0-0-0%26rn%3d0%26prcId%3d28646%26zc%3d97005%26rd%3d30%26crSrtFlds%3dstkTypId-feedSegId-mkId-mdId-pseudoPrice%26bsId%3d20202%26bsId%3d20203%26bsId%3d20211%26bsId%3d20216%26sf1Dir%3dASC&amp;tracktype=usedcc&amp;pageNumber=&amp;numResultsPerPage=&amp;largeNumResultsPerPage=0&amp;sortorder=descending&amp;sortfield=PRICE&amp;certifiedOnly=false&amp;) from cars.com, and here is [one example](http://portland.craigslist.org/wsc/ctd/4459988802.html) from craigslist. 

My budget is $4500 for a used vehicle, and I find very few clean-titled hondas/toyotas with less than 130,000 miles. 

My situation is a bit rough because I will be moving to Hillsboro, OR (outskirt of Portland) for an internship, and I won't have the means to go out and test drive many vehicles. Therefore I'm trying to find the best/most reliable deal so that the chances that I take the car on the spot is high.

Thanks for reading guys! Looking forward to your input.

I am going to be a senior next semester and I haven't gotten an internship yet. 

I am majoring in Computer Science with a concentration in Information Systems.

My professors are horrible at teaching and when I asked my advisor what jobs I should be looking into after graduating she just went on google and typed ""top jobs for computer science majors"" ... i was like wtf...

I can do some small java programming and i'm not really that good at programming but I was thinking maybe look for a career in IT / IT project managers(?)

I need some help looking for something that will fit my major as a career. As of right now I have no clue what to look for or what to do after my college career is over.

I honestly think it's too late for me to start learning how to program ""well"" now. I have a year left of school and I'm sure someone in high school can out-code me...

So what other choices are there for me?"

However in this program you have to do an interview and then companies select you based on how good you are. I know Intel, HP, and Garmin are the big name companies there, the rest are a bunch of no name companies. I heard a horror story of someone getting selected for a internship and he wrote Tech Reports for 6 months. I don't know what the right call is. 

I'm not gonna have a internship this summer. If I get an internship during my Junior summer term is that good enough? If I don't get any internships at all will that be bad when looking for a job? I feel like delaying school for a year is bad so I'm nervous taking it. 

Is it worth it? Thanks!"
25nvne,3,2014-05-15,"My manager [M/40s] hates his intern (aka: me [F/20s]). He has a very abrasive leadership style, and doesn't provide positive feedback of any kind. I need his recommendation to stay with the company. Help.",AmReallyTrying,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/25nvne/my_manager_m40s_hates_his_intern_aka_me_f20s_he/,"I [F/20s] work as a management intern for a fairly large, U.S. company in the northwest. Although I am an intern, I am still considered a member of management, and all of the people that work at our company view me as a manager. Many don't know I'm even an intern.

Each week, I meet with the head of our management team for a one-on-one meeting to talk about how I am doing over the course of my internship. We'll call this person Javert [M/40s].

Javert doesn't like me, which is a problem, because I need his recommendation to continue my work with the company after my internship ends. He has been with the company for over a decade, but he recently was put into this position, around the same time I started my internship.

Javert is a very abrasive person. He tends to call people out on their mistakes, and doesn't give any positive feedback... ever. If you do something great, it never gets noticed. If you do something wrong, he'll hate you forever. I fall into the latter category.

Let me give you some examples of the conversations we have in our weekly, one-on-one meetings:

&gt;**Javert**: ""Is there anything else you want to tell me about?""

&gt;**Me**: ""I think that about covers it!""

&gt;**Javert**: (sighs) ""Well, it's obvious that you're not going to bring this up, so I guess I'll have to...""

&gt;**Me**: ""Bring what up?""

&gt;**Javert**: ""When we had the power outage five weeks ago, and what you didn't follow correct procedure to fix it. You really shouldn't try to hide these things from me, I'm going to hear about them.""

&gt;**Me**: ""I'm not hiding anything from you. That was five weeks ago, I thought it was resolved.""

&gt;**Javert**: ""You may have resolved it with the rest of the management team, but not with me.""

&gt;**Me**: ""Okaaaaaay...?""

&gt;**Javert**: ""You should not have contacted corporate when that occurred. That needs to go through me first.""

&gt;**Me**: ""I understand. And I wholly admit that I should have handled the situation differently. It was my first time I had ever encountered an issue like this; in fact, I was never trained on how to handle something like that. But I know that's not an excuse, and I will learn from it.""

&gt;**Javert**: ""Well it shouldn't have happened and you made us look bad.""

...

&gt;**Javert**: ""I heard that you yelled at some of our employees, when they didn't deserve it.""

&gt;**Me**: ""I did yell at them. They were off the clock, and running through the shop, which we would not allow anyone to do -- regardless if they're an employee or not.""

&gt;**Javert**: ""Well these employees said that you 'banned' them from going into the shop ever again.""

&gt;**Me**: ""No, I didn't ban them.""

&gt;**Javert**: ""Well that's what they're saying.""

&gt;**Me**: ""Well, that's not true. I'm not sure who is telling you this, but that's not the case. I do believe, as employees, they should follow the rules, if not better than our customers already do. So I pulled them aside, and told them that.""

&gt;**Javert**: ""You could have approached the situation differently.""

...

&gt;**Javert**: ""We received a complaint about you. Apparently a customer says that you forced her to leave because she had her dog with her.""

&gt;**Me**: ""Ah yes, this is the customer that was so angry at me, she attempted to physically assault me and so I called security.""

&gt;**Javert**: ""Just because she had her dog with her doesn't mean we have to kick her out.""

&gt;**Me**: ""Yes, I know that. But as you, yourself, said last week -- customers with dogs are not permitted in that area.""

&gt;**Javert**: ""I know what I said. But we have other places they can go with their dogs.""

&gt;**Me**: ""Yes, and I did inform the customer of those other places. But even after doing so, she attempted to physically assault me.""

&gt;**Javert**: ""Uh huh. Okay, thanks for coming in."" [End of conversation.]

These are some examples of what I get to deal with when I talk to Javert. I am not exaggerating. Nothing is ever good enough for him. He has never -- not once -- complimented me for things I've done very well. (Despite getting compliments from other members of my team.) I receive many positive comments from my employees, and many positive comments from customers. But all Javert sees are the things I've done wrong.

When I do something wrong, I own up to it. I want to be wholly transparent and honest, and I want to do what is best for our company, my coworkers, our employees, and our customers. I am incredibly passionate about my work... but I have learned to hate this internship, all because of Javert.

In addition, there are a few bad apples on our management team, which doesn't help matters. They cause drama, and are back-stabbers who will complain about you, just to make themselves look better. When something goes wrong, they will go to Javert and complain about ""how I poorly handled the situation"" before I can even speak with him about it. And again... I look bad.

I know the whole company isn't like this (and if it was, I wouldn't have any desire to work there whatsoever). However, it is this particular team I've been assigned to that is so toxic. But I keep telling myself to breathe. If I can get though this, I'll have a great position at this company, doing my dream job. But I have to get though this. And I have to get Javert's approval to get there.

But I only have a few weeks left of this internship, and I am scared that Javert won't recommend for me to stay with the company. I actually asked him about it, to get an idea of where he was at with the decision. His answer? ""I'm honestly not sure. I think I am going to recommend you, but we'll just have to approach it when the time comes."" In previous internships I've had with this company, by this point, my managers were raving on me and writing me recommendations left and right. This is nothing like that.

I am trying my hardest to do well, but Javert continuously puts me down, even when I think I've done something worthy of praise. I do get compliments often from my employees and my customers, but of course, Javert would never listen to the ""lowly folk"" he sees them as.

Should I continue to try to be as nice as I can to Javert? This is my dream job, and if I make him angry he'll likely not recommend me to stay with this company, and I'll be devastated. At the same time, I wish I could call him out on his poor leadership style, and say to him: ""HEY LOOK, I'VE ACTUALLY DONE SOME REALLY GREAT STUFF, YOU SON OF A BITCH! CAN YOU GIVE ME *SOME* SORT OF POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT? I HATE THIS JOB BECAUSE OF YOU!""

(sigh) Sorry, I needed to vent there. I just don't know what to do, because Javert hates me. And I need him to recommend me. And I don't think he will. Because all he sees in me is failure.


---   
**tl;dr**: Working an internship for my dream job. I have the chance to stay on after my internship ends, but it requires my manager's recommendation. My manager HATES me and only sees my mistakes, despite the things I have done well, which he doesn't comment on.

I am so depressed because I really thought I was doing well, and other employees and even customers have given me great praise. But my manager doesn't see that, and doesn't care to give me any positive feedback whatsoever. Should I call him out on it? Or should I continue to suck it up, hold my tongue, and continue to do my best? I really need his recommendation. And I just don't know what to do.

Please help."

[Do you do any weird rituals before performing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiy1fr?context=5)|No weird rituals, i like to be an hour before the show at the venue, so i can check out the vibe. Besides that a little drink and off i go!
[What is it like to constantly travel the world? How do you find the time to produce?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiy1fr?context=5)|Seeing so much of the world is awesome ofcourse! I have to say, that travelling itself can be very exhausting, especially when you have long flights and a late night show. However, when the crowd gives so much energy it reflects on me.
[Edit: one more, what does your record label do to help develop new producers? Do you guys help manage and promote them? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiy1fr?context=5)|With Hysteria, we always try to help upcoming producers. If we get a cool demo but it isn't there yet, we try to give tips. And yes, once it's signed, we promote them! 
[What are your views on the whole ""rave culture""? Do you think the outfits are ridiculous and drive people away from your music or do you think that it is all apart of the show?  Edit: I jam to your music alll the time, thanks for doing this!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chixzeh?context=5)|I don't think they are ridiculous, it's a part of the scene. Sometimes it creates a sort of unity, which is nice. I wish people would stop throwing kandi at me during the shows though. That hurts. ;)
[I'm very sorry about your loss. I couldn't believe it when I heard about it.  I also saw your set at UMF 13' in Miami, it was incredible.  But my question is: Where do you see EDM in 10 years or so?

I don't know where the music and parties will be in 10 years from now. Things evolve so fast in this scene, which is awesome, but it's hard to predict which direction it will go. One thing is for sure, it WILL be around for another 10 years.

[What are your thoughts on many people associating the EDM scene with drugs and ruining events for many? And do you think it could effect the EDM scene substantially in a negative way? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiy8yh?context=5)|I think the association is something especially press and media like to make. It's short-sighted and naive. It discredits all the people that don't take drugs and have a good time. Drugs are everywhere, you cannot tell people what to or not to do. The best way is to keep educating and communicating with people about it and let them know what risks are.

Besides that, most of the i just use softsynths. Not saying analog is obsolete!

[Miami, Ibiza or Vegas?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiy7sa?context=5)|Love all three of them, no way to choose between them!
[Thanks for all the great tunes Maarten.  ""Cry "" was a game changer and my go-to song for that summer after it came out.  What did you think of Flo Rida capitalizing on the same sample and ending up with a more famous and much shittier song?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiydbq?context=5)|Ha ha, well nothing we could do about it. At the same time, because of that version we got a lot of attention too. People started to look into our music when they heard that version.
[What was it like working with Far East Movement?  Did have any part producing the music video for rattle?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiyg9p?context=5)|Actually during the process we never met them. It was all by email. I met them about a year later, when we played at the same festival in France.  The idea from the video came from our manager!
[Hello Martin, I was at  cream in March and watched you kill it, i am just wondering what was with the MC? Also, thanks for the picture, as you were walking to the toilet haha! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiy7l5?context=5)|What was wrong with the MC? No worries for the pic. Glad you enjoyed it!
[If you could collaborate with any musician from another genre, alive or dead, who would it be, and why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiyagv?context=5)|Prince, because he is such a great musician. Would love to do some funky tunes with him!
[Good tips for writing melodies?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiye5r?context=5)|Best melodies are simple and can be played on a flute. Sounds ridiculous, but it's true. Think about all the melodies you love and you'll see you can play them on any instrument without losing it's touch!
[Big fan here. Thanks for doing this AMA. What's your favorite moment with Paul? Much love from Norway. &lt;3.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiyaro?context=5)|There are many favorite moments. I really miss sharing all the experiences during touring and making music togehter.
[Love your music, and LOVE every episode of Hysteria Radio on Soundcloud!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiya5g?context=5)|Thanks for the kind words and glad you enjoy Hysteria Radio!
[Can I ask, regarding EDM, do you think artists at the moment and in the future should look toward making new sounds all the time, or look back more to discover new (and even reuse\) amazing samples from the past (most notably the Electric 80s\)? (Also any chance appearances at Glastonbury 2014?\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiya5g?context=5)|I think it's good to look to future AND listen to old stuff, it broadens your vision on music and ideas! I've been really inspired by Depeche Mode actually (hence the track ""Mode"") ;)
[What's your stance on big DJs who use ghost producers? Do you use ghost producers yourself?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiyfvp?context=5)|Answered this one earlier here. And no, we produce all our stuff on our own!
[BIg fan! I'm very sorry about your loss ;(  I have just one question:  When did you start making music, at what age?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiy8g8?context=5)|I started making electronic music when i was 13-14. 
[Back a few years ago when Cry (Just a little\) was a huge anthem, did you ever get sick of hearing your music?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiy4py?context=5)|Sometimes yes, but when you play it live and people go crazy, that feeling is gone instantly!
[Hey man, really respect your work .  Curious as to what you enjoy more. Playing Night Club vs Festivals. Also Favorite Club and or Festival/year you've played.?  Thank you, and all the best for a great future !](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiy9zj?context=5)|I love both! Clubs are more intimate and festivals are awesome for the big crowds and nice weather! Don't have a favorite club or festival, there are too many to choose from!
[Do you think you could lay down a dirty techno/minimal set if you were booked to do so/ do you take these bookings  ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiyan2?context=5)|I love some techno and minimal stuff, but i don't think i could do a set, i'm too unexpierenced with that genre. Would love to try it once, maybe as a late afterparty set!
[Hi Maarten, I'm a massive fan, your remix of 'Muzik' got me into house/electro around 5 or so years ago and I was lucky enough to speak with you and Paul at a few different shows in Melbourne, Australia a few years ago.  Me and all my friends were devastated when we read about Paul and I am so sorry for your loss, we always talked about how you two were easily the nicest, most grounded music producers we had met.  My main question is how do you get your bass so tight? I've always admired how snappy your kick drums are yet they always deliver plenty of punch, which frequency do you try and get them to really shine at? How much sidechain and/or regular compression?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chizkme?context=5)|Wow that's an old song haha! For a good basskick well, i just use the right sounding samples. High quality samples are essential! Have to say i love the Sonic Academy plugin for this too!
 |One of the things i tend to do is pull up the volume for the kick a bit more than what people perceive as ""usual"". It sounds so simple, but that's actually what i do. No special stuff there. :) Ofcourse sidechain your bass synth with the kick.
[How did you begin producing/DJing and get into the scene? What tips do you have for an aspiring DJ/producer?  Feel free to not answer this one but how did you meet Paul?  Can't wait to see you live!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiyjla?context=5)|See for producing/DJ'ing tips an answer somewhere else here. I met Paul at his home. I was attending the same school as his little brother. When i came to his home, Paul was producing music, just like me. We became friends immediately.
[What are your views on the definition between a DJ and a producer? Are they two completely different things? Or have the two terms come to mean similar things over time? Thanks in advance man.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiy6kr?context=5)|They are completely different, but nowadays they go hand-in-hand. As a DJ it's almost mandatory that you are a producer too today. If you would look at the most literal description of a DJ and a producer, it's so different!
[Why you decided to continue without Paul, and not delete bingoplayers for ever?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chj1gta?context=5)|Paul and i talked about it before he passed. He told me, if i could find the strength to continue, i should do it. I want to keep the music alive. We've worked so hard where we are right now and had so many plans for the future. I want to carry on his legacy.
[Huuuge Bingo fan, thanks for taking the time to do this! 2 questions. 1\)Whose one producer you would like to collab with if given the opportunity? 2\)Will you be at EDC LV this year? (PLEASE say yes, your set last year was the best of the weekend by far!\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiyga8?context=5)|I would love to produce with Daft Punk if i would ever get the chance!
[Nocturnal Wonderland 2012 in Texas was my first rave, and Bingo Players was one of the performances our group ""had to see"". I had no clue who yall were back then, but Rattle is still to this day one of my all time favorite songs. I've been a part of the ""rave scene"" ever since, and it seems to me there's a growing divide between the different subgenres. I don't pay much attention to the gossip surrounding EDM in general, but any time I look at pictures from different DJ's during festivals I see A LOT of bickering and shit talking about this or that subgenre. Have you come across anything like this? Or am I just seeing the loud minority?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiz86o?context=5)|I'm just like you, i don't pay attention to gossip and all the bs surrounding genres, people, etc. I focus on the positive side of the music, not let negative things distract me from doing what i love most.
[Hi Maarten, I'm a huge fan of early Bingo Players (You're not alone remix, When I dip, Get on the move, etc...\) Do you plan to make similar track like above mentioned in the future?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiyd6x?context=5)|Thanks! I don't know, music evolves and our sound too. Just finished a remix which sounds more like an older BP song. Stay tuned!
[I want to say I respect you, and look up to you for continuing you love for music after the tragedy that happen. I am cancer survivor and look up to you and Bingo Players music. Thank you!  My question is I've Been DJing for about 5 Years and love doing it. Can I Dj with you? Just kidding but no really What's the best software you have use or currently use to produce music?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiyrsw?context=5)|Thank you. I'm glad to read you've beat cancer!  The best software to produce music doesn't exist. It's all about what feels right for you. I'm currently on Ableton, but Logic, Cubase, Fruity Loops. They are all good, it's what you do with it!
[If you were not in the music industry what would you see yourself doing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiydo4?context=5)|Probalby doing motion graphics/video stuff. Like i did before we started DJ'ing.
[Hey Maarten, saw you in Melle in Germany this year, it was incredible, just wanted to point that out first. My question is: Do you like the current state of EDM? Anything you'd like to change/introduce into EDM?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiyasz?context=5)|Great club! I love the current state of ""EDM"", it's evolving so fast and exciting things happen quickly!
[Hey Maarten, I've been following you guys since Devotion came out. Keep up the good work, now for my questions.  What happened with the whole Palladium situation the last time you were supposed to play L.A?  and any chance you'd play a classic Bingo Players set with just your old stuff?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiz7jj?context=5)|I cannot remember exactly what that was in LA? When was this? Yes, i've been thinking about doing a classic Bingo set somewhere in the future for a special occasion.
[How do you feel right before performing a show, and how does it make you feel when you hear the roaring of a crowd? Also, Are you playing in LA soon?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chj2asj?context=5)|There's no better feeling than hearing a crowd roar! Yes, i'll be in LA end of june!
[Any chance of a return to the classic Bingo Players sound like Devotion, Disco Electrique etc? Even for just one song?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chizyd7?context=5)|I like to look forward and just produce what i feel at the moment. I just finished a remix that has a bit more that older Bingo Players vibe!
[What made you guys decide to sample Brenda Russell's Piano in the Dark?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chj2u06?context=5)|I heard it on VH1 Classic back then. I thought the vocal hook would sound cool when you speed it up, especially with all the disco house that was around at that time.
[Hi Marteen your tracks are the best, you think to emerge as dj, would help to do a collab? thanks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiyhz5?context=5)|I think you are mixing up being a DJ and producer. Those go hand-in-hand today, but before doing a collab, try to evolve as a producer. If you feel a collab could give you that extra element, why not?
[Hey Maarten you guys were my first ever show at Governors Island last year, and it was amazing. Ive seen you 5 time since. Do you plan on playing in New York this summer other than at Ezoo!? thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiy7o7?context=5)|There are some plans, more on that later! ;)
[Do you think that any significant changes in music production will happen in the near future, and if so, how do you think they will affect how music is made? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiykwo?context=5)|Yes, but music production changes so fast. I mean, if you hear the soundquality that young kids can produce nowadays, it was impossible years ago! It's great that the technique is there, but also risks that less attention will be spent on the music side of things. We'll see!
[How do you find new tracks that you love?  what outlets do you use frequently to find those tracks?  Awesome that you're doing an AMA.  been a fan since your rendition of Tom's Diner.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chj24f2?context=5)|I check Beatport ofcourse, but also 1001tracklists, Soundcloud (which is great to find new and unreleased stuff), YouTube.
[I just came on to say you're awesome! i saw u @ ezoo this yr &amp; it was an amazing set. im terribly sorry for the loss of paul &amp; think its really cool that you're continuing on.  What's been your all time favorite festival to play? what was your best show of all time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiymw1?context=5)|Thank you! Re: favorite festivals/shows i've replied about it somewhere else here.
[Have you ever thought of producing hardstyle music in the future? You could get the attention of lots of new public ;\) ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiy4da?context=5)|Not yet, but i like said somewhere else here, i really love the sounddesign and mixdown of hardstyle tracks. Most hardstyle producers are great engineers!
[Do you play Bingo? is that the inspiration for your DJ title? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiz8ug?context=5)|Actually i've never played Bingo! We just thought it was a fun name :)
[Huge fan here I remember when rattle came out and it was in everyone's set at starscape!  My question is where do u draw your inspiration from? And how does it effect your music?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiy8iw?context=5)|I get inspiration from many things. Obviously other music, but also movies, reading or just being outside.
[, you're a boss.  Second, what do you think of big EDM producers like Afrojack and Avicii producing tracks with big name pop artists? Do you see it as selling out? Do you see yourself doing any big collaboration like that? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chizz2k?context=5)|I don't consider it as selling out. Some collabs are great, others are not. It's all about what a producer feels at a certain stage. I see myself doing a collaboration if i feel like it and the result is something i'm satisfied with! :)
[Do you think the whole festival culture is a fad that will die down? What about electronic music as a whole?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiyh2x?context=5)|Nope, both will keep going. Maybe in a different form, but it won't go away!
[YOU GUYS ARE AWESOME!!! I WILL ALWAYS CONSIDER YOU A TEAM! I loose my shit when rattle and roll (any version\) drops.  ps-when are you coming back to Southern California? -how have you been man!?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiy9ap?context=5)|Thanks! Coming back to SoCal real soon, i think june!
[What's the story behind your logo? Did you make it or hire somebody? What does it mean to you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chizybg?context=5)|We let a designer make a few logo's. We loved this one. It reminded us of the old acid smileys!
[Hello Maarten! What are some future colabs that we can await from you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiy4as?context=5)|No collabs in the making yet!
[Hi Maarten, thanks alot for this ama. I'm really sorry for your loss earlier this year. We all, (especially you\) lost a good friend.  My question is that when Bingo Players and Hysteria Records was started, it was both you and Paul doing the work together, so you guys were able to do so many things. After Paul passed, how easy or difficult has it been to produce, play the shows, manage the label, and everything else you guys did. Do you do it all yourself now, or do other people help you out in different areas?  Can't wait to see you live someday!!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chj211n?context=5)|When we started the label, we started small. The last year(s) it became bigger and bigger and now we're at a point that we have a A&amp;R/labelmanager running it, while i'm making the final decisions Besides that, i have a great management team that helps out a lot. 
[Congrats on your baby! How are you balancing doing shows, producing, and spending time with your family? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chj0ipy?context=5)|Thank you! He's just born so i still have to see how going away from home will be! At the moment i'm starting to get the hang of changing diapers, so there's a start!
[It looks like all famous DJs/Producers play an instrument since they are little (I don't know in your case\), and this give them a music background.  For someone who wants to become a producer, do you think is important to have this music background before starting to produce music? Do you think is never too late to start producing music?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiylwz?context=5)|And no, i don't think you need to learn play keyboard or an instrument. Many producers can't read notes actually. It's all about if you can translate what you have in mind to an actual song. So, it's more important to learn the software and how synths/sounds work so you can put your ideas to actual songs!
[Hey Maarten! Have there been any clubs that do not allow you to smoke cigarettes while spinning? When I saw you spin at Prime in Boston, I noticed you were smoking throughout the set (if a club-goer lit up a cigarette, this would result in them getting kicked out\).. Keep up the great work!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chizdd4?context=5)|I try to kick the habit! Yes many clubs do not want the artist to smoke. I respect that rule and don't smoke in that case!
[Maarten! I LOVE Bingo Players and so many of the Hysteria Rec releases!  1.\) how much input and influence do you have when it comes to your show's visuals?  2.\) I agree with the other comment I saw on here that said it would be awesome to see you at Paradiso in the Pacific NW this Summer.  Do you have a preference between big festival crowds and smaller more intimate venues?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiz8gh?context=5)|1) We met up with the company that produced the visuals and they showed us some ideas. We immediately loved it! I travel with a great VJ to many shows. He knows what to do in each venue 2) See for answer another post i did in this thread.
[Just wanted to say Rattle is one of my favorites! I love shuffling to it. I recognize it within seconds any time someone drops it at a show.  Anyway, what do you enjoy most about travelling? The least?  Thanks for doing this AMA and see you at Spring Awakening!!!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chj0pb9?context=5)|The best thing about travelling is to meet people everywhere and see a lot of the world! The least favorite thing about travelling is delays and cancelled flights. Always when you just can't afford it at that time. :)
[Just like you, im from The Netherlands, and i sometimes got the feeling you are a bit ''underrated'' here if we compare you to other famous dj's from our country. I honestly think you deserve way more credits. How do you feel about this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiymlo?context=5)|Thanks! Have to say we haven't played The Netherlands for a while, so maybe that's why!
[Will you ever release that edit you played at Fluxx in San Diego back in 2012 where you used the lyrics from Drake's ""Over"" (I swear I got that shit that makes these bitches go insane\)?  Also, any plans to take the sound back to when you did the Outkast - Rosa Parks Edit?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chizahu?context=5)|Ow wow, that Insane track is not by us. It's a track that has been released. I'm thinking about from who it was!!! Maybe try Beatport and search for ""insane""?
[Hey man, what daw do you have and how much time do you spent learning the daw? :\) (sorry for bad english\) :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiyfkv?context=5)|I use Ableton, but started with trackers on the Amiga and Atari. From there on Cubase and Reason. It's just trial and error. Just don't give up when you don't know what to do. There is so much to find nowadays on the internet that can help you out!
[What do you think about mixing different genres, like how Avicii did on his latest album? What genre would you mix into your music?  Btw, I saw you in Chicago last year, and was blown away! You are one of my favorite acts to see :o\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiz4g0?context=5)|I think it's refreshing and keeps things interesting! I don't know what genre, maybe some cool rock or 80's funk? As long you can dance to it!
[Did you end up getting that 12 core mac?  I probably should mention I'm listening Hysteria Radio 30 and it's BALLER.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiyiyu?context=5)|Haha, not decided yet! Heard the new iMac is a beast too! :)

PS: I will make me a tatto of BP, please follow me on twitter @ImAElectroLover.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25noi6/i_am_maarten_hoogstraten_better_known_as_the/chiye22?context=5)|For inspiration, see another reply here somewhere.

25o25k,10,2014-05-15,"The Ego Chronicles I: ""White Supremacy""",[deleted],sjsucks,https://www.reddit.com/r/sjsucks/comments/25o25k/the_ego_chronicles_i_white_supremacy/,"Hello, my fellow social justice haters. Let me regale you of the first tale of many regarding social justice warriors who have roamed into my life. And these are the kind of warriors whose egos are so inflated, they do their own colonoscopies with how far their head's up their ass. Let me introduce the cast.

KGBPro- Me. Narrator and witness to these events.

WarHammer- My awesome girlfriend of strong personality.

LSP- A hamplanet who is the living incarnate of Lumpy Space Princess from Adventure Time.

Selfie- A man whose ego matches that of Kanye West.

SpecialSnowflake- Girlfriend to Selfie. A spoiled brat who allows her opinion to be easily swayed to anyone in her favor.

Squilliam- Friend to LSP, Selfie and Snow. He hates everyone except the just mentioned and he spites everyone in his presence in the comfort of his mind.

TheOG- A true friend to all who approach him.

Now that the cast has been introduced, the curtains are rising and so it begins.

We were sitting around and discussing the qualities of the new Disney movie ""Frozen"".

Selfie:""I don't think Disney has any qualities that influence the public in a positive manner in their media department. I mean, all they've been doing is white-washing fairy tales and characters and lumping people of color together. Their best attempt was with 'Princess and the Frog' and we all know how much of a failure that was.""

SnowFlake &amp; LSP:""Yeah, they have very little consideration for other cultures.""

WarHammer:""Excuse me, but I don't think that's true. I think they have great consideration towards cultures. Maybe in the past, they screwed up yeah, but that was decades ago and cultural sensitivity wasn't much of a thing back then. But now, they've been making up for it by introducing foreign fairytales and keeping faithful to the origin of their culture and timeline. For example, 'Brave' is Scottish, 'Tangled' is German and 'Frozen' is Scandinavian. The character's appearances are portrayed accurately to their place and time of origin, to change any detail of that would be considered culturally insensitive in itself.""

Selfie:""I'm going to have to disagree there. I think it's culturally insensitive to waste an opportunity to interpret and project a story in such a manner that would open doors to consume media and cultures that differ from the predetermined norm. I think Disney, and I'm not excluding other companies from this, cater to the majority of white people rather than the minorities, in order to gain profit.""

WarHammer:""It's Disney! They gain enough profit as it is, do you really think they need anymore? And catering to the majority? Don't you think that's racist? You're lumping all white people together the same way you say they lump people of color together. A person can be white, but still be from a different culture!""

Snowflake:""No, I think he's right. The media is catered to the majority of white people in an effort to americanize foreign cultures, for everyone to see that 'America' is the greatest thing that there is in the world when it obviously isn't if it's doing something this low.""

At this point, Everybody else in the room, with the exception of WarHammer and I, were nodding in agreement to this. I stepped in.

Me:""Snowflake, you're white, right?""

Snowflake:""No, I'm not. I'm X-culture.""

Me:""But, you're paler than the moon on a cold winter night.""

Snowflake:""Yes, your point?""

Me:""My point is, your skin color is white enough that if no one knew you or anything about you, everybody would assume at first glance that you're american or european. You could literally pass off as being from a lot of countries, because of the way you look.""

Snowflake clearly getting angry at my argument:""But, I'm not! I identify myself as X-culture, not because I'm white!""

Me:""That's exactly my point.""

Snowflake:""That's not the same!""

WarHammer:""It's exactly the same! What you're saying is that you'd rather be recognized by where you're from, rather than your skin color and you guys are arguing for the opposite!""

Squilliam grimacing at the whole of our conversation looks at us and says distastefully:""Your argument is collapsing in on itself. None of your points accurately defend the act of white-washing in the media.""

WarHammer and I exchange perplexed looks.

WarHammer:""Do you buy the shit that's coming out of your own mouth? Do you subscribe to your own ignorance?""

At this point, everybody stands up and walks away from the table. We decided to drop it, because apparently nobody can accept opinions differing from their own.

A couple of days later, WarHammer and I were applying for internship in relation to the american government and in the application form, they asked to check off any ethnicity that applies. It was interesting when we found that ""Caucasian"" and ""White"" were two separate categories. ""Caucasian"" being american or canadian descent and ""White"" being of any cultural descent in relation to Western Europe all the way to the Middle East. 

WarHammer seized the opportunity and posted a Facebook status saying: ""Under the legislation of the american government, 'White' is considered any person of these European and so on heritages. Hmm, I wonder how culturally insensitive that is?""

About an hour later, TheOG messages her on Facebook.

TheOG:""WarHammer, what did you do?""

WarHammer:""I don't know? You tell me, what did I do?""

TheOG:""I don't want to throw any names around, but people are going around calling you a white supremacist.""

This threw her off and she double checked and surely enough, LSP and Squilliam unfriended her on Facebook. Not that hard to pin which ""people"" were those. How it makes sense to a bunch of ""intellectual"" dipshits that a ""white supremacist"" would go to a foreign country and date a person of that country(me) beats us. But, they harassed WarHammer by anonymously posting on her other social media profiles rants about her white supremacy and they tried to ruin her reputation with her friends by telling them how she [repressed](http://25.media.tumblr.com/49c35091e4d9d2716c7d32d7f0328f7a/tumblr_mj88inc4aw1rnzcl1o1_500.gif) them and how much of a racist she is. They tried to ruin her social life just because she had a different opinion.

TL;DR: ""People of Color"" try to ruin a girl's social life, just because she has a different opinion."
25o5d3,13,2014-05-15,[W4D3] Biggest achievement so far wasn't what I expected,fake_person,C25K,https://www.reddit.com/r/C25K/comments/25o5d3/w4d3_biggest_achievement_so_far_wasnt_what_i/,"I experienced several amazing feelings today.

Firstly, I actually managed to get out running. I started the programme while I was unemployed so I had plenty of time, but I've been doing an internship for a few weeks now and it's been hard to find the time to run. I get home quite late so I'm often too tired, plus I was ill last week and the days I felt ready to run it was raining.  But today, after a boring day at work sitting in front of the same word document for hours upon hours, knowing the weather was lovely outside, I got home and put my running shoes straight on.

I felt great because I'd started to lose all my momentum for these running days and I was so proud of myself for making the conscious effort to push forward. I'm generally quite lazy and it's totally unheard of for me to do something like this programme, let alone actually put in effort in to master it! It had been a long time since I felt so genuinely pleased for myself - but the best was yet to come. 

It was almost 2 weeks since I did w4d2 and I was nervous that I'd be out of practice or would not be as good as last time. Well, when the first 5 minute free form run started (I'm using the Zombie Run app) I decided to just go for it. I normally run for a song and walk the rest but today I just ran!  For possibly the first time in my life I ran for 5 minutes without stopping, and at a pretty decent speed.  And to top it off I was able to keep moving afterwards. Not too long ago a run like that would probably have put me in a week long coma. I was so happy with myself - but still the best was yet to come! 

The hour long session ended with a 15 minute free form run. By this time I was feeling worn out so I decided to just do the usual thing of running for one song and walking for the next. I ran ok for the first, then I walked but just had no energy left to start running again. I had an awful pain in my chest and my legs almost felt hollow. 

But after doing so well up to this point, I wasn't just going to stop. 

I walked slowly while mentally picturing all the reasons I've been doing the c25k: to lose weight, to feel better, to get active, to get healthier.  Then I started to lightly run. Then I remembered more: that random girl at that party who made fun of my weight and poked my stomach, the times I wouldn't go swimming with friend because I was embarrassed of my body, my ex-girlfriend who would always make me feel so inadequate. I got a little faster. I remembered the guy at work who said I wasn't determined enough at things, every girl I was too afraid to ask out,  every Saturday night in alone because I don't have the self assurance to make new friends, everyone who has ever made fun of me to my face or behind my back. I was sprinting.

Every step was a wonderful, torturous agony. I ran the duration of that song and spontaneously decided not to stop but to complete the extra few metres to get to the end of the path (by this point I was so exhausted that those few steps felt like miles) and I made it!!!

So what am I proudest of today?  Proving everyone wrong. Proving myself wrong. Every single step took every ounce of motivation and determination I could possibly muster. Not a single step was easy, and any could have been the one where I - quite legitimately - gave up. But I persisted.

I don't know what possessed me to start that final run, but by the end I knew exactly what I was running for and I now know exactly why I'm going to complete this programme: Because I'm better than people think and it's about damn time I showed them!

Sorry for the long post. I guess I had a lot to get off my chest and onto the Internet. 

Tl;dr - I ran. I ran well. I ran with purpose."
25o8pa,3,2014-05-15,Need advice on what certs / jobs after college,km0t,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/25o8pa/need_advice_on_what_certs_jobs_after_college/,"I just finished my junior year at my university.
I am going to be a senior next semester and I haven't gotten an internship yet.
I am majoring in Computer Science with a concentration in Information Systems.
My professors are horrible at teaching and when I asked my advisor what jobs I should be looking into after graduating she just went on google and typed ""top jobs for computer science majors"" ... i was like wtf...
I can do some small java programming and i'm not really that good at programming but I was thinking maybe look for a career in IT / IT project managers(?)
I need some help looking for something that will fit my major as a career. As of right now I have no clue what to look for or what to do after my college career is over.
I honestly think it's too late for me to start learning how to program ""well"" now. I have a year left of school and I'm sure someone in high school can out-code me...


------
Should I go after certifications now? This summer I don't have an internship and will probably do some retail job to make some money. 

What should I be looking into to start a career in IT after my last year of college next year?"
25ohbi,1,2014-05-15,Is my job trying to promote me or replace me?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/25ohbi/is_my_job_trying_to_promote_me_or_replace_me/,"So my team at work is as follows: 

COO: In charge of the two brands I work on, as well as a third. Is really annoying and condescending.
Account Executive: My direct supervisor. She is really awesome and we get along well. She has a ton of responsibility.
Sales Assistant 1: My coworker. He has been with the company for 2 years, and is well liked and super analytical.
Sales Assistant 2: Me. Have been with my company for a year and nine months, and am also well liked and good at my job.

Sales Assistant 1 and I approached our Account Executive over the summer about getting a raise. She told us it would probably be the industry standard of 5%, and would take some time to get approved. She was also pushing for it to be retroactive to our start dates. In February, we each found out we were getting a 15% raise that was retroactive. We mentioned wanting our titles changed as well, but that conversation was shut down. 

Which brings us to now. We also have an Analyst position open on our team, and there has been a ton of turnover within in it. The last analyst was 100% useless, and EXTREMELY well compensated. Despite the fact that she spent all day on gchat, wasn't a team player, never completed work on time, and then left us with a bunch of uncompleted projects and files that crashed, she was not let go. She left for a better position with another company after 7 months.

Her responsibilities were subsequently shifted to me and Sales Assistant 1 while they searched for her replacement. 

Anyway, last week, Sales Assistant 1 and I spoke with our Account Executive separately regarding title changes, as our jobs have grown so much. We each received different responses. I was thanked for not just turning in my two weeks notice, and instead telling her I needed a change, so we could work on it. She also said that if we left, she wouldn't be far behind us.  Sales Assistant 1 was told that if he wanted to leave, they understand, and would give him a glowing recommendation.

The 3 of us then sat down with COO. We pointed out that our titles are the same as the retail store associates, which is the total opposite of what we do. We said we were taking on a lot of work, and wanted to be involved in more meetings so that we could see a process through entirely. COO was very condescending in this meeting. He told us that it wasn't about the title, and was instead about the learning experience. He said that he wanted to narrow our jobs so that we are less involved in everything and more focused on a few tasks. We basically were like ""Well we are fine with the workload, and that isn't what we are saying, but its your choice.""

Fast forward to yesterday. Account Executive and COO went into COO's office for a long time with the door shut. When Account Executive came out, she had two pieces of paper that were folded. I got a glimpse of one and it looked like a resume. I was going into a meeting with the two of them, so told Sales Assistant 1 to take a peek at the papers.

He took a picture, and we looked at them later. They were both resumes for people who would be qualified to take our jobs WHEN WE WERE HIRED. They couldn't do our jobs now. For example, 1 resume was a girl who had worked at a major brand for 5 months, and had clearly been let go, since she was no longer there and on the job hunt. The other resume was a former intern that was really great. 

Account Executive let us know later that day that our conversation last week was not forgotten, and that we would all chat about it again Friday (tomorrow). We asked if it was going to be a good conversation or a bad one, and she wouldn't say. Then today, we said we were worried about it, and would like a heads up as to the conversation. She said not to be worried, but that was all she could say.

Just today, I completed a 500k package for a client and our global headquarters, and both COO and Account Executive said it was amazing. Sales Assistant 1 built a report for both of us that will streamline a major part of our job, without being asked. Account Executive e-mailed us each individually to praise us on our wonderful performance.

What is going on?? Thanks reddit jobs!

25oi59,41,2014-05-15,"Reddit throws itself a pity party, blames all their problems on the greatest evil of our time - ""baby boomers""",jamie_byron_dean,circlebroke,https://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/25oi59/reddit_throws_itself_a_pity_party_blames_all/,"[Young people 'feel they have nothing to live for' ""Almost a third of long-term unemployed young people have contemplated taking their own lives.""](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/25nl84/young_people_feel_they_have_nothing_to_live_for/)

I feel like any thoughtful person should realize fairly early in life how futile/stupid it is to blame their problems on ""the next generation,"" for example young people being unfairly maligned by older generations as ""the problem with the world these days."" Young people are rightly offended when older people categorize them all and blame them all for the world's ills, because that's a stupid thing to do.

So I'm completely flabbergasted how ready and willing reddit's ""younger generation"" is to turn the tables and blame the past generation - basically, their parents - for all of their problems. Why are we so quick to do this? Can't you see how inherently absurd it is to blame ""baby boomers"" for every single problem in society? It's literally - and I mean this literally - like going, ""FUCK YOU, MOM AND DAD! IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT!""

The anti-baby boomer jerk on this website just really gets me mad, because first off it's fundamentally stupid, but mostly because it's very offensive to a lot of really hard-working, capable people - i.e., our parents. What right do a bunch of kids who grew up playing WoW all day have to blame ""old people"" for everything? (but now I'm doing the opposite - blaming a generation of ""kids"" for being worthless sacks of shit - but spending as much time as I do on reddit, can you blame me?)

In /r/worldnews, a BBC article reports on a general malaise amongst the young and unemployed. Being young and unemployed myself, I feel the pain. But I also realize that blaming my parents for my unemployment is the absolute stupidest fucking bullshit in existence. If anything, we should - in general - be thankful and appreciative for the world they have given us. It's better than the world they inherited, that's for sure. Black people have rights now, that's something, huh? Gay people aren't routinely beaten. *The entire world isn't at war with itself.* Etc.

But the folks at /r/worldnews just throw nuance out the window and, in the flurry of feeling sorry for themselves, focus the blame on one thing, and it's certainly not themselves: Baby Boomers.

I'm going to skip all of the pity-party comments, because I don't want to possibly make people who are already feeling lousy feel even lousier for feeling lousy. However, the pity-party is definitely the prime contender for the circlejerk of the hour. 

The top comment is pity-party, that's okay. The second top comment changes course, and gets gilded along the way.

&gt;Can you blame us? The baby boomers spend half their time telling us we're worthless, and the other half taking our money and rolling in it. We can't get jobs, our opinions are dismissed, our rights are constantly being taken away by those who don't even understand how our generation functions. We're paradoxically both completely on our own and yet forced to rely on our parents because we can't do anything on our own, because the world won't let us.

&gt;It's time for us to stand up to our grandparents' generation and take our world for ourselves and for the future. I'm tired of being told that what we believe in isn't worth believing in. And I'm sure the rest of us are too.

Ahh, yes, that's it. ""Baby boomers."" They're like the ""SRS"" of the real world - anytime someone downvotes you, it's an SRS-brigade. Anytime you can't get a job, it's a baby boomer stealing it. 

""Our opinions are dismissed."" Are they? Kind of like how y'all dismiss every opinion that isn't atheist/STEM/google fiber/net neutrality? 

""Our rights are constantly being taken away by those who don't even understand how our generation functions."" Are they? Did they take away our right to vote? Did they take away our right to freeze peaches? What rights have we lost? The right to unlimited torrenting and porn? Well, maybe, they're starting to encroach on that right - which, curiously, isn't a right at all, is it?

""The world won't let us do anything on our own."" This is just bullshit. This isn't even an assertion, I don't want to even credit this statement as a statement. It's just ludicrous. What is stopping this redditor from doing *literally anything they could possibly want to do in the world?* I think it's a fairly uncontroversial statement to say that today's generations have more freedom to ""do what they want on their own"" than any other generation in the past. 

The second paragraph, though, gets into that absolutely absurd histrionic ""rally the people"" address that actually believes things like, ""It's time for us to stand up to our grandparents' generation and take our world for ourselves and for the future."" 

Basically saying, ""there ain't room on this planet for the both of us. Either you go, grandma, or I go. And I'm not leaving.""

It's stupid, it's thoughtless, it's hypocritical.

I'm going to move on to the next top comment chain.

&gt;While the baby boomers are delaying their retirement and passing laws that protect their own interest

There it is again, of course - fucking *baby boomers.* How dare they *have jobs.* How dare they *keep working where they've spent the last 40 years working.* Don't they know that when you reach, what, 50 years old? you're supposed to just surrender your entire livelihood to the young people? You're not allowed to have a life at 50 - only children are allowed lives. Old people just need to step aside already! Hogging all the precious jobs and oxygen!

&gt;&gt;Whenever I talk politics with my pop. He consistently says ""the baby boomers are fucking everyone over, and its people your age(im 23) who are gonna have to clean it up"". btw he is part of the generation hes blaming

&gt;&gt;&gt;I salute your dad.

Just including that little exchange for the ridiculous image of a redditor ""saluting"" a baby boomer for being part of the circlejerk.

Curiously, some kind of weird Finland jerk follows this, but I'm not going to go there.

&gt;We are a nation of over-qualified people working shit mundane jobs that offer no oppertunity, fulfillment or even enough pay to afford a basic living.

This is pity-party, and I said I wasn't going to focus on pity-party, but it's still kind of... pathetic, for lack of a better word. What do redditors think the world used to be like? Do they think it used to be *better?* 

&gt;&gt;""Go to University,"" they said. ""You'll get a good job,"" they said.
Fat lot of good that did me. I got a Criminology degree, which is just a specialized Arts degree. I studied what interested me, and even did internships and volunteering during school.
I graduated a year ago and have gotten 3 interviews with ""career"" type jobs during that time, and am extremely underemployed working as a security guard while I beat my head against the wall that is job searching. I try to spend an hour a day on applying to jobs, which generally equates to 7-10 applications per week.
I make $1800 a month after tax, and my rent is 600, internet and phone another 100, car payment and insurance 400 (need it for my job), $300 for student loans. This leaves $400 a month for everything else. This includes my food, cat food and litter, repairs to the car if it needs it (recently had a $500 repair), gas for the car. I recently started playing WoW again so that it will keep me entertained relatively cheaply, but I might even have to cut that expense. I can't even afford things like a first aid course or various other courses that I would maybe be able to get a better job with.
Most days I feel fucking worthless. My sisters, who didn't even graduate fucking high school make more than me because they started working at 16 and worked their way up in companies. I regret getting my stupid degree. I should have just gone and learned a trade rather than waste 4 years and thousands of dollars. Moving back in with parents isn't an option because I don't have a good relationship with them. I was out on my ass as soon as their legal obligation was done. I am certainly in the group that has considered taking their own life. I am sick of wondering how I am going to make ends meet. I am sick of banging my head against a wall trying to get a better job. I am sick of feeling worthless.

More of this same old song, ""they fed me lies about getting a degree! I studied what I wanted to study and they haven't even handed me a well-paying, fulfilling career! FUCKING PEOPLE!"" 

I feel their problems, I really do - but what's with the excessive finger-pointing? And on top of that, what happened to the idea of education for education's sake? But that's another issue.

&gt;&gt;Fifteen to twenty years ago Republicans loved telling people they need to adapt to changes in the market place by seeking out more training, education; and while people were doing just that, they worked with corporations to make it easier to bring in H1B visas, shift jobs overseas and making it easier for US companies to never bring profits home or pay taxes.

Ahhh, yes. It's not actually Baby Boomers that are the problem - it's REPUBLICANS. Republicans are bad, y'see? They have different opinions than me, which makes them absolutely evil. 

&gt;Being a NEET is suffering. It's fun at first because you have all the time in the world to play vidya, watch animu, read books, read articles, watch movies, etc., but then your situation eats away at you. You feel worthless because your life is going nowhere. Even if you are on some form of assistance, you still feel worthless because you aren't able to support yourself. Even being on assistance still has stigma attached to it. I didn't tell people that I was on unemployment insurance. I wasn't particularly ashamed of it because I was laid off through no fault of my own, but it's not anyone else's business. I don't know about the UK, but I'm pretty sure most, if not all, US states lack any legislation to prevent discrimination against the chronically unemployed. The chronically unemployed are just lazy bums who aren't trying hard enough anyway, right?

Maximum pity party. *Maximum.* I don't even really feel sorry for this guy, it's just so over-the-top and self-obsessed. And it ends with a call for the government to mandate - mandate what, exactly? That the ""chronically unemployed"" get first-pick when it comes to jobs? Affirmative action for ""NEETs""?

&gt;&gt;There's a lot of compassionate people here, but a large enough and vocal portion have too much of a ""screw you, I got mine"" and an ""American Dream = if I could do it, you can too; if you can't you must be lazy"" mindset.
I wish there were some way in today's society where you could live, be comfortable, and pursue interest, even if you can't ""prove worth"" to society by becoming a wage slave or turning something else like artistic talent into profits.

First off, no one is more ""fuck you, I got mine"" than the reddit hivemind. Second, what do they want? They want to live comfortable, happy lives without working a job (i.e. ""wage slavery,"" what an offensive phrase), but they don't want to have to ""produce art"" either. They just want to play WoW all day. I mean what else can that mean, if ""jobs"" and ""art"" are off the table?

&gt;I'm a young, full time employee and I still feel this way. I thought for the longest time that money and being busy would make me happier but my mind set hasn't changed.

I mean... Now we're just legitimately feeling sorry for ourselves. Is this person learning the lesson that ""money can't buy happiness?"" Good. That's a good lesson to learn. But what do these folks want out of life, if neither unemployment nor employment satisfy them?

&gt;It's even worse when you can't work due to health complications but don't qualify for disability.
And the social workers don't give a flying fuck. I had a worker once pass me a job opportunity that had expired two weeks prior and for students under 25 (I'm 30).
Having to justify your existance to a social worker is one of the most demeaning things on the planet. Most of them only care about one thing, getting you off social assistance.
They don't give a fuck about your problems and think everybody who looks healthy is healthy. Like they've all got fuckin' medical degrees.

This one shies away from blaming baby boomers and instead blames ""social workers."" I just don't appreciate how redditors villify (he said, villifying redditors) every group that somehow might partially not make their lives perfect. ""Social workers"" are not the fucking problem here. They're not your enemy. Neither are baby boomers - i.e., your parents.

Some other top-level comments talk about the future of automation and stuff, which I consider to be a worthwhlie conversation - at the very least, it isn't blaming generations of human beings for their problems. This discussion is immediately rounded off to one of reddit's favorite concepts: free money.

&gt;Another reason why we need a guaranteed minimum income
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guaranteed_minimum_income

Yeah, sure, okay. Whatever. Just keep pushing for free money, that's the solution.

This following exchange hits on a number of smaller circlejerks, largely histrionic and hypothetical in nature:

&gt;This is how you spark revolutions. Huge populations of people who feel like they have no hope and could potentially blame the source of their lack of hope on the government or society. It's like a dry forest, just needs a spark...

&gt;&gt;Why do you think all the police departments around the country have gotten new tanks and swat gear? Why do you think the DHS has billions of rounds of ammo laying in wait?
You think they don't know what you're saying? They are totally prepared. You aren't.

Come off it, already. Don't blame ""the police state"" now.

Finally - and I've pretty much given up on my ""no pity-party"" talk, sorry about that, but;

&gt;I've actually been having these thoughts for awhile, really ever since I turned 13. Six years later I still have the same general feeling of hopelessness. That, as a person, I'm going to be ignored by all the ""big things"" in the world. The government doesn't listen to the people, businesses sure as hell don't care about us either.
I guess I just don't have the feeling of an open world that my parents or grandparents did. I feel confined, knowing that I'm going to live out my life relatively unknown, and as a mindless worker bee. My finance teacher in my senior year taught us that our generation was slated to have an average of 11 different careers each, in our entire lifetime.
But mostly it's the entire, ""I feel insignificant and expendable"" thing.

This is funny. A 13-year-old really understands what it's like to be fresh out of college without any career prospects. Businesses don't care about you? Oh noes! Why doesn't Wal-Mart care about you? Why doesn't Ace Hardware come to your house and give you money and a house and a family and happiness forever? Fucking corporations, man!

""I guess I just don't have the feeling of an open world that my parents or grandparents did. I feel confined, knowing that I'm going to live out my life relatively unknown, and as a mindless worker bee.""

But *that's* the worst thing about this mega-jerk. Complete lack of historical awareness. Your grandparents weren't ""more free"" than you. If they were minorities, they were literally *less free.* If they weren't minorities, they probably *still* were less free. What do you want? WHAT DO YOU WANT? Do you want to be recognized as a genius redditor, rather than a ""mindless worker bee and relatively unknown?"" The ""relatively unknown"" bit really gets to me - if you want to be known, just fucking *get out there and make yourself known.* For fuck's sake, sorry for repeating myself, but *what the fuck do you want/expect out of the world?*

&gt;&gt;The new world is basically, you are your own business and your own government. It is up to you to develop your own mutual aid and social support network, you cannot rely on the government who are stealing your cash to use on garbage. It is up to you to take advantage of the same shit the corps are taking advantage of.
And don't worry, reddit has your back, you aren't insignificant or expendable :D

Riiiiight. Because 150 years ago the government had everything for you, big business totes had your back, working conditions were amazing and everyone was happy and life was perfect.

""Don't worry, reddit has your back, you aren't insignificant or expendable."" 

LOL.

Man... I mean, wow.

&gt;If it weren't for my nice parents who would be heartbroken if I started being crazy, I would be robbing banks and generally fucking shit up.

Well now we're just entering ""criminal"" territory, aren't we?

&gt;&gt;I feel similarly. It's like what is the point in following society's rules when those rules don't afford me the opportunity to enjoy a decent quality of life?
If society refuses to give me the opportunity to take care of myself legally, then perhaps I will resort to other means to take care of myself.

""It's like **what is the point in following society's rules when those rules don't afford me the opportunity to enjoy a decent quality of life?**""

Do they hear themselves? What planet do they live on? What America/UK are they redditing from? I just... I just don't get it, honestly. I just don't know where they're getting these perspectives.

&gt;At what point do you stop trying to live and honest life, and at least enjoy ""not"" trying to? is it just me? or would you much rather become an evil villain than an honest dead person? When some people get down about life they get a, ""fuck me"" attitude, I'm one of the other people that get a ""fuck everyone else"" attitude.

They basically just said, ""I am the problem,"" but no, it's definitely those greedy, job-stealing baby boomers that are the problem. 

&gt;&gt;I do this too. I get very Walter White when life gets sucky. There's a certain point where you stop believing that karma will serve you well as long as you be good and follow the rules to earn what you want in life. It's hard to believe when you see others cruise past you, taking what they want and suffering not one bit for their transgressions. The past 2 years have seen my morals blur and my empathy fade. I wish it weren't so but it is. At least I'm aware of it, I guess...

Oh man. Oh *man.* They just referenced fucking *Breaking Bad.*

I swear to god, not a single person on the internet has actually watched that show, or they'd think twice about casually comparing themselves to the grand heroics of WW.

And finally, because I'm sick of treading through this unending morass of shit, and because it rounds off nicely with the circlejerk I (theoretically) came here to write about:

&gt;that's because the baby boomers have taken all of our future away from us, through their inaction, we're being forced to clean up their messes, and we'll be wasting our entire generation on it. maybe our children's generation as well.

""Inaction."" Because if there's one word I want to use to characterize the last century of human progress, it's ""inaction."" Oh look, the next comment is the same:

&gt;Boomers call younger gen's materialistic and entitled when they themselves (boomers) were the generation that insisted on the norm being a house with a garage and a big yard and full family, expensive power tools and a couple cars (because cars symbolize American freedom). What was so terrible with good communal living and public transit that they insisted on having the opposite?

I don't know what they're even talking about anymore. This is just inane. This is just juvenile. 

This website is turning me into a neo-conservative simply out of retaliation for all this pathetic bullshit they seem to actually believe. I want to distance myself as far as possible from whatever perverted ideology it is that redditors, en masse, subscribe to.

Fortunately y'all exist to counterjerk with me, or else I would've (gasp) stopped redditing years ago."

25ooqm,1,2014-05-15,Reaction to lowball job offer? Advice needed.,CEjobseeker,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/25ooqm/reaction_to_lowball_job_offer_advice_needed/,"Background: Recent MS in Civil Engineering - Environmental Focus - 2+ years relevant internship experience

I received a job offer today for a part time (~25 hrs) ""Supplemental Engineer I"" position for a local city government. City population about 60,000. They offered $18/hr, which made me balk a bit. No benefits and the position is funded until the end of 2014, but I cannot exceed 1040 hours total in a year. I told them I was expecting a bit more, closer to $25/hr as I had been earning $18ish at previous internships. There was no further negotiation attempt on their end and I told them I need about a week to decide, and that I am going to continue interviewing for a couple other positions.


This seems like a pretty lowball offer to me, there isn't a lot of data available but my research seems to show that something closer to $25/hr would be more fair. With 600/mo rent, student loans etc. their offer would leave me with a pretty tight budget.


The type of work is what I have been looking for (water resources/environmental) which makes it tough to react this way.


I have two more interviews this week for full time consulting firm positions, but I still don't want to reject this offer because I may not get offered these other positions. Did I react appropriately?"

I was looking to get an internship for this summer, but was unable to as I go to school in a different state and was unable to find an opportunity near me. I was wondering what is the best way to try to get my foot in the door as an engineer? Should I be doing research, working with my department, finding an internship? Obviously these are all good ideas, but which is the ""Most impressive""?

On a side note, I live in the area of NYC and was wondering if anyone knows of any Engineering firms, or companies, that would like to hire an electrical engineering intern for the summer, or might want to for next summer? I also program in java, so any firm that would do that would be awesome as well. Just names, so I know who to talk to next year!

Thanks guys."
25oz08,4,2014-05-16,[T][New York] Lunch with a French lady,silentwalker92,AssassinOrder,https://www.reddit.com/r/AssassinOrder/comments/25oz08/tnew_york_lunch_with_a_french_lady/,"Erik sits patiently in front of the conference table and reads through another intelligence files. The intelligences provided by local Abstergo ground operatives proved to be of limited worth, as the only thing he is sure about the local Assassin cell is that the den leader is someone named Jet. They are still unsure the exact location of the New York Assassin’s den, and the movements of the Assassins in New York are still untraceable most of the time. However, Erik does have an ace up his sleeves: he knows that Jet would sometimes frequent a local Italian restaurant, and Abstergo had assigned a ground operative posing as a waiter there. Erik is hoping Jet would drop by the restaurant later this week; he is ready to meet the Assassin den leader for the first time and establish contact with them.

An Abstergo clerk steps into the conference room and requests Erik’s presence at another room. Inside an executive office two floors above his usual operation room, Erik is being introduced to Mr. Harry Johnson, Abstergo’s Community Outreach Manager in New York.

“Good morning, Mr. Konrad. I am pleased to meet the new Templar in town finally. I am Harry Johnson, the local Community Outreach Manager here in New York.” Mr. Johnson and Erik shakes each other‘s hand and proceeds to take their seats.

“Mr. Konrad, my duty as the Community Outreach Manager in New York is to organize public community outreach events in New York for Abstergo. Yes, I do lead blood drives, fundraisers, visits to local orphanages, all those kind of Public Affairs activities. But, I also secretly liaise Abstergo connections with local New York politicians. I had heard about your other specialties in public affairs, and I hope that you would lend you expertise to us.”

“Well, I am delighted that my fellow colleagues in New York do appreciate my efforts in the political field. Yes, I would be honored to help you in any way I can, Mr. Johnson.” Erik wonders what side assignments this Mr. Johnson would need help with, so important that it may interrupt his operation on hunting down underground Assassin cells.

Mr. Johnson passes a file to Erik and goes on to explain the details inside the file. “Mr. Henry Goodman, forty two years old, African American, ex-New York General Attorney. Married with three kids and a dog, the perfect American family we have here. Mr. Goodman is expected to run for New York Governor later this year in the gubernatorial election, and we here at Abstergo are actually rooting for his opponent, which is a close ally and former employee of Abstergo. We are wondering if you could help us with this task on hand; we need to ensure Abstergo has a man inside the New York’s Governor Office.”

Erik grows suspicious when Mr. Johnson explained the nature of this task. Why would Abstergo New York branch assigned this duty to him? Surely, fixing an election and conducting smear campaigns against non-Abstergo allied candidates are not unfamiliar works for Abstergo. What are the New York Templars playing at? Erik knows that he couldn’t reject the assignment and he needs to perform well. Or at least that’s what Abstergo would want him to achieve. Or the American Templars sensed the secret nature behind Erik’s arrival here in New York? Do they know something about the seven-men-plot of the Templar’s Vienna Rite? Erik couldn’t risk being exposed, not after they finally managed to persuade three of the most powerful politicians in the world to join their secret plot.

Erik accepts the assignment and leaves the room. He now has two active operations in hand, not counting his true operation here in New York. Erik must ensure he doesn’t fail this particular assignment, or Abstergo’s New York branch would be suspicious of him. Erik picks up his phone and contacted one of the local Abstergo field agents. He needs to arrange a meeting with someone important later this afternoon, someone who could help Erik in long term.

___________________________________________________________

Erik walks into a French restaurant in downtown Manhattan. The waiter there points Erik to a reserved table, where a middle-aged French lady is already waiting there for him.

“Good afternoon, Madame. I hope I am not late for our little meeting here this afternoon. My name is Erik Konrad, and I work for Abstergo.” Erik pulls out his name card and gives it to the French lady across the table.

“Well, Mr. Konrad, we are not too late for anything, as long as Abstergo are paying for today’s lunch. I had ordered for both of us, and of course some fine champagne to moist our lips.” 

Erik smiles at the French lady. This is expected from a high-class escort, especially a Madame like the French lady in front of him. “That is for sure, Madame. How could we conduct business when there is no champagne on the table to help us clear our mind?”

The French lady seductively smiles back at Erik. She had personally known several high level Abstergo executives and slept with them as well, and she views Erik as another potential client that could bring in more revenues for her operations. “Mr. Konrad, I am sure that your contact had told you about me before setting up this meeting. I am Madame Lucie, and I run the most prestigious high-class escort service in the East Coast. I had previous experiences working with Abstergo, providing girls for some of the private events held by high level executives.”

Erik passes a small jewelry box to Madame Lucie, and the French lady opens it. Inside the jewelry box are diamonds worth at least one hundred thousand dollars, an amount even Madame Lucie doesn’t encounter regularly in her line of work.

“Madame Lucie, our business here requires complete confidentiality. Let’s remember that, shall we. I need you to provide an African American young lady, preferably still studying college or recently fresh out. She must be majoring in journalism or politics or any related field, as long as it fits her cover as an intern for election campaign. If you could hand her over to us by the end of this week, we shall reward you with another one hundred thousand dollars. I do expect one thing: no questions asked. The moment she is handed over to me, I expect you to keep this transaction a secret till death.” Erik firmly reminds Madame Lucie of the serious nature of this business transaction.

“Mr. Konrad, you should understand that some of my most loyal customers would pay sometimes up to ten thousand dollars to spend one night with my girls. In long term, selling you an asset so valuable as you had requested, for the price two hundred thousand dollars are not most economically profitable. Please explain to me, why I would want to sell off a girl so valuable just like that.” Madame Lucie tries to negotiate a better term with Erik, and Erik are exactly expecting this kind of reaction from a Madame. These kind of women are all the same around the world, whether you are American or European.

“Let me explain this very carefully, Madame Lucie: this business transaction will ensure Abstergo has one of the top politicians in the country within our control. The gentleman could even become the President one day, who knows. This transaction is not only about this one time, but an opening for more possible business between us, Madame. I promise you Madame, you will be benefited in long term by aligning yourself with our interest.” Erik convinces Madame Lucie that this business will be in the best interest of her future.

“Very well, Mr. Konrad. I hope that this would become a great start for the beneficial relationship between us. My contacts will use their best efforts to search such girl as requested throughout the country. Do expect delivery in a week.” Madame Lucie raises her glass and cheers with Erik.

“Yes, this will be a great start for our relationship. And when I mean relationship, would you be interested to join me for dinner tonight, Madame Lucie?” Erik slightly grins at Madame Lucie, hoping and expecting a positive reply from the French lady. Erik had been playing this game so long that he knew exactly when a woman is interested in a gentleman of stature like him.

“I don’t recall that’s part of the deal, Mr. Konrad.” Madame Lucie smiles back at Erik, trying to remain her composure.

“Do you really need money to enjoy a candlelight dinner with me, a gentleman like me, Lucie?” Erik makes his move, and Madame Lucie is both surprised and amused by the confidence showed by Erik. There is something special about this gentleman; maybe it’s his exotic lure as a British gentleman, or maybe it’s the power he hold within his hand. Either way, Madame Lucie wouldn’t mind to enjoy a dinner and maybe more with a gentleman so attractive like Erik.

“See you at my place at eight, Erik.” Madame Lucie makes a naughty seductive smile at Erik, and orders another bottle of champagne. "
25ozcu,1,2014-05-16,Wild fan here with an outside opinion and a few questions.,FriendzonePhill,penguins,https://www.reddit.com/r/penguins/comments/25ozcu/wild_fan_here_with_an_outside_opinion_and_a_few/,"I browsed this sub for a little while in the days after your loss (which I'm sorry about by the way. My Wild are out too, and these past few days have been quite depressing). I've seen a few posts about firing Dan Bylsma. My question for you is, how long has this been a topic of discussion? Relatively recently? Maybe going back to last year? I look at the way he's coached the last few years and it seems like he is a coach who is very ""by the book."" He runs HIS system, HIS way, and won't adjust his style of play to best fit the players or the in-game situation.

I was privileged to get to intern with NBC during the Olympics and covered almost every hockey game, including all USA games. He seems to lack passion (although I am not sure how accurate this is, as the post-game interviews were about the only time I saw him speak to media so I could be wrong), and he comes off as, to be quite frank, the wrong guy for the job, both for the Penguins and for Team USA. He also seems like he doesn't have the ability to lead, inspire, and get the most out of his players. You guys have a talented team, that's for darn sure! But these collapses in the playoffs seem to point to a common denominator; no matter how well your stars play, no matter who is in net, it comes back to Bylsma. I don't want to rub anyone the wrong way here, but with the talent you've had on the roster (especially last year), I thought of the Penguins as perennial Cup favorites. Team USA this year looked excellent, but again, after the loss to Canada, Team USA looked unfocused, undisciplined, and unmotivated, and I believe that comes from the coach.

As a follow up question, if Bylsma is fired, who would you want to see replace him as coach? Thanks for the time, and good luck next season!!"

(like he promised her, on the post-it)

I always thought this would be smart, because then they could bring back characters who are DEAD, through Meredith reliving her intern years and her thinking that it is real... like we saw with Elis. This way they could bring back George and Lexi, as well as characters who aren't in her life anymore, such as Izzy and Cristina. (though I'm sure Cristina would come back to Seattle if she got Alzheimer's.)

It would be a heartbreaking way to end Grey's Anatomy... but hey, it's always been that way.

My friend wrote this about me for our new website. I just wanted to share with you all! I will be posting cool articles and excerpts every now and then. Feel free to check us out on [shibescoop.com.](http://shibescoop.com)

Silk Road forever tarnished the reputation as Bitcoin.  Using Silk Road, people took refuge in the anonymity provided by cryptocurrency to commit heinous crimes.  I don’t mention this to imply that Bitcoin hasn’t been an amazing innovation.  It has. 

 Bitcoin has forever altered the way we think about currency and money. In my view, the pace at which information and communication travel has had the effect of decentralizing and challenging traditional centers of power.  For example, in some scholars’ estimation, the globalization of today’s economy has so drastically freed the flow of capital that national governments can no longer effectively wield the levers of economic policy to control the economy.  Cryptocurrency does the same in a small way.

For something to be a store of value, it doesn’t need to be controlled and distributed by the government. We, the people, are also capable of creating stores of value — we don’t always need the government. Granted, the US dollar and many other official currencies are more stable than Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and other such currencies, but having an alternative currency raises the purchasing power of the people and increases their ability to hold their governments’ accountable for the monetary policy they draft by decentralizing power. The case with Bitcoin, however, seems that some portion of the power and freedom created by the currency ended up going to people
willing to abuse it.

Maybe we learned from Bitcoin’s early missteps or maybe people are just changing for the better, but thus far, Dogecoin seems different.

It’s an amazing community in terms of its initiative and its heart.

Bitcoin has Silk Road.  Dogecoin has Talladega.

I was on Reddit this morning where I found a post titled “You shibes have quite the effect on people.”  See, I haven’t spent all that much time in the Dogecoin community. For the past few months though, it’s been a fairly big presence in my life, because when my best friend found it a few months ago, I think it changed his life in a way. I was on Reddit, because I wanted to learn more about a community and a phenomenon that’s a big part of my friends’ lives so I clicked on the link, and that’s how this article came into being.""Before I came here, I was cheap and kind of a dick""

It was that bear meme with the shibe’s eyes and facial expression photoshopped on, but that’s not really the point. As with many memes, the point was the pithy quote, or in this case, the heartwarming one: “Before I came here I was cheap and kind of a dick.”

We all know Dogecoin has done positive things for people. They funded an Olympic team that wouldn’t have otherwise been able to attend. At Dogecon SF, Dogecoin creator and keynote speaker Jackson Palmer noted that during Dogecoin’s 138 day life (at the time of the conference), more than $100,000 in Dogecoin has been raised for different charitable purposes. That is $724.64 in Dogecoin contributed to charity per day.  It’s impressive — that’s for sure, but undoubtedly, there are wealthy individuals and corporations whose contributions dwarf those of Dogecoin, but that’s not the point I’m trying to make here. I’m not saying that Dogecoin is the most amazing thing to hit the planet, because it donates to charity. It’s not the first to do so and certainly won’t be the last.

The point is that the community positively impacts the lives of not only those it helps through charitable endeavors, but also the members of the community. I think that’s special. These days, we do too many things and participate in too many things because we “have to” rather than because we want to or because we enjoy it or because it makes us a better person.

For example, this fall, I took a class on dance appreciation not because I wanted to or because it would make me happy but because my university has a fine arts requirement.

The Dogecoin community doesn’t seem like that to me. It’s like a group of friends that cracks inside jokes and helps each other and others out.  It’s kind of awesome.

In my view, and maybe I’m wrong (I’m sure he’ll correct me), my friend found the Dogecoin community at a time when he was losing motivation because of the pressures and hurdles life sometimes throws at you. He wants to become an investment banker or venture capitalist, and the pressure of that along with all the things you “have to” do to graduate and be successful had made him lose sight of why he wanted those things in the first place.

Dogecoin though, and cryptocurrency, reignited the spark. He was passionate again about investing, innovations, and entrepreneurship. His passion for cryptocurrency helped him land multiple internships, and since then, he has taken on a million different entrepreneurial projects.  There’s this website.  He created and built his own mining rig. He is in the process of creating an online college bookstore that accepts Dogecoin, Bitcoin, and Litecoin as payment.  These are all good things if you ask me.

Right now, Dogecoin feels like one of those good things in the world that improves the planet we live on in small but measurable ways.

So I guess, keep doing what you’re doing :)

25p9by,0,2014-05-16,I'd like your opinion on this situation,Jenny_Lite,MensRights,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/25p9by/id_like_your_opinion_on_this_situation/,"My company offers internships to a large number of University students and recent graduates in a number of different areas.

To be honest I'm not a massive fan of the program, for a lot of different reasons, and I tend not to have anything to do with it.

The recent batch's have tended to have quite a large proportion of women in, because of an effort the company makes to fill as many of the placements as possible with women.

So in a typical group, some will have more success than other. A lot of it comes down to how adept they are at making themselves useful, and putting themselves in a position where they can learn some useful skills.

The girls in the group tend to be a lot better at it, even though on average their level of academic knowledge is significantly lower.

So there's a lot of reasons for that, some of them are quite pretty (but not all of them) so in a majority male environment it can be a novelty to have a girl around (apart from me, for a lot of my colleagues my novelty has worn off). Also they're better at asking I think, as in they'll just walk up to groups and offer to make tea, and afterwards just kind of insert themselves into projects.

So anyway recently I came across a guy who was just finishing his placement and who had blatantly learned nothing. It was just a complete waste of time for everyone involved.

So it was his last week, I had some time on my hands and I thought why not I'll walk him through what I was working on, and give him some simple tasks to do. It wasn't any benefit to me, I was doing it simply to try and help him develop technically.

So we spent a morning working together. He had a bit of an episode, called me a few names and he didn't come back after lunch.

Now without going into details, I am someone that's very conscious of her position. We weren't equals, I was trying to get across a lot of information in a very short time, and he got caught up in the way I was saying it.

I get the impression that it was the fact that I had a vagina that really upset him, and he wasn't used to having a woman in a position of authority over him. I think some other people might have told him a few things about me, which made him less inclined to give me the respect my position deserved.

Anyway I thought this might be the environment to offer it up for discussion. I'd welcome any thoughts or questions people might have.

25piyh,53,2014-05-16,Just finished my first year of college and getting my first real job. I need advice on saving and investing.,CorruptHope,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/25piyh/just_finished_my_first_year_of_college_and/,"I'm currently attending Iowa State for Computer Engineering and just finished my first year of college. I didn't get any internships as it's kind of hard unless you have 1-2 years of previous experience in programming. Anyway, I'm getting my first job as a waiter in a nice restaurant. I've never really had good spending habits as I just use my debit card and jump at the chance of going out with friends.

What are some things I should do now that I'm getting my first job, and what should I be learning so I can invest later on once I have the money?"
25pjl1,10,2014-05-16,[Seeking] Creative Professional At the end of His Rope,[deleted],MNJobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/MNJobs/comments/25pjl1/seeking_creative_professional_at_the_end_of_his/,"Let me tell you a little bit about my qualifications and work experience.

Firstly, I have two bachelors degrees– one in Spanish and another in Studio Art. During college I was the campus photographer’s indispensable assistant who took his memory cards and selected, edited, and prepared his best shots for print and web. As well, I took on photography assignments once a week ranging from in-studio portraits to published photographs to supplement pieces in newsletters and the college website. I made $7.25 per hour and to this date, it was the most fulfilling job I’ve ever held.

When I left college in 2008, I pursued entry-level creative jobs with my strong background in industry-standard computer programs and a touted eye for detail and strong sense of marketing wherewithal. I applied for dozens of jobs weekly for five months from my parents’ house and received two interviews. From those, one granted me a second interview– yet in the end, I remained unemployed. My parents complaining that I was unrealistic and a worthless lump, I gave my name to a series of temp agencies that kept me working for about a year and a half. Some of these were able to utilize my fluency in Spanish and French, but never lasted longer than six months. In this time, I worked freelance either for free or for pennies so that I could develop a portfolio and references.

In this time, I have done campaigns for Crave Restaurants, ING Employee Benefits, Target Corp., Solera, and even managed to combine both my degrees for a Spanish newsmagazine. I proved myself innovative, efficient, reliable, and able to work under strict deadlines. I put all this in my résumé, backed it up with a concise portfolio, and applied again.

Nothing. Not even an internship, because I was “overqualified” for an internship. I applied for hospitality positions and fast food kitchens. I was overqualified to make McNuggets and didn’t have enough hospitality experience to deliver food. I continued answering phones on a two-week basis for temp agencies until I was determined overqualified for more.

About a year ago, I was given a job taking catalog orders over the phone in English and Spanish until one “High Volume” customer informed my supervisor that I “didn’t seem happy to take [his] order.” To the chagrin of the entire office, I was let go. I continue to take on freelance jobs, but many clients either expect me to work for free or have eleventh-hour qualms about my fee and either haggle me or decide they could do a better job in-house.

I continue to apply for jobs with silence on the other end or excuses that my freelance experience doesn’t count as “professional” experience. Others say that I need experience working in an office environment. When I point out that several of my freelance jobs are contract positions that found me in their offices, that doesn’t assuage their fears that I’m an unreliable, flighty risk of a hire because all I know are fortnight-long assignments.

So here I am, posting this from a cellphone-tethered internet connection because Comcast has disconnected my internet. In a roach-infested apartment that I’m now two weeks behind on paying rent for. I have $20 in my account from my last job.

I know this isn’t the standard way to ask for a job, and that’s because I’m no longer asking, I’m begging. Consider this as me on my knees praying. It’s coming up on six years since I graduated college and all I’ve gotten is a cyclical stream of excuses, denials, and silences.

So if you need a great, dedicated employee who’s willing to start small and grow big, I’m your man. Shoot me a message if you know of anything and I’ll be happy to give you a concise job history, list of qualifications, and a link to my portfolio. Don’t worry that I’ll be unreliable, because I’ve spent six years of firsthand experience knowing what it’s like to not have a stable job. I am and will continue to be a hardworking team player and fierce self-starter.

Thank you for your time. I hope to be your newest gladiator in a suit.

Yes, I have a suit."

[I block and delete cookies. I use ghostery. I add new fonts to my browser. I uninstall and reinstall my browser periodically. Sometimes I use TOR although it's a pain. When i can, I get my isp to change the IP. What else can I do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25paz2/iama_i_am_a_senior_web_analyst_for_the_worlds/chjf6jv?context=5)|First of all, not all cookies are bad. Some are simply helpful.
 |For example Gmail will remember who you are so you don't need to enter your details again.
 |In my opinion, you area already quite a bit. In terms of being more secure, deleting your cookies is a great start. TOR will make it even better. Changing your ISP will only mean that your IP address change to a different range for a small period of time.
 |However the industry recognises that the reliability of cookies is diminishing.  This is due to people using multiple devices, deleting their cookies, browsers not accepting cookies, automated cookie flushing etc.
 |So as cookies becomes less reliable, what can the profession do? Develop 'finger-printing' techniques that will identify the user to good accuracy. A company called Experian is doing a lot of work in this front.
 |With the fingerprinting techniques, only using TOR will help. 
[The EFF has a site that checks your browser fingerprint for you and tells you if you are unique or not. I go there every month or so, and usually mine is new and unique. I interpret this to mean that I have made sufficient changes in the month so that I won't be uniquely identified as the same user who tested it last month. Is that the right way to look at the result?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25paz2/iama_i_am_a_senior_web_analyst_for_the_worlds/chjfi8s?context=5)|So this is the type of finger printing that Experian are trying to develop but remember, they have a live database so you will need to change your browser details, ISP fairly regularly for them to loose track.
 |Or use TOR. 
[I alternate browsers. TOR is a bit slower and kind of clunky in my experience. My object is to make it more difficult to create a complete picture of my web activity. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25paz2/iama_i_am_a_senior_web_analyst_for_the_worlds/chjfqe0?context=5)|Remember, we can't, don't and never identify individuals.
 |Everything is aggregated, and more than likely sampled depending on the site you visit. 
[Somebody out there is tracking individuals. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25paz2/iama_i_am_a_senior_web_analyst_for_the_worlds/chjfy8p?context=5)|However the pregnant lady may search for prams or cots, in which there is an ad network that will serve targeted ads across websites using third party cookies. You can opt out of this fairly easily.
[How does one get started in the field of web analysis?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25paz2/iama_i_am_a_senior_web_analyst_for_the_worlds/chjghlw?context=5)|I got into it at a very early stage and I'm usually working for very large companies so we would usually get A LOT of CVs from people wanting to work in a field they don't really know about.
 |That's fine because no one really knows what they want to do whey they first finish uni but they way we go through CVs is literally quite cruel.
 |Any smallest mistake, we would disregard. Why? Because all the CVs look the same and most people have similar experiences.
 |You may want to learn about Google Analytics, as most smaller companies use that. Also look at Omniture, Webtrends or comScore.
 |Don't be afraid to test your own tagging by setting up your own small website and put Google Analytics on it, and use a plug-in in Firefox called Httpfox to track if your GA tags are firing through. You should be able to see the figures in GA.
 |Lastly become a ninja in Excel. I can't stress this enough. Learn vlookup, offset, match, pivot tables and know them well.
 |And one last point. Be lazy. Yes be lazy, always find better and faster ways of doing things. Find if you can automate reports so  you leave more of your precious time of actual analysis.
 |Hope this helps, anything else please let me know.  
[What about breaking into the field from another technical, programming intensive field, such as a physicist?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25paz2/iama_i_am_a_senior_web_analyst_for_the_worlds/chji6aq?context=5)|Programming for sure,  but if you have the brains to do programming.  You might as well as be a developer. (of analytics) 
[Thanks for all the info. Appreciate it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25paz2/iama_i_am_a_senior_web_analyst_for_the_worlds/chjhk73?context=5)|No worries. Let me know if you have any questions. 
[Keep up the good work, man. It's such an exciting field, I love working in it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25paz2/iama_i_am_a_senior_web_analyst_for_the_worlds/chjjflq?context=5)|Yeah, I love my APIs.. integrating a few into Excel now actual so it's pretty cool.
[I'm incredibly lazy, with no relevant skills.  Would I be a top candidate or merely competitive?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25paz2/iama_i_am_a_senior_web_analyst_for_the_worlds/chjimqn?context=5)|Yes. Very much so. Find shortcuts in doing things and you will be on a winning path. 
[What's the most interesting part of your job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25paz2/iama_i_am_a_senior_web_analyst_for_the_worlds/chjg06e?context=5)|Looking at how customers respond to different website changes, conversion rates and how the industry will move with the uptake of technology.
 |The industry is heavily trying to shift from a browser view to a user view so we will understand users that shift from an iPad to their browser or browser to a different browser on the computer. This part of innivation I'm very interest in.
 |I'm also very excited in linking up several databases. So for example, if we know that we've served you an ad and we also know your loyalty card details for Walmart, and a week later - you made a purchase for the product in Walmart, we will be able to do some amazing conversion analysis on that. 
[What was your best salary?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25paz2/iama_i_am_a_senior_web_analyst_for_the_worlds/chjggv9?context=5)|At around $150k USD. 
[By which I mean, at a certain point up until about five years ago, it seemed like the user experience was the focus of a lot of design development, and websites &amp; mobile interaction were developing in a direction of greater, more intuitive ease of interaction. I'm talking about page design, content delivery, indexing &amp; search services, etc.  That process seems to have largely stopped. Just my layman's opinion of course, but for example Facebook's ""timeline"" style seems extremely clunky to navigate, with a lot of counterintuitive features that make it hard to find anything specific you might be looking for. Facebook seems designed for a passive experience, channeling its users like cattle towards currently ""trending"" items of interest and cutting off user-directed search &amp; exploration. Netflix refuses to simply index their list of titles, instead forcing everything into duplicative categories, so that you'll see the same title a dozen times if you're browsing (You'll see *Aliens* again and again under scifi, thriller, action-adventure, award-winning films, etc.\). Obviously Netflix is trying to hide a lack of variety and make it appear their slate of titles is deeper than it really is. Youtube has become a virtual warzone of copyright infringement, so that thousands of videos disappear every day: 6-7 years ago it was an archive of everything in the universe, and now it's like a rotating news site where links die by the trainload overnight and you can't count on anything being there tomorrow. Google's search engine is infested with paid rankings, user profiling and other commercial &amp; legal distortions that make it far less useful and all-encompassing than it once was.  In other words, utility no longer seems to be driving web development &amp; user experience. Commerce, web marketing, legal challenges, new platform development (i.e. mobile phones &amp; touchpads\) and social engineering seem to have infested the entire system, seriously degrading the basic function of providing useful information to end users. Rather than increasing the end-user's access to information, it seems like today's web development seeks to limit and channel users into a far more passive experience.  I should add that this isn't a *new* style of web development: America Online was a Potemkin village from the beginning, designed to fool naive web users into thinking they were on the internet while herding them through transaction points like cattle. I guess I'm saying the entire web seems to be turning into America Online.  What's your view on this trend? Do you agree with me that things are deteriorating or do you see more positive developments?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25paz2/iama_i_am_a_senior_web_analyst_for_the_worlds/chjgkhv?context=5)|I have to disagree with you there as a lot of what I do is to **improve** user experience.  It is very rarely (never) that an ad sales director would come to our team saying they want more clicks on certain ad sales and how we can optimise that. Not in the companies I've worked for anyway.
 |In fact, I work very closely with the UI team and also product team to drive a better product experience.  I know a few companies that would, Facebook for example is one of them and Dailymail (UK) also optimised their sites for an ad-driven revenue model. 
[Change is not always good, and needs to be in response to the users requests ... not just change for changes sake, a new version every other day, and a loss of functionality all round just when people are getting used to it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25paz2/iama_i_am_a_senior_web_analyst_for_the_worlds/chjhcn6?context=5)|If its core content and they don't make money off subscriptions,  they need to drive the ads as much as possible. However if it's a ecommerce site, and the change to increase ad space screws up the conversion rate. It will never be approved.  A change in 0.5% of conversion rate for a multi million dollar company is a lot of loss revenue. 
[Hi, Whats your best life advice?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25paz2/iama_i_am_a_senior_web_analyst_for_the_worlds/chjfsp3?context=5)|If I get angry at something, or someone. I always think ""In two days time will this matter...? Or ten day...? or two months?""

[How much scraping of Facebook, twitter, and other social websites goes on? I don't use any except this one, by the way. Can Experien, TransUnion et al match emails to credit card purchases to FB and other social media sites? Do they try?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25paz2/iama_i_am_a_senior_web_analyst_for_the_worlds/chjfkq5?context=5)|In some media companies, they want to drive a higher CPM (cost per thousand) via targeted ads so they would want to gather information.
 |In terms of gathering information, companies are not really allowed to scrap. They may limit the content you watch without logging in with your details (or via facebook etc)
 |*edited thousand, not million. - thanks to /u/Techwood111.
[Since when is CPM not Cost per Thousand?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25paz2/iama_i_am_a_senior_web_analyst_for_the_worlds/chji3m2?context=5)|Sorry, it is thousand. Cost per mille.
 |I'm not too involved in advertising part but more site analytics. 
[Did you just learn that only a thousandth of the people you thought visit your site actually do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25paz2/iama_i_am_a_senior_web_analyst_for_the_worlds/chjifj7?context=5)|No, CPM is not a metric I use.
 |It's more of an advertising term that the sales guys use. I give them the actual unique browsers, visits etc and they in term that into CPM within their team. 
[WebTrends, Omniture, Tealeaf, Google Analytics, &amp; OpinionLab. How are you using these tools to track visitors and build personas?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25paz2/iama_i_am_a_senior_web_analyst_for_the_worlds/chjh97u?context=5)|Omniture's Insight does this really well which integrates with Omniture.

They are considered as affiliates.  
[What are your thought on A/B testing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25paz2/iama_i_am_a_senior_web_analyst_for_the_worlds/chjjrdi?context=5)|It's a safety net of allowing us to test concepts without much exposure or damage to the conversion rate.

25pya7,2,2014-05-16,What is a Technical Product Support position (level 1) ? How much do they make ?,kevhart,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/25pya7/what_is_a_technical_product_support_position/,"Hello all,  I had applied to a job thinking it would be good for someone at my level ..

( fresh out of college with a I.T degree, 1 internship under belt, 6/7 months help desk experience from work, experience with computer sales; SQL/Java?Python/Linux/Networking and Pen-testing tool classes from college).



Now, they have called back and want an on-site interview next week. 
The title of the job is : ""**Technical Product Support** (level 1) ""..................but I have no idea what to expect for such an interview as it is probably not similar to the IT Helpdesk/ Jr. Sysadmin positions I have been applying for so far.

The job requirements are a combination of some of these tasks:

1. Sales support

2. A HelpDesk position ( Remote and local Support)

3. A QA-Tester Position

4. Technical Integrations services tied to Database/Linux 

5. Customer Management and provide training 

I have enough experience and knowledge in each of them, but I have never seen a position before where all of these are required. Doing a Google search didn't turn up anything too solid for the preparation of the interview.  - I could just go over the topics that I listed above, but I am getting pretty nervous because I have not faced an interview like this before. Could someone here tell me what I should expect. 


- Also, it does not matter too much me, but, how much does someone in a position like this make ? 

Hope someone can answer my questions...it really will help clear things up for me."
25q7g8,151,2014-05-16,UPDATE #2: I [28F] need help movitating my husband [31M] of 4 years... now he's started lying.,throwitaway12356,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/25q7g8/update_2_i_28f_need_help_movitating_my_husband/,"Original: http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1p8w39/i_28f_need_help_movitating_my_husband_31m_of_4/

Update 1: http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1xlmo1/update_i_28f_need_help_movitating_my_husband_31m/

Firstly, I thank absolutely everyone who responded from the bottom of my heart. I apologize for not responding to everyone, I was very stressed out about the situation and needed time to think. I got some great advice. This is a happy update! 

I read everyone's responses carefully. When my husband came home the day after I posted, I had a prepared statement (a lot of which I borrowed from Reddit). I told him that that I would be moving back to our home country after I graduated, and we could either continue as a LDR or divorce based on his progress/situation (giving him almost a year to get his shit together). I told me it was killing me to see him drown without doing anything to help himself, that it didn't fit our life plan that we'd made together, that it wasn't healthy, and it wasn't a good role model for our future kids. 

I then told him I would do two last things for him: Pay for him to see a therapist (for as long as he needed), and book a doctor's appointment to be evaluated for depression. I told him he could not play any more video games and that he had to make some changes that I could see (study habits, getting up on time, etc). 

Luckily, he took these things very seriously. The doctor diagnosed him as borderline depressed (and also revealed some things that even I didn't know, like that he'd had suicidal thoughts), but chose not to take medication as he wanted to try therapy first. He hit it off with his therapist and they saw each other for 3 months, leading up to now. They worked through a lot of his mental blocks that he had with going to school and putting all of his energy into computer gaming, such as why he has escaping and how to prevent it from happening. He also made several appointments with his school counselor on his own and went to those. He talked to a school friend of his (ahead of him in the program) and started to get interesting in the jobs he could actually do with his degree. 

Since then, he followed through with his own plan of going to re-exams and passed all of them. He made up most of the classes that he was missing, and has been going regularly and on time. He also set some goals for himself, such as that he would get up and shower every morning and make breakfast, which he has also followed through on. He applied to several engineering firms to work as an intern. He didn't end up getting a place anywhere, but just him TRYING is a major change. 

He has also gotten more dedicated to going to the gym, and has made a few friends - again, almost shockingly different from before. 

While it's still a long road - he has approximately 1.5 years of school left - things are looking way, way up. I am really excited about the future, and I definitely want a future with him. 

Thank you guys so, so much. I cannot thank you all enough. 

**TL;DR** Followed Reddit's advice and gave the hubs an ultimatum. He responded well and is now on a better and hopefully permanent path. "

While signing the contract I found there was no end-date. Is this some sort of tactic to get me to stay after I graduate? The pay is amazing for a cheme intern (32/hr) but I honestly want to make more when I graduate. If I get trapped here with some sort of non-compete I would be unhappy.

Things are starting to look up a little bit for me though. I interned at a community based recovery center during my last semester in college. A lot of what I did was just hanging out with the members, listening to their struggles with substance abuse recovery, and offer any advice if they asked for it. I also spent time helping members find and apply for work, as well as get involved in any of the community help programs in the area. 

I loved what I did at my internship, it felt like I actually made a difference every day. On a lark I applied for case manager position at a homeless shelter for teenagers, it seemed similar to what I did at my internship and like something I would be interested in making a career out of. My resume was sent out yesterday afternoon, and today I received a phone call where I had the position explained to me fully and an interview set up for this coming Monday.

And today, I came to the conclusion that I hate myself. 

Part of it is because I traveled to China for an internship over the summer and was alone in a foreign country without knowing the language. For two months. 

Another part of it was a case of Eczema that looked so bad I could barely go out in public. 

When I got back after the internship, I was a wreck, and I had forgotten how to live my life. It's been three quarters of college since then, and I've improved each quarter. My Eczema has been treated, but the scars are still visible. I was almost back to my old self, but I just seem to be getting more depressed every day. 

I use to be carefree and secure my freshman and sophomore years, and now, I'm so insecure that people who thought of me as a role model can tell... 

I've had one session with a counselor and plan to continue, but it just kills me everyday. It also doesn't help that no matter how many woman I talk to, I seem to just bounce from one to the next. I make real connections, but fail to communicate my emotions or what I want. I don't want to be a creepy dude, so I try too hard to be a gentleman. It just ends up with me falling asleep feeling more lonely than the night before.

25qr52,2,2014-05-16,I'd like to learn bash scripting,smiles134,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/25qr52/id_like_to_learn_bash_scripting/,"TL;DR I'm trying to expand my skill set so that it's marketable.

In October, I got hired at an engineering and research center to be a student sysadmin. Essentially, I serve as help desk support while also learning how to be a sysadmin and gaining real world work experience. It's equivalent in my mind to an internship. 

Anyways, I got hired to be a Windows admin as well as a Mac admin. I said on my application and in my interview that I had almost no real experience working with Macs but that I'd be willing to learn and use the system.

Fast-forward to now, and I'm comfortable efficient using my iMac and I think I may resolve more support tickets on the Mac side than on the Windows side. A problem with the macs in our building, however, is that the user accounts don't run on our Windows Active Directory, but our Unix and Windows accounts do. What that means is that every user's Mac is configured with local accounts, and that includes administrator and root accounts.

When we change our admin passwords, the Mac computers hardly ever get changed because we have to do them all individually. Which means that when I'm trying to remotely connect to a machine, I sometimes have to use admin passwords that were in effect before I was even hired. We've gone through three admin passwords in that time because of changing employees and the Heartbleed vulnerability. So our Mac machines are operating on at least 4 different admin passwords, which is a fairly large security risk.

I brought this up to my superiors and they suggested that a good summer project for me would be to create a shell script that goes to each Mac and checks the password for root and admin, and updates it if necessary. 

BUT, I don't know the first thing about shell scripting. My only experience using unix commands have been through the Mac terminal since I've been hired. Eventually, I'll probably be getting a job as a sysadmin after I graduate to support myself before I go to grad school, and so I'd really like to learn as much about the field as I can in the time that I have left here.

Does anyone know of any good online resources where I can learn more about shell scripting and unix in general?"

The coveted ""Senior"" title...Clawed from the grasping arms of stubborn tickets, sleepless nights and weeks well over 40 hours.  And not an extra penny in sight.  Though in retrospect that was probably a good thing, I'll save the story of the SD Card Piggy Bank for later.  After my promotion I had to ~~plunder~~ falsify my operations budget just to pay for new business cards.  Needless to say I didn't have one of those engraved name plates hanging on my office door.  I didnt have a door.  Or an office.  But from my cube I proudly updated my e-mail signature and continued to do the same work I had been doing for the past three years.

Fast forward nine months, the owners wife is about to pop, and the assistance from upper management that had been keeping my head afloat has been strategically reassigned to babymania.  At least my *nix kung-fu will save me from ever having to worry about that particular problem...But I digress.  The time has come to bring balance to the e-mail signatures.  We hired some Jrs.  Applications came from all corners of the city, interns and hipsters and retirees looking to make some extra money doing what they've always done, since computers haven't changed much since the mainframe and punch card days, amirite?  With all the power and glory vested in me by my Senior e-mail signature, I was excluded entirely from the hiring process.  My PFY's were foisted upon me to be managed, trained, or some combination thereof.  

The hipster wasn't so bad; anyone whom shares a flat with an ambitious baker and proceeds to bring the bountiful excess shall have a place in my cube farm.  For I am a magnanimous Senior Network Engineer, a fact I remind the hipster of only *six* times per day.  

The intern was eager.  To sit on facebook and pinterest, but in her defense googled every acronym she didnt understand.  And just as quickly shared her new found knowledge of the mysterious Server Sanctum Sanctorum with her twitter followers.  

The elder PFY could disassemble and reassemble a printer faster than any hands I had ever seen.  Though his coffee tumbler trembled as he sipped, the temblors of his liver spotted hands quieted when pinching a screwdriver between thumb and wrinkled index finger, and he became a surgeon on an anti-static operating table.  Him.  Him I liked.  He brought a bottle of whiskey in his briefcase at the end of his first week and tucked it quietly away behind the Great Wall of three-ring binders that enshrined his ancient knowledge.  He never opened them.  I suppose proximity alone was enough to convey their mysteries to him.

Which brings our story to the Great Nepotini.  Nepotini was a wiry, middle-aged man with wild hair and a penchant for plaid button-downs.  He was an architect by trade, but somehow landed the cube by the window on the other side of the office...Far from my governing eye.  He was not cowed by the bold formatting or helvetica typeface of my e-mail signature.  He did not partake of the nigh daily vegan scones, no-bake brownie bars, organic lemon cookies or whatever other peace offering the hipster had ported to the office in his environmentally friendly cookware, as if to apologize for his near total absence of technical acumen.  He didnt follow the interns twitter feed, or whatever the equivalent of pinning ones interest is.  As near as I could tell he didnt really do much of anything.  He sank par for my PFY putt-putt course, and was somehow connected to the great baby event of they who sign my paycheck, so he stayed and collected his twice monthly monies with the rest of us.  Except intern, that is.

Between the long weeks, sleepless nights, and endless tickets, we formalized some informal training hours.  Tickets became learning opportunities, irate clients had to be escalated through the ranks before my Senior title could grace the communique.  We were doing it.  We were making it work.  Even Nepotini found a niche - He could buy time.  Priority one, system down?  Well I guess another few hours is OK...

My PFY's, bless their kernel organs, began to work tickets autonomously.  For the first time in years I wasnt answering calls from panicked clients in the wee hours, just from my Jr. Engineers.  Well at least I'm consolidating, thats a thing people with Senior in their signature block do, right?  Consolidate?

Autonomy comes with a price though, and this one was steep.  One of the law offices we supported rang in a ticket asking to have a single file restored to their data drive.  Their ""server"" was a beefy workstation with dual 500GB drives, one for the OS and programs, and another for all their files and data.  Accounting databases, the repository for some legal discovery software, case files, you know just the life and blood of their firm.  Living in the shell of an old gaming rig re-purposed to run server 2k3.

The lone rack-mount 2U SERVER served as their onsite backup, taking deltas of the ""server"" drives and the few workstations on a regular basis.  The software it ran had a pretty slick interface for managing roll-ups, restoring a whole disk, or mounting as a .VHD so a server could be spun up in Hyper-V within a matter of minutes should the ""server"" suddenly find itself on the wrong end of functional.

The request was simple, just needed one file restored, and with that the lawyer client goes out for lunch and says to e-mail him its done.  Lowish priority, easy enough.  Surely the PFY's can read the meticulous documentation I had assembled just for this client.  But it wasnt to be so.  Nepotini takes the ticket and quickly fires off the restore.  

It was a few hours later, having just returned from lunch myself when I decided it would be good to review the queue and see where things stood for the afternoon.  Lawyer client had pinged the queue with a new ticket asking what was taking so long with his first ticket.  Nepotini had updated the work log, ""the restore is still running, looks like a few more minutes until its complete.""  Certainly a single office document couldnt take hours to restore, perhaps there was something wrong with the backup SERVER.  With a sinking feeling, I logged in, I saw, I cringed.  

Horror, oh the horror.  

DISK0 (C:\) restore, target DISK1 (E:\), -secureformat -purgepartitiontable:yes, -wrboot:replace.  

The restore hadn't even started, it was still on its third pass of random writing to the drive to ""securely"" erase it, which meant that even if I stopped it now I'd still need to zero the drive to make sure skynet didn't become self aware in the random 1/s and 0/s and then restore some 300Gb of data.  The tiny, annoying kind of data that is only 1k in size but actually 8MB on disk because some idiot before me set the block size to Derp.

From that day forward The Great Nepotini was no longer a domain administrator, ticket reviewer, or hunt group agent for inbound calls.  He did, however, buy more time with lawyer client.  I do feel bad attributing that small boon to him when four out of five days the lawyer client was an office of one.  Who played 18 holes of golf and organized legal lunchons the Hobbit folk would be jealous of.

The Elder and I sipped whiskey as we watched skynet be slowly overwritten with the cacophony of legalese.

Naive fresh grad still wants to work in aerospace even though he knows its a really tough industry to break into. He can't get a job so he's considering grad school yada yada yada. I'm talking to a few companies at the moment about possible jobs but none of them do aerospace stuff specifically. One is manufacturing at a tire production plant, another is mechatronics position and neither are in my ideal location. A kind of rule of thumb I try to follow when I apply for jobs is pick 2 of the following 3: location, interesting work, or good pay. I can't really tell about the pay thing so I just focus on location and interesting work. Might have to drop that down to one....Anyway, my point is all the jobs (which is all of like 3 out of 150) I hear anything about after I apply don't have either location or interesting work. Its *very* hard for me to motivate myself to work on something I'm not interested in (learned that in school) so I'm hesitant to apply for many jobs outside of aerospace. Part of wants to hold out for a job in aerospace but the other part of me simply wants to move on with my life and get anything to start making some money. All of my friends are starting jobs, buying houses, getting married and here I am wasting away in my mom's house. 

I'm torn between just taking the first job I can get and hoping to change to aerospace down the road or diving head first into grad school. My plan for grad school would be do dive head first in networking, conferences, clubs, research or anything else I could to try to get a good internship. I did not fully take of advantage of the opportunities I had in undergrad and I'm hoping grad school might be what undergrad should have been. 

A personal side note about myself that may or may not be related: I've noticed that I tend to take ""the path of least resistance"" through life. I subconsciously stay at my lowest possible energy level and I've only begun to notice it recently (hell of a lot of time to think about things when you're unemployed). I fear that taking any job I can find is just continuing down that road and then bam! I'm 40, fucking hate my job and wishing I had pursued my dreams when I was younger. But....like I said, I need to do something. I can't just keep sitting around on my ass with my thumbs up my butt hoping that the clouds part, a hiring manager from Lockheed descends down in a beam of light and hands me an offer. "

SO and I have been together just over 5 years, lived together for 2. Right now we are living out of state while he finishes school. This summer he has a _fantastic_ internship at one of The Big tech companies, and graduates this December.

My dilemma is this: our whole engagement is dependent upon him getting a return offer at that internship, which we are 85% sure will happen. We've started (roughly) planning a wedding for April/May/early June of 2015. The problem is, we want to do a destination wedding in Hawaii. He won't propose until he gets that job offer, which might not be until August or September. Does that give our guests enough time? I would start telling my family to give them a heads up, but that seems dicey with no actual ring! And if he doesn't get the return offer... ugh.

Our backup plan is to try and find a mountain B&amp;B in the NorCal area that will hold ~50 people for a ceremony and dinner reception. I am totally fine only asking immediate family (and 2 super close aunts) but I know everyone else's feelings will be hurt, and SO wants his whole (meaning extended) family there too. 

So, I'm feeling like I'm stuck. I want to plan this thing but I feel like I can't, with no actual engagement or certainty that it will happen in the time frame that we're thinking. We chose Spring 2015 because we've wanted to get married for a long time and as soon as we're engaged I want to marry this guy! If we could just skip the wedding altogether I would. Is there anything at all I can do to help prep for this?"

I'm flying out to San Francisco tomorrow for a summer internship, so I needed to ship my bicycle and pick up the dry cleaning. I had packed the bike into a box yesterday, and I just needed to drop it off at a UPS Store.

I load it up, hop in the car, and back out of the driveway. I'm not in a huge hurry, so I decide to take it slow, since I'm in a neighborhood with lots of little children and they're totally unpredictable. Next thing I know, some mom in an SUV is riding on my tail, trying to get out the entrance of the neighborhood just like I am. And hell if I'm driving any faster in this neighborhood. I take my sweet time, going about 20mph in a 30mph zone.

Now, the neighborhood entrance is at a stoplight off of a main road. I lived here during my high school years, so I know this stoplight all too well. As we approach the stoplight, I notice it's red, and I check which cars are going which direction at the moment. I make my way into the right-turn lane, and as luck should have it, tailgate-witch is trying to turn right too.

At the stoplight, I stop for a second or two, and I wait for just the right moment. Just as the cross traffic from our left enters the intersection, I hit the gas and turn right, successfully getting in front of the oncoming sea of traffic on the main road.

But SUV-cunt is still stuck in the right-turn lane, watching as cars whizz by in front of her.

25rigw,3,2014-05-16,Self doubt,selfdoubt567,veterinaryschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/veterinaryschool/comments/25rigw/self_doubt/,"I'm freaking out a little bit. I need to do well in rotations, I want to specialize in internal medicine, but I feel that in terms of practical skills I'm WAY behind my classmates. I wasn't able to get any referral clinic experience and very little general practice experience before vet school. I mostly worked with exotics, wildlife, and horses.

every time I hear my classmates talk about their summer break stuff, I get a little sick to my stomach. They have all been working in referral clinics or directly with vets. I work in a small animal general practice clinic that doesn't let me do much (since I don't know how).
I feel like I'm way behind. I feel like an idiot, and I know my classmates don't really view me as being very competent.

I tried to get experience for this summer, but I was expecting the general practice place to be willing to let me do more.

I just found out they placed a bunch of my classmates in positions in the emergency clinic also this summer, without sending e-mails or interviewing. I wasn't one of the ones selected.
Have I fallen too far behind now? I haven't even started rotations but I feel like it's too late and I'm left in the dust. I'm not on their level and I won't stand a chance at an academic internship.


I'm rambling but I'm worrying myself sick over this. I screwed up somehow and made it through two years of vet school without really doing anything impressive to put on a resume, or learn practical skills.
I have decent grades I guess (3.7), but of course my GPA dropped last semester (second semester second year) and I probably fell in the class rank too.


So I guess I'm asking if 

A. anybody else felt like this, how did it turn out? 

B. how did the not-so-experienced students fare in rotations?

25rpmk,12,2014-05-17,I think I got into the wrong field.,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/25rpmk/i_think_i_got_into_the_wrong_field/,"You hear about it all the time - I'm sure some of you even think about it when the word 'scientist' first appears in your mind - those evil people who do experiments on people as they shield the world from their unethical practices. When I became an intern at the laboratory after I graduated school for chemistry, they promised me months of learning and experimenting and generally understanding how cool of a job this was, but also how big of a duty it was too. The lab preached its new and amazing breakthroughs in the world of stem cell therapy and how its success was only around the corner. 

However, in a short time's notice, I realized that this was not the job for me. Most of the time, I became the lab's cleaning bitch. I was the youngest on the ""team"" that they made sure to never allow me to feel a part of after I was working there a week, cleaning up messes left on tables, sorting through papers. I found I was never getting my hands dirty, never assisting any of the scientists in their work, and they would shoo me away from their break time conversation as if I hadn't just completed gradate school and worked my ass off to get where they now were. Almost fed up to my head in this shit, I nearly quit. But one day the other intern, Nicole, approached me after being extremely quiet and under-the-radar for months. 

""You really need to understand what's going on here."" 

Her words shook me to the core. I'm from Pennsylvania and I'm not sure if any of you know this, but Pennsylvania is known at least by its residents for being sort of uptight, known for its small communities where everyone knew everyone and everything, known for being less than exciting on a scale that people from other states could never understand. I suppose that's why I stuck to Nicole like a giddy elementary-schooler when she explained to me that we would be exploring the facility. Since she was so small and was able to sneak around and make it look like she was doing what she was supposed to be doing, she was able to get away with shit like this. When our lab mates were very busy and we had a moment of downtime where we could sneak away, she would show me the halls and all the rooms where they would conduct research that seemed to be nothing involving stem cell research. 

There was a room at the end of the restricted halls with one-way mirrors, where a small and sad child sat inside. 

One day, my lab mates thought that I had left an hour prior but I was actually sitting inside one of the bathroom stalls and decided that I was going to do some wandering after-hours before I resigned from this fuck-job of a place.

I wandered back into the dirty, seemingly abandoned hallway of the giant laboratory, renowned for its amazing research, where this crusty little child sat hunched over, malnourished and frowning, barely awake. I knocked on the glass to get his attention and his mouth opened to the point where he would have shown fangs if he were some feral animal, but he only had three teeth despite the fact that he was of elementary school age. He was completely void of clothing and covered himself at the sound of knocking.

I peeked my head inside the room and when I noticed he had his eyes on me but didn't move an inch, I flicked on the lights to a bright room and closed the door behind me. I inched closer to him until I was about three feet away from this small child who could have been the spawn of Satan for all my fearless mind knew.

""Who are you? What have they been doing with you?""

I expected him to stay cowering in fear in the corner, but he lowered his face to the ground and said, ""I just want to go home. My parents aren't taking good care of me and I'm hungry. Can I leave?""

""How…long have you been here?"" I asked him. 

""I'm not sure anymore,"" his small voice came, trembling.

""Well, we're leaving."" 

Working quickly and planning the escape in my mind, knowing we would be stopping at the police station and needing to go undetected, I inched closer until I could grab the child's hand but he reared away from me like I had some sickness. ""You can't touch.""

We walked down the corridors as I attempted to shuffle him along as quickly as possible, promising him freedom. The place was completely black and security had never existed on the grounds so it was quite easy to make our escape. We broke through the doors and headed out into the cold of the night, success on my brain. I was the guy at the laboratory who discovered the sick child being used as some disgusting thing to experiment on. Who knows what they had been doing to him there, how long he would have lived if I wouldn't have found him. And the thought came into my mind for a flash of a second - this is not the life I wanted. My experience thus far had led to exhaustion, mistreatment, and now I discovered that the people I worked with were lying maniacs. I wondered if this is what my entire field was about but then one thing came back into mind. I only heard my footsteps pounding as I ran down the street.

I turned around and the child was gone. I spent two hours searching for him on the streets and calling out for him before I went home.

I never showed up at work again, but a voicemail was left on my machine the next morning from the boss who oversees all of the interns at the laboratory.

""It's fine that you decided to take upon yourself to do a good deed, but I just wanted to bring it to your attention that you left something very evil out of this lab. Watch the news over the next few weeks and take note of the fact that death tolls will undoubtedly be rising. Abel was our prime undercover experiment, a child who kills everything he touches in a moment's time. We assure you that we will be doing our best to retrieve the test subject that you released onto the world. Just be assured that even if he didn't hurt you the first time, you may meet him down the line if you aren't careful - he knows your face now.""

I never called back and moved out of the state weeks later.

The past 24 hours have been a much more stressful time than I even imagined. This is coming from a guy who decided to take an accelerated college curriculum that was year round.

So background. I'm a 22 male, who's about to graduate with his bachelor's in computer science in June after I finish my last internship, so I'm also currently applying for jobs as well.

I was seeing this girl 3 months ago, and we were mutual where we stood. I was the one that first proposed we end it mutually since of our schedules picking up, and me needing to possibly needing to relocate. She was hesitant, but she did agree with my points. We remained friends and I tried moving on, but couldn't and eventually regretted making this decision. 

Yesterday I caved in after having a job offer rescinded (Mix-up with resumes and they thought I could start sooner) and talked to her again after three months. She helped me out of my predicament in calming down and well I caved and let her know how I still felt about her. Unfortunately she's now in a relationship, so I knew I had to stop there. What was worse was she made it evident that she wanted to move on with our relationship before, but circumstances prevented that (Busier schedules, etc). I felt crushed cause I knew at this point it was my fault for letting her get away.

She kept insisting we be friends, but I knew better and told her it wouldn't work. However I caved in and agreed, after she kept trying a few times and said we could try. I tried to stay away but my bad state and situations just kept pushing me beyond reasonable thinking. What I thought was just me venting, ended up sounding like me being desperate and I just regret talking to her again.

I couldn't sleep at all last night due to the combined stressed of the rescinded offer and learning I was the one that screwed myself over.

I've just cut communications with her now and have been doing fine for the most part today. Those painful memories still pop up of what once was, but I have to constantly remind myself; she isn't here now and she cares for someone else. 

I've let my closest friends know and they've been helping encouraging me through both ordeals, saying the usual things friends would; ""You're a catch and you'll eventually find the right person."" or ""There are other better job offers I'll get."" Being positive and trying to get myself to believe them, it's just at the moment my self-esteem isn't helping.

I just feel like my world got 180'd or some carpet I was standing on get pulled from me

This isn't the first time I've had to get over someone, but this one is hitting me much harder that I figured. I'm trying to see some positive out of this, but it's just getting too much for me to handle and I'm seriously have not been acting myself in the past day.

Any words of encouragement or advice would help now. Again sorry for the wall of text, but my head hasn't really been on straight for the past 24 Hours.

**tl;dr**: I had an unlucky break and bad day. Made it worse by talking to my last ex I was still interested in and thought was still single since we ended it mutually due to circumstances. She wasn't, made me realize I had an opportunity before, and probably made myself worse to her.

Cut all communications already. Friend's helping me through ordeal with encouragement, but it's not helping much. Losing sleep and acting strange according to my friends. Any words of encouragement would help"

25s1xu,2,2014-05-17,How long does it take to transfer a title to a family member (in RI)? Is there any way to speed it up? Can AAA do it?,SellingMyToaster,cars,https://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/25s1xu/how_long_does_it_take_to_transfer_a_title_to_a/,"Hi!

So I'm in a bit of a pickle. I've decided to sell my 2010 Honda Element. The car was originally my mother's, but she signed it over to me. However, due to insurance/registration/blah, I never actually registered the car in my name and got a new title. So it's still in her name, I just have her signature on the title.

Now, I'm doing an engineering internship across the country in two weeks and I decided that

A) I really dislike the toaster (dat shit mpg) and it has a relatively high sell price
B) Not having a car will be a huge hassle in that part of the country
C) I don't want to drive 3,000 miles

so it makes sense to sell the car and get a new one while there (as a young male, insurance is very high for me but my sister lives closeby so I'll just put the car in her name). 

This means that in the next two weeks I have to do the following:

A) Submit my application for a family transfer
B) Get the new title
C) Sell the car

I'm going to submit ASAP. I'm not sure if AAA can do it---do you guys know? If so, I'll submit the application tomorrow morning. Otherwise I have to wait until Monday for the DMV. 

Then, do any of you guys have any idea how long it takes to get the title? If the title doesn't arrive in time and I find a buyer, I have a neighbor who's willing to deal with the title and actually hand the car over (he would just mail the new title to me and I'd sign it and mail it back). Do you think a buyer would be open to this?

As for some way to speed it up: if there is one, it can't require my mother to be present. She lives across the Atlantic.

I felt I should post some back story. I am a high school senior planning to attend a college in the fall and major in computer science. About 3 weeks ago I attempted suicide. My life sucked. No motivation, nothing. I was baker-acted into a facility where I stayed for about a week. Upon discharged I knew my life had to change. I made a point to set my life straight. Well. Last night I talked out a plan with a friend. In the coming month, I am selling some bitcoins to earn $30,000. I will spend about $15,000 on a decent Honda Civic 2012, prepay insurance for a year, and then relax and enjoy summer. I have a job paying $15/hr which I will work my butt off during the summer and earn money to pay for tuition. My parents are allowing enough to pay for my phone, rent, and possibly help me out with insurance on the car. I have set a prospect to get a scholarship with the college's programming team which could yield up to $15,000/yr scholarship. During my 3rd and 4th year I will try to get an internship at Microsoft/Facebook/Some company in the seattle area. Move up there for 2-3 months during the summer, work my butt off. I predict I could come out of college with about $10,000-$20,000 and be ready to start my life. My dream job would be a job at Google. I feel if I keep up what I do with programming (I've been a competitive programmer for about 4 years now, and have been scouted by the college I am planning on attending) I can seriously do this, and be successful in life. Just thought I'd like to share my plan. To all programmers out there, dream big. You'll get there! Hold your head high and remember, no dream is too big. :)


Edit : One slight change to this plan. I'd be moving to western Florida for 6 month rooming with my friend and we'd work on WebApps and Programming. He'd do design and I'd do development. (I'm planning on attending college in the spring rather than fall)."
25sn4d,4,2014-05-17,Motivating my daughter,reggindiputs,Parenting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/25sn4d/motivating_my_daughter/,"My daughter is approaching her senior year of college this fall. She has never had a paying job or an internship in her life. When she comes home for breaks, she goes out most nights with a mysterious long-term boyfriend whom she has never introduced the rest of her family to. She leaves very late at night, gets driven over an hour away, and sometimes stays out for days at a time without telling us anything. Coming back late most mornings ~~with a hangover~~ ""tired"" (my son tells me she occasionally tells him this--I'm not just making assumptions), she'll sleep most of the day away, and either shut herself in her room, or go back out with this mysterious guy. I'm worried that she won't be prepared after she graduates to handle ""real"" life: her mother and I have been able to provide a lot for her, and I'm afraid that she has grown too used to that.


She attends a very well-regarded art school, but thinks that her degree will be a sort of ""golden ticket"" for getting jobs. While it may be important to get her interviews, she has basically nothing on her resume but her education, and doesn't seem to be actively trying to change that. She's a talented artist, but lacks agency.


Her discipline for other things is also very low. Since she's been home for the past couple of summers without a job, even getting her to help around the house has proven difficult. ""I'll do it later"" is her default response, meaning that a few hours later someone will have to pound on her door for five minutes just for her to hear through her headphones. In the case that she can actually be persuaded to help around the house, even doing something as simple as doing dishes after a meal, she will always leave difficult work hidden and unfinished for someone else to stumble upon and deal with begrudgingly. Half the time there's no getting her to do this unfinished work because she's out with mysterious boyfriend™, anyway! It's probably worth mentioning that she hasn't even been trying hard at all to get her driver's license, or any kind of thing to help her be more independent.


My wife and I have seen other parents being too over-pressuring on their sons and daughters to dive into the professional world, and in a lot of cases it's been discouraging to them, creating in many a low sense of self-worth or panic. We don't want to be too stressing, but we don't want to wind up doing nothing to motivate our daughter. We have two other children, one older and one younger than the daughter in question, and they work hard to accomplish things, but at this point we don't know what to do with our daughter. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. We want to help her, but we just don't know how."

I wish I had good news. I'm going to get a lot of I told you so's. I've been getting a lot of pressure to go home and I let my dad know I'd be coming home past Sunday. He of course wanted to know what'd be keeping me behind. I had work to get done that I was being paid for and errands to run locally before I leave for the summer. Thursday I was only supposed to pick up a pay check. I was asked to work another hour or so since the project we're doing is going to be presented soon. I wasn't leaving yet, I said okay.

 So apparently there were joint emails in my family going around that interfered a little with my internship plans and I was unaware because I didn't check them yet that day. My uncle called and we discussed it and I went back to work. Then my dad called. I assumed it was about the same thing, so I picked up. Que screaming and cursing. He screams that my family has been trying to fucking reach out to me for days and I need to get my ass involved. I told him I was busy doing work and I'd call back as soon as I was done. He says fuck my work this has to get done in the next ten minutes [no it didn't] and HE'S the one who has to get work done. My work isn't real work and I'd better do this now if I want his financial help or I'm doing this on my own. I told him I can't get things done when he talks to me that way, that it was rude and hurtful, he needs to respect my boundaries, etc. He heard none of it. So I warned him if he continues to curse at me I'll be hanging up. He continued so I told him I'd figure it out myself and hung up.

After that conversation I realized all the time I had tried to set my boundaries have done nothing and my dad's probably beyond repair. The only sliver of hope I had was therapy. Since I realized the cursing wasn't going to stop, I downloaded an app to record our phone calls and checked the state laws of both where he works and where he lives. It's legal for me to record the calls since I am part of the conversation. I thought I could have it as back up in therapy since he was already in denial of how bad he talks to me.

I also checked with my local bank about student loans, how 529 plans work, and called my mom to know more about her divorce agreement with my dad. I've been establishing credit for a year now at least; I'm not sure what my score is but I'm hoping interest won't be as high as 12% which seems to be the max. My mom gave me a copy of it a year or so ago when he was giving me issues so I am more aware of my education payments. I have it locked away so I'll check what it says soon. Supposedly, they agreed that he was to pay for my education until I am 23, not 21, and it's a signed contract. I think regardless of whether or not he is legally obligated, I'll probably take out loans anyway for my last year but I'd like to have this documentation present so he can stop saying he sacrifices a lot and pays for schooling purely out of the kindness of his heart.

So the inevitable phone call happened and I had the recording prepared. My dad asked about when I was coming home and reminds me that everyone effected by this is going. I ask him what he means by ""everyone."" He says everyone in this household. I reminded him we agreed it was to be the two of us and that my stepmom isn't involved. She speaks up from the background [couldn't hear what she said] and he tells me his wife is involved. I told him he cannot force me into therapy against my will, we had an agreement, it's between the two of us, and if she goes I will not be attending. He said there will be serious consequences for my actions, I cannot control him and tell him what to do [he's the father, I'm the child], and he's allowed to change his mind. He says his wife is involved and everyone is hurt by my actions [he was careful not to curse because she was there in the background], and I have no idea the type of crap I put them through the past two months. My stepmom pipes up that she feels uncomfortable to have me in their home from all that I put them through. My dad says he was sick for weeks because of what I did and that I don't even care. I talked about establishing boundaries, the way he treats me hurts, and me ignoring them was a response to how they treat me. I said I wasn't doing it to control anyone, it was to protect myself from how badly they treat me. My dad made a list of all the things he's paid for and says if I want him out of my life then do it after graduation and until then I'm under his rule and I'm going to therapy with the two of them. I told him I was prepared to take out loans. 

The conversation went back and forth like this for ten minutes with his wife whispering in the background and cheering him on. He talked over me the majority of the time and dismissed all parts of my argument including the loans and his behavior. The only good thing I got out of it was the recording so I know I'm not crazy. Once I reveal the recordings, they will watch what they say on the phone and save it all for in person meetings. So I think I'll be holding off until I get the cursing recorded if anything. I don't know if I'll be going there now. I feel betrayed and disrespected. By time the call was over, I was shaking and crying because it was extremely mentally draining.

I guess the next step is to call more banks and see which one offers the best plan for student loans. The bank seemed a little worried that I'll be part time, so I may or may not have to pick up an extra class in order to get that loan. I need a cosigner, so I'll have to ask another family member that isn't involved. 

I feel like I'm taking crazy pills but I'm very thankful my boyfriend and best friend see that I did the right thing and I'm not as heartless as my parents think I am. I'm saving all the emails that back me up and I'd appreciate it if any of you happen to know of any articles that discuss establishing boundaries and what not that you think might be useful. I'm not sure if this is my final update, but I'd like to thank you all for your advice, support, and for encouraging me to break away.

TL;DR: Dad started cursing at me again. I started recording our phone calls and educating myself about student loan options. He took back his promise to go to therapy alone with me and his wife feels uncomfortable with my presence.

Edit: Parents called and it was another heated discussion. His wife came on the phone to involve herself so I hung up. I discussed it more in [this comment](http://ud.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/25soq4/updateme_21_f_with_my_father_50s_where_is_the/chkde0v).

So, to those with more experience, to those at quarter schools, what has been your experience for finding internships?

I came here to share a short story that problably happened to some of you. Surely I hope not, but come on guys, we're not that lucky.

Quick background: IT head from local government. I have 3 people under my wing: 2 interns and a tech. I too handle some tickets, this was the last one from yesterday:

- Hello, IT. chrisnasc here, what seems to be the problem?

Guy: - Hi, I'm $someguy from $somedept. I am having trouble updating my system.

- OK. Your #dept does not have internet connection, so let me know what you did so far...

Guy: - Clicked ""install"" and next &gt; next &gt; next...

- Good, then what?

Guy: - Then it asked me to restart the machine.

- Yeah, unfortunatly it's necessary. And?

Guy: - I did, but it didn't worked.

- What happened?

Guy: - The screen turned black while I restarted but the system does not work.

- Weird. Can you please try to reinstall now?

Guy: - OK. *click* *click* *click* *click*. Now it's asking to restart.

- Do it.

Guy: - Done.

- What?

Guy: - Done.

- Already?

Guy: - Yeah.

- But sir, the restart process takes a little longer than 3 seconds.

Guy: - Not here.

- How?

Guy: - It's restarted. The system doesn't work.

- I'm coming down.

So I pick up my car, drive about 30 minutes and go to #dept to see this wonder machine. I see only a regular, 15-year-old machine struggling with windows XP, running as loud as an F-15 Eagle.

- Could you reisntall so I can see?

He did. I saw. I did not believed. To this particular user, since the machine turns off the video input while is restarting, and since the machine took about 3 MINUTES to boot up properly, he tried to *trick* the machine into thinking it was restarted... by turning the MONITOR off and on again.



**TL;DR: hurr durr I tricked the machine by blinding it a little!** "

cGPA: 3.93, phi beta kappa (inducted as a junior)
sGPA: 3.95 (give or take)
MCAT: 34 (12/10/12)

**LIST OF EC's (tl;dr - I think they're decent/good)**

* Research experience since 1st year in 2 labs (moved to second one at beginning of 3rd year), will complete a senior thesis in current lab - no publications

* Participated in competitive summer research fellowship following 2nd year at same institution)

* Various non-clinical volunteering (~50 hours over the course of three years)

* Wrote for a organizational newsletter for a semester

* Internship at a big cancer hospital, which was pretty much intensive shadowing (&gt;200 hours)

* Shadowing at nearby children's hospital  (~10 hours)

* Study group leader (/tutor) for a neurobio class for a semester

* Worked on a special programs council (voted in) and served as volunteering co-chair for a year (will likely run again)

* Volunteer at local community hospital since 2nd year (helped primarily surgery/trauma patients)(~120 hours) 
    - also I am a part of a small student leadership group here where we help evaluate applications from prospective volunteers and conduct interviews
    - will also be training new volunteers this summer

* Volunteer at foster/temporary-care home for kids from troubled homes- engage kids through science-exploration activities (just started this past semester ~10 hours)


* (Paid) Mentor and tutor in chemistry for 1st year students, now in a leadership role in this organization, will continue mentoring and tutoring next year along with duties of new role

* Ran a 5k earlier this year. Trained for and ran a 10k recently. Will start training for a half marathon soon.

* Will have 4 LORs, not sure what counts defines a good or great LOR, but I think they will all be at least decent.


School List:

All TX/TMDSAS schools (UT Southwestern, UTMB Galveston, UT Houston, UT SA, A&amp;M, Tech/Lubbock, UNT DO, Paul Foster-El Paso)

AMCAS schools:

Baylor
Mayo
Columbia
Stanford
Harvard 
Duke

The reason my AMCAS schools are all reach schools is because TX schools are all of great quality already and the tuition costs are unbeatable and I figure if I apply out-of-state I may as well aim high.

What do you all think? Is 14 schools enough (I realize apps can be a numbers game)? Are the AMCAS schools worth applying to? Any schools to add/drop?

Also, I don't mean to step on anyone's toes if I seem boastful. I really do appreciate the community here and the vast amount of information shared. I am a long-time lurker (check here almost every night) and this is where I've learned most of the stuff I know about apps. 

Best of luck to everyone applying this cycle!

It was spring in our fair city, and three of the four windows our squat, square office owned looked out over the blossoming merriment below.  The general queue was marked either *in progress* or *awaiting customer feedback*, and my PFY's busied themselves playing in the gentle ebb and flow of the springtime ticket tides.  I realized then that for Intern and Hipster, it was still a game.  They were being paid to use the technology they grew up with.  Rewarded for second nature; much the same way Baby must have been showered with affection each time he ate, pooped, or continued to breathe.  Baby was also probably paid better.

With season tickets to Babymania, Owner and his lady wife projected a distinct aura of absence, bordering on outright abandonment.  

I never told the Boss about The Great Nepotini's brief experience with the art of data restoration.  Of course, I never told the Lawyer Client what happened either.  Nepotism and Lawyers are two forces of (human)nature I have no desire to involve myself with more than absolutely necessary.  I'm not sure if Nepotini expected me not to tell, or genuinely didn’t care.  His demeanor was reflectant of status-quo.  In the end though, The Lawyer Client hadnt actually done any work since our last snapshot and I used the opportunity to show the Elder how to mount a .VHD and some symlink magic with file shares.  All was well in his world when he finally returned to his office.  If he ever returned to his office.  I removed the work-hours on the ticket from Nepotini, added them to Elder, and tidied up the symlink shuffle later that evening.

""Our website could really use some work.""  Nepotini had made the trek and rounded the corner of my cube.

""That's really the Owners Lady Wifes' territory, she usually handles marketing and advertising.""  I was sure those two words were in her signature block somewhere, when she didn’t simply sign -Her Initials.

""She said to check with you.""  Oh, Nepotini, thou art truly worthy of thy name.  

It was the perfect storm, the faces of my other PFYs began to appear over the low walls of our modest agri-cube zone, voicing their agreement that our website looked as if it had been generated by one of those ""host your website tonight!"" schemes.  

An e-mail alert was hovering low on my desktop.

*From: Owner*

*Subject: Company Website Updates*

It was electric, Hipster and  Intern were gnashing at the bit for an opportunity to express themselves creatively, and there just wasn’t enough work in the queue to avert their attention.  Like a stubborn garden weed, this project spread its roots in all directions.  I looked about the faces that had sprouted from their cubes.  Evidently the conversation had continued without me and now they were waiting for me to say something.  I glanced back at my desktop.  The notification from Owner had long since faded.  It was late afternoon.  I wondered how quickly I might spread that sample of Cryptolocker I had saved.  No...They were looking to me for leadership, eyes full of hope.  We needed supplies.

I stood, I spoke.  ""Elder, order up a pizza and then head down to the liquor store and get a case of beer.  Intern, go check and see if the downstairs conference room is in use - The one with the projector.  Hipster, Nepotini, you're on research.  Get a laptop and find some other websites we can use for inspiration.  Brainstorm meeting in one hour.""

It was as if I'd sounded a battle charge, PFY's moving in all directions.  The hairs on my neck tingled, but not from the electric atmosphere, from a coldness that had suddenly washed over my shoulders.  Nepotini and I locked eyes.  I gave him a Senior Nod and broke the gaze, sitting back down.  Sheltered behind the grey walls of my cube, I shivered.  The cogs that turned The Great Nepotini were in motion.

Three of the four windows looked out over the city, bright with the creativity that spring inspires.  The fourth window framed dark storm clouds on the horizon, billowing towards us...

25tmaf,4,2014-05-17,Input please: Stick with the military vs. going it alone?,the_serenacy,financialindependence,https://www.reddit.com/r/financialindependence/comments/25tmaf/input_please_stick_with_the_military_vs_going_it/,"Thank in advance for adding your 2 cents.  I'll try not to ramble on for too long.

I'm currently an Air Force ROTC cadet with 4 years of prior enlisted experience.  In 2015 I will commission as a Lieutenant.  At that point I owe the Air Force four more years then I can choose to get out or stay in.

Before listing the options I will add that my goal is to ""retire"" by 40ish so that I can write and use my time for non-economic pursuits that are important to me, on my own terms.  I'm pretty individualistic so I know there is some irony that both of the following options are quite institutional (read: controlling).  But hey, they're the options most apparent to me at this point so maybe that will change later.

Option A:

If I get out after four years (2019, age 27) my next step according to my (tentative) planning would be to pursue an MBA and then transition to investment banking as an associate (age 29).  MBA would cost quite a bit (I'm thinking around 200k+ as well as two years' sacrified salary) but I can expect income of around 150-180k after graduation assuming I land the Ibanking position.  I will have prior banking internship experience and my GPA/(expected) GMAT place me in the competitive range for MBA programs where investment banks recruit, which makes this a realistic goal in my opinion.  Other options after graduation include consulting and corporate finance, which are still great but offer lower income potential over my time frame.

As some of you may know, investment banking salaries can become quite absurd for those who progress beyond the analyst/associate ranks.  Without going too far into numbers, which would be quite speculative since we are talking about a time frame over 10 years from now in a volatile industry, I assume that such a salary combined with aggressive and thoughtful saving habits could produce a sizable portfolio by age 40 (perhaps $3-5 million or even more if I live substantially below my means) as well as total repayment of MBA student loans.

However, the caveat here is that I do not particularly want to spend my 30's slaving away in a bank for 70-100 hours a week even if the salaries become massive.  There's also the risk of them firing my ass or another recession that results in this little plan going awry.

Overall, I would be limited to returns on my investments as well as whatever income I produce after retirement but would have a much larger portfolio.  This option also allows for the possibility of earlier retirement given that the Air Force career requires I continue until at least age 43.


Option B:

I stay in the Air Force after the 4 year mark, earning progressively better (but not great) pay as an officer.  After 20 years I am eligible for retirement with a defined pension (a percentage of your averaged final three years salary based on my understanding). I would have access to the Thrift Savings Plan throughout this career, which is great because it has tax efficiency and extremely low expenses, but lacks matching contributions for service members.  Also, I can possibly earn advanced degrees paid for by the Air Force.

This is definitely the simpler option but not without caveats of its own:  First of all, the 20 year retirement system may not exist by the time I would retire (This is a whole discussion of its own which I will avoid further).  Secondly, there is the possibility of not making it to the 20 year mark, for whatever reason.  Finally, four years of service has already taught me that the military often makes my blood boil with its... peculiarities.  I am optimistic that choosing a new career field upon graduation will alleviate some of this but I know this career would involve much gritting of teeth.  (Not that the alternative is much better).

Overall, at retirement I would have that retirement check coming in every two weeks as well as the income from my portfolio.  The catch is that my portfolio would be considerably smaller given the much smaller salary (and thus smaller annual contributions).

Closing:

As promised I tried not to dive too far into the weeds, so these options aren't too detailed and many topics that could have been covered have not been.

Please let me know what you all think.  I wouldn't be posting this if I thought I already had all the answers so feel free to inform, critique, preach, etc...  Thanks!"

CALL the White House.[1] The number for comments is 202-456-1111. The phone menu for this can be a bit of a pain, so skip and come back here if you're limited on time.

Write a letter. Yes, that means snail mail:
The White House
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW
Washington, DC 20500

Fill out an email form.[2] Instead of aggregating 100,000+ people into a single, easily ignored petition, make them spend a little bit of effort ignoring you.

Done one (or all) of those? Good. Now hit the FCC:

Dial 888-225-5322
push 1, 4, 0

a person will answer.

they will ask for your name and address. you can just give them a zip code if you want.

""I'm calling to ask the FCC to reclassify Internet Service Providers as Title Two Common Carriers."" Feel free to add more, if you have more to say!

They'll ask if there is anything else you would like to add.
""No, Thank you for your time.""

hang up.

They'll probably have an automated message telling you to send an email when you call the FCC's number. Nope. Crash their phone system and keep their operators busy.

Now go submit Comments to the FCC's Proceeding.[3] You'll probably want to express that in terms of Proceeding 14-28 and why the FCC needs to reclassify ISPs as Common Carriers under Title II. Net Neutrality is only the beginning- as a data service provider, they're strikingly vulnerable to being grouped as an associate to any crime committed over their connections, just as Kim Dotcom was.

DO NOT use a form letter for the 14-28 comments! This will get your comments aggregated and considered a mass email along with everyone else who used that form letter. This makes your comment more or less ineffective! Take two minutes to type out a paragraph. (You're on Reddit right now, so don't tell me you don't have two minutes.) Potential talking points include:
ISPs can charge extra fees to carry traffic from any online business they want. If a company depends heavily on Internet traffic, the ISP could refuse to allow web pages to load in under 30 seconds unless that business pays up. How much? Whatever the ISP thinks it can get you to pay.

Consumers are already paying for Internet access. Online businesses pay their ISPs, just like consumers. Why should the regular people not get the Internet services like email, Facebook, or videos that they've already paid their ISP for? Why should an online business have to pay the customer's ISP, when the customer already paid that bill?
The end result will be either destroying businesses that can't afford to pay up, or higher fees for customers. Some ISPs also own their own online businesses. Those ISPs can charge competitors high enough fees to drive them out of business, so customers only have one option.

Fixing the problem is easy: The FCC reclassifies ISPs as Title II, just like a phone company. If you talk about Verizon on an AT&amp;T phone, they're not allowed to cut off your call, or fill it with static. ISPs shouldn't be allowed to interfere with your Internet either.
Mix it up, add your own views.

Call your Congressperson.[4] Yes, phone call again. Speak slowly and clearly, and keep your talking points simple. You're talking to an intern again. What do you want? Title II for ISPs. Why do you want it? Because as a sysadmin and subject matter expert, you are concerned about what this will mean for the industry, for customers, and for your job and those of others like you in their district.

EDIT: Okay, this blew the heck up a lot more than I expected. Since there's a /r/bestof[5] link now, let's do this right. Get your voice personally heard by doing some of the following!

On the vote to create 'fast lanes' (Where if you're not paying extra to Comcast AND Time Warner AND Charter AND Verizon, you're in the slow lane):

Tom Wheeler (D): YES

Mignon Clyburn (D): YES

Jessica Rosenworcel (D): YES

Ajit Pai (R): NO

Michael O'Rielly (R): NO

Thank Ajit Pai and Michael O'Rielly for trying to stop the ""slow lanes unless you pay cable ISPs"" concept. Ask Jessica Rosenworcel why, if she had misgivings about the vote moving too fast, she voted for it. Express your displeasure with Tom Wheeler and Mignon Clyburn.

Interestingly enough, the Chairman and Commissioners' direct email addresses have vanished off the FCC website and been replaced by a web form. It's like they don't want people like you to be able to contact the FCC's leadership directly. Pity, that:

Chairman Tom Wheeler: Tom.Wheeler@fcc.gov[6]

Commissioner Mignon Clyburn: Mignon.Clyburn@fcc.gov[7]

Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel: Jessica.Rosenworcel@fcc.gov[8]

Commissioner Ajit Pai: Ajit.Pai@fcc.gov[9]

Commissioner Michael O’Rielly: michael.orielly@fcc.gov[10]

Do not CC: or mass-email them. The government has fairly effective spam filters and you're likely to get your message trapped. Take a moment to write out a few sentences and shoot an email off to each individually.
Their telephone numbers have vanished too. Too bad they're public record:

FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler: 1-202-418-1000

FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn: 1-202-418-2100

FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel: 1-202-418-2400

Write your local newspaper a letter to the editor, call your local television news station and ask them to do a story, especially if you're an actual subject matter expert on networking and the Internet who is good in front of cameras. Consider using those talking points above to illustrate the issue in simple terms. For the generic company referenced, substitute ""If (newspaper/news station) depends heavily on Internet traffic, the ISP could refuse to allow web pages to load in under 30 seconds unless (newspaper/news station) pays up.""

You may have their attention at that point!

They've been paying me pretty good money for an internship.

We started negotiation for permanent employment after I graduate some time ago, and we agreed on a (small) moving stipend, plus wages equivalent to low starting wages in the area where I was moving. We were pretty firm on that for some time, and were discussing specifics.

Over the past week, they've suddenly said that they do not want me to move, that all previous negotiations are off the table, and will allow me to telecommute at a huge salary cut. The new salary represents about a 20-25% cut to the starting CS salaries where I am.

However, the problem comes about due to me graduating in two weeks. I've turned down all interview offers/existing offers due to my negotiations with them, and I don't really have time to find any alternative offers before I graduate.

I'm trying to find out my options and what people here would recommend I do."

What is the best resource for brisk group rides? I'm no pro, but I *love* tough hill climbs.  

Do you think there are any local teams/shops that would adopt me for a season? I really enjoyed having teammates to race with this year, and I'm not sure of the best way to find fellow female cyclists.

I haven't gotten any internships lately, and some of my classmates are about to get one or are doing one right now. I feel like I'm way behind. I thought of getting one for the summer, but I feel that the companies I sent my resume to care are GPA, not my skills. Also, my interviewing skills are lacking in confidence, and I feel like I won't be able to get an internship soon.

There are some people I do not get along with in my major. One used me by asking me for my help but does not give it back in return. One time, he saw me suffering with an assignment, and he did not even attempt to help. I guess I encounter a lot of assholes (there are some nice people in the major though), and they even influence my mutual friends. I don't think I want to network with those kind of two-faced people.

Also, I'm thinking of doing a part-time job over the summer, but I don't really want to work in a food-based environment. I want something related to my major, yet I feel like the jobs out there are looking for those who have experience.

I'm also thinking of taking a gap year, but I fear that I might not get financial aid if I come back.

I'm also thinking of taking a summer class in a closer university (my current university is about an hour or 2 if traffic), but I feel like those classes might be filled up when I apply.

I also want to network with other engineering professionals, but whenever I try to talk to them, I feel like they don't really want to network with me.

I have no idea if I even belong to this engineering discipline. I love what I'm learning, but I don't know if I'm not doing well because of the environment (my university is a quarter-based system) or I get distracted with a lot of issues and insecurities in life.

I'm sorry for these long lists. I am not sure what I should do to make myself better."

And to be honest, I don't really care if this gets buried, as long as I get it off my chest, I'm think I'll be alright.

I'm haven't *really* hurt myself in at least six months. But I still feel it every day. Every fucking goddamn day its the same thing over and over in my mind when I get stressed, which seems to be happening more and more lately. But thats unrelated. 

I keep a razor at my desk at work. It's hidden under my wooden Buddha figurine so I can remind myself of what I stand for before I lift it up. In the end, my life will go on, my life will go on, my life will go on. I don't know if that what Buddha stands for, but I really don't care.

I shouldn't be drunk by myself. Bad things happen when I'm drunk by myself. I knew this was a bad idea before I even starting drinking. But like many other situations I find myself in, *I just don't care*. My SO knows my username, and I know that somehow they'll see it, and a part of me wants them to see it.

Yeah, apparently I'm totally cool with everything. Oh me? Nah, I'm fine. Really. It doesn't irrationally bother me that you're off having a great time on your birthday at camp with your friends and I'm here by myself at home getting drunk and waiting for you to answer my texts, knowing that you won't, because you're having fun on your birthday. I want to be fine with it. I want to be completely fine with you wanting to have time without me, and with your friends instead. It's what a good SO would do. Even when I went to Minneapolis with some people from work, I regretted it and didn't want to be there anymore after the first night. I wanted to be at home. also known as wherever you are.

And I shouldn't cut myself right now. I don't want you to feel like you can't leave me alone for two fucking nights without me hurting myself. I don't want you to feel like you can't leave me alone to live your life. I don't want you to worry about my own mental health at the cost of your own. One of your journals for your internship was open and I saw that you wanted to change your shifts to more correspond with mine because you were worried ""for my own mental health."" 

I'm so ashamed that you think I can't be left alone.

But dear fucking god, I want to rip myself apart.

I'm so fucking clingy. It really bothers me how clingy I am. And it bothers me how emotional I get when I'm away from you for more than 24 hours.

Maybe it's because I don't have any friends. I've only moved here a year ago. I was born here, but I only moved back 9 years later. All your friends are my friends. I don't have anyone for myself. You go out with them all the time, and I just tag along, cause I'm so fucking lonely. I WANT FRIENDS, not just people I talk to at work. I want someone I can invite to come over. I want someone that I'm not terrified to talk to. I want to go over to someone's house and not instantly want to go home. To be honest, *you, my wonderful love of my life, are my best friend. Maybe even my only friend.* 

I feel like a pathetic, awkward loser who doesn't know how to interact with society, or even with myself.

I'm so insecure. I want so desperately to be comfortable around your friends, and have then be comfortable around me, but it's really hard when I don't know them very well. I want to be friends with your friends, Because they're wonderful people. They really are.

I know these things take time, and that becoming comfortable with myself and other people is a long process. I'm working on it, I promise. I know you dealt with the same thing for most of your life, and still do sometimes. But you're so much further along than I am.  

Long story short. I'm so jealous of you.

**TL;DR**: I'm ashamed that I feel like my SO thinks they can't leave me alone without me hurting myself. Also I would like to feel comfortable around myself and people I consider the closest thing I have to friends. "

We met in college and we were just messing around for about a year before we started dating. I graduated and went on to find a job. I would go up on weekends and stay the night a with her. She lives about an hour away. Occasionally I would make it up on a weekday. Throughout the relationship we have maintained good communication via facetime, texts and calls. Her phone is glued to her hip and she doesn't leave her house without it. 

This summer she will be working an internship for her final year of college. She took on a serving job at night and on weekends to at least have an income. This limits the amount of times that I can see her because of our schedules.  We have had conversations about our relationship and that we are growing apart because our schedules do not match up. We agreed to try and make it work because we have been through a summer like this already. 

Lately she has been distant. Sporadically answering my texts, and not answering facetime calls. It seems like I am always initiating the conversation.  She goes out with her best friend alot (who I am not really fond of because she hangs out with alot of guys, all of whom are not her boyfriend).  I don't think my girlfriend would cheat on me, but it doesn't help that there is a possibility her friend could influence her.

My girlfriend has since changed her twitter and Facebook pic away from us to just herself. I really like this girl and she was the best thing that has happened to me. What should I do? I try not to be clingy/desperate by calling and texting her, but I can't help it. From my eyes, in order to keep our relationship going we need to continue the communication, but she seems to be avoiding it.

Thank you for your help, I apologize of some of it does not make sense. My head is spinning right now thinking about this. Please feel free to ask any questions.

TL;DR; My girlfriend is not answering me texts/calls, what should I do?

EDIT: in a text this morning, she had mentioned that she wanted to quit her job. I have never asked her to do this"

25u9v7,0,2014-05-18,[Question] What sort of college degree should I get?,[deleted],sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/25u9v7/question_what_sort_of_college_degree_should_i_get/,"Hello,

I'm considering a career in system administration. I'm graduating out of highschool in several years, so I guess it's an appropriate time to start considering college plans.

I currently have two years of experience as an ""apprentice technician"" at a technology firm. (it was a fairly catch-all place. They did computer repair, web apps, websites, and provided internet to a handful of clients.)
I also recently started as an intern for a fairly large web design company (they host around 2000 websites). However, my boss offered me the spot as junior system administrator and of course, I took it and I took the rise that came with it ;)

With all that being said, from my experience in the field and the general consensus of my colleagues, most people think it is unnecessary to get a college degrees now. However, I feel it would be gambling quite a lot to decide not to get any college experience and hope for the best. I can only see college helping me in the future. So, hopefully we can bypass the discussion as to whether or not I *should* get a degree, and focus on which studies I should focus on.

So, I enjoy the scientific side of computers, however, a degree in computer science doesn't seem to be a perfect fit for sysadmins. Are there certain schools known for good courses focused on the skills of sysadmins. With that being said, what are some prestigious schools that a sysadmin could attend?"
25u9zv,1,2014-05-18,"I hate myself. I hate who i am. But im a teen, i love who i am, right!?. I am not the person people think i am. Help.",Throwdelta0012ba,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/25u9zv/i_hate_myself_i_hate_who_i_am_but_im_a_teen_i/,"So much to say I don’t know where to start, I guess I should start somewhere.

I hate who I am, I hate myself, there I said it, finally. I have so many issue, so many things I think that are wrong with me. But no one to share them with, no one to talk to, no one I can trust, really trust. That won’t hurt me, or affect my life. I don’t want a lot of my life to change, I just want the bad parts to change. I want to fix myself without changing anything else. But I can’t do that, I haven’t been able to do that. How am I supposed to do that now? So many things I want to fix, but no way to fix them. 

So where do I start with all my issues I think I have? Here I guess,
Friends, I only have one good friend, I thought I had two, but well I guess not because I havnt had a good conversation with them in several months, its like they don’t want to be a bad friend, but at the same time they don’t want to be my friend, so we end up with this terrible friendship, that sucks but I don’t want to lose a friend, because heck I only have a couple friends. I cant afford to lose a friend, someone I share almost everything with, someone who has been in my life for over 2 years. Maybe im losing them because I never hung out with them, only texted? But that seemed like what they wanted, we’re teenagers, we cant drive ourselves anywhere. How are we supposed to hang out? Plus even if we did something I would be to awkward to be who I really, the person I am on text messages, the person I want to be. But the person I cannot be in person. So is this why I feel like I am losing a friend? Why I have no friends? Because I am not like other people? I don’t even know at this point, I am hiding so much I have been hiding so much I cant feel anything anymore. Its all a blur. 
All the other “friends” I have, they’re just people I know. People who only kinda talk to me. I don’t know if they’re my friends, its like they’re only my friends in certain situations. Only when they need to be my friend. Only when they need me, my support or something. That’s when they’re my friend. But I don’t know, I cant feel anything. 
I want to be like other people, I want to have friends, and things to do. But im to afraid to try, im to afraid of who I am to do anything. So I stay where I am out, hating myself, hating who I am because I cannot bring myself to fix it. Living out of the city, and being homeschooled doesn’t help. Everyone else is normal and im the weird farmer kid who doesn’t go to school and has no friends and isn’t social. That’s what you get for living out west I guess. 

This only scratches the surface of the issues I have and the issues that are coming. Im supposed to be this smart kid, who works on a farm and is going to start his own business when he gets older. But really, the only reason I am so smart about business stuff is because I don’t do my school. I just plain old don’t do it. I can’t bring myself to do it, I hate school, and everything else I do is so much more fun. Why would I want to do school. It sucks. So here I am, 3 weeks away from school ending and If I don’t  do my school, that I really haven’t done all year then well I get to repeat whatever  grade im in. You know what that will do to my self-image, which already sucks. Yes, it will pound it into the ground. It will be nothing, I will be nothing, more than I am. I can have that. I need help, but I have no motivation to fix anything so why do it. 

I have so many opportunities that are going to be ruined by me redoing a grade. So many job openings and internships that I could have, but can’t if I fail this grade. I won’t be who I want to be, im supposed to be someone special, someone smart, after all im homeschooled, im a smart ass kid who knows everything and knows exactly what he wants to do. But really I don’t have any idea what I want to do, im not all that smart in most stuff, only in a couple areas and really im not better than your average person. But of course everyone thinks im better than that. That I am the smart homeschooled kid on a farm. But im not, I am really not and I can’t escape that assumption about me. I am just like them, just without any friends. 

I have no feelings most of the time. I don’t feel stuff, so people are happy, so people are sad big whoop. Doesn’t affect me, if it does it’s a show so I don’t look weird because I am not reacting. I don’t feel anything during the day. Its only at night  that I start to feel everything, when I start to lose the grip on covering everything up, when the depression sets in and I feel crippled, so I crawl off to bed or absorb myself in TV to wash away that feeling, or maybe go jack off because that always makes me feel better. But really it doesn’t, it just hides everything and I hate that I do it.

I hate that I masturbate all the time. It bothers me, it goes against what I was brought up with, against what I want to believe, what I want to hold myself to. What I want for myself. But I can’t stop, ive tried it doesn’t work, and It just keeps happening. I enjoy that 2 seconds of bliss but I hate myself for it. I hear everyone say its ok it won’t hurt you, but heck its hurting me, I have no emotions, I have terrible thoughts because of it, ive done some terrible things because of it. I hate everything about it, but but I cannot keep myself from doing it. Of course porn comes along with this, and this also goes against my moral, MY beliefs, standards I have set my MYSELF standards people think I adhere to, standards that people think I am living but really its just a lie. Just a fake. But I cant come out about it, that would ruin everything, everything I tell you. My parents would take away everything I have, I would have no privileges nothing. I would be a nobody more so than I am now. Life would never be the same, for the worse. I don’t those things, they cant change. I need to stop the PMO addiction, but I cant. 

Ive said so much, but there is so much more to say. But I feel like ive said enough maybe. I don’t know what to do. I think I need help but I have no were to get it. No were away from my parents. No were to run to. But of course im supposed to run to God, but I can’t. I don’t know how.

Throughout undergrad and medical school, I never paid attention to healthy habits or taking care of myself as a priority.  I just wanted to do well in school and have fun with friends.

During my medical intern year, **** hit the fan.  My lack of ""wellness"" habits - even though I always exercised and played sports growing up - came back to haunt me.  We worked 80hr weeks, and weren't given time to sleep, eat well or exercise.

When I started business school, I knew I wanted to succeed but I wasn't willing to sacrifice my health to get there.

I came up with a way to still work hard and have fun with friends, but also include the other key ingredients of living a long and healthy life as per the American College of Preventive Medicine: sleep, exercise, nutrition, stress management (i.e. meditation, yoga, relaxation) and love/social.

Because I'm a very visual person, and sometimes find it hard to focus on a single task (i.e. with ADHD-like attention at times), I wanted the experience to be fun, colorful and visual.  Health can be a ""cool"" thing, so I didn't want something dry and boring, I wanted something fun, engaging and aesthetically pleasing.

The result is here:

I was further discouraged by the fact that no matter what I do for Biology and think about going for Bio PhD, I would be doing the same thing for over 12 years even before becoming a professor . Plus, more and more fields in Biology started requiring computation-heavy data analysis, and I was ever wondering if my doing masters in CS could help.

Because I got back to school at the end of my junior year after 2 year hiatus, I virtually know no one and I could not get help from friends when I needed. That really affected my performance and further hurt my confidence. Now, I avoid coding and am horrified to just graduate and have no job whatsoever. 

I am taking algorithms, probability theory, and linear algebra now, and have taken C++ programming and discrete mathematics. I hope to take C programming class and database class and do well in them, but I was wondering if people like me could just start searching for a summer internship (part-time). My school has masters program that admits current undergraduate, and I need to boost my GPA for that as well, but now I feel like I am a failure."

25uitk,0,2014-05-18,Should I bother trying to transfer?,throwawaycstransfer,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/25uitk/should_i_bother_trying_to_transfer/,"Hi all, been lurking this sub for a couple weeks and everyone seems to be extremely helpful and friendly so I figured I'd ask a question that I've been thinking about for several months now. 

I just finished my freshman year at the University of Pittsburgh, which is a state school in Pennsylvania. It's a decent school, but its computer science program isn't exactly very prestigious, unlike that of Carnegie Mellon's or MIT's. Out of high school my stats were OK but not exactly stellar, but since starting college I have been trying harder and have been more involved; I finished up second semester with a 3.65 cumulative GPA while taking mostly CS, natural science, and calculus courses, did bioinformatics research in the spring, and will be starting a research internship at the university's children's hospital in a couple weeks where I will also probably be doing bioinformatics work. 

So what I'm wondering is if it would be worth trying to transfer out and attend a school with a more prestigious CS program, with the intent of going into industry after graduation. I don't really want to up-and-move to a ""random"" location where I don't know anybody and I don't know the area, since coming to Pitt from high school was kind of rough the first couple months, what with getting to know people, and now I feel like I'm starting to settle in with people I would like to continue to be friends with, and so I would really not prefer to do that again. So the only two schools I've been seriously considering applying to are Carnegie Mellon and Cornell, since Carnegie Mellon is literally 10 minutes walking from Pitt's campus, and my brother and several friends attend Cornell. Both of these schools are obviously fairly prestigious with acclaimed CS programs, and consequently have extremely competitive admissions -- while my current GPA and other credentials are better than they were in high school, they are still by no means stellar and I doubt I would get into either one as a CS major. So if I were to transfer, I would apply as an Information Systems/Science major, since at both schools the acceptance rate for IS majors compared to CS majors is a good deal higher. From what I understand, the curriculum for IS and CS programs are fairly similar early on, and then later diverge, with IS being more business and Internet-related. So if I were to transfer and get in to either school after my sophomore year, I would be taking slightly different classes than a CS major, but if I didn't like it I could try to transfer into the CS school.

People often tell me that it doesn't really matter a whole ton where you go for undergraduate, as long as you do well. I'm fairly certain I will have managed at least a 3.5 from Pitt by the time I graduate, and would probably only have at least a 3.0 from Cornell or CMU, so I think those would seem fairly similar to a recruiter. The main thing I'm concerned about is work after my first job, since by then it seems that employers often disregard GPA and look more at just the school, where Cornell or CMU would look more impressive than Pitt. So if I graduate from Pitt with a BS in CS, I would probably look to attend graduate school at a more impressive/prestigious university with a more acclaimed CS program, ie. CMU, Cornell, MIT, Michigan, etc.

Currently, I'm leaning more towards not transferring, since I'm currently fairly comfortable at Pitt. But if trying to transfer out to a more prestigious university would be worth it, I would give it a whirl."

25v2n1,2,2014-05-18,Am I screwed? (Somewhat of a long post),IN_THE_KLOUDS,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/25v2n1/am_i_screwed_somewhat_of_a_long_post/,"Hi Reddit,

I'm posting here to see if anyone can offer me some advice because I think I'm pretty much screwed in terms of job prospects.  Maybe there's something I should be doing or that I haven't thought of that someone will point out.  No matter where I apply, I don't get any responses or anything.  I've tried temp agencies with no results.  I've tried the standard job search sites as well...no luck.

Here's my scenario:  I graduated from a large university about a year ago with a degree in Spanish and Portuguese (with an Econ minor).  Since then, I've gone back home, and worked mainly at a retail operation doing something I really hate, and I make minimum wage.  I'm looking for a way out but so far haven't found anything.  I've decided to (partially) return to school - I'm doing a language program with Middlebury College for 8 weeks this summer with hopes that that could help me boost my resume.  I'm also working with a group on the side to develop a website devoted to e-commerce in the legal marijuana space...

I'd like to find a job doing whatever it takes to allow me to move out of my parent's home and make enough money to support myself.  


Here are a few things about me that I usually like to point out when discussing jobs, employment, etc...

~I speak 2 other languages (Spanish and Portuguese, as I studied them at University and taught English in Mexico during a gap year after high school) pretty well.  I can get by with ease.  I can also speak basic German, but not enough to really do much with it as there aren't a ton of German speaking people to practice my language.  I understand some Mandarin as well.  

~I invested my college fund at age 13 (with parental consent, obviously) and I made enough off selling the stock I held in Nintendo from 2003-2007 to pay for college (bought at 13/share, sold at 65/share).  I do stock research for fun.  I minored in Economics in college and have done lots of (personal) research on the drug war and its effect on and in Latin America, particularly Mexico and other Central American countries.   

~I've been told I'm a good writer.  I've actually done some editorials for a friend's sports blog, as well as covering a professional soccer tournament while in college for the city's newspaper.  

~Good with computers - I know it's standard these days but I'm pretty good with Excel, I've done some basic website development, I do audio related stuff as a hobby and dicked around with Photoshop and Final Cut while in college, made a few things.  I learned to program in Basic when I was in middle school, and have a few programming books.  


Here's what I think is holding me back:

~I'm from a major center of exorbitant wealth and naturally, ""connections"".  I interviewed for internships across the board while in college, but never landed one despite getting in contact with CEOs, Board members, etc... from all kinds of firms - banks, investment firms, sporting leagues, advertising agencies, you name it.  No dice.  My dad is an executive recruiter and constantly tells me that this is a massive mark against me.  My degree in Languages isn't very useful either, apparently, if I don't want to go into teaching (which I've done before, and hated it).

~See above - I'm from a very wealthy area and I didn't go to a great school.  This raises red flags, right?  I know it's more about connections and experience than school later on in life, but since I'm young and only a year out of school, it's all about the school, right?

~Lack of experience - the lack of a job during high school, during college, and dearth of internships.  I've done a number of odd jobs from working for several different retail outlets for a few months on end to working for the U.S Census department.  However, as stated earlier, nothing beats internships.

~I don't ""network"" very well.  This can be changed, but probably isn't the one thing holding me back. I don't use Linkedin, haven't been on Facebook since '07, etc...  


Here's a bit about me personally that still applies to a professional setting:

~I'm immune to office ""politics"".  

~Willing to relocate.  I hate living in the suburbs of NYC.  Just too damn expensive. 

~Extremely timely.  Being so much as a minute late is a massive pet peeve of mine.  I respect the hell out of everyone else's time, and the same for my own.  

~I'm pretty well-read (WSJ and NYT every day, baby!) and find it extremely easy to strike up a conversation with someone who isn't from my part of the world, just by talking about their local issues.  Strong interest in politics.

Any advice?  How screwed am I?  I'm 24, BTW.

25v3fa,3,2014-05-18,"I just want a job, what should I do?",inthegreenshirt,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/25v3fa/i_just_want_a_job_what_should_i_do/,"Hi guys, I would appreciate literally any help/advice. 

First off, I am in the unique position where I can either graduate from college now (summer term, but without taking any extra classes) or do another semester. 

Either way, I would earn a Biology BSc degree. At one point I actually thought this was a practical major, now I feel like not being pre-med or going for a PhD it was a horrible decision. 

I have good credentials: a 3.87 GPA (from top 3 US public school, top 25 overall), special honors awards, some research experience, and an abroad internship experience. However, when applying for paid internships this summer (sending out 50+ apps by the end), I couldn't get a single one. Then having done web research and looking at some of the graduates I know, I am now officially freaked out about not being able to get any job whatsoever upon graduation.

As stated, I just want a job. I don't have very high standards, I would be happy with anything stable, 35k+ (livable wage here) with normal hours. I worked all through hs as a waitress and in retail and I just don't want to have to go back to that.

So here's where I ask for advice. Should I do another semester in which I take stats courses to try and gain real skills? (Classes in SAS, R, maybe Java too) Also sticking around campus, I might be able to go to more mass interviews/events.

Or should I opt for early graduation, and start out for a new degree/certification. I'm really interested in medical field related things. I've looked into grad school public health (I am interested in this, but fearful it is also a bad decision when one really needs a paid job at the end). I've also thought about doing a nursing masters or an accelerated BSN. I've also seen certifications for various hospital type jobs- should I go in that direction? (I really don't want to do more schooling but will if I have to, though I'd prefer two more years tops limit).

I feel like I was very stupid in choosing my major, doing it because I liked bio and had thought with no evidence that it was practical. I didn't actually think about what jobs are open at the end, and now I feel as though nothing is. 

TL;DR: Bio major wonders if she should graduate now or stick around and take stat/CS classes to attempt to be more marketable? Also keep applying to jobs or instead embark on second degree or specialized certifications?"

I know you tell yourself this is a first world problem, but its one that's worth time and effort to fix. This such a frustrating ailment. Don't give up :)**


Hi everyone-- these are my abbreviated notes on my journey so far, methods I've tried, my failures and triumphs. The numbers represent my overall feelings about my trich: 


**Childhood: 0**

&gt;Always picking at split ends, zits, funny hairs, didn't think much of it. One thing sticks out in my mind though in hindsight after much rumination: When I was about 11 a friend of mine told me if you have these thick black hairs that poke out of the top of your head it has something to do with your hormone changes. I hated the thought of hormone changes. I pulled them out whenever I found them. Stopped doing this in high school, but since that time I still loved my tweezers and finding strange hairs that didn't belong all over my body. I thought this was strange but again, didn't think much of it. 



**December 2009 - The first episode (wow didn't realize it had been this long...): -2**

&gt;I remember that first pull so perfectly well. I have fine, long blonde hair. I was in my bedroom studying for finals, running my fingers through my hair and I feel this course, thick hair. Hm sorry little buddy you don't belong. Pull. Wow I wonder if there are other ones like this. Oh my goodness so many. Two days later the space around my desk is has strands of hair all over the ground. I didn't tell anyone, but it didn't alarm me at the time. 



**Spring 2010 - Hm, something's wrong: -4**

&gt;My arms and fingers ache, I have hair everywhere, I spend 15-60 min in a trance picking most days. I ask my hairdresser why I have so many course hairs, and if there was something I could do to to make them soft (I still thought this was an issue with my hair at this point, not with my brain, though I was starting to get suspicious of that brain of mine...)



**Summer 2010 - Coming out: -2**

&gt;I find a name for it. Trich. I tell those close to me, my boyfriend and sister. I lived with my sister, and being a psychology student, she decided she would employ her own negative reinforcement experiment on me, which essentially involved smacking/hitting/throwing a cat at me every time I picked. I'm sure everyone here could guess that this only lead to frustration for both of us, and ultimately resulted in what I call ""negative-negative"" reinforcement where I would smack her after she smacked me. Ultimately the experiment was rendered futile. We have an amazing relationship and she has always been supportive of my more... conventional methods of healing. My boyfriend was so lovely about the whole thing. When I told him I was nervous he would think it was very weird, but he responded with only love and a willingness to help. His plan of attack through the whole situation has only been gentle reminders when I was pulling. Though this was never ultimately effective, anyone who has trich knows how absolutely annoying anything else but a gentle reminder is. He was and is totally patient and supportive. I told my parents later in the summer; they had already noticed of course. 



**Summer 2010-Summer 2011 - Just. go. away...: -6**

&gt;Methods of attack included: will power, hats, gloves, rubber bands, string, hand lotion, etc.... All lead to basically the same thing: Immense frustration. I also felt depressed-- if I'm honest with myself I've always known something wasn't quite right in my brain. I always nearly got the courage to try counseling but never did. In the spring of 2011 I was having a particularly bad time of it (couldn't find a summer job, no money, poor relationship with parents). My mom suggested I see a councilor for my pulling, and though annoyed that she would suggest this I reluctantly went. Basically I walked into the office, she asked me what was going on, I broke down crying for the full hour. As you would imagine, my sobbing didn't really result in a cost-effective counseling session. She suggested I try fish oil to make my hair stronger (an obvious band-aid-- but what more could she do in the moments between weeping?). I ended up getting a job the next week and was away out of province for the rest of the summer. 



**Fall 2011-Summer 2012 - Counseling and CBT: 7**

&gt;In the fall I finally got the courage to see a counselor weekly (I did this for 4 months). Luckily this was included in my university fees. She was only an intern, but it doesn't seem to matter when you click with someone I guess. She was wonderful. We focused on two main things: general counsel and CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy). I participated in CBT diligently and went through a book called ""Mind Over Mood"". This was moderately helpful, but I never really found my ""trigger"". From reading the posts on this subreddit for some time I don't really know that anyone can define a trigger other than general stress or boredom. What really helped me during these sessions though was just general counsel. We talked through some of my first world problems that I had been bottling inside for a long time. This, in my opinion, is what helped the most. My picking went down substantially and my parents noticed (I didn't tell them I was in counseling). It was truly amazing to me because even though I was under a lot of stress I was still calm and peaceful. The ""effects"" of the counseling went until about Summer 2012 and then slowly I started picking more and more. 



**Summer 2012-Spring 2013 - Results decay: -1**

&gt;My old counselor moves on to become a registered counselor, I see another women starting in the fall who seemed great but I was just too busy to make the time. Plus my trich wasn't terrible during this time, I would say around a -2, so I wasn't overly motivated to get help, though it was still terribly frustrating. I graduate in winter 2013, work for four months, then take four months off to relax and travel before starting my first full time, salaried job.



**Summer 2013 - Old fashioned rejuvenation: 3**

&gt;During my four months off it was incredibly easy for me to reduce my pulling. I employed this technique where if I started pulling I put my hands in the air and repeated, out loud ""I don't need to touch my hair"". This simple tactic worked wonders in my newly stress-free life. I wasn't perfect but by the end of the summer I had practically considered myself ""cured"". 



**Fall 2013 - Yeah, I'm not cured.: -7**

&gt;My boyfriend left to study overseas. My new job started and was very stressful. I had moved and was alone in a big city. My first world problems resulted in pulling like no other time in my life. This was the first time my hair dresser asked if I pulled. I was mortified that she noticed. After that I sought counsel again. I get 8 free sessions with a councilor on my work plan. We didn't really ""click"", I eventually stop seeing her after about 5 sessions. In the mean-time, I have the good fortune of getting in touch with a woman online who's son had trich and overcame it by using Zoloft for a short time and was successful in banishing his trich. This seemed too good to be true but it planted the seed of trying medication in my mind. I tell my dad this and the next day he brings me home samples of Cipralex (he's a GP). I'm skeptical and wait about a week before trying it.



**Fall 2013 - Cipralex: 10 .....-3**

&gt;It was like a freaking miracle. My hands just didn't care to go to my head. My hair seemed utterly uninteresting. I felt like a million bucks. I felt so free. The first day I called my mom and told her ""I hope this works. But if it doesn't, I'm just so thankful to have today"". It still makes me tear up thinking about how good I felt that day. Sadly over the next few weeks, the results became less and less as my dose went up and up. I didn't want to admit defeat, but my mom told me she noticed I was picking as much as ever. I was heart broken. 



**Winter 2014 - Zoloft: -2**

&gt;My dad helps me switch to Zoloft. It made me feel nauseous at first, but I got over it. It helped a little bit, but not nearly the effect of my first few weeks on Cipralex. Again, my dose slowly went up, while my results remained largely stagnant. I tried a few things during this time because I had read that anti depressants work best in conjunction with other, more holistic methods. I tried CBT again (on my own) and a few other methods, including one that I adapted from the book ""The Brain that Changes Itself"" which involved meditation and chocolate. Though tasty, it ultimately didn't work.



**Spring 2014 - NAC: 3**

&gt;My dad started researching other methods for treating trich. He found [this paper on NAC (N-Acytle-Cystine)](http://www.trich.org/dnld/NACarticle_InTouch55_rev.pdf). I found it at a natural health food store; interestingly it is not sold at pharmacies. I slowly reduced my dosage of Zoloft, and increased my dosage of NAC (up to 2000mg). This is my first week completely off of an anti-depressant since the fall. The NAC has been helping a lot in my opinion. Its so hard to tell with these things. You never know what is a placebo. I measure my success in not pulling by the number of ""episodes"" I have-- I define an episode as that trance-like state of picking that I can't seem to snap out of. Since using NAC, I have had very few of these episodes. I would certainly not say I'm perfect, but I feel much more in control than I did on the anti-depressants. Apparently NAC helps more and more overtime so I am excited and hopeful for the future. 




I'm sure from my story you can see I am very lucky to have such a supportive network of people around me.

Good luck everyone-- trich is a weird one.

[Did you ever take a call from a lobbyist? If so, what was it like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chkk9v0?context=5)|Lobbyists dont call the general number for a Senator. They have a relationship with the Legislative Assistants and come in for meetings. So they either have the direct lines of the people they need to talk to, or if they're calling me its only to direct them to someone else.
[So, it's worse than many people think.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chkkykt?context=5)|A lot of lobbyists are former staffers. So they have a very intimate knowledge of the procedures and how to write pieces of legislation and had already existing relationships established with the elected officials themselves.
 |The lobbyists can write the first draft of the legislation themselves and work with the staffers in the office on edits and the language in the bill. 
[How enraged does the senator/lobbyist relationship make you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chkult7?context=5)|Honestly the thing that bothered me the most was that I felt like although not everything that is done on the Hill is shady and bad, it could have been a lot worse because most of my generation is extremely politically lethargic (im now 28).
 |Obviously there is going to be a lot of people that are very passionate about the way that their government operates and the shit that goes on, but so far in my life most of the people i've come in contact with since i've left DC just chalk everything up to ""bullshit"" and dont care. I cant say I blame them because they havent seen too much reward for the time and effort it takes, but it just makes for an extremely vicious cycle that ultimately ends badly.
[What methods have worked to get a response from the Senator himself/herself, instead of just having a call screened and logged by you? For example, if I call in with an intelligent argument and present it reasonably, is there any shot that the Senator will actually be told ""one of your constituents, Flavor80 from Redditville, called yesterday and brought up a point that we haven't considered before""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chkk9u7?context=5)|For starters i'd say start with the Senators/Congressmen that you're able to vote for. The only thing we really required from people to record their calls was their zip code. If they wanted a response from the Senator (in written form) we would take down their postage information. So if you recently moved. If you call a Michigan senator with a California zipcode and address you're not going to get any follow up from the office.
[If I'm registered with the other political party, or just moved to the state and therefore wasn't a registered voter for the Senator's last election, will that impact the way my question/request is treated?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chkk9u7?context=5)|For your first question, I cant obviously speak for the other 99 senators but I would almost always include a specific example of a call I received from a constituent when reporting it to the Senator. So if you voiced your opinion or concerns about an issue i took notes on it to bring to the meeting if i felt like it also captured a lot of what other people were saying.
[Have you seen house of cards? If so how accurately does it depict the real govt?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chkkeh9?context=5)|I actually have not seen it. My friends have been screaming at me for a while to watch the show because they know i'll love it.
 |There are a couple of shows that I saw that had the most accurate representations of government, one was The Wire (more on a state level with Carcetti/Little Finger :P ) and I think all Hill staffers are obsessed with The West Wing.
 |Martin Sheen actually stopped by the Hill when i worked there and pretty much everyone that saw him as he was roaming around referred to him as ""Mr. President"" lol.
[Do you think West Wing was an accurate representation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chkqo9g?context=5)|I only watched the first couple of seasons of the show, but I do think it was as close as anyone has gotten to the life on Capitol Hill. The kinds of relationships that are forged and the ways in which they function between the White House and Capitol Hill and between people that work in politics i thought was very well established in the show.
 |I've heard from former colleagues and many others that House of Cards also accomplishes this, but I cant say for myself.
 |My favorite show or medium that shows all sides of the coin for me was The Wire. I got in a few conversations about how accurate the show was with a lot of our senior staff.
[What demographic did you hear from the most?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chkk2yi?context=5)|Senior Citizens.
 |Also I worked for a democrat so the majority of people that called in tended to be more conservative.
[This is why we can't touch social security, Medicare, etc.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chky2xi?context=5)|Senior Citizens are certainly a lot more active politically. They have a lot more time on their hands. So they're going to be a lot more vocal with their concerns.  
[On average how many calls did you get in a day?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chkk79j?context=5)|I would say it fluctuates but i'd say there were far more days that the phones literately wouldn't stop ringing from 9-5.

There was one guy that always came and visited the office dressed in a suit with such a massive beer gut that his bottom button was always popped and his gut was fighting to escape his shirt. I always found that entertaining. Oh there was a crazy woman that always called us after hours and left messages about her menstrual cycle...those were always interesting.

[What is your personal opinion on 'corruption in Washington'  I have seen AMA where former staffers/politicians have said that it's very corrupt, and politicians are generally trying to get re-elected and find a nice job for them when they leave, and others that have said it's just an extremely tough job with no good options and politicians just seem corrupt but are generally good.  What do you think?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chkqnqb?context=5)|Honestly, i was not a fan at all of the way things operated. Here is the best way I could explain what I had an issue with (which I dont think is really eye opening or groundbreaking information)...
 |Every senator is going to be extremely knowledgeable and well versed in his/her core group of issues (usually directly relating to the state that they represent). Those are the issues that they ran on. So if you represent a state for example that has an economy that is extremely tied to Agriculture, you might have a Senator who is very well versed and knowledgeable on that subject. Or if you have a state that lost a ton of manufacturing jobs, you could have a Senator who ran on a platform based on manufacturing and trade agreements. So basically there are going to be a handful of issues that these elected officials are going to be experts in and from what I saw its almost always going to be tied to the people that put them in office. So when legislation or something came up pertaining to that issue they're going to be extremely educated on the subject and thus a lot harder to sway by lobbyists or their own political party.
 |Now there's nothing wrong with that, it makes sense, the majority of the people in the legislative body are very smart and well educated in a range of issues. But they're not going to be experts in every one of them. That is why you have a legislative staff. They go out and make sure that you have Legislative Assistants (LA) and people that they trust in the issues that arent really high on the list of the priorities of their voters. So a state like Utah for example (^I ^dont ^actually ^know ^what ^the ^top ^priorities ^are ^for ^people ^in ^Utah ^im ^just ^guessing ^here) Foreign policy may be really low on that list of priorities. So thats where the lobbyists or political parties do the most damage. It's a lot easier to convince someone to vote one way or the other on an issue. And ultimately the people with the most power are the people with the most money and can craft the best argument.
 |The main reason I had a problem with this, was because obviously whether a Senator is an expert or not on an issue they operate within a legislative body that has to cover anything and everything. And what i felt like got lost was that the issues that didn't necessarily seem like a high priority for them, but could easily effect people in other states/countries were up for grabs. And those decisions were based on who could make the best argument. Whether it was someone who claimed to represent a lot of your constituents, pressures from your political party telling you to just ride the party line and vote along your fellow dems/republicans, or people that donate a shit ton of money to your campaign. I just realized i'm typing up a massive essay here, so i'll tone it down. If you want me to clarify any of the points though let me know...
 |**TLDR - No I wasnt really a fan of the way things operated. I felt like too many very important decisions were being made for the wrong reasons.**
[This is great to read. It's such a fundamental flaw in the system that every person in power is capable of weakness just like the rest of us.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chkwgbo?context=5)|It's not a perfect system, you're not going to get a perfect system when you're talking about governing the kind of population with the kinds of demographics that exist in this country.  When I worked on the Hill I would go home and watch the Prime Time shows on Fox News and MSNBC. Main reason I did this was not because I gave a rats ass about what they were saying. It was because I knew that without a doubt i'd go into work the next day, log into the phones and listen to call after call of people reciting exactly what they heard Bill O'Reilly, Glenn Beck, Ed Schultz or Rachel Maddow tell them the night before. It was disturbing to me, but unfortunately it's far too convenient for people to take a news story about legislation or an event that happens and only try to concentrate on the facts that support their ideology and throw away every other bit of information. At first I blamed the networks for this, and thought that they were trash. I still think they're trash, but i dont think they're the issue. I think the issue is the people that watch it and soak it up like a sponge. Fox News isn't bad for what they put on there network. The fact that people soak it up like a sponge is the disgusting part.
[How would you solve the problem you mentioned?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chkwgbo?context=5)|Ultimately I think the only solution to these kinds of problems are having a very well educated constituent base. And this is something that I couldnt be any more cynical on. The sources that the majority of Americans get their news from is in my opinion absolute garbage. Any media that tries to deliver news has become all about talking heads, and opinions. You no longer get a news story with any factual information you just get someone's reaction to a news story. People are not taught how to think they're taught what to think and they just want to remain comfortable in their bubbles.
[I'm a firm believer in a form of technocracy/meritocracy where the decision makers for a field are the best and most learned in said field. We should expect more from the people who control our schools, health and wealth.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chkwgbo?context=5)|Honestly I dont know if it's something that can be fixed. I know this quote gets beaten to death but I have to agree with Churchill when he said said...""Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time""  And obviously I'm generalizing here, I know that there are is a large portion of people in this country that this doesnt apply to, but in my experience i'd say they are a minority. 
[What did you guys do with Larry Flynts monthly delivery of Hustler?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chkmuah?context=5)|We would recycle em. Granted if someone wanted to take them out of the recycle bin and take them home they could...
[How often would you get calls from enraged constituents?  What were the conversations like? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chkl0px?context=5)|Very often. The people that were enraged, usually just worked themselves up through the call and would end up just screaming at me about an issue. I always tried to keep the conversation focused on whatever the issue was so i'd make note that they were very enraged but if they weren't making any sense or didnt have a point to make i'd do what i can to just move on to another caller.
 |But those kinds of people generally just want to yell and scream and vent. I dont think they really cared much for the conversation to be honest.
[Do you have an example of one call that directly led to the changing of a specific policy or did that never happen? After working this job do you ever see yourself calling into a senator to voice an opinion in the future?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chkma1a?context=5)|I personally never fielded any calls like that, but i know that there have been instances where someone calls and references a story of theirs and  the office wants to use their story to help promote their stance on a bill. I wouldnt say it changes their perspective on the issue though.
 |I personally don't call a political office though. I guess i just got more or less burnt out on it.
[What information do you actually take down from phone calls regarding issues? Is it worth making a whole speech, or should I be as terse as possible?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chkkcok?context=5)|I'd say its a mix. We have an internal system that helps us log all the calls that come in. We weren't able to log the call though without the zipcode so we needed to make sure that the person calling is actually a constituent.
 |That being said, when logging each call, we make notes on what the actual call was about. So as you're making your points my job was to write down a summary of what you were saying. I mean some people definitely went on a tangent and covered like 40 different issues as they were talking but i'd say its better for you to stay on point and stick to one issue with each call. 
[I know I'm a little late but if you're still around...  What were some of the qualifications for your position?  Do they run for any offices?  If so would that help their chances of election?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chkmhr1?context=5)|People usually stick around for a while and transition from the staff assistant role to a Legislative Correspondent (LCs). LC's will get a batch of issues for themselves and work along with the Legislative Assistants (LAs) that handle similar issues. So LCs primary role is to deal with the drafting of any correspondence to constituents and to suppor the LAs on their issues (whether thats writing Legislation or meeting with people). It does happen where an LC can move to LA on their own but most people that get hired as LAs have some kind of formal training in that issue. So if you're an LA that concentrates on military/defense issues for example it would help to have a military background, or if have a post-graduate degree on the issue at hand.
[Where do people often go to after they hold positions like yours?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chkmhr1?context=5)|I'd say the majority of people that get their start on Capitol Hill started as interns. One of the other responsibilities i had was the running of the internship program as well, and I can tell you that generally speaking most offices will aim to hire interns that are either currently in school or fresh graduates. There tends to be a high turnover rate on Capitol Hill so i got lucky that when my internship was done there was an open position and i applied.  There are certainly a number of people that hold office today that started as interns and I worked with a few that had aspirations to run for office. I think a few actually started as Capitol Police officers as well.
 |In terms of whether or not it helps in their election i'd say thats debatable. I think most politicians in this country have a more unfavorable reputation so you hear the word ""Career politician"" thrown around negatively when people are running campaigns because it leads people to believe they've been part of a corrupt process their whole life.
[How were you told to respond to constituents who disagreed with how your Senator voted? Engage in debate? Explain the reasons why? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chklfvj?context=5)|This changes from office to office. At one point our office used ""Talking Points"" so people who handled the phones [Whether they were interns or other staff assistants] had a book with them that gave them the senators stance on a range of issues to gauge off of.
 |We weren't supposed to engage anyone on the phone in any kind of debate. I'd say the majority of people that called in disagreed on an issue and that was the reason why they were calling. If they knew the senator agreed with them they didnt feel the need to call.
 |That being said, obviously a lot of people wanted us to explain to them the senators stance, so thats what the talking points were for. As we got closer to election time, our office decided to scrap the talking points and move towards a written correspondence, that people in the legislative staff would write up. I dont necessarily think its the most effective in terms of communication, but I think it was done so the office can make sure they control the message going out. 
[Craziest conspiracy theory a constituent called with? I interned for a House member and we had a crazy guy who claimed the Chinese Government owned 3 of the local McDonald's and was poisoning everyone.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chkkv9d?context=5)|I mentioned this in an earlier question but we had a woman who always called in and left messages with all kinds of crazy information. She would call in and blame the government when she missed her period and pretty much had a conspiracy for anything and everything going on.
[How do you folks deal with requests for nomination for the military academies. Is there a specific vetting process?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chklzmd?context=5)|Yeah we had a specific application process for academy nominations. You could apply through the Senator's website as long as it was before the deadlines.
 |Most Senators have someone who works in the State offices and deals with casework that handles the nominations so i'd contact the local office of your senator to get more info. What state are you in? I can probbaly find a link for ya.
[If you had an issue that you wanted to get addressed by the senator and not just an aid how would you go about that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chkmamd?context=5)|If you mean like a personal request thats regarding casework i'd say just say contact the State office. Say you're having an issue with another government agency (related to unemployment, social services, immigration, or whatever the issue may be). At worst a letter from a US Senator on your behalf to those agencies could help make a difference, or they might let you know of other programs available to you to help you with whatever you need.
 |Like I mentioned earlier, if you have 2 senators and a congressmen that represent you, cant hurt to call them all, but i'd aim for the one thats closer to re-election. They might let you know of a program or some kind of assistance that you might not have known existed for someone in your situation that could make a difference.
[Did you get a lot of threats?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chkjqyb?context=5)|Not really, ~~a few~~ a lot of people would work themselves into a fit of anger but other than cursing no one really would threaten the Senator or anyone in the office. 
[Could you describe your job as the punching bag between politicians and the public? Is there any reason to call them if you dont have a problem? Would people call just to check in or say that the senitor is doing great? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chkvppq?context=5)|At times I certainly felt like a punching bag. But it was very easy for me to not take things personally.
 |But some of my favorite callers are the sweet old ladies that call in just to say Thank you and they love the work that the Senator is doing, or are just excited.
 |And on another note, I was a tour coordinator for a while (setting up tours for constituents to visit Capitol Building, White House, Bureau of Engraving and Printing, Library of Congress, etc.) and although there were plenty of people that were hard to deal with, generally speaking it was a joy to be able to help a family out and make their vacation a little easier. Always loved meeting them when they came in to the office and showing them around.
[Yeah, but think where those party priorities come from. Do you think that still isn't ultimately determined in large part by what the big money donors want?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chl01np?context=5)|Absolutely, i've grown to be a bit cynical but I do think that ultimately its all going to be traced back to money. But as Roman tells you in GTA, you wanted Capitalism...you got it.
[Did you ever take a call from a prostitute or an escort ?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chkv50z?context=5)|No not while in the office. But I will say that anywhere with that kind of power is goin to have a thriving community of high class escorts. I heard rumors of some steak houses and nicer establishments around DC  where they go to try and pick up congressmen. But i never got to see any of this go down obviously, with the salary i had and the extreme cost of living in DC, i'd be lucky if i could have witnessed a rub n tug at a shady asian massage parlor. 
[Did the Senator actually care what people's opinions were?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chkxtb2?context=5)|I'd say when it came to the phone calls, he cared a lot more about the overall influx of the calls and what topics dominated the phones.
[I call mine from time to time and get the impression that they really don't care what my opinion is.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chkxtb2?context=5)|But I will say that the Senator I worked for always talked about conversations he had with constituents whether in State or at events here in DC where they voiced their opinions on things. They certainly cared about what constituents said to them when they met them in person.
[Are you the guy who talked about the gay senator and then didnt come out about it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chkvx17?context=5)|I didnt know of any gay senators while i was working on the hill, isn't Tammy Baldwin a lesbian? She's a US Senator serving Wisconsin. I mean i know that doesnt get nearly as much press as it should but I think thats awesome. 
[Do you still work on the Hill? If so, what do you do now? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chkou52?context=5)|I do not, i left a couple years ago, returned back home and did my MBA, i'm now looking for work in a few places, but off the Hill.
[I have a friend who worked as a staffer for a few years in DC. I asked him similar questions about trying to get some action from the senator/congressperson.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chkytzp?context=5)|Well there are very strict laws prohibiting separating campaign and the legislative office.
[The main thing that came across is that the politicians spend nearly all day on the phone ""dialing for dollars"". He also said that individual voices do little to effect change since the politician isn't trying for individual votes but to get blocks. Do you have any comments on this? Did your person spend all day raising the next campaigns funds? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chkytzp?context=5)|That being said the Senator did have a block of time scheduled on some days for which they were doing campaign calls. I wouldnt say it was the majority of the day at all, but i'm sure some Senators/Congressmen do it differently. 
[What led you to become a staff assistant? and how do you get the gig? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25tfk9/i_answered_phones_for_a_us_senator_for_2_years_ama/chkwtcj?context=5)|I started as an Intern and proved myself capable while I was there.

Hey guys!

I have a few questions for you guys who have been looking for at least 3 months to no avail for a CS job.

- What is your education?
- Do you have internships or work experience?
- Do you have side projects or a portfolio?
- Do you have specific skills you are strong at?
- What is your location?
- How long have you been looking?
- What kind of jobs are you applying to?
- Why you think you haven't found a job?
- Any other detail you think is relevant?

You can also include your resume if you want us to comment on it.

As for me, I'm employed now, but I've been fired of a 3 months job in the past for scummy reasons and it took me 2 months to get a new job, so I have an idea of what it feels like, though it certainly doesn't compare to someone who's been looking for a year or more. I'm curious as to how long-time seekers are doing and I'm willing to help.

25vi7d,2,2014-05-18,On a major downswing and in need of some encouragement or kind words. TL;DR included postscript.,TAdepres,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/25vi7d/on_a_major_downswing_and_in_need_of_some/,"Hi all. I'm notorious for writing tangentially so I apologize. I'll include a tl;dr at the end of this.

I'm female, 24, and was diagnosed with childhood depression at age 8. Throughout the years I struggled to find a good med mix (with weekly or biweekly therapy sessions included) and in 2008, I found it in Pristiq 100 daily *(I'll note that this is what I'm still taking atm)*. In 2009 I developed anorexia nervosa and in late 2010, I took myself off the Pristiq cold turkey (*""I don't need this! I'm fine!""*). By spring 2011 I was a complete wreck; full-blown eating disorder, alcohol abuse, severe anxiety and depression, unmedicated, and suicidal. After realizing that I was in the throes of rock bottom, I committed myself to the hospital and that experience changed my life for the better. At the time I was in college and after my hospitalization, I joined two very helpful therapy groups on campus for depression and eating disorders which undoubtedly helped me discover mindfulness, meditation, patience, acceptance, and for the first time in my life, true hope and faith that I had inner strength. Putting the skills I learned into practice made me a better person, in my opinion, and although I sometimes did slip and fall, I was able to wrangle myself back up, pinpoint what happened to start the downfall, and my ""depressed times"" were much shorter in duration. I felt that I was very much in control of helping myself wrestle through the muck and come out on the shinier other side. 

I graduated college last May but before I could receive my diploma, I had to complete a 12-week unpaid internship. My university was 4 ½ hours away from my family and I was in no way financially capable of working 40+ hours for free all summer and still live in the town where my school was, which was where I wanted so badly to stay. Long story short, I landed an internship in my hometown, which is a mostly rural place with &lt;4,000 residents. We don't have apartment complexes here. My only choice was to move back in with my toxic family. 

I very much enjoyed my internship and formed tight bonds with all of my colleagues but it was with a state agency, and I'm sure most of us who've tried to get state-level jobs right out of school know that it's nearly impossible being that we don't have any experience. (I've since learned that a 12-week internship does not count as experience.) 
As such, I finally found a job an hour away that is somewhat related to my degree, but is soul sucking. It is a psychiatric hospital for children and teens--and by psychiatric I mean patients with major aggressive tendencies who may or may not have a touch of mental illness sprinkled in. I began in September working full-time but by mid-April, I could not handle it anymore. The two-hour round trip, the constant understaffing and being berated by patients, and the way that I myself was trained during orientation to be a strict authoritarian with our patients. Basically, my own usage of mindfulness, patience, listening, understanding, and loving-kindness was simply not allowed at my work. Naturally, after six months of using this harsher technique, I found that it became much harder for me to turn the work switch off once at home, and my old feelings of depression and despair began resurfacing. I quit my full-time schedule a month ago and now only go in PRN, but it's still extremely difficult for me to even work there a few times a month (which is, truly, all that I can mentally stomach).
I was involved in a sticky fwb relationship with one of my coworkers at the hospital from December-May. To be quick, he was not the person I thought he was and he ended up sexually assaulting me a couple of weeks ago at his home. I am still trying to wrap my head around this because I truly trusted him and thought he was my friend, not to mention I had never been sexually assaulted before. 

Next, my family. My dad is an alcoholic, my mom has severe major depressive disorder and anxiety, my 16-year-old sister is an academic prodigy but is an extreme hoarder who bottles up her feelings and has crippling anxiety at times, and my 13-year-old sister has been diagnosed as bipolar, but her therapist (who she's seen since age 7) has begun using DBT with her because she believes that she's a budding borderline. She and my mom have a disgustingly codependent relationship and seeing it in action daily is absolutely infuriating. I do not have friends here, as all the friends I had in high school have since moved away, and all of the friends I have from my work live near the facility. I do keep in touch with each of them regularly via texting/emailing, but it's just not the same as being able to escape and have that social, personal bonding. 

When I quit my f-t schedule, I had over $2000 saved up and had been fervently applying for jobs of all kinds--retail, food service, state, local, you name it--since January. I was confident that *some*thing would arise (I have plenty of retail experience, some of it supervisory, and I've never had a problem with any bosses so I didn't/don't foresee receiving a bad reference) and that I'd have enough money to be able to move out and cover those costs. However, my plan has not worked out as such. I have monthly payments to make, and this is the second month I'm having to make them without any substantial incoming cash flow--I pay my parents a small portion of rent, I pay for my phone, car insurance, then I have a credit card payment monthly, and two student loan payments to make. This past week I had an interview with a coffee shop about an hour away and it went wonderfully, but protocol demands all potential new hires have a second interview with the district manager before being officially hired. I am still waiting for a callback from the DM so I can get all of this in motion. 


Y'all, I feel like I'm drowning. My family is absolutely toxic. I have no social life, and I'm by nature a person who thrives being in the company of others. There aren't even coffee shops or bars where I live! I want--need--to move out of here to regain my independence and freedom from negativity. I feel like all of the progress I made after my hospitalization has been consistently dwindling since I moved back home a year ago. I think the last time I showered was on Wednesday before my interview and hygiene has always been a top priority for me (when I'm well). I can't stay here much longer. Yesterday I was truly suicidal for the first time since committing myself. I feel like I'm a waste of space, a do-nothing, and even though I've accomplished a lot, I feel like it's all been for nothing. I feel like these are the years when I should be thriving and independent, not unhappily living at home again without any sense of security. I'm so incredibly sad.


**TL;DR** Been diagnosed with depression since age 8. Found a great medication years ago and after a hospitalization, I learned new techniques to help me become more mindful, patient, calm, and peaceful. After graduating college a year ago, having to move back in with my toxic family, working at a job that makes me cringe at the mere thought of going to (and one of my coworkers, whom I thought was a friend, sexually assaulted me less than a month ago), not having a social life, and not having much luck in finding other employment that will help me escape living here any longer, I feel utterly hopeless. 

Thank you for taking the time out of your day to read this, /r/depression, and I'm sending my best to all of you out there who are also struggling to keep yourselves afloat."

My mother is terrible. She passive aggressively insults me constantly and trivializes my feelings. Today, for example, I said that I put air in her tires for her for free at the mechanic, and she said ""I guess having big boobs pays off!"" in a sarcastic way. Then told me I was an idiot when I said that was really inappropriate.
I have a square jaw, and so does she. She'll often point it out and call me ""jaw face"" in a mocking way, then tell me I need to take a joke when I say it hurts my feelings.

She constantly makes me feel guilty for any money she gives me, even if it is for medical things like dentist appointments, etc. She is paying for my university, which is cheaper because it's in Canada and we are originally Canadian so I get the Canadian rate. She consistently tells me I am draining her financially and any time I ask for something, she tells me to quit taking her money (my mother is a successful business woman who makes 230,000 plus bonuses a year. She's not loaded, but money shouldn't be a huge issue for her). 

I am home from school for the summer, working 45 hours a week on a commission at a high-end store. I have always made all of my own doctors' appointments, paid for my own clothing and make up since age 16, pay my internet/water/electricity at school (voluntarily), and go to one of the top schools in the world. Yet she has never once told me she's proud of me, or that I am accomplished. Instead, she focuses on the things I do ask for, such as tuition, the odd thing like boots or a coat, and basic necessities at school.

I suffer from low self-esteem and anxiety. Today, I told my mother I was upset because I have been having trouble sleeping since I got home. She asked me what my problem was. I read her a list of things that were worrying me (looking for support and reassurance, I was at the point of tears). She interrupted me and began yelling that I wasn't going to make it in life if I got so worried about stupid things, (she was literally yelling), and told me I was a pain in the ass and not to bother her. When I became more upset and began to cry, she told me to get out of the room. That's when I suddenly had a panic attack and had to rush out of the house and onto the porch, where I curled up in a ball until I recovered.

She did not come out to check on me. When I came back in, she told me the eye doctor was charging too much for my appointment back in January, and she needed me to drive there and get a printed receipt. ""Add it to your list of things to do,"" she said, despite the fact that the WHOLE reason I had previously been upset was that I was overwhelmed (I am moving to NYC to do an internship in mid June, and because I am working so much, it is difficult to get anything done. I am paying my own rent/living expenses in NYC, so I am concerned about saving enough money, adding to my stressors).

I am beginning to hate her. I feel awful saying it, but I really despise her. She is not a mother, she is a woman who does nothing but mock me, yell at me, and make me feel worthless. Is she narcissistic? What should I do, since I have one more year of college and still partly depend on her? Help! I have been feeling almost suicidal since coming home. I am so miserable. I have no privacy here and I am only spoken to when it is to ask a favour or criticize. "

I stumbled upon fitness while searching aimlessly for a fitness plan that fits me. I'm starting summer break and made the decision not to leave town for this internship so that I can focus on my health and fitness.

I proved to myself that I want to do this this past week by going to the gym 5 days last week for two hours. I've been following my brother's lead, doing all the muscle groups over the week, ending with cardio on Saturday. But I want something a little more measured.

My workout schedule to give everyone an idea:

Monday- Chest and Back
Tuesday- Legs and Abs
Wednesday- Biceps and Triceps (and forearms)
Thursday- break
Friday- Traps, Delts
Saturday- Cardio

Basically I'm looking for a place where I can find a workout routine that complements what I currently do (the muscle groups I do each day, the amount of time I do each day) but with a better measure of results.

Would maybe doing a preliminary fitness test be a good idea? To figure out my bases and my limits? (I'd love to know my starting strength, starting weight, recommended daily calorie intake, and the base weights I should use for each workout. Something a little less trial and error.)

I'm lost but I hope you all can help!!"

We live about 40 mins away from each other at home and go to unis about 2 hours apart. However, she's doing a degree that means she has to go abroad for the next year.

She's been away for the past month, living and working with a group of about 15 other interns. It's about 7 hours travel to where she is and pretty expensive, but I have managed to get out at visit her once so far.

The problem is that i'm still stuck at uni studying for exams and can't stop thinking about her and wanting to talk to her (when shes at home we talk everyday) 

I understand that she's busy, but she just doesn't seem to be thinking about me or missing me the same way i am with her. When I call, she pushes me off the phone after about 5 minutes of conversation and it just feels like she's pushing me away. We're going to be on different continents for 4 months this summer and although she said she's completely committed and wants to make this work, I feel like we've lost some of our connection.

I want to still feel close to her without being needy or obsessive, I know she loves me, but I'm just feeling a bit neglected atm.

I still like her very much.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/25w11d/i_23_m_went_to_a_concert_and_a_few_dates_with_l/,"Hi Reddit! Long time reader, but first time posting to /r/Relationships.

I volunteer at a group that helps feed the homeless, and about a year ago, a great girl friend of mine - let’s call her A - brought along a good friend of hers - let’s call her L. L started volunteering too, and she and I started talking quite frequently, and became “friends.” A short time after meeting her, she told me that she liked a particular (extremely well known) singer. I found out that he was coming to a town about three hours away, and told her if she wanted to go with me; she said YES! I was ecstatic.

We had about three months until the show, so we got together a few times to buy the tickets online, book the van that would take us to the venue, etc. I finally mustered the courage to ask her out for a few drinks and dinner - under the pretense of organizing our day trip to the venue - and she agreed. Well, I would say that these “dates” didn’t really go great. It was a bit awkward, no kiss or close contact of any kind. **But if there is one thing I can tell you, Reddit, is that I was crazy about her.**

One particular weekend, the whole group where I volunteer went to a party, and L and A were there. I left a bit early, and the following day, my best friend (M) told me that L’s best friend (A) had told her girlfriends (who are part of the group) that I fancied L. She mentioned that I had asked her out several times, and that she wasn’t interested. As you can imagine, this was a huge blow. I was hurt because I really liked L, and because I felt A had betrayed me - what right did she have to tell the whole group what was between L and I. I felt humiliated. Up to this day, I am still good friends with A. She doesn’t know that I know what she said, and we regularly go to dinner with a small group, etc. Should I have told her what I heard? I don’t know. But honestly, I think that if I never mention it to her, it will always be on the back of my mind.

I decided to try and not let what people had said influence me, and to play it like I knew nothing at all about what A had said.

So, show weekend came around. Since she really liked this artist, I decided to surprise her. I drove for eight hours and got us tickets in the first row! (YAY) I put them in an envelope with her name on it, and only showed it to her once we were on the way to the venue. Overall, the I had an amazing time on the trip. She was friendly, sweet, and we got along great.

Once we came back, however, things started going south again. I invited her out a few times, and she would always have something else to do, couldn’t make it, etc. And a couple of days later, I went on a trip with my family for a few weeks. Just before I came back to my home town, she went on a trip with her family too, and things cooled off. She stopped volunteering at our group, and - except for a short Whatsapp conversation on my birthday, the messaging stopped.

I was devastated. I should point out that, despite being 23, one would say that I have little experience with girls. It may be that I am shy, or that I don’t drink, or a combination of both - but that’s neither here nor there. Anyhow, it took a few months, but I was finally OK with myself again. It still hurt when somebody would mention her, or the guys (who don’t know I fancied her) talked about her, but I managed to go about my life alright.

Fast forward about three months with barely any contact, I got an internship at a tech company that would require me to live in another town (the same town of the concert) during the weekdays. Out of the blue, I got a Whatsapp message from L on Saturday’s evening saying she was just talking to a friend about the show, and that she felt reminiscent. She mentioned nothing about the internship, but I suspect A (our mutual friend) told her about it. Anyway, we messaged back and forth for a little while, and then I had to leave to go to a birthday party.

Being honest, this stirred up a lot of old feelings. Should I text her now? Am I being weak? Should I ask her out again? I don’t know, Reddit. I believe that, thinking critically, I should not, but I can’t help but think “what if.” I am still crazy about her.

What should I do? Pursue her again, or try to move forward?

**TL;DR**: I met a girl, asked her out, and went to a concert together. Went on a few awkward dates, but her best friend told our group that I had asked her out several times and that she was not interested. Now she contacted me again, and it stirred up a lot of old feelings. I am definitely not over her, and I still like her. What should I do?

25w8g9,267,2014-05-18,I (21 F) broke up with my abusive ex-boyfriend (22 M) over a year ago. Today he contacts me and is threatening to put our sex video from when I just turned 18 on the internet. HELP!,hellakitty92,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/25w8g9/i_21_f_broke_up_with_my_abusive_exboyfriend_22_m/,"To clarify, I am in my third year at our university while my ex is in his final year here. A little over a year ago, I broke up with my then boyfriend of four years because he was abusive and I needed out. Also, him taking another girl to his fraternity formal over me but still expecting us to be in a girlfriend and boyfriend relationship after also put me over the edge This was actually his second time doing it. The first time, I was going absolutely crazy on the patch for of birth control, and I decided to stop taking it because I was feeling depressed and seriously crazy. Because I stopped it abruptly, he yelled at me for risking being pregnant since we had sex three days before I pulled it off, and took another girl to his fraternity formal (this happened four days before his formal too). These two instances are two completely different stories and I'm over it, but I'm going to give as much detail as I can about this relationship. So before I get to my current problem, let me explain why breaking up with him was probably the best decision I have made. 

Our relationship was both emotionally and physically abusive on both ends. He would lash out at me for not telling him about my past relationships when we were not together and would call me really mean things. He would also yell at me whenever he was drunk and would accuse me of cheating even when I did not go out and have always been faithful. He actually cheated on me during my freshman year of college, but again that's a different story and I am over it. Even after that incident, he always checked out other girls in front of me, and just make me feel inadequate (he would tell me to lose weight all the time, or ask why I couldn't look more like someone else). In response to most of his abuses, usually I would just put my head in a pillow and cry or sleep and ignore him; but when it got really bad, I would hit him and scratch him when he would not stop (he would call me names and yell at me when all I wanted was to be left alone). He would hit me back and bruise me as well, but I used to think everything was completely my fault. 

Because of my guilt of hooking up with people during one of our breaks, I let him do anything to me. The worst was when he let one of his fraternity brothers have sex with me while I was drunk even when I did not say yes (in fact, I actually said no) because he wanted to see me get touched in the way someone else touched me when we were on a break. Yes, I understand that was rape. I reported it to our Sexual Assault group in our university after I broke up with him. I did not press any charges because that was so traumatic and I didn't want to deal with it because it was just so hurtful. But I do have the option of getting a school restraining order in which he would not be able to contact me in fear of getting kicked out. So I guess I have that going for me.

Fast forward to the present, and I am the happiest I have ever been in my entire life. I had counseling sessions, got an emotional support animal, my grades are better, I am more social, I go out without any fear of being yelled at, I've scored more internships, and I have been dating the absolute best boyfriend I have ever had for the past six months (honestly, if he isn't the one, I don't know who is - I've never felt this way about anyone in my life!). Basically, I turned my life around. However, my ex is not in the same boat. He is graduating and for the past year has been texting me that he is depressed. I used to text back and tell him everything will be okay and he can get over me, but he always became abusive and would start calling me names. He is very jealous of my life and happiness, he even tries to make fun of my boyfriend. In fact, he once saw us together, flipped out, and texted me mean things about him that were just so childish. So I have been ignoring him for the most part for the past 6 months, and I blocked his texts and phone calls for the past 4 months. 

Last night, I saw his name pop up on my screen for my phone. Both my boyfriend and I saw it, but the call blocker (This blocker is called ""Dead 2 Me"") ignored it as expected. However, I get two unknown calls within the hour after he called me. This was late at night and it is always typical for him to abusively call me when he is drunk. He also left two messages. The first message told me I should feel guilty for giving him a few scars on his arm that were permanent. I am not proud of that AT ALL (my ex knows this), and it really hurts me that he brings it up as a weapon. I do not think being physically abusive is justifiable in any way, but the biggest scar I gave him was when he told me it was my fault his fraternity bro had sex with me. I bring this up only to describe how much abuse I took before I fought back. However, the second message is much worse. He brought up a sex video we made when I was 18 and he was 19. His friend recorded it, and in our years together he told me he destroyed the video. Still, he told me he had it and would put it online if I did not talk to him in 24 hours. I freaked out this morning when I heard the messages, and in panic I deleted it permanently (I tried to go back and recover it to no avail). I hate dealing with my ex because of the memories of abuse, and I just did not want to deal with this again. I told my best friend over the phone and then I woke up my boyfriend and cried hysterically while telling him everything. Thank God he was so understanding. 

Later in the day, I make my best friend who I told text him to tell him i would tell the university that he was harassing me and that I could get a restraining order that could get him kicked out of school if he tried this again. My ex responds to her ""Sorry. It won't happen again.""

I am contemplating telling the school still, but the quarter is almost done and I am more worried about midterms and what not. Telling the school takes so much time and effort so I don't know if I should go through with it; I hate re-opening that part of my life because it brings back so many depressing memories. I also do not know if he will threaten me again with that sex video. If he has it, I do not know how to go about making him destroy it or if I have any rights to it. It is so embarrassing, and i do not want my reputation to be hurt in any way from a stupid mistake I made when I JUST turned 18. I guess this also goes toward anything else that can be incriminatory, since I know he tried to spread rumors about me in the sorority I just joined (and sadly, some of the girls who are his friends took his side even though they do not know of what he did to me). So reddit, I don't know of the best way to go about this. Tell our university and go through a process of bringing back memories and have many meetings that will take time out of school and work, or just ignore him as I have been doing and hope for the best unless he tries to talk to me again. I don't want to be bothered by this anymore.

---   
**tl;dr**: My abusive ex boyfriend left a voice mail saying he would put our sex video we made when I was 18 and he was 19 online. I want to make sure I won't get hurt.

I'm looking for some guidance choosing a lifting program for the summer.

My goals are to add 5-10lbs of muscle, while cutting down to about 8% bf. To keep my bf low, I plan on adhering to some version of the leangains program; however, I am not sure what weightlifting routine to use.

Also, this summer I have an investment banking internship lined up and I anticipate working roughly 80 hours a week based on estimates of what current employees said past interns usually work, so I'm going to have limited free time for the next 2.5 months.


Some things about me:

I'm a 21yr old male college student 
5' 10"" 
150lbs 
Roughly 10-12% body fat 
Bench (3x5): 145lbs 
Deadlift (1x5): 255lbs 
Squat (3x5): 185lbs 
Press (3x5): 100lbs

Tried SS about 3 months ago, but tweaked my back deadlifting 2 months into it, so I've been chilling for about a month now to let it heal. Going forward, I want something where I'm doing more than just 5 reps per set.

I used to be a D1 athlete before my school cut my team after my sophomore year--never really had a solid lifting routine then either bc of constant coaching changes. Looking to start changing that now.

I'm thinking about the AllPro Beginner Routine, but I'm not sure. I would really appreciate some suggestions!! Thanks

TL;DR - Working 80hrs a week this summer, need suggestion for workout routine that is short-ish and intense to help build muscle"

I've been posting a bit the last week, and just wanted to formally re-introduce myself... I used to be very active on the Plounge, but have been mostly away for a fairly long time, more than half a year... I still see a few familiar names, but I also see a ton of new people! ^(Hey new people! &lt;3)

[](/sp)

[](/dwspace) Pretty much, I've been super busy interning at NASA, while concurrently taking a few online classes ^(because who needs sleep!)

At first, it was only going to be for Fall... then they offered to keep me for Spring... then tomorrow, I'm actually starting a third internship for Summer. I guess I must be doing a pretty good job q: ^(Also they're going to have to hit me with a stick to make me leave!)

But anyyyways, my classes are over, so although I'm still going to be interning this summer, I'm going to try to be more active here again.

[](/sp)

[](/vsspace) For those who don't know me.... as my name might suggest, I looove space. ^(That's an understatement) 

I love collecting stuff, like [space shuttle hardware](http://imgur.com/a/fFh7h), [space suit components](http://i.imgur.com/QqJaNSJ.jpg), and [pilot gear](http://www.reddit.com/r/MLPLounge/comments/1hcawi/). I love ~~preaching to~~ teaching [kids about NASA and spaceflight](http://i.imgur.com/OJ0E4Gg.jpg). I love playing dress up, whether as an [astronaut pilot](http://i.imgur.com/i65pYzw.jpg?1), a [moonwalker](http://i.imgur.com/fWGUlNF.jpg), or as [some crazy adventurer](http://i.imgur.com/ntDZpeQ.jpg) ^(please forgive me for the fedora q:)  

And I also used to do a ton of [embroidery](http://www.reddit.com/r/MLPLounge/comments/17wunb/i_think_i_just_won_the_game/) ^(sorry if I've been too busy to make anything for anyone who's asked &lt;/3)

**So, what's NASA like?!**

[](/sp)

[](/dashieglee) Well, the past 8 months have been incredible. I've seen plenty of [cool stuff](http://i.imgur.com/PixizZf.jpg), met a number of [cool people](http://i.imgur.com/78vjVvm.jpg), and got to do some [pretty cool things](http://i.imgur.com/jGeneG5.jpg)...

Whether it be [sitting in a space shuttle cockpit](http://i.imgur.com/UDOHURp.jpg), checking out a [freakishly large](http://i.imgur.com/SWQdFTS.jpg) airplane (and some of it's [smaller brothers](http://i.imgur.com/GgN9aB4.jpg)), playing with a [space station hatch](http://i.imgur.com/iAXuapt.jpg) and [robotic arm controls](http://i.imgur.com/pwM5EAc.jpg) inside a training mockup of [the international space station](http://i.imgur.com/uYWx8Cz.jpg), learning about [space suits](http://i.imgur.com/NXUNdRW.jpg), watching [astronauts train](http://i.imgur.com/aWv3jS7.jpg) inside a giant swimming pool, getting a [3D scan](http://i.imgur.com/vqOH7Bl.jpg) of myself ^(they didn't let me keep it &lt;/3), or [partying with a bunch of astronauts](http://i.imgur.com/cYTED2h.jpg) at a celebration.

[](/nerdtwi) I met a lot of [super cool kids](http://i.imgur.com/dnqCpQ1.jpg) too at a bunch of different schools, while spreading the word about space. I helped [set up the testing field](http://i.imgur.com/w2UblWj.jpg) for the Morpheus lander test vehicle (rocket engines [are very loud!](http://i.imgur.com/ZOCx7pm.jpg)). But most importantly...

[](/sp)

[](/derpycam) NASA also let me have a pretty cool [professional portrait](http://i.imgur.com/Q5VZAdf.jpg), which was nice &lt;3 Though, for some reason their official photographers also decided to photograph me [eating lunch](http://i.imgur.com/gAYqe2v.jpg), staring [at wildlife](http://i.imgur.com/bLSLs9t.jpg) (which made its way [on Instagram](http://instagram.com/p/k2Qx5ZqpCC/) o.O), and [watching a lecture](http://i.imgur.com/CZ5Mcp1.jpg) (That elbow that's just out of frame is the deputy director of the Johnson Space Center...

I'm about to fail my operating systems class after dropping with a W another CS class.

I have two tabs of github and google code with other students implementation Nachos (an academic OS for students learning operating systems). In other words, I'm cheating because I procrastinated continuously this past week. I really have no excuse other than sheer apathy, laziness. I would continuously open up reddit when I knew I had to start my assignments. Very poor self control.

I'm stuck in a rut. In previous quarters I've worked very hard on my assignments with no cheating and I've done well. I didn't get straight As but I felt decent. The classes were challenging (for example, Computer Architecture, discrete math, accelerated intro to Java and some GE) and I studied and finished my assignments early. Barely had any time to even fap, lol. 

I did really badly this quarter. If I withdraw from this class, I'd be only taking 1 course, an econ class. But I did have some extenuating factors like, I work at my internship/coop where I program stuff for my bosses. It's only 10 hours a week but they take up two of my afternoons, sometimes on weekends. I feel satisfied with my work there and I think my bosses feel the same. I've been working with a friend programming a robot for a competition where we placed 3rd out of 27 teams. I don't want to make it seem like I'm rationalizing my failure because I did browse reddit extensively in my 'free time' which was still quite a bit of time. 

Is this what burning out is? I just stopped caring about my classes, missing lectures despite pop quizzes, doing shitty on my midterm and not starting early. Maybe because of my hubris because of my internship and sideproject? Idk I don't think I'm that type of person.

Anyway, I will be a 5th year soon and will likely need two more quarters. I need to hear it, whatever tough love or hate or just ignore me. How do I care again? How do I get my self control back?"

Our main guy working on this stuff didn't leave very much documentation behind after he left, and I have been trying to reverse engineer everything after encountering an error while imaging our machines. I have almost zero experience with this stuff, but I have been researching for about a month now. Don't be afraid to get technical, but I may ask for clarification if I do not fully understand. I'm just an intern, forgive my ignorance.

**Problem**

I am using Microsoft Deployment Workbench. The OS was imported as a custom WIM and I created a task sequence for it that specifies our MAK. It is now on our WDS server, but after the machine downloads the image and begins running the setup I receive this error shortly after:

&gt; *Windows Install*
&gt; 
&gt; *Windows could not parse or process unattended answer file [C:\windows\Panther\unattend.xml] for pass [specialize]. A component or setting specified in the answer file does not exist.*

After clicking ""ok"" it repeatedly boots and fails over and over with the same or similar message. This is so strange. My previous test worked perfectly. The only difference is that the test image only had windows updates on it. The image I currently have has everything our company requires as a standard for each client. The default unattend.xml has not been changed in any way other than specifying the local admin account that pulls from our group policy after joining the domain. That way, our techs can easily make changes to the image before deploying the machine to the end user. This setup worked before with the test image, it logged in as local admin and reported a successful deployment.

If anyone can help me, I will be eternally grateful. I have been pulling my hair out trying to get this far. After my test image was successful, I was certain that the master image was going to work.

25wq1h,4,2014-05-18,Possible Thyroid Cancer,umainebeast,cancer,https://www.reddit.com/r/cancer/comments/25wq1h/possible_thyroid_cancer/,"Hi guys, I felt like getting this off my chest to someone other than my immediate family and friends. It's a different kind of camaraderie, and less personal. I haven't even been diagnosed yet and I'm being smothered! I'll start with a little bit of background.

In October of last year, I was walking to my car at the University and I noticed that the ground was swelling up to me in waves. Like, I was on a boat in the middle of a Nor’easter; I had to sit on the sidewalk until it passed. I had been having trouble focusing with my right eye for a few days but I wrote it off as my contacts being an old prescription. I went to my eye doctor and he dilated my eye, took a peek around in there and found nothing. He decided on a whim to check my blood pressure and it was 148/98, definitely high for a 21 year old male in excellent shape. I ran 5k's, lifted, ate well, just a normal active person. I saw my family doctor, a nurse practioner. (This is important for later, maybe) She prescribed me beta blockers, propranolol and subjected me to battery of adrenal tests, looking for a root cause. They screened me for renal disease, blockages in my aorta, pheochromocytoma, and a complete panel blood test/ urine test and everything was negative. It was a huge relief. I just needed to manage symptoms and get back to my active lifestyle. 

After a few weeks I was lethargic, and I had no appetite. Some days would be great, others not so much. In February of this year I had my first event. I felt a pinching in my right leg and I had facial palsy and a galloping heartbeat. It subsided within thirty minutes. It was accompanied with syncope and shortness of breath. I wrote it off as heat stress, as I was working in a mill environment on internship and the conditions on the floor are not great. Then I had another, worse. I should have gone to the ER but I’m stubborn. I had been prescribed an automated cuff to track my BP and checked it. 165/125, it was a hypertensive emergency. It also displayed arrhythmia. My doctor sent me to the cardiologist following that event, and I had an echocardiogram of my heart, as well as an EKG. I also had an ultrasound of my leg looking for clots and an angiogram of my brain due to the facial palsy.

The cardiologist put me on a 3 day Holter monitor, and it showed pretty intense heartblock. This was around the time that Lyme disease was thrown around. A symptom of Lyme disease is heart block, so the propranolol was discontinued. I immediately felt more energetic, but my symptoms weren’t completely abated. I continued on, not really finding out much for the next month or so, and losing about 20 pounds.

In early May I was driving home and noticed a swelling between my Adam’s apple and collarbone on the right side of my throat. I called my doctor and there was an immediate ultrasound scheduled, without even seeing her. It took over a week to schedule and in that time, I began feeling it push on the structures of my throat. I have pain in my right ear, a cough, hoarseness, and shortness of breath. For about a month I've had pain with every breath in the right side of my chest, almost like I have bronchitis, but I don't know if it's related. It’s getting worse by the day. They found a mass in my thyroid that was 25 x 26 x 38 mm. A FNAB was performed and I got a call that the mass was benign. A lobectomy was recommended. After a day had passed, and I had celebrated, the hospital called again and told me a second pathologist was called in due to the first pathologist being unsure, and they found “atypical cells” throughout the sample. They said that cancer was 40% likely and recommended an immediate iodine uptake, which will be performed this week. A surgical consult was also hired, which seems to me that I’ll have surgery before the month is out, at least a lobectomy, perhaps a complete thyroidectomy.

So in summary, I was first diagnosed with chronic high blood pressure. Then they thought that there was adrenal dysfunction. Then blood clots. Then it was neurological/ lyme disease. Now I think that the thyroid could have been the problem all along. I don’t know if it’s a combination of inexperience and misdiagnosis or incompetence as a nurse practitioner. I see the good in people and want to think it’s the former.

If this does turn out to be cancer, I hope I can learn from some of you that have gone through this ordeal. Should I be eager to get a second opinion? Should I actually get a doctor with experience instead of a CNP? Should I be more aggressive in asking the doctor’s for procedures? If it was up to me this growth would be gone already. How do I even set up a team of specialists and oncologists? Is there support groups? I want to become better prepared in case it’s something bad. It feels like I'm in a dream. I've never had health issues like this and it's almost too much. Thank you for your opinions and enduring this wall of text. I encourage you to ask questions and I apologize if I missed anything.

There’s even a theory that Kevin could be Cecil’s forgotten brother. It does make sense.

But I’ve been thinking, and I feel it goes much deeper than that.

In “Cassette,” young Cecil says that his mother warns him not to look in mirrors, because “Someday someone will kill you, and it will involve a mirror.” She goes so far as to cover every reflective surface in the house, and hide from Cecil for three days. He also mentions that his brother doesn’t like the idea of him going into radio, saying he “doesn’t have the right voice for it.” Later on, after Cecil reports getting the internship for Leonard Burton at the station, his brother glares at him with hollow eyes across the breakfast table and howls.

WHAT IF Kevin wanted to become a radio show host and eventual replacement for Leonard, but knew from the tablets down at city hall that his brother would be taking the spot, making him angry and jealous and perhaps a tad malicious?

WHAT IF Kevin was the noise and shadow haunting Cecil during his practice recordings, because he wanted to get back at the younger teenager for taking the job he wanted?

WHAT IF Kevin had the ability to move through mirrors and kill? It’s not so far out there. If he can be totally comfortable with murder and blood, it’s possible he could have ways of fulfilling his sick pleasures.

WHAT IF that’s why their mother warned him about mirrors and hid when she felt danger lurking? She probably knew what evil and demented things her other son was capable of, and wanted to keep the other boy safe.

WHAT IF Kevin attacked and nearly killed Cecil at the end of the recordings, and for some reason, didn’t succeed? What if instead of being locked up, the Sheriff’s Secret Police just sent the boy to Desert Bluffs, where he became the eventual host of Welcome to Desert Bluffs? And the City Council just erased Cecil’s memories to make it easier for him to fulfill the prophecy as the future Voice of Night Vale without any complications. It would explain why Cecil had this seemingly irrational hatred of the town, despite never visiting it. It also explains Kevin’s insistence to make listeners forget about the former host when he and Lauren take over the show in episode 47. "

I'm an eighteen year old male from the Netherlands, currently studying IT in an Univesity of Applied Sciences since February. English isn't my first language so mind me if I make any mistakes.

Firstly, since Decembre I've felt more and more anxious. I've always been a bit of a person that worries about a lot and possibly too much but the last half year I've noticed and thereby increasing. At the end of Septembre I finished a study IT Management at a Vocational Education which I started at age fifteen. Since internship ended too late I couldn't start at university on time which in return kept me at home from Septembre to January. Since I was seventeen at the time it wasn't as easy to find a job so I spent that time sitting at home behind the computer. 

Part of the problem is possibly that I've done everything well at my education including the Vocational Education. I've barely studied until this point and even though I have no problems taking time to study, I've never had to work that much to make any accomplishments and that doesn't help right now. Since I started this study I've been more and more worried that I'll fail and disappoint not only my parents but the majority of my family as well.  The classes I have are mostly practical lessons and I get fine by some, but I'm struggling with others.  

Adding to that, I'm part of a triplet with two sisters and they're struggling with dyslexia and the youngest one has autism (not informed too much about it, would go in more detail if I could) and I've been told that my parents don't worry as much how I'll end up compared to them, unknowingly giving me more things to worry and think about.

The second part of my worries is adultery. Now that I've become eighteen this year and from then on I've had some questions and worries added along. While my parents take care with financial support I keep worrying about when I'll be ""grown up"" and if my burden upon my. I feel like I'm not mature at all while I'm no way anything close to mature. I won't have to move out until I have a steady income high enough to afford a good appartment and the other costs, so fortunately that's not a worry.

tl;dr; I'm constantly stressed, worked up about my current studies,  when I'll ""growing up"" and disappointing the ones I care about."

I [m/21] have been dating my SO [f/19] for a little over 6 months. We quickly fell madly in love and are each other's soulmates. On May 8th I had to leave her behind for my 12 week internship abroad. This is our first time being apart for more than 3 days and my first LDR. Although I bawled most of the drive to the airport, I had been feeling okay up until today. I think the honeymoon phase of being in an exciting new place is starting to wear off. I had a hard time focusing in class today (I have 2 weeks of language class before my job starts), and as soon as I got back to my apartment I laid down in bed. I looked up songs to listen to when you're missing someone, and came across ""Transatlanticism"" by Death Cab For Cutie. It helped get my tears flowing and I was able to let everything out. 

So, r/longdistance, what are your go-to songs when you feel like crying from missing your SO?

TL;DR - I'm new to this subreddit and experiencing an LDR for the first time. What can I listen to when I'm missing my SO and want to let out some tears?"

Here's a little background on myself. 

I'm currently a grade 11 high school student in Ontario. I've decided that the best university for me to go to, is Waterloo as it's CS program as well as co-op program is one of the best in Canada! I've looked at what it takes to get in, and since my marks aren't too bad, nor excellent, I want to do more extra curricular's for the summer. 

I have come up with 3 options.

1) Going through with Summer Company (a program which allows you to start basically a risk free business by giving a small grant, and I'll try to make some applications as my business)

2) Doing a web dev job where I basically use wordpress to construct the site

3) Finding an internship somewhere in the GTA at a software development company where I can hopefully learn and help develop applications for them. (Doesn't have to be paid)

The problem with the 1st and 3rd option, is that I can't figure out how to go about it. For the Summer Company program, I can't think of many applications which will be good enough to sell to the public, because I'm not that experienced and I don't have enough time. 

Regarding the third option, I'm having trouble finding a tech company which would take high school students.

Please help me prioritize what I should try to do out of those couple options or any others that you may have.

Thanks for reading!

25xwoz,285,2014-05-19,"Mom unhappy about my graduation ceremony and (originally planned) graduation party is canceled because ""she never had anything like that when she was my age""",JenLakerFan,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/25xwoz/mom_unhappy_about_my_graduation_ceremony_and/,"Err.. here I go with a lovely rant. Sorry.

I had my graduation ceremony this past Saturday. I got my BA in Communications (WOOHOO!). Quite an amazing day despite the heat outside. I was looking forward to this day, mostly due to how I'd get to sit with one of my best friends and just enjoy the festivities altogether.

My parents were ehh about the ceremony. My mom, who is definitely an Nmom, especially didn't want to go. They went anyway because they felt they were ""obligated"" to since they're my parents. My mom believed me having a graduation ceremony was ""unnecessary"" because she never had anything like that when she was my age.

She was barely an immigrant to the U.S. around then and had other things to straighten out in life that didn't involve education (aside from taking ESL courses). I understand this... and there's many people out there who have been (or are) in this position. But she always blames me for that happening. It's my fault that she never got a proper education in America. It's my fault she didn't know English too well and had to take ESL classes. And... I didn't even come into the picture until several years later.

The entire ceremony, she (and dad) had this dull look on their faces. They looked pretty frustrated. When my name was called and I shook the Dean's hand, it was just my friend and my brother cheering and yelling in the stands. My parents just sat there stone-faced. Not surprised, really. They had always been crummy about my accomplishments, so I learned to hide stuff from them -- but who the heck could hide achieving a college degree?

Our family friends had been planning a graduation party for me and another fellow grad in the circle for weeks, but my mom kept pushing for it to get canceled because she felt I didn't need one. She didn't even think about the other girl whom the party was for as well. After weeks of learning the party would be on..then off...then on again, it's now been permanently canceled. I really do hope that other girl gets a party or something though, because it'd be messed up if she doesn't AT ALL just because of my situation.

My mom tried to ""cheer me up"" last night about the cancelation, saying we'll go somewhere nice as a family instead, like Santa Monica Pier or something *rolls eyes*

It's not going to happen. Sounds like great plans, but she does this so much every time she takes away something from me, and when the day comes, we don't go anywhere. And when I ask about it, I'd be told ""What do you want? Why do you want to go there? There's nothing there.""

YOU JUST PLANNED FOR US ALL TO GO THERE JUST DAYS AGO!

I'm so tired of this way of thinking my mom has. I'm glad I'm taking this cancelation better than I would have months ago... for one, I'm not surprised (unfortunately)... and two -- it should be more fun to go somewhere without the parents and celebrate my graduation that way.

But this way of thinking is always going to be around with my mom. Everything is ""I didn't have that when I was your age, so why should you? That's unfair.""

I thought parents are supposed to want the best for their kids? For their kids to have a better life than them (all while still wisely taking care of themselves too, of course)? It's crazy how long this has gone on for, and it's only gotten worse since I finished college.

It leaves me thinking I have to baby her all the time, but I usually don't know what to do. 90% of the time, I feel as though I'm not taking care of myself as much or focusing on my life plans/goals much; the thought of trying to make sure my mom doesn't spazz out is usually in the back of my mind. I guess... no matter what I do or say, she'll spazz out anyway.

She likes to compete against me. Spreads rumors about me at her work to make herself look better. She was upset that she didn't get to go to work on Saturday because of the ceremony, even though she had the option to not go anyway. But going back to the ""obligation to go,"" she thinks nothing is fair when you're a parent. She claims her life had been complete shit ever since I came into the picture, and believes I owe her (a lot of money) for having been around.

Well, I'm sorry to break it to you, but... I didn't ask to be born.

I remember as a kid, she used to threaten to put me up for adoption. Or drop me off at the police station so they could deal with me (for being a ""bad child""). I wish she had done either of those things.

I'm about to head off to work now. It's always a long drive for me (2 hours to and from), but I enjoy it because it gives me a peaceful mind knowing I'm away from the house for a bit.

It's an internship, to be exact, so the pay isn't enough to move out with, but it could turn into a full-time job so I hope I get it after the internship period is over so I can get out of this house.

Sorry for the rant :("

I did not know where to ask this question so I chose CSCareer forum because it is related to leading healthy, strong career in IT.

As you probably are all familiar, sitting for hours and eating nachos with coffee as food is not good for you in the long term. I will start working at my internship and decided to take some kind of action over the summer. I decided to start working out, eat a lot of healthy meals, around 3k calories each day, 6 meals a day. At work, we have microwave and electric stove. I know that I won't have time to prepare foods from scratch, this is why I will bring prepared food to the work.

My question is how do you keep yourself fit and healthy because in my opinion, I function a lot better mentally after a run or some physical activity.

Even though this question is not about jobs, in my opinion, it is very important for healthy career."

I'm kind of freaking out that I put this off for so long and I feel like I'm stuck in the mud and have no idea what to do.

I am a recent college graduate that has obtained two B.B.A.'s.  One in Management, and the other in Marketing.  

I am finding it incredibly difficult to land that entry level job in the marketing industry.  I have tried to reach out and talk to some alumni in my area, but they either never respond or offer poor advice such as contacting other alumni or emailing people.  I have been trying to email businesses and other contacts but it leads to dead ends or no responses.

I am constantly on Indeed.com searching in my city, as well as other cities for marketing positions but I cannot find any relevant jobs that are not either shady or pure sales.  I am not opposed to sales but some of these jobs are 100% commission with zero work life balance.  Also any of the jobs I have applied for I never get, or very rarely get a phone interview which I do well on but for some reason never make it onto the next step (these are usually for social media positions).I have a professional website and twitter as well.

I have applied to a broad range of marketing jobs, but usually not sales jobs unless I view the company as stable and ethical.  I also try to apply for social media jobs as well.  I have 2 1/2 years experience being an accounting intern and 1 1/2 year of being a public relations intern.  I also have 7 years of leadership experience, and I have had friends and others view my resume and it appears to be pretty good.

Sorry for the wall of text I am just really frustrated as I have been applying and looking for jobs since January.  Does anyone have some advice to perhaps further help what I am already doing, or something I should do better?"
25y4vr,3,2014-05-19,How much is too much?,nalgenethis,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/25y4vr/how_much_is_too_much/,"Hello all,


I'm 29/m, and my awesome gf is 26/f.  We met a year ago in a very romantic way.  In short, we barely knew each other but hit it off and whimsically booked plane tickets to Indonesia together, after which we got to know each other much more, then we fell in love while overseas.  Upon returning back home, our living situation was a bit atypical: she was transitioning careers (had given up her research position at an Ivy League lab), and I was doing a summer research internship elsewhere.  Since she was now (deliberately) unemployed and was just going to teach herself necessary knowledge as she applied for jobs in her new field and thus had freedom to live wherever, we immediately decided to move-in together during my out-of-state summer job, and afterwards when I returned back to school.  This lasted for 6 months and went great between us, but she was often bored, lonely at home while I worked, and at times battled severe depression.


She landed a good job out-of-state in January.  I've made enormous attempts to be there for her, as she struggles with stresses of the job, family, and other stresses.  She became suicidal.  I interrupted school for (7) 1-week trips during the semester to see her and to try to help put her back together.  Around March, as she was suicidal, she surprisingly decided to take a break from our relationship and broke up with me (for no tangible reasons that she could pinpoint about me).  That didn't last long, and we've been back together ever since.


 She saw a psychologist and psychiatrist for a while, but stopped and is handling depression is much better now; when I visit her, it's like she's her original self and there is no sadness.  It's only when I'm in my normal, out-of-state home away from her that she's struggling.  The reality is her job does suck in that it's way too demanding and she just handles stress very poorly. She truly deserves a less-demanding job, and it's over-working her big-time.  Plus, the town she's in is tiny and depressing for her (it would be for me, too).  So, she wants to quit the job and accept a new job in my city, which is great for our relationship; however, we both know that long-term, she shouldn't live up north with me because the cold winters negatively affect her mood.  So, ideally, she should move to FL or CA, and when I'm done with school, I move to be with her (which I'd be happy to do).


So, here's the deal: although she isn't suicidal, her general mood is often very sad.  It's not bipolar, but it nearly is.  She's happy each day, but she misses me like crazy but almost every single day she gets really down for at least one of these:

* job

* family stress

* physical issues (her stomach and vagina have both been occasionally giving her problems for months, dr appts are scheduled but 1 month away).

* roommates (pretty unhealthy, dramatic situation that her roommates are in with each other; she's not involved)

* missing me


I've been essentially a caregiver for the vast majority of our relationship.  I'm always taking care of her (e.g., calling appointments, handling logistics for her, driving her everywhere when I'm in town, cooking every meal for her (which I like to do)), and she really appreciates my help.  I've had 2 medical issues during our 1 year relationship, and she's been incredibly supportive and there for me, too.  She loves me with all her heart, and she's very caring and wants to know about me and be there for me.  So, the love isn't 1-sided.  However, the tone of our relationship is often one where I'm just lending support and trying to be there for her -- where she's either doing okay and is fairly happy for half the day, then the other I'm helping her cope with her sadness.  She's applying for new jobs in my city now, and she desperately wants to move in with me again.  I love her so much, but I just keep feeling like I give, give, give, and that it's comparable to how a parent must feel with a struggling, sad teenager.  That's a strong, weird thing for me to say, I realize.


I should say, we are able to have fun though.  When we're together, she tends to be able to make me laugh, too, and I truly enjoy spending every minute with her.  It's just that nearly everyday I assume this giving role, to the point that it makes me feel helpless and sad that I can't ""fix"" all of her issues she's battling.  Related, my dad and mom are very poor and are struggling.  Dad has been suicidal for last 7 years, and as the only child, I'm essentially a parent for my parents, although long-distance.  I take care of a lot for them, both financially and emotionally, I'm their crutch big time.


So, my vague question: how much is too much to give.  I love her so incredibly much, and I consider her the love of my life, but I realize it's important for each person to feel happy and confidence in life without the other person, and for their happiness not be entirely contingent and derived from being in the relationship with the other person.  She's not happy without me.  I am what makes her happy.  I want to be with her, but I also want her to be happy independent of me, which looks very unlikely.  I can't build her up and make her whole.  I don't know what to do.  I want her to feel complete without me, and I wish she could handle stress better -- especially when I think of how she would serve as a mother (she'd be awesomely caring, but I could imagine her pouting and secluding herself to a room anytime things get hectic).


Does this constitute that maybe I should say we take a break from the relationship?  How can I help her more?  Maybe things will be much better once she switches jobs again?


p.s. the sex is amazing.  2-6 orgasms a day for her when I visit her, and 1-3 for me.


If you've read all of this, you deserve a cookie and a hug!  So, thanks!"
25y6qh,15,2014-05-19,Need advice about roommate,BucolicLove,actuallesbians,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/25y6qh/need_advice_about_roommate/,"Hey there,
Haven’t known about this subreddit for long. I don’t have a lot of fellow LGBT friends, and I need some advice from humans who understand what it’s like being a lesbian.

My partner and I moved into my friend Andy's basement within the last year to overcome some economic and health related hardship. He’s a straight guy I worked with for a couple years, and always considered upstanding, until recently. Things have been going great - he’s a veteran, and although we don’t always see eye-to-eye, it’s been a fairly harmonic, win-win situation for all three of us. We’ve helped him out in certain ways, by offering gardening assistance, by being sisterly and listening to his troubles, and he’s given us a fairly cheap place to rent during a really rough patch.

My partner is sick with adrenal fatigue and genetic inability to process Vitamin B/Folate issue, and we just found that out. She’s been losing hair and has migraines and physical pain all the time, so she’s not been able to give a lot because she’s very weak. We don’t have insurance, and can’t afford the cheapest ones we’ve found. 

This last year, I’ve returned to college to complete a degree to get our family to a better place. My partner, “Anne,” has been working +50 hrs/week in a caustic work environment on top of her illness, providing income while I’ve been driving 12-16 hours a week for full time upper level undergrad courses. I’ve been living out of my car at times to finish this degree: it’s cheaper than renting near where my college is, and Andy helped us by giving low rent costs so we can afford health care and I can get this degree.

Summer has struck, and I have more time at home, which I’m not accustomed to - most of the time I’ve been studying in our one-bedroom, or driving. Because Anne has been severely ill, we haven’t cleaned our portion of the house, but neither had Andy cleaned his portion, who is also in college full-time. 

Since I’ve been home from college, I’ve noticed Andy has a cruel streak, one I didn’t know about while we were working together, or while I’ve been in hyper-focus-4.0GPA-mode. 

Andy seems to be one of those humans who teases ruthlessly and pushes the shock-button continually “in jest.” He doesn’t tease Anne, she thinks it’s because she hasn’t reacted to it, so he stopped. He’s said some fairly offensive things while I’ve lived here, but I figured, meh, some people are like that, they may not mean it, it’s just how they blow off steam - and this is what he’s affirmed. Offensive = racist and misogynist comments.

Anne and I both feel Andy has some PTSD from Iraq - he’s seeing a therapist about that right now; suicide is very common in his unit, more than the average for the military branch he is a part of. We have been attempting kindness and compassion - we are both older than Andy, and have seen crap ourselves, so we have felt we could be sort of the safe confessors.  I think he’s seeing therapy because of some of the honest questions he’s asked of me and Anne, and our honest replies. 

This guy doesn’t like to express emotion. He’s also had a rough semester. He’s been working 2 part time jobs, one a night shift, while going to university full time, and he was dating a girl who, younger than he, also had depressive issues. They had a pregnancy scare, and this freaked his girlfriend out and she kind of backed out of the relationship after that, until they were broken up (apparently amiably, but all happening in the same week as finals). My partner and I have both been trying to be kind to him, because to us this is a ton of stress! However, he insists he’s not stressed, and that he’s fine, although he’s been drinking more, and he’s been increasingly cruel in his teasing.

Last week we had our first ‘roommate fight.’ He kept making passive-aggressive comments about cleanliness, also saying things like, “you’re still tired? Huh” - this is less than a week after I’ve completed a 4.0 at the 2nd best college in the country for my degree. He also passive-aggressively alluded to how I was lazy because I don’t have a job and my partner does, which really irked me because I’ve been working to carry the household load of my sick spouse, while trying to get a summer internship, and clean, on top of offering him landscape/gardening help and being wiped from a rough semester! 

I flew off at him because he had been giving me these passive-aggressive hits all day, saying that if he had a problem with me, he needed to tell me directly, because I wouldn’t know unless he did. He got all red in the face, which looked honestly like shock and guilt that I had caught him abusing me, and then tried to have a conversation about it with me. I was so upset I had to leave: I resist being violent in my family-generated fighting style, a thing I want to leave in my past, and I don’t like angry confrontations. He was trying to apologize, but I couldn’t deal with that until I calmed down. When alone, I figured, I’m a frayed wire, I was probably over-reacting because I was exhausted, so I apologized for flying off the handle, and he apologized for what he said - that he wasn’t trying to allude to anything. 

Things have been awkward since. 
This weekend was the planned weekend to help him landscape. He has one day off a week, that one day was yesterday. He left early for Home Depot, giving me no direction on helping him, so I cleaned my fridge waiting for him to get back. This greatly delayed landscaping.

The dude moves until he drops, and I can’t keep up, but feel the social pressure that I’m expected to. I also feel he is jealous of me because of my grades, and this jealousy comes out sideways through other competitions and one-upmanship’s. He tried for all A’s this semester, but with the crap he had going on, he couldn’t. And I did, and he hasn’t congratulated me about it, but rather has acted weird about it since I got my grades, and he’s gotten his 2.5GPA. I couldn't care less, everyone has their own path to walk, but I think he cares, and competes - he’s told me he’s jealous of my school capacities before. I don’t know what to say/do about that. 

For the work, he prepped some amazing lamb in compensation of my landscaping help. My spouse also helps, and has a discount with landscaping supplies which she has given him for this project = lots of discounted money, wholesale savings.  We’ve both been extremely helpful, and kind, and compassionate to this guy. 

He had his 10+ year best guy friends over to share the lamb last night. Turns out all three of them when together exacerbate the cruelty. At least one of them was drunk, and this guy is Andy’s best friend, who he weekly works with at a brewery. Andy was at least tipsy, and the other guy is LDS and not exactly gay-friendly. It was insanely awkward. These guys didn’t help with the labor, so it was Andy and me doing most of the work, and really, me doing most of it because Andy doesn’t know shit about plants. 

The comments made last night were aggressively misogynistic, aggressively homophobic, and aggressively cruel. All in “jest.” There were also some insanely white-supremacist comments made, in a multi-racial neighborhood, and I don’t agree with these comments at all! I was so shocked, sitting there in the mud, putting in this guys plants, as he and his friends go on about gays and blacks, and white power and how women are cunts. I was so shocked it didn’t hit me until last night, when I couldn’t sleep because of it. Now, it was mostly Andy’s friends saying these things, but it was so wrong, I don’t remember it all - I’ve blotted it out of my memory it made me so angry (coping mechanism). 

It was odd, but each time my partner left, the cruelty was directed at me. Like they’re trying to make me ‘one of the guys’ and jest with me like that, but I don’t know how to do that. I’m a motherfucking female! Tomboy, sure, but I’m still a woman! After the planting was done, I took a shower and then came up for lamb. I was going to eat then go back to our basement apartment. Anne and I came up, ate, at this point Both Andy and his best friend (the non-LDS) were drunk. Anne finished before me and went to remove the plates, and as I was getting ready to leave my roommates best friend said the following:

“So, what the fuck is wrong with you lesbians, anyway? You don’t like dick? What the fuck?! You must be fucked up - like, what the fuck did your parents do to fuck you up THAT much?” 

I was so shocked I just stood there. I said:
“Well, that’s a discussion for another time.” 

The mormon guy went:
“Oh, dude that went too far! I think she wants to get on her liberal soap box now! C’mon, girlie, let’s do it!”

And I said, 
“I hardly think this is the time. I’m not as offended as much as you think (I lied, I was traumatized, but what can I do?)”

My roommate just sat there, a stupid dear-in-headlights grin on his face, saying nothing at all.

So, I was in shock. Honestly. After all my partner and I have done to help this guy, be kind, share discounts, give physical aid, and then to have that happen, I couldn’t fathom it. He did nothing. 

He came down later after his friends had left and apologized if he or his friends had offended us. That they had gotten a ""little out of line"" at the end, and that they don’t mean it, and were only “kidding.” It’s all in jest, he said. I looked at him and said, “don’t worry, you’re just being guys.” and I tried to mean it, tried to be the bigger person, convinced myself in that moment I did mean it.  But, really, I feel so totally trapped, furious, and sick.

I couldn’t sleep last night. I was so angry. I was so hurt, and I feel so stuck. I don’t want to live here anymore, but I’m not in the economic situation to do anything about it right now that I can see. I’m waiting to hear back on a paid internship. If we can, Anne and I both want to move closer to my college, because it’s a much more liberal area than the conservative military town we’re now in, and because Anne also wants to finish her degree - she just was able to get a better job than I could with retail experience, so she was fronting the living costs while I was in school this year.  With these comments from Andy, I  have NO IDEA what to do. I have until August before I go back to college, and I can’t deal with this every day. I can’t deal with this kind of two-faced bullshit. The company one keeps says a lot about a person - if these are Andy’s best friends, does Andy feel the same? When he is with Anne and me, we have fun together, but when I’m alone with him, he says really weird shit, passive aggressive biting comments that he doesn’t say to Anne, and I can’t handle it. I’m at breaking point.

I may sleep in my car tonight. Or go to my mothers, and my mother and partner don’t get along so this is really hard. We have no where else to go right now, and Anne said she can’t sleep in the car still keep her job.  So, I feel stuck, and I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what to say to Andy - I have to be honest, I have to tell him it actually did break my trust in him, right? Or, should I try to keep quiet? What do you guys suggest I do?

We have a little savings, but not enough to get us through until August, esp. moving to the college town - doing the move means Anne loses her job. 

Any ideas would be helpful. Sorry this is so long. I just don’t know what to do.






=========


EDIT/UPDATE: Thanks for reading my verbose saga.

My actions with Roommate were a fusion of your collective advice coupled with gut intuition. I wrote him a letter when I wasn't angry, explaining why I was hurt, the boundaries I required to maintain personal wellness, and asking if he held the same caustic anti-gay crap opinions his best friend did. He read it and we talked the next day. The Wifely-One wasn't about (so important she has a title), and as an individual she's got her own journey with him.

It was... weird. He said, ""He was sorry I chose to take it personally, and chose to be hurt about it, but that he wasn't going to apologize for himself, and he wasn't going to apologize for he and his friends jesting."" So, he didn't apologize. I asked him if he felt that way about lesbians and women, and gayness in general, and he said, ""Honestly? No. I don't care. If you find someone to love, whatever. If I find someone to love who isn't a girl, whatever."" 

And then, he asked me to help him garden.

I guess I have no backbone, but I helped, mainly because I love plants and wanted to do something pretty outside, and also I'm emotionally exhausted and don't give a fuck and can't fight with a dude trained in fighting. He's been avoiding me and my Wifely-One since, which has been nice: I like privacy/boundaries. During the conversation, he used phrases like ""I'm a loser,"" and ""I'm an idiot"" more times than I've heard him say before. He also said he'd 'reign in his teasing.' So, I guess he feels bad, but he won't apologize. It isn't his responsibility to apologize for his homophobic bestie. I asked that he let my Wifely-One and I know when his friends would come over, to remove ourselves from them, and he complied.

Right now, our plan is to get the hell out of here as fast as possible, but as cautiously as possible. I've been commuting &gt;400miles/week to complete a degree in a different city, while the wifely-one has been working as a manager in the conservative city we live in (this insanity was cheaper than living in the college town). She wants to finish her degree also, and the management place isn't working well with her health issues, so we're planning on moving up to the college town before summer's done to both finish. We're in our 30s and finishing college has been difficult, lacking familial support. I hope to keep the peace here for a couple months longer. Fingers crossed, and thanks for listening. I don't really have any lesbian friends, so you guys are my community :-) Blessings.  "

Ok, never done this before, but I'll be buggered if I'm getting any objective advice from anyone I know personally. So, I'm turning to my recent finding of this odd little site for a bit of help.

Ok, context. I've been taught to fly since I was 13 years old, and for a hell of a long time it was the sole career I wanted to pursue. However, parents not happy. Mum though it was a waste of my brain, and Dad - through a combination of jealousy and annoyance (if anyone wants clarification on this please ask) - did his best to put my flying dreams to bed. 

Fast forward to me at 16, and 3 years of nagging and plain 'not interested' from the parents had made me all but give up on the idea. I studied law during my college (high school to any US readers) years, kinda' liked it, and went on to study it at university.

I graduated roughly a year ago, and - for the most part - was on track to get a damned good degree... that was until my final year. I met someone, shit went bad, I had a near complete mental breakdown, and just scraped a lower honours degree.

Summer 2013. At mum's/step-fathers house, get a part time job waiting at a local restaurant, and spend a lot of time in/out of various internships. All the while fairly pissed that my degree is acting as one big barrier to furthering myself in the legal field. 

December 2013: Holy shit, British Airways had relaunched their Future Pilot programme, a near fully funded cadetship for people of any flying experience to enter the pilot profession. Of course, I apply, thinking that I had nothing to lose. Further holy shit, they accept me within two weeks. 

January 2014: I go for my 'stage one' interview, as one of 800 for just 65 or so places. I didn't get it. But... the flight college who interviewed me were impressed enough with my aptitude and attitude that they allowed me 'on merit' entry into the unsponsored programme until Jan. 2015. That's near £84K of finance needed, all for a 'chance' at a job. No guarantee. 

However, parents had changed their tune completely. Mum realised I was still determined, and that BA giving me a chance must have meant something. She is now in full support. Both her - and my stepfather- have agreed to help settle my finances when they are in a position to so (approximately mid 2015). They are very clear on this, and we have talked extensively about it. So far as they are concerned, I'm already at the academy. 

My father, initially, was hyper supportive. He was amazed that I had gotten a chance with BA, and even more impressed that I had a place on merit. Since my initial interview I have done more of my part time job (getting a couple of pay rises and become a senior member of the staff), and applied for a few more cadetships with UK based airlines. I didn't get them, and was getting increasingly restless. I wanted change, and I wanted to grab the opportunity which I had been presented with. 

Last week, after a really shitty day at work, I snapped. I had spoken to mum the night before, who thought I really should 'just do it' and apply fully to the original academy. The very next day, I initiated the process to start my course in September 2014. 

The problem? My father. He is now against it, saying that to be landed with this much debt so early in life is insanity, and to at least wait until mum/stepfather's affairs are in order for certain. They ARE a certainty, but as yet haven't got access to what they are owed. As I said, sometime in 2015 is reasonable. 

As much as I hate to admit it (me and my father have never exactly seen eye to eye), in this instance I think he does have a point, and am now having serious jitters about what is possibly the shit scariest thing I have ever done or committed to. 

I want to start, I want to live my life and go for the career that I have dreamed of since I was a young teenager (even earlier, come to that). 

Any advice would be fantastic. I don't even care if it's along the lines of 'Man the fuck up and do it.' 

Thanks anyway Reddit. "
25ya18,9,2014-05-19,Proper Protocol for an Internship,mizdictator,architecture,https://www.reddit.com/r/architecture/comments/25ya18/proper_protocol_for_an_internship/,"I have recently graduated with a B.S. in Architecture and through my part-time job as a waitress met an older architect (we'll call him Richard) who was ecstatic to have potential help with computer work and I was ecstatic to have a foot in the door.

He is working on the expansion of a company and designing some new buildings for their complex. I went to the interview process with HR of the company but have not filled out any proper paperwork, taken a drug test, or been officially hired. Even before I went to the interview this Richard started giving me assignments. HR member said that was a no-no because I was not on payroll. 

Last Friday at about 7pm Richard sent me another email asking for some CAD work due for Monday. I was out celebrating my friend's birthday so I did not promptly return the email. The next morning at 9am he called my cell phone to insist that this work must be done for Monday. My long-term boyfriend's family was coming down to visit so I said that I would not have time. This was when Dick became irate.

""If you cannot spare 30 minutes to do this for Monday"" he said ""I should just find someone else to fill the position.""

I have been compliant with Dick so far. However, I have also BCC a member of HR (the one who was interviewing me) with my messages to Dick. At first Richard was insistent that I ""had the job"" but Dick is now telling me that I need to go through his interview process to see if I fulfill his requirements which includes various AutoCAD assignments. 

It seems like Dick is trying to get me to do free work for him with little to no intent to hire me. I have never had a job or internship in the architecture field so I really would like the experience so I can at least move up in the world. The first job is the hardest.

Is this common practice in the architecture field to give assignments before being officially employed?

Should I stick it out and help Dick out or should I call it a lost cause and pursue careers elsewhere?

**Edit:** I am cutting my losses for a lot of the reasons discussed below. Most of what was discussed I had inclinations about before this post but I just wanted a second opinion. Thank you for the clarifications and advise!"

I checked out your craigslist for housing, but I'm a little dismayed with the choices.  I realize its a bad month to move (mid June/July to Sept), but I was hoping to find a cool place soon.  I was hoping there might be some other sources Ottawa specific that I am not aware of.  I'll be looking mostly for places around the Hill and the government office area, Sandy Hill, and Ottawa U areas.  

Since I'm single, I'll be looking to meet women and cool guys to hang out with.  Where is the best area/places to do this?  Also, best places to watch the World Cup games? I'll be cheering mostly for the latin countries (Spain, Brasil, Ecuador, Argentina, but also Germany).

I'm a college student looking for an internship for the summer. 

Internship A is my dream internship, they do EVERYTHING in regards to CS. I would learn a ton, meet cool people and if i do well i would have a job waiting for me when i graduate. It is also a government job so i would get full benefits with a full time position. 

Internship B is a little web development internship that i've already been told is mine if i want it. Im okay with web dev but i dont necessarily love it.

Internship A told me they would let me know of a decision last week but they didnt. My friend who works there said the hiring manager was out all week. My friend said that i was one of the best interviewees and candidates however so to just wait it out. I emailed the guy who interviewed me yesterday and asked when he anticipates a decision because my summer is dependent on this.

Intership B called me today because i was supposed to start working there if i accepted. (i havnt talked to them since their interview so i havnt ""accepted"" yet). I've recieved no email response from internship A today. Should i just give up and accept the internship that i've had, or should i risk it and potentially end up with no internship?

TL;DR: Internship A is amazing, and i've been told i'm one of the best candidates. No response from them yet. Intership B is kind of lame but i've been accepted and i would have had to start today but i've been waiting it out for A."

Before i start this, I'm not depressed, dont have any medical/mental conditions, and actually like life right now.  I hate calling myself a failure because i know people have real problems that i have never and know i couldn't even begin to comprehend, while i have little to no real issues.  So I'm only a failure in the terms that i've defined for myself.

While I have all these good things going for me, here's why i feel like a failure.  I seriously don't think I can remember the last time I gave something my full effort, or earned something.  I'm from a well off family (not Rich, but my family is doing good for themselves), with just about the most supportive parents and extended family of all time. I've always done ""good enough"" in school, was a solid B student in HS, and was able to do so without much (and by much i mean none) effort. That was constant throughout my entire HS career, in all aspects.  Never went to a party, never had a GF, never drank, never smoked, didn't really hang out with anyone.  But i seriously can't take anything i do seriously, I've been on the cusp of getting kicked out of school, and still haven't been able to concentrate on my schoolwork, or even give an effort towards passing classes. While my parents are able to pay for my classes, I can't even try hard enough to not completely waste their money for me to go to college.  I've failed many important classes, and barely passed others.

But this isn't just about school. I'm a big guy, who's extremely self conscience.  Ever since I was a little kid, my parents were on me about my weight (since they struggled with weight issues, as well as some health concerns tied to it). And I try to blame them for that, but i know it isn't them.  And this, mixed with my inability to try at ANYTHING, has lead me to become someone who has never even tried to have a girlfriend, and never had sex, as a 23 year old college student.  Its literally become anything outside my comfort zone is off limits.  In HS and up until a year ago in college, I was someone who never had any close friends, my childhood friends all ended up in a different ""group"" as me, and I desperately tried to fit in with a group of people i didn't belong with, which lead to me not really doing anything in HS, ever. I played football in HS, and wasn't very good, but since middle school i've been made of for being a big guy, and honestly didn't care, and i know a lot of people say that they dont care, but i honestly didn't care, after a little bit of time, it became a sense of pride, especially as an offensive lineman in high school, where it was just a group of us big dudes.  But i've never been good talking with new people, or meeting new people, that aren't in my really close friends, which makes it even harder to meet girls, especially when my best friends are complete extroverts and get lots of girls, pretty easily.  I over-analyze the absolute shit out of anything that i say to almost anybody, other than my friends, so unless what i'm saying is completely scripted or i have a very good idea of what i'm talking about, it comes out wrong or with a stutter (i dont normally have a stutter problem, especially when i'm with my friends).

But that leads to an extension of the not trying at anything, seriously not caring about anything. There's very few things that I care about, at all, and would get offended if happened.  And usually if something goes far enough to seriously piss me off, i'm far too big of a ""miled mannored person"", or as most call it, a pussy to do anything about it.

I've thought of awesome plans, of what i'm going to do in the future, and not once have I followed through on any of them.  Most of them related to losing weight or studying, since thats 90% of my life right now.  But the fact that I can't try at anything has made me feel like such a piece of shit, especially when i spend most of my time doing absolutely nothing, and ignoring whatever I could be doing.

Thats the end of what i had to get off my chest, probablly gonna get downvoted to hell, dont really care, just looking for something to vent to, thanks reddit...lol"

He was the kind of guy who was controlling and a dick to her at times, he never hit her but he would punch walls and break her phone from time to time; and of course like every romantic comedy, there was just something about him that made him worth staying with, figures. 

And that's when she got pregnant....

Fast forward a year, we haven't talked in months because I didnt want to break up a relationship that involved a child. But one day I get a call from her telling me that her and her BF (I'll call him C) broke up because he had been cheating since before the baby, and even more so afterwards. At this point I was living 1300 away on an internship for a year, but we decide to start talking again.

Things are going better than ever, we make plans to meet up when I come back for Christmas to visit family, and we do, and one thing leads to another and we have sex a couple times over the course of the week. Here's where I made a mistake, she wanted to make things official, but a combination of me living so far away, and her having a child made me very hesitant, and I told her I couldn't do that at least not untill I was living in the same state as her.

Fast forward again to another year or so later when I move back home. We are very excited to see each other and I decide that I want to spend a day with her and her daughter, with my intentions being to ask her out once I feel comfortable with the idea of dating a girl with a child. Things go great at first, her daughter loves me, and I start to really get attached to the idea of being part of their lives. But like every romantic comedy, there's a catch.

She has been seeing some guy who started out as her stalker, but for some reason her loneliness combined with possibly my not wanting to date her while I was out of state, drove her to sleep with him, and to start having feelings for him. She tells me things are weird at the moment and that we should just be friends for a while and that apparently this stalker of hers is dangerous at times and she's afraid what would happen if the two of us were to be together. She tells me she still thinks I'm her soul mate and that she really wants to remain friends until she gets her head straight.

But it was too much for me, I told her that I couldn't just be friends with her, not after everything we had done to get to this point. It's been a week since I told her I cant talk to her anymore and that I wished her the best. I thought that by breaking off contact I would realize it wasn't worth it and I would start to move on, but I've just been feeling worse and worse about the situation.

Should I swallow my pride and try and make things work out (which I'm not sure was possible, even before cutting off contact) or should I just keep trying to forget about her?

If you read all of that, thank you so much, I couldn't think of a way to make it any shorter, if you have any advice, questions, or personal wisdom to give me, it would be greatly appreciated. "

I'll tell you a secret. When Dark Horse was barely a year old, I secured the rights to the latest Japanese Godzilla book. The company at the time was basically Randy Stradley and myself. We did not know where to go to find a translator, so we divided the book into six issues and  I took issues 1,3, and 5 home while Randy took issues 2,4,and 6. We ""made-up"" our translations by looking at the panels. That is how we ""adapted"" the book. Surprisingly enough, we were pretty close to the actual translation.

[I know that Dark Horse has more creator-owned characters, how does that affect film rights?  Also, has Dark Horse ever considered creating more adaptations of its properties? And would you ever consider creating a studio similar to Marvel Studios, where every work is part of a collective universe?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25z06w/iam_mike_richardson_publisher_and_founder_of_dark/chm2xsl?context=5)|Well, it might surprise you but Dark Horse has its own film division. We've produced over two dozen films and television series over the last two decades, projects such as The Mask, TimeCop, Mystery Men, Hellboy, etc. We currently have several projects nearing green-light status.  As far as a collective universe, see our Project Black Sky line. Some of those characters are currently being discussed as films and television series.

I don't care much if a fan has a home-made shirt featuring one of our characters or even if an artist sells a piece featuring our characters. We do have a problem if someone starts producing items on a large scale. I hope I'm answering your question.

[What do you look for when getting pitched new creator-owned properties?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25z06w/iam_mike_richardson_publisher_and_founder_of_dark/chm2nfl?context=5)|Talent. Great stories with an unusual direction. Something I haven't seen before. Terrific art. Fun twists. Familiar stories or characters with unexpected surprises. As you might imagine, I see thousands of proposals. Pitches that appeal with very few lines. I'll always remember Steve Niles pitching me the entertainment rights to 30 Days of Night. ""Sun goes down in Barrow, Alaska for 30 days. Vampires show up."" I saw the entire film with those two sentences. Strong concepts can be pitched for comics or film with few words. 
[Comics industry heroes: any favorite first time meet and greets? I sorta remember reading a forward where Schultz was talking about meeting Frank Miller, then talking the day away about ideas (can't find that damn book right now though\).

An event, achievement, or maybe a behind the scenes thing of making a particular printing deadline where everyone gave 110%?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25z06w/iam_mike_richardson_publisher_and_founder_of_dark/chm54w4?context=5)|I met Frank through Geof Darrow. Geof told us about a book he was doing with Frank when we were maybe two or three years old. I asked Geof to let us have a chance at the book and he agreed to discuss with Frank. Many months later, Geof called and said Frank would meet with us at a specific restaurant at a specific time. We (Randy Stradley and I) hopped a plane and met with Frank at the proper place and time. He pulled out a pad and paper to take notes. I laid out a four or five page document itemizing every cost related to a comic and told him to tell me how much we could make.He looked surprised (had never received a P&amp;L from previous publishers), picked up the document and put the pen and paper back into his pocket. The while meeting lasted not more than 15 minutes. He told me to meet him at the same time and place the following day. We did, and he gave us Hard Boiled with Geof alone with Give Me Liberty with Dave Gibbons. I learned later that he called Dave Gibbons that night and told him he's met a publisher who gave him "". . . the keys to the kingdom."" He also insisted that I NOT give him so much of the profit, that our deal had to be fair to both of us. We've been working together now for more than 20 years.

As a result, I could read when I began the first grade. I was once asked how I felt about school and I answered that I was generally bored. I was then asked when the boredom began. I said probably the second day of the first grade . . . I read Fun With Dick and Jane while it was being passed out and then had to wait for everyone else to catch up.
 |I enjoyed certain artists before I knew who they were . . . the ""Good Duck Artist"" - Carl Barks, Steve Ditko, and of course, Jack Kirby. Hal Foster was my all time favorite from the comic strips and I discovered Alex Raymond later on in the Nostalgia Press editions. I actually quit comics late in high school and it was Barry Smith's work that brought me back in.
 |I've always loved comics. Majored in art as a result. worked as a commercial artist. Always planned to start my own business, so a  comic shop was a natural.

[Considering the upcoming releases of the new Alien-Predator comics, some of the writers have opted not to treat the AvP films as canon for their story, but what is Fox's stance on the AvP movies? Are they a canonical side-story or alternate universe in regards to the newer films (PREDATORS and Prometheus\) and new comics as far as Fox is concerned?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25z06w/iam_mike_richardson_publisher_and_founder_of_dark/chm2u9f?context=5)|We pretty much built the continuity for the AVP (which we created) and Predator franchises (the second film was based on our first series . . . a fact complicated when we had to license the film, making it the first comic based on the film that was based on the comic). We are looking mostly toward Prometheus and Alien continuity for our series. Where the other films fit, if at all, will depend on whether they fit in easily and if there is an advantage to including them. We've worked with Fox for many years and they are very supportive of our efforts. Current story lines are consistent with both the studio and the filmmakers.
[Just wanted to thank you for doing this AMA. Long time fan of Dark Horse, from all of the Aliens universe comics ever published to the good ole days of Concrete and everything in between.

Thanks! -Andrew ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25z06w/iam_mike_richardson_publisher_and_founder_of_dark/chm4ld5?context=5)|We do set up portfolio reviews at some conventions. You can also set up interviews with particular editors at the same cons. In the end, you can drop off a pitch or submission off at the booth. They generally find their way to me if they show any potential. I can't promise everyone a reply, but if you are good, odds are we'll get back to you.

Life is short and the days are precious.
[In regards to submissions, assuming we're coming as a complete creative team (or at the very least writer/penciler/inker\), do the guidelines change? Do you still want a full script, or will 5-10 (sequential\) pages do?  Ditto for Dark Horse Presents -- Assuming we've got all the pages penciled, inked and lettered, would you still want the script?

[ of all, thank you for Dark Horse comics. Publishers like you made me stick with comics in the mid to late 90's.  I'm sure that you get asked this a lot but advice to breaking in comics.  And what do you think about web comics?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25z06w/iam_mike_richardson_publisher_and_founder_of_dark/chm4ktw?context=5)|The best advice I can give you is to be persistent. Competition is fierce, so you have to be resolved and not discouraged easily. If you are good, someone is going to notice. For those who have problems with traditional comics publishers, I suggest setting up your own website. We've published many series we've discovered on-line. And I guess that answers your question about web comics . . . I love 'em (if they're good).

As a result, all of the information related to the characters exists in our upcoming event. As a result, every film character is somehow connected to our stories. You'll have to read the series to see who and how. That's the fun of reading the comics, right?
[Yeas ago, you published a a Legend line with Art Adams,  Frank Miller, John Byrne, Mike Mignola and more.

A reunion is highly unlikely. If  I were you, I'd just take a look at their current work and grab some of the work from those good-old Legend days. What great comics they've created.
[Hi Mr. Richardson! Been a long time reader of Dark Horse (especially Hellboy and The Goon\) and I am absolutely loving the Project Black Sky line.

[When you still had the Star Wars license, and of course still possessed the rights to the Alien-Predator franchises how come no Star Wars vs Alien-Predator crossovers ever came about?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25z06w/iam_mike_richardson_publisher_and_founder_of_dark/chm3ega?context=5)|Neither company was interested in seeing their properties combined with the other.

[A lot of fans of the Alien-Predator franchises feel that the overall Expanded Universe (Video Games included\) continuity is discombobulated. Some even say there are alternate timelines or universes, others say just different continuities and liken it a Choose Your Adventure Book.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/25z06w/iam_mike_richardson_publisher_and_founder_of_dark/chm54bv?context=5)|We've gone to great lengths to preserve our own continuity. We've even gone back and re-edited books when the film continuity did not match ours. It's our belief that fans of the books want them to be extensions of the existing films, so . . .

25zffb,28,2014-05-19,What is your opinion on Masters degrees?,aczJWSfan,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/25zffb/what_is_your_opinion_on_masters_degrees/,"Hi, I'm an engineering student and there always seem to be a debate among people on the importance of a masters degree in engineering.

Some people argue that if you do a placement or internship then you'll do just as well finding a job and salary wise once out of university as someone who has done a masters without doing a placement or possibly even better as companies value experience. 

I was just wondering what the opinions here are? I know a lot of people might just answer ""well why not do both?"" and the reason against I guess is having to take loans for tuition and living for an extra year rather than getting that all important experience in industry (assuming a good job is found within a year after university)."
25zhbg,91,2014-05-19,IT can mess up stuff too,[deleted],talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/25zhbg/it_can_mess_up_stuff_too/,"Hi TFTS, first post here.

I work as T1 support at $nonprofitorganization (NPO). It's important to mention that the building next to us is another non-profit organization (NPO2) and we support both, while primary being associated with $NPO. However, just as we support both, users (and sometimes computers) switch between these organizations (depending on their work).

One day I get a call from $CEO at $NPO2.
&gt; CEO: I can't ssh to my computer anymore. Could you check what's going on?

&gt; Me: Sure, give me a second.

Some second later after checking the config files, assuming she made a mistake:

&gt; Me: Yeah, that's a windows machine and we don't support SSH for windows.

&gt; CEO: No, that can't be right. There has always been a linux installation on that computer. Are you sure about that?

She starts getting nervous. I remote to the machine and it is in fact a windows installation. Uh-oh.

&gt; Me: I'm currently connected to the machine and it's definitly a windows installation. Are you sure it's the correct name?

&gt; CEO: Yes I am. That's horrible! The work of an entire year is on that hard drive. Please figure out what happened and tell me my data is somewhere.

We end the call. I start searching in the ticket system what happened and find it out. It's like everything that could go wrong went wrong. 

$CEO had previously been a user at $NPO and switched to $NPO2 to become the CEO, while still working on her old stuff. The administrator of her department (budget and hardware) said she can keep on using the machine, meaning she switched the building and her computer was lingering around in some office.

A $luser found the computer, decided that she liked it and put it in her room(until today I don't know how that happened). Because she didn't like the linux installation (why the f*ck did you take it then?) she created a ticket to reinstall it with windows. There was no remark in our database that this computer belongs to $CEO and here's where the mistake happened: the $luser was a student and students never have their own computers - they use group machines. I missed that. $luser is sitting in the student room, but I ordered our intern to go and pick it up, meaning I didn't check the room and was unaware of that. Being a good intern he asked $luser if there is any data on the machine. $luser said no. Intern told me so.

Now, it's not completly my fault, and I only feel half bad for it. She was storing the only copy on a local drive while we offer project folders (including a daily backup) and an awesome backup system for normal machines, but she didn't use them. The same would've happened if the hard drive failed, but it was still me who deleted all the stuff. She ""luckily"" had a 6 months old backup on an external drive, but the rest was still lost. "

My application is written in Python/Django and incorporates the Twitter Bootstrap and JQuery/UI. Prior experience with these technologies is preferred but not required. Some minimal web-development knowledge or experience is required, but a willingness and proof of ability to learn new frameworks is more important. 

As this is a very early-stage startup with minimal funding, we can only offer an unpaid internship at this time. For this reason, we are hoping to attract students or those looking to expand their experience and resume. We hope to be able to offer paid internships soon after launch!

Last summer, I began an internship at a small web development company. The company is very small, there are less than ten of us, and its a great company. I like everyone I work with and get along really well with my boss. It's a relaxed environment, and I really couldn't ask for a better workplace. I'm getting ready to work a full 40-hour schedule again this summer from my 14 hours I worked through the school year.

The only thing I'm not satisfied with is my pay. When I interviewed last year, I came unprepared. I didn't come in with a number in mind, and when we got to talking about wage, I threw out $10/hr, which my now boss accepted without hesitation.

In retrospect, I think that wage was more acceptable when I first started. I thought going in that I knew everything I would need to know, and man was I wrong. I had a ton to learn, and I have. I'm to the point now that I would consider myself a competent developer.

My boss and I talk a lot throughout the day. At one point we got around to talking about what larger companies like Target and Walmart pay their workers. He then asked how much he pays me, noticed how close they were, and remarked ""I should pay you more."" I took this to mean I would be getting a raise, but didn't pursue any further. These conversations are always pretty casual, and if I wanted to see results from them I should have more seriously pressed for a raise.

All this to say, I think I deserve a raise. I'm going to be spending the majority of my summer at work trying to save up for college. It'd be great to be building an even bigger savings.

How do I start this conversation? It seems like larger companies have all of this mapped out, with things like performance reviews and other regular things.

But what do I do when its just me, my boss, and a few other people in the office?"

Some background: I'm an asian high school senior. For the past four years, I've been working my ass off to get into a good school. I have a 4.35 gpa for grades 10-12, a 2320 SAT score, 800 in Biology, 760 in Math II for my SAT IIs, and I have a bunch of AP tests under my belt. I've been doing taekwondo for over half my life, and done a variety of extracurriculars; working a part time job as a TA at a summer school, tutoring kids another summer, working at an internship for a biology research clinic, etc etc. I asked the teachers that I got on well with to write me letters of recommendation. Come April, I discover I've gotten into literally zero colleges. None. FUCKING NONE. UCI, UCSD, Wash U St Louis. All waitlisted me. All my other schools (among them UCLA, UC Berkeley, and USC) rejected me. Then comes May 15th, when I find out NONE of my waitlisted schools have chosen to admit me. What have I been fucking working my ass off these past four years for? Everything feels so fucking USELESS. I guess being an Asian STEM major just means the cards are stacked against me. And these past few months I've slowly been descending into a downward spiral of laziness and lack of motivation. And maybe this is me being a bit arrogant, but I don't think I'm meant for community college at all. The lack of motivation and drive there would just stifle me. Yes, you get the same degree, but everyone says that I'll get bogged down, and I haven't worked my ass off to go to community college. So fuck me for wanting to get a higher education, I guess. Fuck my hard work. Fuck the college admissions process.

Also, among other things, my prom date ditched me for another guy who asked her 15 minutes after she said yes to me, I got into a minor car accident, and my parents want to increasingly get involved into everything I do because they feel I can't do anything by myself anymore because ""I failed the first time."" I'm just angry, but I think above all I'm the most angry at myself.
Maybe I would have gotten into a better school if I worked harder. Maybe I wouldn't have been left by my date if I had a fucking spine and asked her sooner. Maybe I wouldn't have hit my car if I had been more careful. Maybe I wouldn't have rapidly dropping grades if I wasn't such a self hating and unmotivated sack of shit.

I fucking hate everything."

I'm currently transferring to University from community college, and I need to make a decision in the next few months that could cost me a lot of money and time. I have the options of 

1. BS in CS, finish school in two years, have a little free time to sleep and do research. 
2.  BS in CS and BA in Computational Mathematics. This would take 3 years of my time and would be much, much tougher to accomplish.

I am taking out some loans for college, getting some grant money, and have some parental help. To go to school for 2 years would cost me roughly 35k in loans. To go to school for 3 years would probably cost me about 55k in loans, maybe more. 

I like the idea of doing just the CS degree and getting out in two years because it'll allow me to enter the job market quickly and begin paying down my loans to rid myself of the debt burden, but I truly love mathematics and I love combining mathematics and computer science. I feel like I only live once and not pursuing the second degree in Comp. Math would be something I dearly regret down the line. 

Anyways, what I'm really consulting you fellas for is advice on whether or not having a Computation Mathematics degree in addition to a CS degree is beneficial, and if it is beneficial, does it outweigh the cost of 20k more in loans and a full year of opportunity cost in terms of building a career.

thanks in advance

Things were great for the first two years. We skyped and we talked all the time and always tried to see each other as much as possible. Unfortunately she goes to school 6 hours away from me. However, we maintained a very close relationship and were genuinely excited to be together for the long haul. 

The only time we get to be together and see each other is vacations and long weekends where she comes home. For the last two years she has decided to stay up at school for the Summer in order to take some classes and do research for her resume. The first time she did this was for an internship where she would be two hours away from me for the fall semester, something that was really awesome. This summer she will be up there for the summer, fall, and spring. 

This last semester (Spring 14) was tough for both of us. She wasn't used to school, having been out of it for a year, and I was struggling with my mental health. I had had issues with depression and anxiety before and this semester was particularly tough on me and my mental health. She freaked out midway through the semester and did what she usually does, shut herself off from everyone, including me. I freaked out at the end of the semester and did what I usually do, talk it out. This is where I think the problem started. 

She thinks that I am relying on her too much for my happiness, and it puts a lot of pressure on her. I will admit, I did dump a lot of my issues on her and I don't really have anyone else to talk to intimately like I do with her. I get why this can be seen as a lot of pressure. I can't get over how distant she's been this last semester. She is a terrible texter and sometimes goes a day or two without talking to me in any form. She wasn't like this until her internship last fall. I understood it during the fall because I got to see her every week or so, but it continued when she got back to school as well. We both have a good group of friends at our schools as well and we do have people other than each other to keep us busy, but we have always maintained a close relationship. 

Last week, she visited me while I live near school for the Summer. We had a good time. I was still mental and was struggling with it. I am getting help now and I think it will work, though. So on the last day she was here, I had an anxiety attack and was freaking out over nothing (like usual). I told her about it the next day and she did the typical girlfriend stuff of ""It will all be ok, i love you, etc."" A couple days after she left, we had a talk about our relationship unlike any we had ever had. I thought there was a problem with us, but I also thought it was a result of my mentality. In the conversation we agreed that we wanted to be together, but we also acknowledged the distance between us was starting to be a problem. I let her know I thought it was because we hadn't been talking as much. And she let me know that my mental health was scaring her and making it tough. We agreed we would try to maintain our relationship and get better at what we had to get better at. 

The thing is, I am not convinced she is willing to change. She still doesn't talk to me as much as we used to and I still feel as if she doesn't want to be with me. Even though she just told me she wanted to be with me. I love this girl and I really don't want to lose her, but it's becoming difficult to convince myself I deserve this. The biggest issue I am facing is that I think I am putting in way more effort to make this work than she is. We were perfect for two and a half years. I mean perfect. I never doubted us and I was never worried about us. Recently its all I can think about. I don't know what to do. We just had a conversation about the relationship and yet I feel like we need to have another. So is it even worth it? I am beginning to think I deserve better than a girl who doesn't even talk to me and that is ""dangerous"" thinking. I don't know what to do anymore. Is it over?


TL;DR-- Long distance relationship, like 6 hours long, is becoming increasingly difficult because of my mental health and her lack of communication. We've been together for 3 years and just had a conversation where we decided to try and make it work. The distance is becoming difficult and it doesn't feel like she wants to change for it to work and I am beginning to think I deserve better. I don't want to leave her, but its feeling like I have no choice. "

So I have nothing to do this summer and I'm 21 and I have had no internships since high school but that is because my dad got me those positions. My dad wanted me to get my own job but I failed him.

It's a cycle. You can't get this job because you have no experience so we won't give you any experience so you can't get that other job."

261xi2,8,2014-05-20,Having Trouble With Motivation Without My Running Partner,ProletarianParka,xxfitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxfitness/comments/261xi2/having_trouble_with_motivation_without_my_running/,"So a few weeks back, I was talking to my SO about how I wanted to get better at running. He is in great shape, and was pretty ecstatic, so he set up a plan for us to follow and would go out with me every time I ran. During, he would make jokes, ask me how I was doing, encourage me, and generally make running, an activity which I usually avoid-at-all costs, bearable, if not occasionally fun. He was super supportive, and would always tell me he was proud, etc. after a run, and I generally ended them on a good note.

Unfortunately, last week he was called away unexpectedly for the next month and a half for some job-related stuff. Now I am left trying to run on my own, and it is not going well at all. I am going shorter distances, feeling unmotivated to complete the run, and putting a lot more walking breaks in between miles. During I feel frustrated and unhappy. Afterwards I feel unaccomplished and depressed. I am seriously considering giving up.

I have looked into getting someone else to go with me, but most of my friends have summer commitments to internships, studying abroad, etc. and aren't around to go, or just plain old not interested.

I want to continue running so I can impress my SO when he gets back, as well as improve myself, but am struggling with doing it by myself. I'm just wondering if any of ya'll have some advice for my particular situation."
2620bf,10,2014-05-20,I'm fucking tired of feeling like I'm always so far behind my peers and friends in everything I do. I feel like everyone else's life goes so smoothly.,down_the_toilet,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2620bf/im_fucking_tired_of_feeling_like_im_always_so_far/,"Graduted 5 months ago with a degree in mechanical engineering with a solid GPA but no work experience. I have had zero luck with job hunting. I'm stuck living in my mom's house in a new town where I know no one. Meanwhile, all my friends are raking in $55-65k jobs, buying houses, and getting married. I'm so fucking tired of all of this. Did I really fuck up my entire career by not getting a fucking internship? All I hear about these internships is how people just sit around and push paper all day. How is that good experience? Why is it so important? I feel like I've completely barred myself from the career in aerospace I've always dreamed of because I didn't get some damn paper pushing internship in school. Almost all of my friends had jobs before they graduated or within a month or two. Here I am staring down the 6 month mark with student loans breathing down my neck. 

The job search is the biggest load of bullshit I've ever seen. These companies leave postings open for fucking months at a time during which they accumulate literally hundreds of applications. How the fuck is a single person suppose to get noticed in a stack of shit like that? I've been perfectly qualified for all of the jobs I've applied for. Hell, I don't even have a problem finding jobs that require zero work experience but I just never hear anything back. Don't even get me started on big a waste of time cover letters are too. Can I make them sound nice and fancy? Yeah I've gotten pretty damn good at it by now but its all just grade A bullshit too. ""Multifunctional team"" ""dynamic team environment"" what the fuck do these even mean? I'm so sick of all this pointless HR jargon that I have to sprinkle in my cover letter to get it past the screening programs. God, just bring me in for an interview and let me show you that I'm smart and enthusiastic and ready to learn. 

I applied to my dream job at a company a few days ago. They were looking for an entry level engineer to work on the next generation manned spacecraft. This has been my dream for literally over a decade. I would fucking do this job for minimum wage. I wrote a passionate, yet professional cover letter, explaining my experience and how I was qualified for the job. Will I ever hear anything? Probably not. And if I do, it'll be like 6 months from now. I tried my hand at ""networking"" for this too. I saw on Linkedin that I had some 2nd degree connections at the branch where the job was located so I got in contact with the people I knew and asked if they could help me get in touch with someone there. My professor replies saying that he doesn't really know the guy he is connected to and that its a huge company so probably doesn't have any say in hiring regardless. Strike 1. My friend Facebook messages the girl he knows there but she hasn't responded yet. Probably strike 2. I feel like the universe is actively trying to stop me from getting a good job with this bullshit. Would it really be that hard for that girl to email my friend a hiring manager's email address? Does she not know how big of a difference she could make in someone's life with like 1 minute of her time? So I probably won't be getting a job I'll actually enjoy. I'm afraid at this point, if I do get an offer, I'll be for some shit job I don't want to do but I'll be forced to take it. 

The worst part of all of this? I feel like I can see how all these problems will compound in the future to make my future suck too. If I get a shit job not in my field of choice with a low starting salary, then employers will see that and it'll still be hard to get a good job in an interest field. All I wanted was to get a job I could see myself doing for the next 2-3 years without having to keep applying. Chances are I'm going to be stuck in the same damn part of the country I grew up in too. I can't fucking escape the south and midwest. God, I want out of this hell hole. 

I can see how being poor creates a cycle that perpetuates being poor. It sickens me how much of my happiness will be indirectly tied to money. I'm not asking to be rich but without money, I can't move to a place where I'd be more happy and job hunt there. I can't replace my 5 year old laptop that is literally falling apart. I can't pay to get my screwed up phone fixed. 

My biggest worry in life is turning 45 and thinking ""What went wrong?"" Both of my parents detested their jobs and I think that instilled a real fear of being unhappy in me. Regret is the worst feeling in the world, in my opinion. The feeling that you screwed up and that you can't do anything about it fucking sucks. I hate the helplessness of it. 

Sorry for the huge wall-o-text. /rant"

In medical school, I suffered from stress and anxiety.  After my medical intern year - with 80hr+ work weeks and ironically really poor lifestyles - I made a commitment to myself.  I wanted to be successful, but I wasn't willing to sacrifice my personal health to get ""there"".

I started coming up with a new way to plan my day, that was very visual and focused on my health - as well as work and other priorities.  The American College of Preventive Medicine outlines 5 main activities we need to perform to have long, healthy lives, and I made those priorities for the planner: Exercise, Sleep, Nutrition, Managing Stress (i.e. meditation, yoga, mindfulness, deep breathing, relaxation) and Love/Social (i.e. spending time with family and friends).

A few friends and colleagues and I teamed up with a professional game and puzzle app development firm in France -renowned for making fun, easy-to-use games - to help develop the interface.

The result is here:

I'd appreciate outside input.",[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/262a2r/stuck_between_two_very_different_summer/,"I'm a rising senior in college. I've worked part or full time throughout college and every summer, but only low level positions because I couldn't obtain any paid internships and couldn't afford to do anything unpaid. I applied for a bunch of internships this spring and most didn't work out. Arguably the most appealing one is in my home city. I didn't hear back for ages until last week (despite cold calling twice to check my status), when I received an email notifying me that I was in the final selection group.

In the meantime, I had already committed to a sports opportunity in another city, thinking that I was not going to be offered the job. I'm a D1 athlete and this is a huge opportunity for me to advance myself in my sport and have a shot at the collegiate level national team this summer. I also have Olympic aspirations but I'm not sure if it's worth the years of full-time training and financial struggles after college when I could be getting started in my career.

I haven't heard the final word on the internship, and obviously if I don't get it I'm going to follow through on my sports opportunity. I've tried applying for internships in the other city but it will be difficult if not impossible to manage with my training and competition schedule. Besides, its late in the process and there are very few appealing or convenient openings.

I'm not sure when I find out about the internship in my home city, but if I am offered the position I face a serious dilemma. It's *very* well paid, to the tune of exceeding my moderate amount of student loan debt. I also had really hoped to get internship experience on my resumé before beginning to apply for post-collegiate opportunities over the course of my senior year. If I take the opportunity, I have to back out on my sports commitment and will let down 3 other athletes and 2 coaches who are counting on me to be there. They will be able to replace me with a less talented athlete if I back out, but that jeopardizes the other 3 athletes chances of making the national team. I report to the other city for training in 3 weeks. I haven't told the coaches about this dilemma yet because I'm not sure what to do.

Appreciate taking the time to read! Any perspective would be really appreciated."

Not even because my life is so difficult, there are no problems I can not escape. But my stress level is through the roof because I worry about every single aspect.

**Education-wise**

I am in my third year of my bachelor degree. About to start an internship. (One more year to go after the internship. Which consists of specialization and thesis).

I am good at what I do, but I do not feel like I master it. I am like extremely average at everything. But the things I focus on I do reasonably well. I won't be the best, I won't outspecialize someone else. This sucks, since I rather focus on few things really well and help others. Facilitate instead of produce or do myself.

But knowing that in my field I will not be the best, not be a specialist. Means I won't know everything. This scares me because I hate being held responsible when I was already doubting myself. Hence why I prefer to facilitate, and not manage or lead.


**Part-time job**

It is very closely related to my degree. I learn new things everyday, but again. I am not the best, and I seemingly just dont have it in me to become the best. I constantly second guess and I do not feel comfortable delivering work which a specialist should be doing.

I need to take the time to look over a request when it comes in. In face to face situations, it is difficult to tell someone you need some time to figure it out. Eventually I get away with it, but if my boss, co-workers, or clients knew what was running through my mind. They would fire me.

**Socially**

I love going out with friends and doing new things. It is all about experiencing, since I never went out much, this is a lot of fun. But I worry constantly... Meeting girls, meeting new friends, talking to people. It all brings a dynamic which I try to dissect and understand. As we all know, emotions fuck up everything (or make something beautiful), so this intrigues me. What if I do this, will she respond in a positive or a negative way?

It is amazing as long as nobody gets hurt or too manipulative. But I feel sick to my stomach having to handle all these issues. Being there for friends who got hurt, who have problems, who just want to 'get something off their chest'. It tears me apart on the inside, where do I put my issues? I dont want to bother them, they can't help, won't do anything. I am losing myself in doing 'whats right' to help others and not what benefits me anymore.

This girl likes me, we flirt a lot. Anyone else would have stepped up the game by now... Not me. I am scared. Afraid that she might actually like me. I don't know why this scares me. I feel very uncomfortable.

**Being a weirdo**

I overthink everything. Philosophy, cultural, economical, political, social... ALL issues. My brain is constantly grinding the information and trying to find absolute perfect solutions to every problem.
Disrupt me and I'll go silent, recalibrate what you were disrupting me for... Sheepishly laugh and answer to the best of my abilities.
Unmotivated by the lack of results in previous ambitions, I am in this infinite cycle of barely getting by doing things I don't enjoy while never really getting any enjoyment out of any other aspect of my life.
I only ever feel happy or comfortable when watching movies or series.

Please help me, I am lost.
I want out, I want to quit. But I know I can't. I am part of this system now. I have obligations and am entangled in other people's well being. I am part of their life, but not of my own.

If necessary, I feel like ending it altogether because over last couple years I just noticed that I feel more and more like I will never find my place because I am so internally conflicted. But then I think of how weak it would be and I sort of postpone the thoughts to some other time.

Enjoying what I do, but struggling to get by and could use some advice. I've seen some really great suggestions on this forum in the past and would appreciate any input.

I just began my first job as a business analyst/systems analyst for a startup. The job requires a mix of programming, consulting, web development, optimization, and analytics. My main role has been working with an industry optimization programming language writing code to assign a distribution of vehicles within regions across the nation. They had been struggling with this for a while before I arrived, but with my background in applied math (and some relevant coursework) this has been pretty simple for me. 

Now I admit, I took the initial offer to start at $34600/year plus healthcare benefits covered up to $400/month. Being previously without work experience (no internships), and hurting for cash while on the job search, I accepted the offer. The CEO had interviewed me personally and I thought he was one of the better interviewers I'd spoken with which seemed promising. I now work primarily with him and the other owners, along with IT, on some of their larger projects.

Minimum salaries for business and systems analysts around here begin at ~$45k. These guys are very smart, talented individuals with other successful startups, which leads me to believe that they MUST know they are underpaying me. 

It's also been personally difficult moving across the country to LA and with student loan grace periods ending, I cannot afford to live at my current salary. I feel I should ask for a raise up to at least the $45k, but would this be too much given where I am now? Regardless, I can't afford to keep my current rate. 

Is it reasonable to ask for that much?

What's the best way to approach this?

And what if they say no?

What should I watch out for?"

The project I'm working on is really boring and is not the least bit interesting. It is basically a giant CRUD app made with ASP.NET, C# and some other Microsoft crap. I looked through the code and it is absolutely terrible. Most functions are 200+ lines long and there are magic strings everywhere, along with tons of deeply nested if/else blocks. I'm not surprised because my coworkers (who have been working there a few years) are all from Full Sail University... 

What should I do? I don't want to quit the internship but I want to make the work tolerable, and end up learning something useful in the long run. "

I plan on walking in tomorrow and asking, I've already put my app in. I was told that since I didn't put down for full time they passed me up. It was a call center job, and my stats were great. They're hiring like crazy, and I have higher ups who can vouch for me. I don't mind working full time, but then that would make going to school too difficult. 

The issue is, my college is giving me the runaround. My program was supposed to be a year. I've been there for a year and 3 months now, and when I went in to class they told me they pushed my grad back to september. I failed one class, which I'm currently retaking, but they keep pushing my internship back, and adding classes that I was not told were necessary. They're really dropping the ball with my financial aid too, and because of that they keep asking me for cash payments. 

If I go back to work, school will need to be put on the back burner for a while. I want to push through and finish, but I'm tired of being broke.

Forgive me, this might be all over the place.

First he has an anger problem. He knows this and I know this. When I was younger, I had a lot of insecurity issues. I was abused heavily by mom verbally and emotionally which evolved into physical abuse (pushing and she choked me once while drunk). He also knows this.

When I say anger problem, I mean the switch gets flipped and the sweet, caring, intelligent guy I fell in love with punched holes in walls, stole my car (which I gave him the spare keys to get to work) to chase me down when I left the house, threw me through a screen door, tore down my bedroom door piece by piece when I locked him out, hit me (I hit him back eventually). Just bad bad bad. 

We separated for a year and that's when I changed. I grew up, called myself on my shit and tried to work it out. I moved to Hawaii to intern and ran short of money. We'd never really stopped talking and right before I was set to leave the island and lamented I'd have to go back to my tiny town, he offered to have me move to him in a city across the country. The move made sense and we took months to talk things through and became the couple all his friends envied. 

His family loves me. His friends love me. I wanted him to love me. And he said he did and I believe him. But the problems never really stopped. Instead of taking the stance of fighting back, I tried to convince him to try counseling. I could see the patterns of his behavior not just with me, but in life. He would feel threatened, slip into rage mode, destroy everything around him either with words or his fists, then fall into a depression.

After the depression, there was never a ""I'm sorry"". Only a ""I'm sorry, but you..."" My responses changed from ""How DARE you?!"" to ""I can't make you feel or do anything. I'm not your puppeteer""

He's in the entertainment industry. He doesn't always get paid because a lot was networking. I, too, want to be involved in the arts. But we needed a paycheck. So I landed a great job. But I became frustrated when he couldn't pay rent twice in a row and finally tried to talk to him about it.

He exploded and I paid the price from then on. He accused me of resenting him, of lying about supporting us, being too ""negative"" about his work. Maybe it was all true. I was so frustrated.

It came to a head last month (18 months after I moved here) when he said in a rage, ""YOU NEED TO MOVE OUT"" and I started looking for rooms. I gave him one last chance and he agreed to couple's counseling. The night before he exploded on me again (I don't remember why, honestly. Maybe he was scared of counseling) and I declared the relationship over.

The next day he sent me a barrage of texts on the way to counseling stating he hated me and never wanted to see again. We got through the session and things were better. We made it to another and I saw progress. The counselor called him on what I had been saying but we left with him feeling bad and saying he didn't get counseling since it was just him talking and I wasn't being called on what I did.

I wanted to make it another. But we got into argument at lunch. I tried to talk to him last night about it but he just started yelling at me so loud our neighbors called the security guard to check in. He demanded I move out (again) and, well, I was actually looking for rooms while he was yelling at me. 

Then the nastiness started. He called me a lying, little bitch. That the problem was my dad gave me too much freedom and my mother abused me so I don't know how to communicate. I was a two-faced pig. And he hated me. I had emasculated him in the relationship and acted like an authority figure. He got right in my face screaming at me until he had me laying down on my side on the bed.

We still share the apartment until I can get into my next one (seeing three this week!) and he is now in depression mode. Weeping in bed with the curtains drawn. I know he got out once today as I called a mutual friend that would keep this private (I'm not trying to ruin his career and reputation, he needs help not to be ostracized) to drop in on him while I was at work.

So why am I writing this? Because while I'm holding it together and know I don't deserve to be treated this way, I'm completely shattered inside. I feel so stupid and left to drift. When someone who knows you so well can seem to forget everything about you and then do the absolute worst thing to you while saying it's your fault, that he's only ever been like this with you, it's confusing. 

I'm worried that I am this monster he described. I caught myself thinking I could never be in a relationship again because maybe I'm just bad at it. Maybe I'll get with someone else and they'll say I'm self-absorbed and a ""horror"".

 
---   
**tl;dr**: Ended my relationship with my massively abusive boyfriend and I'm lost in a sea of thoughts that range from excited for the future to maybe I am the monster he described. "

To be honest, I'd much rather work for the company I had my internship with.  The commute would be MUCH nicer (Around 10 minutes rather than 30-60 minutes depending on traffic), and the pay would probably be better.

Should I tell him that I already found a job, but I'm still interested?  Should I tell him I'm interested, but NOT tell him I just started somewhere else?

Should I even apply at ALL?  If I DO apply, how do I handle scheduling interviews if I'm offered one?  I'm not really sure I can take time off for them right now, and I imagine it'd be a terribly bad idea to tell my current manager that I'm taking interviews at other jobs.

I am a computer science student at a university and I just finished my second year of school. As soon as I got out, I began searching for a summer job and ended up getting hired as a web developer intern at an international company. 

I have had jobs before, but never anything more than minimum wage retail positions. So this is my first experience working in an office environment. 

I showed up for my first day of work and felt immediately overwhelmed. I didn't recognize any of the software they were using, the programming was almost all unfamiliar to me, and I have no idea what I'm doing. None of this was explained to me when I interviewed. 

So today was my second day. I still feel useless. I want to contribute, but I feel like I'm drowning. I'm trying to absorb as much as possible, but because I'm only here for three months, I feel like there's an expectation that I should be hitting the ground running.

I try to be self sufficient and take care of my own problems, but I've got so much to learn that I keep having to ask my boss for help. I feel like I'm burdening him and the stress of the new work environment is breaking me down. 

I have this constant pit in my stomach. I get home from work at 5pm and am so worn out that I just sleep. I am absolutely miserable and I am absolutely horrified that my boss is going to tell me to leave because I'm in over my head. 

I feel pressured that I can't live up to the expectations of my employer and I feel disappointed in myself for not being able to do my job. 

I want to succeed more than anything in the world but it's only my second day and I'm ready to implode. :("

I'm fresh out of college, so I'm mostly conflicted on deciding on general job vibe/potential versus career growth. Personally, I'm conflicted on deciding between Option A which seems like it would be more ""fun"" and Option B which seems like it would be a better choice for advancing my career with the added bonus of a slightly higher salary. With all the experience that there is in this subreddit, I'd greatly appreciate any advice for a fresh graduate. Thanks in advance!

**Background on me:**

* Just graduated

* Currently living and wanting to work in Southern California area

* 4 internships of experience

* Wanting to work in mobile (specifically iOs development)

* Biggest factors in my decision (in order of most preferred): Salary, Location, Employee Perks/Office, Potential Career Development, Company Recognizability



**Here are the comparison of the two options:**

 | Option A | Option B
:--------|:--------|:---------
Company Size | Growing, well-known company | ""Startup"" Mobile app vendor company that is still small at roughly 30 employees. They were formed in late 2013, I believe
Experience With Company | I've been with this company for about one and a half years working as an intern. Started when the company was relatively small, and have seen the company almost triple in size. Currently have a lot of friendships with coworkers (although many aren't in the same department as me) | Met a few members of the team in an interview. Company is led by successful engineers from big companies. Both of the owners have patents and I get a good vibe from them
Company Growth | Job seems relatively stable and growth looks like it won't be slowing down any time soon | They're looking to bring on 20 more employees by the end of the year.
Company Office | Cool company office with modern designs | Typical small office in a commercial business building
Company Location | 15 minutes away | 40 minutes away
Employee Perks | Company parties/outings have been some of the best experiences I've had. Cool employee perks (discounts with partners/services, monthly lunches, yearly holiday party, stocked kitchen with snacks, free on-site cafeteria and gym) | Little to no employee perks, Low-stocked kitchen (free drinks is pretty much it)
Work Hours | Flex Hours | Flex Hours
Base Salary | $5,000 less, but a $5,000 signing bonus for first year | $5,000 more
Yearly Bonus | 10% dependent on performance, but from what I hear, you are not likely to receive it |  20% dependent on performance
Yearly Salary Adjustment | Usually 5-10% | Usually 5-10%
Health Benefits | Medical, Vision, Dental all paid for | Medical paid for, Vision, Dental are optional
401K | Matching up to 5% | No 401K with matching yet, but is expected to be setup by the end of the year
Profit sharing/Stock | Absolutely none | Yes, details after signing
Personal Career Growth | Now that the company has grown a lot in size, I'm not sure there's a lot of chance to move up in the company quickly, not quite sure the current structure would allow me to learn and advance my skills at the speed I'd like (My internship has taught me a lot, but mostly by throwing me into a fire and self-learning) |  Showed interest in mentoring me and developing me as a programmer, *Seems* like I'd have a greater possibility to move up in the company within a few years
Long-Term | Since I feel like the company has little opportunities for advancement, I feel like I would *have* to be moving on to another company within two years to advance my career (but it's two more years of perks, right?) | Unless the company grows large successfully, I can definitely see myself leaving the company for a better position elsewhere within two years
Negotiations | Firm Offer that can't be modified per HR's rules | Supposedly highest offer. The company said this is their best offer since they do not want to go back and forth with negotiations. I'm not sure if this is a negotiation tactic or an honest statement. From what I've read from the FAQ, it seems like I should still try to negotiate.


** EDIT 1: Thanks for the initial feedback. I was actually kind of surprised by the overwhelming advice for Option A. I guess there is a lot of advice against start ups. Anyway, just to provide a little more information that I should have elaborated on earlier.

* The commute actually will be similar, I will be living essentially 50 minutes away from both options until I buy a house (hopefully one year from now) in the location I want to live.

* I've asked for further details into profit sharing, will likely hear back later today.

* Yes, both companies offer the same PTO

* The offers are for roughly $80

* The interesting thing about Option B is that it is a startup, but isn't funded by VCs. Since it is a vendor company, it is running on the funds from its first client, which is actually helping out in the hiring process (since they are paying for the hiring). But then again, the company may also run out of funds if it loses its clients (although it seems like the first client is in it for the long run)."

""Which programming languages/programs do I need to learn and use?""

I have 1 full year (5 days a week, from 9 till 5 (excluding free time)) to make it happen.

*""Come on, it's time you met the bastard himself.""* Motorcycle IT Guy (MITG) said, walking out of his office. He turned down one of the halls out of the IT Dregs and into the beige maze of offices. I was quick on his heel, since I was an eager little PFY. We turned into a larger bullpen styled area with about fifteen to twenty interns and assistants chattering away. The smell of Coffee and desperation filled the air, it was slightly off setting in a way. MITG didn't wait for me, he turned into another hallway and stopped in front of an office. He motioned me in, and I entered the room. 

*""Who are you!?""* The man screamed at me. He was in his early 70's, with a small stature. He didn't look threatening in the least, what with his artic white hair and glasses. His entire office smelled like cheap cologne, and there was paper littered everywhere. You couldn't take two steps without landing on a pile of papers, his desk was bowed with the weight of a small redwood worth of print outs. 

""I'm rstrt, the new IT tech."" I looked behind me to see MITG nowhere to be found. ""MITG told me to come see you, but didn't tell me why. So what seems to be the problem?"" The man didn't introduce himself, he didn't even look directly at me. It was as if once I said I was IT I became less than human in his eyes, his cold, dead eyes. 

*""The computer crashed!""* He bellowed. I was slightly taken aback by the volume and tone of him talking to me. I glanced at the monitor to see about a hundred Outlook messages open, along with several other programs. *""So fix it! Don't stand there like an idiot.""* I opened my mouth to reply, but didn't get the chance. *""Oh, so you ARE an idiot then. Great, just like the last one.""*

 ""Did you see a blue screen when it crashed? Did it restart?"" I decided it was wise to ignore his verbal attacks, MITG did tell me he was a bastard. 

*""No, I didn't see the blue screen.""* His response was patronizing, at best. *""I said it CRASHED. I was browsing the web and it crashed. Do I need to write this down for you?""*

 I reached over and moved his mouse, reopening the Internet Explorer window he had open, but hidden behind his copious amounts of Outlook mail items. 

""Was this what you were looking at?"" The screen showed an opera house, he was buying tickets for. 

*""God, it's about time you got to fixing it.""* He went back to his browsing and waved me out of the office. I rounded the corner to see MITG leaning against a wall, smiling. 

*""That's Dan, and he's going to be your best friend here.""*

I've been in a monogamous relationship with my girlfriend since Dec. 25th, 2010. We've had a lot of ups, and a few really bad downs. I've broken up with her a couple of times only for her to win me back over and this is the cycle I've been with since I started college.

I've got trust issues, admittedly, and she knows this and has known this since day one mostly because every woman who has been in life has wronged me and I don't trust people easily, my father wasn't worth his salt so I tend to be actually fairly reserved with everyone tbh. 

About 6 months into our relationship, a friend who ""saved her life"" wanted to go to a concert with her, she didn't tell me about it, and said she was going to a friends wedding thing. I confronted her on the matter, nothing was going to come of it she said, and she didn't go to her friends wedding party or whatever because she was worried I wouldn't trust her at that point anyways.

Fast forward a couple of months, we got into a huge fight about my brother moving in because he had no place to go, my 3 year old nephew had no roof over his head, so I said cmon but you gotta get on your feet and handle your share of bills. We got in a huge fight and I was in a lease with her and as opposed to fighting more, and dealing with a long running issues of her unhappiness I asked my brother to find somewhere else to stay. This put some distance between us because I just had to tell my brother who has sole custody of my nephew, and my nephew, on the streets to make her happy. Not long down the road we got into a big argument over my brother again (if you want more details I'll elaborate) and i told her I was tired of having to choose between her and my family and told her we need to take a break for awhile because my family is important to me, I have no friends and she would barely allow time for family.

Within 24 hours of this, the irony is she was on the phone with her ex (who lives 2k miles away) and I caught her where she tried to deny it. I told her, in all realness it doesn't matter because I'd just broken up with her, but I thought it was rather convenient &amp;/or odd that she was on the phone and talking to her ex THAT fast.

She came around and apologized, told me she was sorry, said my brother could move in if he needed to and we started to work on things, we stayed together and renewed our lease a couple months later.

Later I found her talking to her ex again about 5 months down the road, and I lost my shit calling her out on her poor moral/ethical values in a relationship. We even ended up getting over this after some deep conversation regarding our relationship where we were both at fault for not appreciating each other for enough, showing that, and following through in it. Having thought we acknowledged these problems and started adjusting for the issues, I can accept fault where I am at fault and progress to do better. 

A couple of years have passed at this point and we are in our 3rd lease. Our sex life has came to a screeching halt for weeks at a time in several cases and I tried to discuss these issues with her and she seemed to just not be in the mood, I informed her she's not happy and I can see it, what can I do to make her happy? The real answer here was ...nothing, apparently.

We had a lot of good times, and we had some rough spots too but things ad been working out alright when suddenly our intimacy and friendship
started dwindling yet again and we signed a lease in July/August and its been about 4 months since. I work 30-35 hours a week and go to college at 15 credit hours a semester (5 classes) and my time is strung. I have literally not been to a single college party, college event, or anything else because WHEN I get free time, I choose to spend it with her doing anything, asking to do anything. Bike ride, walk, puzzle, game, movie, anything. I ask if we have problems, she says no everything is fine. one night she's acting rather ...different, quiet all night etc, and I asked a few times if everything was ok, is there anything to talk about? Yes, everything is fine, no nothing to talk about.

The next morning I woke from a bad dream, bad feeling in my gut, and I checked her phone. There were pages...and pages...and pages of FB conversation with the same ex. This is the 3rd time I've caught her talking to this guy and I absolutely lose my shit starting by snapping her phone in half, breaking my hand on a wall because of how mad I got and I didn't want to hit her, I could never hit a girl, it's simply not in my character. 

I break up with her, we're through. It's done. She begged me to hurt her for it, she felt guilty and said she deserved it. I refuse, she keeps begging me to hurt her. I told her I'm moving out, my mind is racing...wtf am I gonna go I'm in a lease and I cant afford to move, to buy out my lease, or anything. I go to leave and shes still begging me to hurt her, so I go take my gun with me because shes begging to hurt herself etc, and she goes stupid. So I took her gun, took both guns to the police station, informed them what was going on, and they followed me back to the property to ensure she was ok, after all my hands are bloody/swollen and they asked if I struck her I said of course not, they can look at the wall for proof, my skin was still on it.

We spent 2 days of her begging me, attempting to touch me even on the arm and I couldn't stand the thought of her for days. She shows me a message she sent to her ex saying he has to stop contacting her, its ruining her relationship, they are ex's for a reason, etc. I dunno how or why but at the time all I could feel is how much I loved her, and how hurt I was by this. Nothing literally happened because I KNEW he lived 2k miles away. 

tidbit of info, she goes out to Seattle, WA in May, 2013 where her friend lives and there was a literal 2 day blackout where we didn't speak or text at all and she said she was in the mountains, had some pics to prove it. A) I think she cheated on me because at the time, I didn't realize her ex was only 2 hours from where she flew to, he lived in Oregon...now having learned this shit WHILE SHE WAS THERE, and right around that blackout, my mind went a bit crazy and all I could think about was her fucking her ex.

So getting back to Feb. 2014 to this huge breakup with the cops involved, all I can think about is the one thing I loved so dearly has betrayed me unforgivingly. After she sent him that message with the only working device, my phone, I felt a little reassurance. Since both her phone, her laptop, and ipod got destroyed 2 by her, phone by me) during that argument (i was going to read whatever they discussed as i hadn't initially, just scrolled through the BOOK sized conv. they had over FB) she wasn't on electronics again for a couple weeks until I bought her another phone after things had started to go back to normal, whatever that was at this point. I tried to make myself forget about this, put this behind me

Now here we are, its May a few months later. Shes already fallen back into online social hole of spending hours on FB and Pinterest and dusting me off when she gets bored there. I love her, I'm no longer in love with her. I told her we would work on this and see where things go, the problem is I know what damage has been done to me is permanent I feel. I have nightmares Biut her sleeping with people, I am thinking about what she does while I'm gone to my internship for 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. I know my trust will never be the same again with her, yet for the past couple of months she has tried so very hard, and I can tell, to make me feel like I'm her king. Just yesterday she wrote a very sweet letter, but in the back of my mind whilst Im reading it all I'm saying is ""If I'm the best thing that happened to you, why did you do this to me and lie about it in the same night, not talk to me about where we stood...or she stood emotionally with us"". My love for her is real, me being in love with her is over.

She thinks everything is ok, but I want to leave her at the end of my internship. I want this before we both get 10 years into marriage with kids and her get bored of me, again, and do something like this again to drive me to shoot myself or something crazy. 

So I ask reddit, when do I tell her....how should I tell her Ive fallen out of love with her because of what shes done, the many times there were weeks of no affection, and her untrustworthiness i just cannot get over?

Sorry such along post...maybe I should have made it a few different posts. Ask me anything pertaining to any of it, I'm an open book.

264pcy,1,2014-05-21,Running vs Walking?,[deleted],loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/264pcy/running_vs_walking/,"Hey loseit,

I'm a 19 year old male college student. I put on some weight during the school year and have been trying to drop it (CW: 176, GW: 165ish) since summer started. Losing weight over the summer has never been an issue for me, but this summer I have an internship and am taking the MCAT, so it's harder to be active. I've been running or lifting almost daily (usually 5-6 days per week) and have been using MFP with a daily calorie limit of around 1800. I've been losing a bit under a pound per week, but I'd like to speed the process up a little. 

This is where the running vs walking question comes in. I love running, but when I run for 30-45 minutes, it feels like I wasted time that I should use to study. In an attempt to fix this, I've started running 1.5 miles in the morning and then walking for another 30-60 minutes at night while going over notes or flashcards. It seems that I end up burning about the same amount of calories (according to the treadmill), but is walking as effective as running for weight loss? I've come across a bunch of articles that claim that people lose more weight when running (even if they walk for a longer period of time), but shouldn't this be a matter of calories in vs calories out at the end of the day?"
264ps5,2,2014-05-21,"21yr White Male - Possible Stroke 1 year ago, please advise",[deleted],AskDocs,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/264ps5/21yr_white_male_possible_stroke_1_year_ago_please/,"Background info: 1 Year ago I moved to NYC for the summer. I was an intern for an investment bank so the workload was heavy. I don’t smoke, use any narcotics, and do not take any prescription medications. I am a 21 year old male, 6 foot 2, 275 pounds (lineman build – not skinny but no one would say I look fat). I have very SLIGHTLY high blood pressure, my grandfather died of a heart attack at age 63, and my father has high blood pressure. There’s no history of stroke on my dad’s side but my mother’s ide has a history of multiple strokes.

**The Facts:
**

* On a Friday night 1 year ago I went out to one of my favorite bars in the meatpacking district.  Metup with some friends from back home that I’ve known for years and I had 2 drinks (yes just 2). After about an hour I hopped on the subway, ate a little bit when I got home and then went to bed around midnight. 

* At approximately 4AM I woke up with horrible nausea, a splitting headache and I was EXTREMELY dizzy. I could hardly sit up. I tried to getup to get to the trash can and practically collapsed as soon as my feet hit the floor. 

* I could barely move my arms or legs and just had enough strength to support myself over the trashcan. All the while I had an absolutely splitting headache, it was very hard to see/focus even with the lights on in the room. I then attempted to get to the bathroom but ended up having to crawl. I got into the shower, turned on cold water and just there. I couldn’t move, I couldn’t feel, I couldn’t think. I didn’t have enough energy to stand or even talk and I noticed numbness all over my body. 

* I also had severe “pins and needles” on my right side. After about 6 hours into this ordeal I feel as if I finally was able to think clearly – and truthfully that was the first moment I even considered calling the paramedics. Some may say these are hangover symptoms but they truly made me feel as if I were to die. I can leg press 1000+ pounds, bench 175+ and still have the stamina to run a 5K. That’s why I was so scared – I’ve never felt so weak and powerless in my entire life. I’ve felt 10x stronger after a major surgery.

So – why am I asking about this 1 year later? This past year I’ve not been myself at all. I was a 4.0 student going into my senior year of undergrad, extremely social, and was extremely motivated. I noticed after the “incident” that I immediately felt much more challenged by my workload. I was late to work and left tasks unfinished. I pushed through as best I could but was nowhere near my performance when I started working. I got started back at school for my last year and just couldn’t concentrate on anything. I skipped most all of my classes and skipped exams – throughout everything I was just completely apathetic. I also became somewhat reclusive; I got a 2.0 GPA first semester senior year and a 3.0 last semester. My girlfriend noticed that my right eyelid seemed to be drooping (noticeably), I stumbled over my words and just wasn’t as sharp as I once was. I hear the words, I recognize the words, but my brain just doesn’t process those words into sentences that I can immediately understand.

What could this have been? If it wasn’t a stroke what else could’ve caused both the physical and mental symptoms? What kind of doctor do I see to test for a stroke a year ago (if that’s even possible)? What else should I explore?

**TL;DR – Hardly ever sick in my life, had incident a year ago that caused severe weakness and almost complete inability to move for about 5ish hours, since incident I’ve had severe depression, complete loss of motivation, anxiety, lost my 4.0 GPA, I have a slightly drooping right eyelid, trouble understanding sentences, difficulty concentrating and I am reclusive. A complete 180 from my personality and academic record for the past 21 years. None of these symptoms existed before the incident.

264r99,6,2014-05-21,"I'm looking to get into the IT field, but don't know how to go about getting hired (at a local store).",Praedonis,techsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/264r99/im_looking_to_get_into_the_it_field_but_dont_know/,"I'm sixteen. I work close to full time (39-41 hours a week) at a Jimmy John's in my downtown area a couple minutes from my house in addition to school. I downright love it; the work, my coworkers, etc...

...but I'm looking to soon begin something more serious that could possibly give me some insight into a few different fields. With my current schedule, an internship (unless paid) isn't exactly something that I'd find myself interested in.

There's a local computer store called, ""[CLASSIFIED] Computers."" I've been looking around and talking to people, and their positions are in-store hire only (you have to walk in to acquire an application; no online submissions). I am perfectly okay with that, and I believe I'd do well in a considerably professional application acquisition situation. Dress nice, hair's nice, smell and look clean. Possibly a tie, just for the hell'v'it.

So, no problem there. But my issue is not the actual process of filling out an application, it's simply *getting* *hired* as a **sixteen** year old with only one prior job reference (amongst recommendations from current professors).

My background consists primarily of the construction and takedown of computers, but that is limited and I'd love to learn more. I've built my own gaming computer from scratch (purchased all the parts off of NewEgg, assembled it myself) and swapped out a few mobile hard drives on laptops due to file corruption. I can blaze through operations on a computer, type fast (probably doesn't matter), and have no problem ridding a PC of malware or running a defrag... I digress. The bulk of my computer knowledge comes from knowing design programs (Adobe Photoshop, After Effects, InDesign, and Illustrator). I have loads of projects I could possibly input into a portfolio. The last of my computer based knowledge comes from coding in C++. I've got limited experience (just took a semester long class at my high school) yet am furthering my own personal knowledge on it every day through examples and random projects I work on. Arrays, loops, conditionals, variables, functions... it's all familiar to me. I'm going to be taking an AP Computer Science (learning the extensiveness of Java in its entirety) class next year.

I ramble a lot. Sorry.

Nonetheless, here's what I'm asking...

* With my background and experience, what's the likeliness that I can ascertain a position at a computer repair/parts place with my age?

* With my experience, what should I be including in my portfolio with my resume? Should I include any of my artsy projects made in Adobe programs, or do those not apply to these kinds of positions?

* What's a reasonable wage to ask for? (I'm currently working minimum wage and won't mind working minimum wage for another couple of years)

Thank you so much for hearing me out and listening to me in advance. ^^^I ^^^love ^^^you."
2650xm,3,2014-05-21,So my girlfriend and I broke up/went on a break for a while because of my own issues. I want to improve myself as much as possible before possibly trying to get her back.,jewfro667,askseddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/askseddit/comments/2650xm/so_my_girlfriend_and_i_broke_upwent_on_a_break/,"I know the usual thig you say, which is a break is a break up and that I should move on. I really don't feel like moving on because this girl is probably one of the greatest girls I know. Without going into it too much, we basically started fighting a lot because I was stressed about not being where I want to be in life at this point and feeling inadequate. I have a shitty internship that isn't satisfying and the job hunt stresses me out so I got irritable very quickly and started fights with her. She always supported me. 

Anyway, we both decided that this can't keep happening and decided on a break. I want to know how I can become the man she fell for a year and a half ago because she looked at me and said that I'm not the man she fell for, which really hurt, especially seeing her cry. Anyway, I want to become even better than that guy and am looking for advice on what you recommend I do. 

Also, I do plan to date around still. I just don't think I want a relationship for a while until I get my stuff together. I'm giving myself a few months to decide if I want her back and then will go from there regarding that. 

Tl;dr: girlfriend of 1.5 years and I had mutual breakup because I don't have my shit together and kept getting irritated despite her support, want to become better than the guy she fell for a year ago and possibly get her back in the future. 

Edit: so I decided against my better judgement to see her today and talk in person. A lot of crying happened. Then I told her it would be better to take a break from each other because we don't have a lot of relationship experience. I told her that I won't talk to her for a little while and then we can see what happens. She still wants to hook up though, which I don't really want to do at this time. So yeah, I surprisingly feel a lot better after that. It was really therapeutic. Now I don't know what's going to happen. "
2653a5,10,2014-05-21,I got hair follicle surgery (continued from 5 months ago),lo1ly,tressless,https://www.reddit.com/r/tressless/comments/2653a5/i_got_hair_follicle_surgery_continued_from_5/,"Hey guys. Sooo I'm back. Here's my original thread i posted 2 or 3 days after my surgery [boom] (http://www.reddit.com/r/tressless/comments/1tf9ky/i_just_got_hair_implant_surgery/). So It's been a long 5 months since my surgery, and I am going to try to make this thread as detailed as I possibly can. 

Note: I may add to this thread, but I will try to put it into sections so people don't have to read a long wall of texts, and can just read sections instead.

Preface (Chapter 1): So I'm a 22 year old dude ( Turn 23 tomorrow) who started going bald probably at the age of late 20, but didn't start really noticing it until I turned 22. Once I started noticing, shit got bad quick. My boss at my internship made a couple remarks, but said ""don't get surgery."" I stuck it out through the summer and then at the end I saw a billboard saying something like ""We grow hair!"" So I gave them a call and met with a consultant for free.


Pre Surgery (Chapter 2): Going into this meeting I had no idea what to expect, but in walks in a dude with beautiful full white head of hair. We talked about hair follicles, and told me his story and showed me his before and after pictures, and I was stunned. I couldn't believe this was the same dude. Anyways, we started talking about hair follicles and what procedures would need to be done. I started taking Minoxidil (basically rogain) and some special shampoo (not really sure if it does much). We met 2 other times, talked about pricing, and I finally decided to take a risk, say fuck it, and do the surgery. As of this point I'm still in my senior year of college, and decided to do the surgery during my christmas break, December 20th. There wasn't much prep before my surgery other than taking minoxidal and another thing the night before my surgery.


The surgery (Chapter 3): The surgery took 4 hours, and they pulled follicles from the back of my head, because those follicles get more blood flow therefore wont die, and placed them in the crown of my head. They took around 3500 hair follicles. I was out for the entire surgery, but I guess that's really uncommon for that to happen. You're supposed to be awake for like 2 hours of it, so I'm not sure if that part hurts. I heard it doesn't. Anyways after the surgery I felt fine, but had to get someone to pick me up. I had to leave the bandages on my head and sleep upright for the next couple of days, since I had sort of a big surgery.


Post Surgery (Chapter 4): I read other people's stories from blogs saying there was little to no pain. For me, I had some discomfort. Yes hydrocodon was extremely helpful, but I personally felt pain for about 3-5 days. I had scabs on my head, and I was given instructions how to treat them fro the next 10-15 days. They started falling off in the shower around day 10 from light massages. After around 10-12 days, I was back to ""normal."" Things looked worse than before, but it was because they had to cut the original hair follicles to see where exactly to place the new ones.


Months 1-5 (chapter 5):  The First month was extremely noticeable and wore hats to hide it, but honestly, nobody would have guessed I got surgery. People just would have said ""wow, he's really balding quickly. But things started to grow quickly. Month 2 wasn't much better, but there was definitely improvement. Still felt a little self conscious, but things were looking better. Month 3 showed a lot of improvement, but I was starting to get skeptical. I wondered if my $6,000 investment was a bad one. Things were still growing, and I felt a little more at ease when I saw a new wave of hair follicles sprout. Month 4, this is when shit got real. My hair started to look awesome, and damn near complete out of nowhere. Month 5, things seem to have been done, but I met with the original consultant. He was amazed with the progress, and told me the hair follicles were going to continue thickening up for the next 3 months to come... so that was good news

Reflection: I've been very happy with my investment. I didn't lack confidence prior to the surgery, but just wanted to look my peek during the prime years of my life. I've gained more confidence, and am sure it will help me in my career, as it has already helped me in my romantic life. I wouldn't get the surgery thinking it will make you happy, but if it's something you've been thinking about, just talk to someone.




With all that said, I hope you have learned something from my experience. During my last post, I got a lot a shit for getting a surgery from a billboard, getting the surgery at the age of 22, and only spending $6000 on it. All I can say is I'm living evidence that hair follicle treatment does work, and I'm glad to have hair for 15+ years.

One last thing.. I will still take minoxidil, and I am going to start taking propecia when I start my Job come July. If you wanna message me. Feel free."
2653ve,0,2014-05-21,Need some job advice.,[deleted],engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/2653ve/need_some_job_advice/,"So I feel like I'm at the point of no return. Here's a little background as to my situation:

* Graduated in May with a degree in Biological Engineering w/ an Environmental Engineering focus with a 3.0 GPA from a well respected state university
* Internship experience at DOT doing drainage work, a bit of permitting, and some storm water
* Designed and Constructed a Bioretention cell for our senior design project for the City of Wilmington
* Lots of experience in AutoCAD, Microstation, Excel
* Passed the FE in October of 2013

I interviewed with three companies. Two of the three are large well established firms with offices nationwide. The other is VERY small (literally just one PE who owns it, with his brother working as a CAD tech). The company that I really badly wanted to work with does mostly water treatment work (the position was for civil/site development) and I really liked everyone I interviewed with, plus they had compensation for doing part time masters (which I was really want to do in the future). The second larger one seemed ok, but I got a very different vibe from everyone who worked there, the work was not exactly what I wanted to be doing (a LOT of site development for pipelines, oil, and natural gas), but seemed like a decent first job. The third one (with the small company) does a lot of LID projects, site development, and storm water retrofits, which I was very interested in, and got very high remarks from both our senior design mentor (who is well known within the storm water community), and one of the extension specialists who helped us out with our project. 

The first company (the one I really was hoping for) said it was a very tough decision, but they gave the job to somebody else. They did say that I gave a very good interview, and the head of the group said he would love to write me a recommendation if I needed it anywhere else (which was nice). ""Intangibles"" were the reason they gave for picking the other person.

The second company gave me an offer:

* $48,500 with decent benefits (heath, dental, vision, long term disability, life, 401-k)

Due to timing constraints with the offers, the day that I was supposed to give my final word on taking the offer was the day before talking with the very small company about salary and benefits. I ended up stupidly declining the first offer and today I met with the smaller company and they told me that they would be willing to do...

* $43,500 and pay $150 for health insurance/dental/vision, and match contributions into 401-k with standard 21-days off paid per year (including 9 holidays off automatically)

Starting I would be able to have much more responsibility over projects, and I feel like I, overall, would enjoy working there more, but part of me feels like I'm getting duped/I made the wrong decision. This is the only offer I have to work with now (and I already informally agreed to it/shook hands/went out to lunch). Any thoughts? I know this is extremely long and I apologize.

265b76,0,2014-05-21,High Undergrad GPA/low grad GPA,[deleted],gatech,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/265b76/high_undergrad_gpalow_grad_gpa/,"Fellow tech students, I was wondering if anyone has been in a situation where they had a good GPA in undergrad but not so great in grad school, and how to report it on a resume.

I graduate with a 3.9 in AE and continued on to the master's program, and so far it hasn't been going so great. I've been overwhelmed with TA/classes/research and had to drop several classes and only managed a 3.5 so far. 

If this trend continues and my GPA drops even more by the time I get my master's, how should I put these on my resume? I'd like to have my undergrad GPA on there since I don't have any internship experience, but then leaving off my grad GPA seems weird. I'm hoping I can pull my grades up, but I don't know about it given how hard grad classes are (undergrad was a total joke in comparison). 

I've also considered applying for full time jobs and just taking one if I get a good offer and finishing up my master's later when GPA doesn't matter anymore (I'm not enjoying grad school anyway). 

EDIT: I don't consider a 3.5 a bad GPA, I have only finished 2 classes including an undergrad math class I managed an A in. I'm worried about graduating with a GPA closer to 3.0"

I'm a sophomore at a public university doing Math, Computer Science, and Physics. I'm looking to do a Ph.D in computer science right after undergrad. I started in a lab durring my first semester of freshman year and I had a great time, but I was primarily working on other peoples projects. That experience lead me to a summer internship doing research at a government institution. Here im working on my own aspect of a larger project by myself, so I feel like im doing much more meaningful work than I was at my lab at school. My internship ends in August. I was just offered a sort of extension which would allow me to work durring the actual school year. I know I want to work in a lab over this next year, but I'm not sure if it will look bad if I only work in one lab for so long. I love the work I'm doing and certainly plan to continue it next summer at the least, but should I stay in this lab or branch out?"

265k4k,2,2014-05-21,I [22M] ran into an ex-bestfriend/flame [22F] that ruined our friendship and I haven't spoken to in years since I moved away.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/265k4k/i_22m_ran_into_an_exbestfriendflame_22f_that/,"I apologize for advance for the massive wall of text.  I feel it's important to know the entire story of our friendship/relationship thing.

I'll start it off from how we met I suppose.  It was towards the end of our senior year of high school.  This girl was smart, athletic, funny and beautiful.  We knew of each other but hadn't spoken or hung out at all until a few weeks before prom.  She had just ended a year long relationship and was out of a prom date so a mutual friend ended up pairing us together.  From the beginning she let me know that she wasn't looking to start a relationship with me and that I shouldn't expect a kiss or anything after prom, if I still wanted to go she would love to but didn't want to give me the wrong idea.  This immediately let me know what type of person she really was and we became close friends.  We'd text and call each other every day and 
come to each other for advice on things.  Every one wanted us 
to be dating but we thought of each other as friends, she'd confide in her relationships with me as I would with her.

Lets skip ahead to the end of summer after graduation and she's preparing to leave for college that was about an hour away from our home town.  We had a day where we just hung out and talked about our futures with school and how often we'd visit each other at our different schools.  Well at the end of this day she kissed me and said she ""wished I had asked her out then maybe she'd have gone to my school instead or I would have gone to hers"".  I should note that this was the first time either of us were physically intimate with each other because I just considered her way out of my league and too good of a friend.

So we're freshman in college now and continue talking to each other throughout the year and visiting each other but around valentine's day she gets into a relationship with a guy and stops talking to me completely.  I took this as a sign and went on with my life and ended up moving back home from school to do an internship for the summer.  When I was done with this internship I decided to go to a community college in town rather than move back to the University a few hours away again.  She started an internship herself for the fall and took the semester off, we were inseparable.  When we finally started sleeping together she'd drop hints about a future together and what she wanted to do after graduating college.  We expressed we loved each other a couple times.

Now we'll skip ahead again to what would be her sophomore year of college in the spring and I'm still at home going to community college.  She began a relationship towards the end of the semester and I hadn't heard from her other than me occasionally texting to catch up.  She was very short with her answers like ""I'm good, you?"", ""oh ok"", ""good to hear from you"". Now and then she'd come back to town and always want to spend time with me and go do things with our mutual friends and act like we were best friends again but when she went back to school it was the cold shoulder.

Towards the end of 2011 I was offered a great job opportunity a long way from home and I only had a couple weeks from the offering until I needed to move.  I tried every single day of those 2 weeks trying to get a hold of her and to meet up and say goodbye, good luck, kiss my ass, whatever.  I had a bunch of friends that went to the same school as her so I went up to the town to hang out with them and decided I'd try her one last time.  I sent a text that said ""*Hey, I'm in town and really wanted to tell you something important.  Any chance I can take 5 minutes of your time?*""  I considered her my best friend and didn't want to tell her via text.  So a few hours go by and I finally get a response that said ""*FarAndGone you need to leave me ALONE!  This will NEVER happen and I will NOT meet up with you.  Don't speak to me!  Oh and don't bother responding to this because I won't read it.*""

Well the thing was that apparently my texts every day asking to see her had upset her boyfriend and he broke up with her because of it.  How did I know this?  Because that very same night I saw her older sister while my friends and I were out drinking.  I told her I was moving but didn't tell her about the text her little sister sent me.  I left a couple days later and had to get a new work phone from the company, I deleted all of my social networks for awhile but kept my old cell phone around for a week just to see if she'd apologize or something.  Didn't happen.  

I haven't so much as heard her name since I moved but I came back to town this week to visit family for the summer.  I ran into her while I was having lunch with my friends.  She seemed shocked when she saw me and there was without a doubt an awkward tension.  It was a basic interaction with the how are you's and good to see you's.  She went to go for a hug but I pulled away.  I guess she asked one of my friends for my new number because she text me saying she really wants to meet up and talk, then she added me on my new social network pages that I created a short while after I left.

I guess what I'm asking is.  Do I give this woman a chance?  She may apologize or she may just act like that situation never happened and wants to be friends.  I've lost a little bit of weight since I left and gotten a little better looking, in my opinion, and maybe she's had a change of heart since seeing me.  I mean she didn't bother trying to get in touch with me UNTIL she saw me in person.  I'm just confused about it and really I want to see her and tell her to go fuck herself but then I remember how close we used to be and she might have been going through a tough time.

**TL;DR: an old bestfriend refused to see me when I was moving away, destroyed our friendship and now after 3 years wants to meet up and act like all is ok.**"

While I am certainly interested in this side of ECE, I've always seen myself as having a better understanding and maybe a bit of a bias towards hardware. That being said, at the moment I feel outpaced with regards to the kind of work I will soon be expected to do. 

Much of the work (at least my first project) seems that it is going to involve scripting and IDL in a UNIX build environment. Most of my programming experience has been in C++ and Python with some basic MATLAB and Java. I've never written a script let alone IDL, so I feel way in over my head.

Does anyone have any advice for an intern who feels way behind the curve? I'm looking for things along the way of resources, general advice for moving forward, and anything else you guys might have to offer.

EDIT: Sorry if this seemed a little scrambled. My hands are in immense amounts of pain right now because of cutting chilis. Advice on that would be cool too."

Hello new recruit, I know this new surrounding may be a bit shocking to you, but you will learn to love it.  This facility is kept secret from the world, for good reason, but every once in a while, someone with great potential is recruited, so lucky you!  Unfortunately, the life you had before this has been wiped from your mind, and every trace of your existence erased.  What you did before will be nothing compared to the incredible things you will be a part of within these walls.

You will be given a brief orientation, and then you will be assigned a temporary office.  In this office, you will find a welcome basket, containing your rookie manual, a variety of gift cards to the facility stores, a name tag, and a Class 1 access card.  The access card will allow you to obtain up to 500 interns, and a hydra chosen at random.

After your special skills have been identified, you will be given a permanent office in the department you are most likely to excel in.  If your special skills do not fit into a current department, a new one will be created, which you will become head of.  Once placed in a department, you will be given 5 tasks to complete, if you fail to complete these tasks, you will be terminated, mind wiped, and ejected from the facility.  After 5 tasks have been completed, you will receive full clearance to most of the facility, and your intern limit will not be capped.

If you have any further questions, contact your department head.  If for some reason, they are unable to answer your question, then contact the Maximum Order Department Supervisors, or the MODS.  Please enjoy your stay at [REDACTED] Facility.

266i9r,0,2014-05-21,law school admissions advice,throwawaylsatbs,law,https://www.reddit.com/r/law/comments/266i9r/law_school_admissions_advice/,"Hi, 

I was wondering what are my chances of getting into a top 25 school? Below you will find explanations of my academic and personal background. I am particularly interested in Berkeley, UCLA, and Columbia (2 of these 3 are long shots, I know…), but would be very grateful to hear about everyones opinion regardless of school (especially ones that have suggestions for schools they believe I might have a chance at).

Academic Background: Graduate next spring with a Comp sci degree. Current gpa 2.4, trying for a 2.6 by graduation. 162 lsat cold. currently studying for it, and Ill take the real thing in september. First semester I dropped everything. The next 2 contain D’s and F’s. After that I spent a year at a community college studying to be a paramedic, eventually decided that wasn’t for me. Returned and changed my major about three times. The past three years I have held good steady jobs, did one year interning at a hedge fund and the past 2.5 years at a research lab at my university. Have had mostly solid grades since working.

Personal Background: Did policy debate during university for a year, then I joined a student financial club where I held leadership positions. Was part of a group that proactively entered ourselves on behalf of our school in the CFA Research Challenge ( a competition that usually only grad students enter, and where I meet the guy who gave me my hedge fund internship). Afterwords I joined the competitive programming team and won some competitions. I also would like to mention on my ps that I did 4 years of varsity swimming and water polo in high school. And I throw a decent yo momma joke every now and then (that doesn’t go in the ps). Oh and I am a male latino who is also an american citizen (so no immigration issues).

Also, because my gpa sucks, would anyone advise waiting for my lsat score before I start sending in applications this fall? I ask because I would like to send them in as early as possible but perhaps I might get put off when they look at my low gpa and then see that I have yet to send in my lsat scores. I am pretty much riding on my lsat scores to get me in. The wait between when I can first send in my applications and when I can send in my lsat is about 3 weeks.

So, college stuff isn't in the picture right now... and honestly, I don't really want to accrue *more* student loans anyways.

I took a couple admin classes (Linux/Windows), a couple Hardware &amp; Repair classes, and started in to a bit of networking at the end. Right now, all I know is that I like working on computers, and I think I'd like being a troubleshooter guy. And system administration seems like it'd be nice one day as well.

Thing is, while I got some great info at college, I don't think I'm anywhere *near* trained enough for this stuff. I just applied for an entry-level help desk position, and these were some of the qualifications:

*""Experience setting up and troubleshooting internet conections, modems, routers, etc""*

Well, I've logged in to my router and changed settings a few times. I know how to plug stuff in, setup passwords, find a connection, etc. But that's all pretty basic stuff, yeah? I mean, I don't know if I really have the experience that they're looking for...

*""Comfortable with a linux command line""*

Okay, well, I am *comfortable* with it. I don't remember most of the commands, or the ins and outs, because that class moved through the material *really* quickly, but I know how it works. I mean... how much experience does this sound like I'd need?

*""Experience with Kaseya, Connectwise, or other MSP tools a plus""*

I... don't know what that stuff is. :/


I mean, I don't see entry-level positions pop up very often, but even when I do, they seem to call for a few things that I'm not really sure I actually know. I still apply, because fuck it, who knows? But still... I'm not very confident.

As it is, right now i'm just studying for my A+, because it's a baseline thing, and I see it as a kind of jumping off point. From what I know of certifications, this seems like the most attainable one right now, so I think it's worth going for. Not just for employers, but also for myself, to prove that I actually know something.

Right now I've been going through Professor Messer's videos, which are nice. I'd also like to find an A+ practice exam, but they all seem to cost money, which sucks.

I don't know. I'm in a bit of a pit right now. I sunk money in to those classes, but I'm not sure what I really gained from them. I'm more of a hands-on learner, but I can't get any entry-level jobs because they seem to require more than what I know... so what do I do?

Are there internships for IT jobs? Is entry-level *always* help desk? What knowledge do I *really* need to know for this stuff?

And most importantly, how do I learn it all? I have some spare computers lying around I could work on, but idk what to do. How do I teach myself to be a tech? How did *you* learn to be a tech?

I'm pretty aimless right now. I have no real skills beyond customer service/retail, but even that is hard to find decent work in. This is the only skill I have even the mildest of interests in, so I need to make it work, but I'm not sure where to go with it.

Lastly, I'm not sure where to actually *look* for these kinds of jobs. Right now I just browse Cragislist, but some fine folks pointed me to a site called Dice.com, which I'll be looking at more. I'm fairly close to Portland, OR, so if anyone has suggestions, I'd love to hear them."

I met this girl in high school several years ago and have only since been little more than acquaintances if I am being honest. We hang out in the same group of friends, but do not really communicate outside of that. After graduating high school, she went off to a college in-state and I went to another. For several years we seldom saw one another, but this has changed recently. Over the last year she has visited my house (I live with several high school friends) occasionally. Truthfully,I have always been attracted to this girl (great personality and gorgeous) and this was made more difficult over the past week.

Background for the background now, this girl is going to college for a degree in acting/theatre. Because of this interest, she managed to get an internship at a prominent theme park/entertainment conglomerate (I don't want to be specific in order to avoid upsetting the ""magic""). With this connection, she was able to get my friends and I several passes to the park for two days and came with us.We managed to catch up in the lengthy line wait times and had a blast on all of the rides.  It was during this time that I felt myself becoming more attracted to her, and I'm sure the firework shows didn't help. Now my vacation has ended and we have once again gone our separate ways.

 My question to you Reddit is layered: how can I initiate contact with her (without coming across as creepy/desperate), should I pursue the a relationship when she comes back to our home state, and what are any helpful tips for this situation?

P.S Some additional background facts:

1. I am a fairly shy person and have never been able to come close to a relationship before.

2. I am a college senior doing an extra semester and want to act before we both graduate and potentially start very different careers.

3. Honestly, this girl had dated one of my very good friends back in high school (worried about any toes being stepped on here).

4. The girl and I get along well when we hang out in that larger group setting.

5. If it is at all important, she has said that I am on the top of her list for finding someone for me to date and that I'm a nice guy. I'm sure this wasn't an open invitation for a date, but I hope it also wasn't ""friendzoning"" or whatever.

6. I guess I can answer any additional questions below.

- Hair is naturally dark blonde, dyed it purple for 2 months (no bleach)

- When purple faded, dyed it a mix of turquoise/midnight blue

- Aggressively washed out the blue so I could go back to natural for an upcoming internship

- Had a very very faded greenish purplish stain left all over, had it professionally dyed over with a light/medium gold-brown (level 6)

So this whole process worked very well, my hair right now is pretty close to my natural color so I don't have to worry about weird fading. The only problem is that I have a very slight greenish tone in some areas. It's not super noticeable but I notice it and it bothers me.

I have a degree in something I don't want to do, nor have I done it out of university.  I have no transferable skills from the railway job.  I can't explain the last 9 months of work history without telling an interviewer that I was on sick leave for months (red flag).

I've been on a few interviews but I never get passed round 2.  I think this is because more details come out and the red flags add up.  I present very well and have the luxury of being attractive in appearance but my work history is a giant red flag.   My last employer will give me a good reference because she feels bad for me, but that's about the only positive.

So i feel like I'm pretty much fucked.  My wife resents me for not being successful.  I need to take financial help from my parents.  And I have no idea how I'm going to find any professional success.  Sometimes I think my only hope is to start my own business.   But I don't really have any skills that I could sell, and opening a store seems daunting and stressful.

I'm feeling quite desperate and like my life is basically over.  I had all of these aspirations of being financially successful and career oriented but all of my attempts have failed and I'm now unhireable.  So much money wasted on a degree...so much potential smarts wasted away.  I was always the guy people thought would go places, I'm heading towards chronic unemployment and a divorce.

Fuck my life, seriously.  

Edit: reading this over and observing how poorly I'm communicating my thoughts is troubling....communication used to be my strength...now I sound like an idiot."

I just finished up my second year of college, and I've made the decision to leave the school: At the beginning of my freshman year, I went to a frat party and was sexually assaulted by one of the guys there. Since then, I became so depressed and my self-esteem was so damaged. I lacked self-respect and did many more things that I really regret up till today. Anyway, I remember his face.. And I saw him around campus a lot. I found out his name, since he's a really popular guy. Not only is he really involved in his frat, but he's also a student athlete.. Some of my friends/acquaintances are friends with him and I always see them in pictures together on Facebook. It seems like alot of people that I know know him, and they all like him.
Anyway, I stalked his FB profile and instagram, and found out that he got a very prestigious internship position this summer. All this info that I found out about him angers me... He is such as asshole and douchebag and he made me so suicidal.. I failed so many classes because of my depression and anger.. While he is out there having the time of his life, and getting places in life. Life's not fair... I hate him. I really really hate him...

EDIT: Thanks for all the answers! 

And for all the people telling me that I need to move on and it's been 2 years, *clearly* I know this. However, it's easier said than done. I'm obsessive by nature and find it extremely hard to let go of stuff.. Especially when I feel like I've been wronged. I hate it but it's so hard to put it behind. Some days I feel like I'm ready to let go but other days I feel so angry I can't even control myself.

For everyone asking why I didn't confess earlier: After it happened, I didn't tell *anyone*. I was so embarrassed. I held it in, and kept it to myself. I only confessed it to one friend about a week ago. I thought it would help me feel better to finally get it out, but instead it made me angrier. I've been seeing a counsellor on and off for the past two years but I haven't confessed this to her yet. When we initially met, I never told her *truthfully* what was really bothering me and we just always discuss my mood. (Btw, it wasn't that I wanted to lie to her. It was that I was lying to myself). Also, I don't feel comfortable enough to tell her, in all honesty.

267j8y,0,2014-05-22,I'm an empty shell of a person,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/267j8y/im_an_empty_shell_of_a_person/,"I'm generally not keen on life with few if any interests and effectively no social existence. I'm nearing the end of my first year of university and on track to a 2:1 although I despise my environment. Obviously there's some kind of mental disorder going on but I've got nothing to indicate so on paper. I need to seek out mental help, I am not oblivious to this.

Any interests I do have beyond computing are of little value to my impression as a person. I enjoy film &amp; television but I don't have knowledge of cinematography - just a plain consumer. I believe civil liberties are incredibly important but I don't do anything about it.

Something I definitely do enjoy is Java and softeng in general. Despite the lack of any extra-curricular activities on my CV and everything on it being immediately relevant to computer science I have been able to use my github and enthusiasm demonstrated within my cover letter to score a pair of (skype and phone) interviews for Java web development internships. I feel that an internship would do me wonders - I'd be doing what I enjoy and the strict schedule would be healthy. I'd come back to uni with real-world experience, knowing that if I got an internship the first year I can do it the next year. I'd have something to look forward to.

I'm concerned that in an interview scenario it will become immediately apparent I am not a well-rounded individual and simply broken by any standard. I'll be seen as no fun, odd or simply a bad investment and after all they're businessmen, not social workers.

My priority right now is to score an internship so that I may have a summer that is constructive towards my career and hopefully mental/emotional health. As much as I should, and I will, seeking out the help of a mental health professional right now will do nothing to improve my chances of an internship for this summer. The interviews need to be done within the next two weeks and this is already my final and last chance to get an internship for this summer.

I dread the thought of having no employment for the summer and fear I would spend it similarly to how I spent my winter and spring breaks, apathetically doing nothing at all. Maybe I'll produce something noteworthy in terms of programming, or finally talk to a doctor but that's not nearly as constructive as an internship.

Finally, I just wanna reiterate there is no one I know personally that I could turn to that is in position to be of any help. I'm not really sure what I'm up against in terms of other candidates but I don't think the outlook is any good. What could I possibly do before the interview to improve my chances?"

A user just came to the helpdesk asking for help using the VPN.  He appears to only need VPN access every six months as he doesn't use it often enough to either save my instructions or remember how to use it.  After we helped him get a fresh copy of the instructions he then asked ""Do I always have to have the token with me?  Can I throw it away?""  That was when one of my interns threw his hands up and walked away.

Me, I said ""No, that's half your password, it's a bit important and more reliable than our backup passcodes via SMS.  Also, if you do throw it away you're going to need to explain to your cost center manager why he's spending another $70 on a token.""

26855h,1,2014-05-22,Sibling Bullying/Abuse,[deleted],survivorsofabuse,https://www.reddit.com/r/survivorsofabuse/comments/26855h/sibling_bullyingabuse/,"I'm using a throwaway because I do not want my reddit name attached to this. I feel shame and guilt talking about it, but it seems to be becoming redundant to those close to me.

My sister abused me physically and emotionally for 30 years. I now think she even tried to kill me. When I was three-seven, she pushed me down a flight of stairs, put a bean bag over a barbie house and pushed me into it, locked me in an ottoman for what seemed like an eternity.

Throughout my life prior to puberty she has broken my bones (my arm, three fingers, and twice my nose), had her friends beat me up for telling my mom she was smoking, stolen my bike, and would beat me up for getting student of the month awards in elementary school. My grades started to drop because I did not want to be beaten. I told my parents a few times, but that just made things worse. Eventually I just stopped talking about it all together. 

One time her and her boyfriend were going to camp for the weekend. Mom made her take me and my cousin, it was a small cabin up in the mountains. All weekend, Cousin and I heard Sister pornfucking Boyfirend, with interludes of getting stoned out on the porch. Cousin told Aunt and Mom what happened, and I got beat by boyfriend and Sister for it. 

After I hit Junior High, she spread rumors that I was gay, cross dressed, and was a narc. She would then make fun of me for not having a girl friend, stinking, and I was a loser for not standing up for myself and having no friends. One time her new boyfriend held me down and put deodorant on me. I broke out in blisters under my armpits and was mocked because i was ""so dirty even deodorant cant help you"".

Over time, she apologized for how she treated me and started to help me become an adult. She helped me find my first place when I got a full time job, and would just be an all around friend. Of course, I would help her financially, I had no real bills and all my extra money just went towards comic books for myself. Of course I would help buy groceries for her and her kids, god knows her husband doesn't make enough. Of course I would pay her bills. I got evicted from my house anyway. I don't know where my money went, I guess I am a loser for not being able to pay my bills and rent. I should have been more careful with my money. I am a loser for having to move back in with mom and dad, you're right, sister. 

I did not even realize I was feeding some sort of psychopathic narcissist's ego until I lost my job. I was going to move into Sister's old house and take up the mortgage payments, but that got axed when my income dried up. 

Sister lost her shit. She called me every name in the book, lied to my grandmother to such an extent that Grandma disowned me a year before she died. I still don't know what she said, but Grandma told me I wasn't welcome in her home anymore. She disowned my mom and dad for giving me and my family a place to live while I finished school and looked for work. She told my mother that I am using her (mom) and am ""worse than a nigger at work and a schister with money"". 

My wife has been so helpful in me recognizing what had happened, she is a survivor of abuse as well. Wife is able to predict what sister will say or do with such uncanny certainty that it boggles my mind. Wife predicted that Sister is on drugs (Meth and that generic weed shit), is spreading lies to feel better about herself, and even showed me that I gave Sister power by reacting to her negativity. I ignore the bitch now. It was my wife that helped me recognize everything I have done in my life, to focus on the positive aspects, how influential I am to our children, and that if anyone is a freeloader, it's Sister. Wife pointed out how much she relied on me to live, yet I got nothing in return but scorn when I did not bend to Sister's will. She said anyone who truly loved their sibling would not scorn them for financial woes and actions outside their control. She also pointed out that 

Mom tries to keep a rapport with her, but Sister isn't having it. Mom needs permission to drive an hour away to see her grandchildren, and sister won't give it to her unless I am out of mom and dads life. In the mean time, she is now all over facebook spreading lies about my parents and my family unit. 

It should be noted that my parents tried to intervene a few times, but it was met with disaster. First time, Sister claimed abuse to the school counselor. Second time, she ran away and came home a week later strung out on meth. Third time, we moved out of state and Sister resorted to pills. 

Now, I am a loser for not doing drugs (never have and don't want to), being unemployed (I intern now), having no place to live (I personally hand built extensions to my parents home and keep it from decay), and take handouts (I was a janitor prior to interning). 

I hate that cunt.

TL;DR: A rant that probably belongs elsewhere. "

He would still ask me to be his girlfriend and I repeatedly told him I did not want a a boyfriend, and remind him we were not in a monogamous relationship whenever he brought it up. He moved away to an internship last summer and that's when we ended our relationship.  He asked me one final time to be his girlfriend and I again declined.  He got very angry and thought all our time spent together was a waste. 

Fast forward to January, I had to hear from someone else that my future roommate (we signed a lease in October) has started dating AJ.  Meanwhile, AJ has been spreading rumors and making his distaste for me well known.  Future roommate has actually told me I haven't been invited to certain events because AJ would be there.  Three months ago both AJ and future roommate started using cocaine. (*Just a note, I already talked to a lawyer about the situation and she said it'd be no problem to kick her out of the lease if she was misbehaving and hard drugs are involved)

I was originally going to arrange a meet up with the both of them and try to talk and clear the air, but the more I think about it the angrier I am.  I would never expect them to ""ask permission"" from me, but a friendly heads-up would have been nice.  She also entered a relationship knowing her boyfriend hated her future roommate. I feel like the ball is in their court. 

I guess my question is should I try to arrange a meet up to clear the air, should I just ignore it, or does anyone have another idea?

&gt;My internship at Intel was an incredible experience that I learned a lot at.  In my time there I was able to see what the job site is like in fields of work that I’m interested in, as well being able to experience working as a team.  I already had a pretty good idea of what working at Intel would look like, but there were still a lot of things that surprised me.  The whole experience never once felt like it was just something that I had to do or a job I had to be at, I genuinely enjoyed my time.
 

&gt;On my first day I met my supervisor Anthony, who made it clear from the start that this internship should be a fun experience to take a lot away from.  I was given my first task soon after, I was responsible for setting up a display of newer products that were going to be used in a sales pitch.  It felt a little weird being in a large conference room setting these products up while catered food was being brought in for the meeting.  I’m not sure how to explain it other than knowing that this was an important meeting and I on my first day was able to take part in getting it ready.  I half expected my first day to be somewhat slow, maybe being shown around a bit.  
For the rest of my internship I was working in a lab with about 50 other people, I quickly fell into place with everyone after a few days.  The subject of what we did is really difficult to actually define, I had a rather large range of tasks and a lot of the time we were allowed to work on what we felt should be worked on.  If I had an idea for something to work on that would be beneficial I had the freedom to work on it.  A lot of the time I was building computers to be used in our lab, which was something I was always interested in but had never done.  A lot of the time I had to bring something I was working on to another part of the building which doesn’t sound like too big of a task, but the Intel building is absolutely massive.  After the whole summer I still had pretty much no idea where I was going in this building, but I did learn how to get to the few important places.
 

&gt;While I already knew quite a bit about what Intel did as a company and a little bit about the knowledge required for their positions, I learned a lot while I was there.  I worked in a team with other interns on most days, which was a little different than the typical team for a project in school.  I also learned a lot about computer hardware, how it all works together and how to use them.  With these two skills combined I felt like I was an effective member of our team and I will definitely be able to apply them to future work situations. 
 

&gt;In the future I would like to work at a place like Intel, or somewhere that I can apply skills similar to what I used at Intel.  Working at Intel requires to either be in college or to have a diploma from a college and for you to have been an intern there before.  I think working at Intel in the future as either an intern again or a full time employ is a realistic option for me and it is definitely something that I would like to do.  Not only do employees at Intel have a really interesting job, but they have a lot benefits for their full time workers.  Just as an example they allow you to work from home or whatever hours you want as long as you’re getting your work done.
 

&gt;Interning at Intel as my first job experience was a great experience for me and it has definitely made what I want to do in life clear.  I would like to intern at other electronics companies to get a broader view of the industry, but Intel was a unique experience that I learned a lot from.

So I graduated recently from a top tier engineering school with a BS in Aerospace Engineering with a 3.62 GPA. All throughout my senior year I had been applying to jobs and had only had three interviews out of maybe 100+ applications. All of those led nowhere since they ""chose a more qualified applicant."" Since graduating I've been searching and applying to jobs every day but am getting really discouraged and desensitized. If I'm lucky I can find 2-4 job postings a day and usually I am not qualified for most (or all) of them. Many jobs seem to require experience and skills that I just don't have. A few days ago I even found an entry level job requiring ""10 years experience minimum"" -- ridiculous. 

It seems that everyone in my major who has gotten a job has gotten it from someone they know in the industry or because they had some really nice internship. Well I don't know anybody in the industry because I was always turned down from internships for not being qualified enough. I feel like I'm fighting an uphill battle. I'm living at home with my parents while I'm trying to find a job and every day when they come home from work all they talk about is jobs. They ask me why I havn't found one and talk about how easy it was for them to get jobs when they were my age. The thought of paying off my student loans looms over my head every day as well, and my parents are sure to remind me of it. I wake up in the morning and don't even want to get out of bed. I know I'll do my job search and find that I'm not qualified. For the jobs that I am qualified for, I won't hear back because someone with internship experience or someone who knows an employee will get the job. 

This whole experience has made me feel worthless, like nobody wants me. Any advice on finding aerospace jobs? "

Everyone that he's talked to his entire life has said so.*

Dramatic intro aside, that's been my situation for the last four months. I'm about to graduate from Computer Science and to embark in the job market, hoping to get a moderately decent job and praying to get one of those unicorn remote gigs that will allow me to get something better than $3/hour. Though reading around all the files from this sub I still have a LOT to learn. Quite frankly some of you people scare me intellectually.

Anyway, as part of my coursework I had to do a 3-month unpaid internship at a bank, with the good fortune that I ended doing maintenance  work for one of their pages, usually that involved resetting passwords, deleting duplicate records, all that stuff. The redeeming quality of this was that because this site was internal I had less idiocy to deal with, I've yet to be broken by the idiot users I've dealt with so I still have some hope for humanity, most of the users on the bank use FF or Chrome, which is a good thing because the pages don't play that well with IE, and everyone has been told so. up to the fact that if they absolutely, positively must use the web browser of Satan that they at least switch compatibility mode on. One day back in February the phone rang..


&gt;me: Good evening, how may I help you?

&gt;$worker:Oh, Hi Imaani, I've been having problems around the page, I think it's down, can you check?

&gt;me: Alright *looks over to his monitor*....nope, working pretty well here.

&gt;$worker: Are you sure? I've tried closing the window and opening it again, opening a new tab. Everything.

&gt;me: I see...Tell you what, why you don't send me a screencap so i can check the problem

&gt;$worker: Alright, but I'd like you to check it with $imBoss first

&gt;me: Of course. *hangs up*

No way. $imBoss has me here to soften his workload, if anything I should be solving this. So I do due diligence on the whole thing before escalating it. Refresh the webpage, everything is well; ping it, response times are adequate; call $webAdmin to see if everything's alright, he checks it, it is. Then the E-mail with the screencap arrived.

Naturally, it is IE with compatibility mode off. The shortcut to Chrome is on his taskbar.

I ring him up

&gt;$worker: You solved it already?

&gt;me: Yeah, Open it on Chrome

&gt;$worker: WOW! it's working beautifully, why wasn't it working before?

&gt;me: You know how is it with computers, they do weird stuff sometimes..

&gt;$worker: yeah yeah.

&gt;me: if it happens again, close the tab then open Chrome, that makes it work better because the people at Google made it to work around problems like this.

&gt;$worker: Oh, I didn't knew that, thanks!

268nvk,7,2014-05-22,Looking for a place to sleep in the summer. Will cook and clean for you.,mocklobster,NYCapartments,https://www.reddit.com/r/NYCapartments/comments/268nvk/looking_for_a_place_to_sleep_in_the_summer_will/,"Hello, Reddit. It's that time of year again: internship time. I myself will be working at a production studio in Midtown, and thought that I could provide y'all with some info about myself in case anyone is interested in renting out to me:

I am a man and I have no problems with living with all guys, all girls, or a mix of the two.

I am 20 years old. I could tell you that I'm ""responsible,"" ""wise beyond my years,"" ""born in the wrong generation,"" etc. all day, but that won't make a difference. If you have a problem with young people, I'm not your man.

I am clean and organized. I won't make a mess of your space.

I will be working pretty consistent hours.

I do not drink or smoke, but I have no problem if you do.

I will cook and clean for you outside of my working/sleeping hours.

I do not need much. I shit you not, I will live in a broom closet, on a couch, or under a bed if you need me to.

Are you interested? If so, great! Here are my/your two options:

I will pay $700 in rent if you are within 45 minutes' walking distance of my workplace (West 37th Street/8th Avenue).

I will pay $600 in rent if you are beyond that, because I will have to commute.

Both of these options are somewhat flexible if you're just outside of that range.

If you are interested, please send me a PM. I am trying to find space by June 1. From there, I can provide pics, links, and anything else you might like to know about me.

EDIT: though I said that there was no use in saying that I'm responsible, I may have phrased that badly: I AM RESPONSIBLE. Fact is, if you don't want to rent out to a 20 year old, I can't change your mind. That was all I was trying to convey.

EDIT #2: the offer's still open if someone wants a personal cook to make them some friggin' delicious dinners this summer! 
Also, if you just have a room open and don't need a cook, feel free to contact me anyway... please?"

I'm going to keep looking, but I'll probably be graduating next year without any experience. How can I get a job with a low (3.0-3.1) GPA and no experience? 

My school is very highly ranked, so maybe the degree itself will help me, but it obviously didn't help me get an internship, so I can't see it doing anything to help me find a job. I'm really stressed out about this as it seems everyone else in my school got an internship. Some people who I never would have thought would have an internship before me, got something. I can't imagine going through this same experience again a year from now, spending all day every day on a computer applying for jobs worrying what I'm going to do.

What should I do between now and a year from now when I graduate to get a job in finance without having any internship experience?


EDIT: I exaggerated a little bit about the emails. For the past 2-3 weeks I've been sending out 20+ a day, but before that I was sending about 20 per week. Also, I went to some recruiting events in the fall, but they didn't get me anywhere, as I had a 2.6 GPA then. I brought my GPA up from a 2.6 to a 3.0 this year, and I'm looking to continue to bring it up during my senior year. Thanks for the advice everyone, and I welcome any more that you might have.

268t87,3,2014-05-22,How to gain in advantage in certain majors for undergraduate internships?,WorldListener,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/268t87/how_to_gain_in_advantage_in_certain_majors_for/,"First off, I would just like to say that I don't mean this in any disparaging way, and I hope it will not be taken that way.

However, in my major (Chemical Engineering), I have noticed that next to no one in at my university gets an internship their first two years unless they actually know someone personally. This is largely got to do with the fact that employers who recruit at our college no what the curriculum is like, and expect us to have taken certain classes before they want us as an intern (i.e. the Thermos, Separation Processes, and Transport...). Sometimes the fact that they want these classes is just generalized as ""We are only looking for 3rd or 4th years,"" and after talking to numerous employers at two career fairs, that is what it ultimately came down to. I will be doing research in the fall regarding drug delivery systems and protein synthesis, but I do not want to run into this internship problem again come next Summer (note, I started applying for internships for this summer, last August, weeks into the school year, modifying my resume as I went and more opportunities became available)... How do I give myself a competitive advantage despite the clear disadvantages that I have with reference to classes?Essentially, other chemE's in my year have gone home and gotten a part time job, or taken summer classes. Either way, it appears to be much harder for my major, and I'm sure with other majors.

This is where it might get somewhat offensive so others, but isn't directly related to the question. How do I explain this to my other engineering major friends who have it much easier? I have a lot of ME friends, and they make remarks to me all the time basically rubbing it in my face that they have a summer internship, and I do not. They take their autoCAD and inventor class their first year, and that is one of the basic skills that employers are looking for.


tl;dr: 
-How do I gain a competitive advantage in getting an internship when the employers are looking for 3rd and 4th years students in my major, and I'm only a second year?
-How do I explain to my other engineering friends that the fact that they have it easier and that there is no need to rub it in they have an internship?

268xhv,5,2014-05-22,Busting my [22F] ass at college while my mom [56F] still makes me feel guilty about money.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/268xhv/busting_my_22f_ass_at_college_while_my_mom_56f/,"Some background: My parents are divorced, and my mom used to work for my dad/stay at home with me (I am an only child), so when they got divorced about eight years ago, she decided to stay at home instead of getting a job. She makes a (very small) amount of money through an at-home online business, but it really only operates for a couple months out of the year. Most of her money comes from my dad paying child support/alimony/etc (which is a whole other issue, since they are still fighting about the divorce settlement in court eight or nine years later) and some other ways like money from the selling of a house in her family, things like that.

Both of my parents have helped me financially through college, both with tuition and rent in an expensive city. I've worked part-time jobs and done internships (mostly unpaid) throughout college, and right now I'm finishing up my last semester. I'm taking a couple of classes at night, working 25+ hours a week at a part-time job, and doing an unpaid internship that can be 40+ hours a week (the hours fluctuate, sometimes more sometimes less). I'm trying to manage a relationship, but our dates have been consisting of him driving me to cover things for work or making food at my place and falling asleep. I'm trying my best, but I don't make enough money to afford my rent and tuition so until I graduate and find a job in my field that will actually pay me, I have to rely on them.

So my mom doesn't really do much during the day. She tends to yardwork, runs errands, plants flowers and redoes rooms in the house. She admits she hasn't even paid attention to her own business in months. She goes on lots of dates and nice long bike rides all the time. She makes no money, really. But...she kind of gets on me and makes fun of me when I tell her I'm tired or I'm rushing around to try and do everything I need to get done every day, and likes to insinuate that my job is easy and I don't do anything and mocks me a little bit when I tell her I'm really busy.

Meanwhile, any time I buy anything new (and we're talking a new shirt or a phone case or whatever, just little things like that) she tells me how we're in really bad shape financially and that I've sucked all of her money into tuition and she's poor and struggling and makes me feel like shit. It drives me insane because the simple solution, in my mind, is for her to get a job and make some money. I'm doing what I can until I can find a full-time job. She tells me how hard her life is and how busy her days are but I don't think she understands that the things she does on a daily basis are things other people do while having actual jobs!!!

Am I being really selfish for being frustrated here? I know it probably doesn't sound like I appreciate her help. I know she's not obligated to help me but either help me or don't, but making me feel guilty and lazy about it all the time is helping no one. How do I not let this get to me?


**TL;DR: My mom (who doesn't work) makes me feel lazy and guilty despite the fact that I'm working hard, because she's helped me pay for rent and tuition.**

I was fine with it for a while, but an existential crises leaves me with a girl-shaped hole in my life.",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2694oi/why_am_i_such_a_lonely_bastard_i_was_fine_with_it/,"I really appreciate anyone who takes the time to read this wall of text.  This is probably a standard complaint here, but I'm incapable of forming any type of meaningful relationship with a girl.  I find a girl, and they're always either using me, not as into me as I am to them, or the situation causes it to fail before it even gets off the ground.  

I rarely dated in high school.  I dated a girl for a month freshman year, we broke up, my dad vanished for a year or so, then came back into my life and died shortly after.  All of this left me with a pretty severe bout of social anxiety that followed me throughout most of high school.  

Eventually, senior year, I got a much needed hair cut, and the loss of those long locks gave me a slight boost in confidence, and a boost in attractiveness, as well.  Ended up going to prom with and dating a girl that had rejected me a year or so before.  We break up over the summer, partially because we're both too afraid to propose taking each other's virginity (we both wanted it, but thought the other wasn't ready), and partially because she's just a very fickle person.  

I didn't do anything else with a girl for a little over three years after that.  A mixture of being too busy balancing school, work, and music, and being afraid of my own inexperience leads to me still being a virgin at 21.  

Summer of 2012, the first ex is back in town for an internship, and we're hanging out here and there.  She's got a long distance boyfriend, so I'm just enjoying our renewed friendship, no expectations.  We go to dinner and a party, and she starts talking about how she's going to dump her boyfriend the next day when he's in town.  She takes me to another room and she pounces on me.  I have her pants off when her boyfriend texts her and we move back a few steps.  She ends up staying with him, and they live happily ever after in another state.  

A couple of months later, I meet the roomie/best friend of a work friend.  We text for a few days, she invites me to hang out, and she takes my virginity.  We hang out and hook up for a few months, but she tells me she's not ready for a relationship when I ask, so we stop.  It doesn't take long before she ends up actually in a relationship.  

A few months after that ends, I end up sleeping with a friend of a different friend.  It lasts a couple of weeks before she ends up in a committed relationship.  

I get back in touch with high school ex #2.  She's back in town taking some time off from school, and we hang out a bunch.  A mutual friend (who hooked me up with the previous girl) says that she's been talking about wanting to hook up with me.  The ex had hit me up earlier that night and took a limo with some friends 30 miles from Dallas to Denton to hang out at my house after one of their bar crawls.  They all leave together, except her and she crashes on my couch.  We make out, and she stops me because ""she's just got too much to figure out in her life.""  I told you she was fickle.

At this point, partially because I'm so busy, and partially because I'm so disillusioned with my interactions with girls in the past, I decide I just want to hook up and whatever happens happens.  

This goes fine for a while.  I slept with a girl once, we kind of drifted apart when she left the state for winter break, and I wasn't torn up about it.  

The next semester, though, I started having an existential crisis.  Things got worse when I briefly became involved with my best friend's ex.  They had been broken up for about three years now, but we kept in touch because we always got along and lived in the same college town.  I hit her up to hang out one night because I was having an existential panic attack and didn't want to be alone.  We're talking at a bar, and she asks if I had ever had an existential crisis.  I hadn't really brought it up with anyone at this point, but she asks me about it out of the blue and we spend hours talking about how we're going through the same thing.  We ended up sleeping with each other that night, and a couple of nights later.  It was wrong, because she was my best friend's ex, but I hadn't felt this type of connection for a long time, if not ever before.   

I told my friend, as I thought it was the right thing to do.  It ended up hurting him way more than I expected, so I broke it off.  This hurt immensely for two reasons.  Number one, I had jeopardized my relationship with my best friend, and number two, I thought I had found the perfect distraction from my existential depression, only to have to throw it away immediately.  

At this point I realized how much I wanted a relationship.  Those two nights with her did so much for my anxiety that I had to find something to replace it.  I wasn't content with just hooking up any more.  

So now we make it to my latest failure.  A friend from work.  I've had a thing for this girl the entire time I've worked there.  She was one of the first people at the job to make the effort to get to know me, and we'd always been flirty with one another.  When we'd hung out early on, she mentioned that she was against getting involved with coworkers.  I liked her, but I put the idea of being with her in the back of my head.  Around the time things fell apart with the last girl, she'd made an offhand remark about not always following that rule.  We'd always texted back and forth, but now the conversations were getting deeper and more frequent.  I ended up kissing her as she was heading home from my place one night.  She said ""that was unexpected,"" and asked if I wanted to have a cigarette with her before she left.  We texted a bunch the following week, but she blew me off when I tried to hang out with her again.  

The next few weeks or so, I don't really talk to her at work.  Nothing passive aggressive or mean-spirited, I just don't really make an effort, since I assume she's not into it.  This week, though, she's been extra flirty.  I asked her about it, and she said she catches herself flirting with me all the time, but she's not looking to mix work and dating.  

So that's where I am now.  Desperately looking for a connection, but having no idea where to look.  Any time I go to a party, I almost never meet anyone that I'm interested in.  My band can play to a packed house, and it will be 90% males.  The other 10% are girls that are with someone in the 90%.  I'm so frustrated right now and have no idea what to do.  

TLDR: I can't find girlfriend material.  They're all either using me or move on.

2695gn,4,2014-05-22,"Missed EU LCS Week 1? Wrap Up, Expectations &amp; Results! [LONG]",Squallify,leagueoflegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/2695gn/missed_eu_lcs_week_1_wrap_up_expectations_results/,"With the games of today the first week of EU LCS has come to an end. From today on I'll be doing a weekly wrap-up of how the week went and make an analysis of the teams and their performance.

Hope you like it!


* **FNATIC** 

Fnatic's last split performance was pretty shaky. They started great with a 7-0 win streak, but after that they went on tilt with a 0-8 losing streak. 

After the split they managed to climb up in the playoffs and crown themselves as the Spring 2014 LCS champions AGAIN.

Thus they participated in All Star tournament where their performance was also shaky and gave a lot to talk.

**Expectations:** Come back from the summer vacations and shake the shakyness off (heh). They have to proof that they are a solid team.

**Results:** They are still a shaky team. They managed to end 2/2 but the games weren't really convincing, not even the ones they won. Let's see if they manage to step it up next week

**Best Player this Week:** Rekkles. He's a life asurance and even when his team doesn't do well, he won't go on tilt.

* **SK GAMING**

No one expected much of SK Gaming at the start of the Spring split, they completely changed their roster being CandyPanda the only remaining player from the old roster.

Even though they didn't look as strong as the start of the split they managed to end in 1st position at the end showing a lot of strength and specially good tactics and sinergy.

In the PlayOffs they ended 2nd just after losing to Fnatic. 

**Expectations:** Keep the high level of play, specially in terms of macro (rotations, strategies, team sinergy..)

**Results:** SK Gaming has showed that they are a top contender for going to worlds this year. Their laning phases may not be the strongest of all teams, but they make it up with great rotations and calls.

**Best Player this Week:** Jesiz, or should I say JESUS? He totally stepped his game up from last split where he was considered not to be a top mid laner. Looking forward to see him dominate even more!

* **ALLIANCE**

Alliance was a team that came into the Spring Split very hyped, the so called ""super-team"". 

This quickly transitioned into the fail super team because they were in last position for quite some time. 

Luckily for them EU LCS likes ties and all the teams being close to each other in the standings and they improved their gameplay in the latter part of the split and were able to sneak into playoffs where they put up a good fight.

**Expectations:** People probably expected this split Alliance to show that they really are a super-team, and after Froggen's performance in All Stars and being known that the team was looking for analysts, a good performance is what people want to see.

**Results:** Wanted good performance? There you have it. Tied at first place together with SK Gaming and Millenium. All the players played out of their minds, both individually and as a team.

You could also see some korean tactics being used in their game against Fnatic totally denying Soaz's farm and experience. Great start for them.

**Best Player this Week:** It's pretty hard to decide. Even though I will go with Tabbz because he's the one who stepped up his game the most from last split. 

No one really expected him to carry, everyone expected Froggen to take that role. But Tabzz did a great job, nice to see ADs in Europe evolve!

* **ROCCAT**

The polish powerhouse. They replaced MYM As the full-polish team in LCS and surprised everyone. After kicking NiP out of the LCS they entered it and totally dominated at the very beggining.

Overall the team was great, but if we had to chose one Overpow is that man. He really shone in the spring split. Sadly by the end of the split they started to lose some games, but still they are not a team you should look over.

**Expectations:** People expect Roccat to be a top tier contender. They want to see the dominating version of the polish players, and be up there in the fight to get into Worlds.

**Results:** They ended 1-3. Even though their play was not bad, they lack the consistency they maybe had in the start of spring split.

They seem to make bad calls and throw pretty easily. Potential is there, but there are lot of things to **polish** (DEM PUNS).

**Best Player this Week:** Again and again, Overpow. He's the player to look at and the player that will shine when Roccat wins. His Kayle is still terrifying.

* **GAMBIT GAMING**

Our favourite russian overlords. Edward came back from NA and everyone was all aboard the siberian hype express. This was the year we destroyed the koreans.

Sadly, it didn't end all like that. They started pretty strong with a 3-1 superweek in spring split, but after then they lacked consistency. You could see good plays here and there, but sometimes it wasn't enough.

Probably there were problems like having to trouble, the Ucraine conflict when they had a gaming house, and the intern tension (as Alex said when he left).

They entered playoffs but escaped the relegations by the skin of their teeth. After that Alex Ich left the team and stated that the intern situation in Gambit was a huge part of the poor results.

**Expectations:** Now without Alex people really don't expectated much from Gambit. Most of the people wanted to see how NiQ will do, will he be able to fullfil Alex role? If yes, that would be a surprise, and a great one. If no, sadly it wouldn't surprise anyone.

**Results:** Even though Diamond says they are stronger then ever their poor 1-3 start and their performance didn't show so. They got ran over in 2 games, and even though they managed to take a win from SK Gaming... Let's just say they have a lot to work on.

The mechanical skill didn't seem to be the problem, but rather the calls and team sinergy. There have been several moments where it seemed that they didn't really understand each other.

**Best Player this Week:** NiQ. He's the new one and even though he's the best player in the team right now.

Darien and Diamond were probably at their weakest version this week, and the bot lane didn't seem in their best moments either. NiQ had also some difficult moments but even so he's the one that seemed the most solid.

* **COPENHAGEN WOLVES**

The Talent Factory. They entered Spring Split after a very strong performance in the Challenger League when Rekkles was still play with them. 

People didn't believe that they would do well without him, but FORG1VEN, a greek ADC replaced him and did a really good job.

They didn't look bad, they were a well-made team. But even so that wasn't enough and even if they could give a good fight, the dominating teams of the split were too much for them to take.

Luckily they were able to stay in the LCS.

After that, AGAIN one of their members moves to TSM. This time Amazing. Also Forg1ven left the team. Airwalks (jungle) and Woolite (adc) switched in for them.

**Expectations:** It's their second split in the LCS but they suffered pretty heavy changes in their core members. Will they be able to still give a good fight with this changes? That's the question.

**Results:** They ended 1/3, but even the sensation it gave off was pretty satisfying. People thought that they wouldn't give up a good fight anymore and that didn't become true, they put up a good fight and showed that they are a team you better should not forget of.

**Best Player this Week:** Woolite. He came new in, and came out big. They may have gone 1/3 but everyone that watched the games will agree this guy will be a main component of this team.

* **SUPA HOT CREW XD**

They were the underdogs in the spring split. Were able to enter in after kicking MYM out.

They probably had a couple of rough weeks at the start but slowly they were finding their place, specially the AD carry Mr Rallez. 

Sadly it wasn't enough and they ended at the 7th place and forced to play the relegation matches, but they played brilliantly against C9E and 3-0'd them to come back into the LCS this split.

**Expectations:** Migxa left the team so now Rallez has a new support.  Also LS will be working for the team as an analyst. People will be expecting to see results of that.

**Results:** Even though the results could have been better (2-2) you can see clearly how they improved from the last split. Mr Rallez is as strong as ever, and specially the team rotations are way smoother than before. Props to them.

**Best Player this Week:** Who would it be? Yeah it's Rallez. He's a machine and everyone who has him in his Fantasy LCS will be glad they picked him up. Keep up with the good work!

* **MILLENIUM**

And last, but definitely not least, Millenium. They came into the spring split with high expectations after picking up Kev1n, moving Kerp to mid and having the ADC Creaton back from breaking his arm.

Sadly they couldn't live up to it and ended in 8th place, facing the strongest amateur team of all, NIP. After a good fight they managed to win against NIP 3-2 and here they are now, in the LCS again.

**Expectations:** People didn't really think they would be impactful in the LCS. They were called the Velocity of EU.

**Results:** Oh dear lord. There's not a single person in the whole LoLiverse that isn't impressed by how they stepped their game up with this 3-1.

Not only the calls and rotations, but also individually. The lanes looked stronger than ever, and they are even looking for an analyt as Kev1n said!!!!!

**Best Player this Week:** TRACKBALL TRACKBALL TRACKBALLLLLLL

Yes ITS KERP! What a monster what a beast! Last split we could see him doing some good moves but dear lord this week, he really played out of his mind and destroyed. I'm sure he's the week MVP.

If he keeps it like this he'll be definitely there in the top mids in the scene.

2697q4,21,2014-05-22,"Some general helpful tips and hints about interning that I wish I had known before I started (in a numbered list, because, convenience)",yanchforce,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/2697q4/some_general_helpful_tips_and_hints_about/,"Just a quick note here about interning and making the most out of your experience. These are things that I wish interns had told me before I started interning (2 internships in at this point)

1. Network hard. So hard that it hurts. Meet so many people, shake so many hands that you when you walk down your office theres not a persons face you don't know. Sit down and schedule short 1 on 1 meetings with them to talk about their careers and role in the company. Go grab some lunch with them, you don't even have to talk about work things, just get to know people, and the sooner the better. I would strive to meet as many people as you can in your first few weeks of being at your company, it makes your conversations more meaningful (you learn more) and interesting for everyone. This is the most important tip. Thats why its #1.

2. Never turn down an opportunity. Whenever you are in a group setting and your boss comes in and says, I need one of you for X, Y or Z, be that person that volunteers to do it. No matter what it is. If your boss is talking to you and you are his only employee ASK for some opportunities that go beyond your traditional role and expectations as an intern. The worst that can happen is that they say no. You will be able to do some really interesting things you typically wouldn't be able to, and you get to add some more meaningful material to your resume which is key. Put yourself out there when looking for tasks from your supervisor. Its kinda like dating, except instead of finding love, you find money.

3. Get to know the other interns. Make them your friends. Go out with them after work, hangout with them, etc. Make these people your friends first and your coworkers second. You are going to be spending the next ~3 months with these people so you might as well enjoy their company. That being said, I would refrain from doing anything highly offensive, illegal, or sexual with your intern friends. They may be your friends first and your coworkers, second, but they are still going to be your coworkers at the end of the day. Don't forget that the next time you decide to get blackout drunk and make out with Jen the hot intern at the party.

Fourier. Listen to the old timers and line workers. These people may look old, sad, crusty, or defeated, hell maybe even all of the above, but they do know what they are talking about. These people are the ones that will be able to tell you wether the part you designed is even manufacturable, or perhaps they have some sort of insider knowledge about your process that could be optimized and you didn't even think about it. They are going to be the ones who make your good ideas great. No one knows better about your product line than the people who are working the line for 14 hours a day. They also probably have some pretty solid stories.

A few months ago, I bought a threadmill and started to run in my basement. Did 3 weeks and all was going well... until I started an internship at an hospital and got sick (flu, then a cold). Afterwards, I tried to continue on week 4, but fell off my threadmill and had to take a few days off to heal. It was really stupid: I tried to get all my hair in my headband during my warmup. The headband was on my eyes and next thing I know I flew off on the right and fell hard on the floor on my hip. I had troubles walking afterwards. Then I tried to run again a few days later (a W1D1 run) but I had trouble running one minute and I had to stop halfways.

Now I'm back -again- at W1D2 and everything went really well! I did it faster than I ever run before! One thing is for sure: perseverance will pay off!"

And to make things worst, testing the code requires you to read through layers of layers of abstraction and wrapper. I don't know if its because I am doing this the first time or what, but I wonder how do people start pushing code in their second week, as I feel that I need at least a good two or three week just to put all the files in context.

So you can say i barely have any experience with girls.

So I met this really vivacious and cheerful girl while I am currently doing an internship with a foreign company whom I really fancy getting to know. Problem is that she works in another department while I work in finance, so I don't get the chance to speak to her often. I noticed she had been looking at me while I am in a conversation with someone else ( although she doesnt do that these days) and took that as a possible sign of her being somewhat interested. 

So i tried making small talk through our company's version of skype/IM in recent days, and I have been camping in the building lobby to wait so i can speak to her personally but always never got the chance. and today, I bit the rag by finally asking her personally to her face if she wanted to have lunch with me ( This took a lot of courage for me). She agreed almost readily, which surprised me, but then she followed up by saying that she could gather a whole bunch of her department friends to come as a group to have lunch.

To be honest this was not at all what i envisioned, I felt that my question was straightforward 'i was wondering if you would like to go out for lunch together with me?' so I am feeling rather crestfallen at the fact that she may have just friendzoned me and that she does not want to go on a one to one meeting so we can get to know each other better ( I want to get to know her better).

so during lunchtime she asked if I wanted to join her group and I said it was not convenient and postponed my attendance to next week because I am feeling uncertain of what to do and how to approach the situation. I am not really comfortable in large groups ( I barely know her friends) and I feel that this is going nowhere, so im feeling on the downside right now.

And yes im serious about this, I am looking for a serious dating relationship and not just for bedding her or something. What should I do next? Should I give this up totally and focus on my career and keep both of us as friends ( im about to enter university soon) or should I be more bold and tell her that I am interested in her only?

TL:DR Girl I am interested in may have friendzoned me when I asked her out for lunch, by gathering a group of her friends ( she usually goes out with them for lunch) instead, so I am rather crestfallen and wondering if i should pursue this or just remain friends

I am interested in applying for the IT internship position at your agency which is listed at Kopra from 2015 April to October 2015.

Currently I am studying Computer Science at the University of Konstanz, Germany, where I expect to graduate with a Bachelor of Science in 2016. During my studies, I acquired a wide knowledge in programming, theoretical foundations and mathematics. During the bachelor's class ""Interactive Systems""‘ offered at my university, I gained various skills regarding web technologies, mainly HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In a team with fellow students, I am also currently co-developing a web-based course submission system for university teachers to facilitate the evaluation of assignments handed in by students, which is the goal of the ""Software Project"" course I am taking at the moment. The university's computer science department focuses on data visualization and analysis. 

I am skilled in fine arts as well as design and took several courses of that matter at the local school of fine arts in order to improve my working techniques and abilities in that field. Since several years ago, I started learning and working with Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign to design and create flyers, brochures, websites, as well as posters for local clubs and societies.

Gaining more knowledge in web technologies, especially web development and interaction design, would help me to acquire the background necessary for a future job in this field.

I speak English fluently because I am learning it for ten years now, while I also have basic knowledge in French. Furthermore, I am very interested in Japanese culture and language. Since my vacation in Japan in April 2014, I started taking Japanese lessons and practicing the Japanese alphabets.

I believe that I am well-fitted for your program and this internship position would be ideal for me to improve my programming and design skills. Please contact me if you agree that my qualifications are a match for this internship. 

Thank you for your consideration.

Some background:

Myself and two other friends from university decided to do a internship abroad in spain in our third year of studies. All three of us have decently paid jobs in big spanish companies where we are given a lot of responsibility. Although it can be stressful sometimes living in a country where the main language spoken is different from your mother tongue, we manage to get on fairly well, and we have a cute appartment altogether.

My friend, let's call her A, only speaks english whereas myself and my other roomate are at a professional level of spanish. Our friend A really struggles and can only speak one or two phrases. Recently she changed jobs to work for a much better company and here is where her problem began.

--------

A started off with a great working relationship with her boss, she was given more responsibility than at her previous job and was being consistently told how good of a job she was doing. A months in her boss told her how he only hired young foreign females for this position and she wasn't the first who didn't speak spanish as he ""enjoyed having the intern to himself and speaking one on one in english"". 

He has started taking her out on wine tours and forcing her to go out for drinks at lunchtimes rather than letting her interact with other interns there. More recently when she declined his request to have lunch together so she could  revise for her exam he insisted that she was ""no fun, not like how you are on facebook, you love to drink"" and informed her that prior to this job he was a worked in IT and knew how to track and read private profiles.

When she declined his request for a lunch time break so she could revise she joked that she would go back to university without a degree if she didn't study, he replied ""and if you turn me down again you'll come back from your exam with no job"" which she said he said with no humour in his voice.

Last week, he spoke with her about how he has taken previous interns on holidays, to his private residence in the south for weeks at a time ""just for fun"". I told A she should report him but the problem it'll be difficult for her to convey what's happening with him due to the language barrier. I offered to write to her HR manager but I wouldn't know how to start it. Plus A suffers with an anxiety disorder so she's scared of confrontations and keeps telling me she only has to ""make it til the end of july"". How can I help her? Should she report him?

sorry for the wall of text and errors I'm writing this from work

26agzd,1,2014-05-23,(Spoilers All) Arya and her attitude in the show vs the book in ASOS,jdthemannis,asoiaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/26agzd/spoilers_all_arya_and_her_attitude_in_the_show_vs/,"I remember that after the Red Wedding, Arya was in a point of depression that I thought was beyond return. She couldn't care less where the Hound would take her and you could see she doesn't give a crap if she dies or not. When she kills Tickler and then leaves the Hound I think se remembers how good is to have revenge and kill (which for me is a little bit concerning) and then tries to sail to Braavos. 

Now you have show Arya who, in past episodes, is able to be funny (in that man's house where she and the Hound devour the stew) and to care about The Hound's injurys. I remember that she didn't hate Clegane that bad but was having and intern fight over his feelings toward his kidnapper. 

I'm a little worried that people is still cheering and happy for Arya when in that part of the book you were really concerned about her, she was almost suicidal to me. That state of mind is the reason she is becoming a character with so many shades of grey. Could she be a villain in the future? Is she a psycopath? Does she really listen whe the kindly man talks her about the mission and vision of the Faceless Assasins or is she just about vengeance, vengeance, vengeance (ironically like her mother? To me those questions is what makes BookArya an interesting character in ASOIAF. While, until now, ShowArya is just a hero, you can see only white and doesn't see to be grieving a lot about her diceased family. 

Do you think it's valid to do that for D&amp;D just because the screen time of the Hound and Arya makes so many people happy? I get it, they are awesome together, but I think it's a short term reward that it's going to have some consequences in the long run. Many people won't understand (unless they change it too) some of his actiones in Braavos.

I don't know, give me your opinions and sorry for my awful English"

26avl6,9,2014-05-23,Coming to a conclusion with my church drama. The meeting with my former lead pastor.,[deleted],brokehugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/brokehugs/comments/26avl6/coming_to_a_conclusion_with_my_church_drama_the/,"I thought I'd update y'all on the ""personal"" meeting my wife and I had with my former lead pastor to try and at least reach an understanding. It was important for my wife to be there because she's known him for over a decade, and so his actions have personally hurt her and destroyed their friendship.

It actually went a bit better than I thought it might. My wife was really upset and (since she shows emotions more than I do) I think it really became clear for my former lead pastor just how much he has hurt us. At the end he did apologize for not speaking with me sooner or more clearly. He said that he realizes we need time to forgive and that we will need even more time to trust (in my case, if I ever do trust him again.)

My wife was very clear about what she thought he did wrong as a lead pastor. With some things he agreed with my wife, although with other things he disagreed and argued back. He still stands by his assessment that I'm too introverted and lack the communication necessary to be a pastor. But a couple of interesting things came out in what he said. One, he didn't like that I didn't really communicate how I *felt* with him during my intern time. That was apparently problematic. It was at a more heated point in the conversation so I told him that my feelings were none of his damn business. I mean, call me a product of typical American ""boys don't cry"" upbringing, but I choose who I share my emotions with. And I express them in a rather restrained way. 

He also said that he can't believe that it was only in January that I realized how completely differently I would go about making house visits (i.e. not inviting myself to someone's house because from my perspective that would be rude.) He just couldn't believe that I could not know that it was different in this culture than in America. Which we both found a bit ridiculous because I've never HAD to do house visits before. Then he said, ""Well hasn't your wife told you?"" And we said no. Then he had the gall to ask ""So what do you actually talk about?"" Such a stupid question. 

It's also pretty clear that he still can't comprehend that I am so completely different from him. That I communicate differently, think differently and work differently. It's like he just can't get that. Which is disturbing in a pastor. I even told him that I think my mentor was right when my mentor said that he has never really understood me.

Although he did say something VERY revealing right around the end. My wife told him that she had the feeling that he just dumped me on the charge to see if I could make it. She said she couldn't understand that and did it have something to do with him having a lot of extra work to do?, etc. So he started to talk about his work and then he let slip this nugget: ""When the District Superintendent asked me if I wanted an intern, I thought 'I don't want that.'"" At that point I interrupted him and pointed out just how important that one little phrase was, ""I didn't want an intern."" He got confused because he didn't even realize that he let it slip. But my wife caught it too. I said that I think he brought that attitude into his work whether he realizes it or not. Whether he meant to or not. And I think that attitude really was present the whole time I was there.

Like I said, it was a bit better than I thought it would be. He has seen now just how much he has hurt us. I think that has, for the first time, really been driven home. He still stands by his perspective, but he's been made aware of how many mistakes he's made and he apologized for many of them. What this means for the future, I don't know. Luckily it's not like I have to see him so constantly anymore."
26ay5u,1,2014-05-23,Dilemma on Summer Internship,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/26ay5u/dilemma_on_summer_internship/,"Let me start with a description of myself. I'm a sophomore who has only been studying CS since last fall; so I have 2 semesters under my belt. I decided to pursue a summer internship to get any kind of tech experience on my resume. 

So I found an internship online with a big non tech company in my town. The position is IT intern. Basically it's sitting at the help desk and going out to units when there are problems with computers, printers, etc. I know this isn't an attractive job but it's tech related and a really convenient location for me. I found out after applying that I'd be interviewing with my friends uncle, great. So I interviewed and got the offer probably with a little help from my friend. 

Here's where it gets tricky. Another friends dad contacted me 2 weeks ago while I was job searching. He works at a big time tech company. I sent him my resume and he forwarded it to a colleague who was looking for a software dev intern. I should mention that my advisor at my school about a month ago told me to ""stay away from the IBMs and googles"" this summer (this company may or may not be one of those 2..... :p). 

Now fast forward to this morning and I get an email from his colleague saying that he'd like to have a half hour to hour phone interview early next week. As my programming skills are good but not great, I'm not sure how I would do at this job or even in the interview. But I do realize how it's an incredible experience and internship to put on my resume. 

But I also have already signed to work for the IT position. I would not want to terminate that especially because it would be unfair to my friends uncle. It kinda stinks too because it's only a 20 hour job with a lesser salary than the second internship. 

My question is how do I respond to this interview request? Should I accept/decline? What should I expect to encounter in the interview? And if I were to get an offer, what steps do I take after that?

I worked side by side with Chinese developers and saw how outsourcing is done. I sat in on the meetings with western clients and really got a good look at the other side of software development.

Even my friends in my year have noticed that outsourcing is a hugely relevant issue right now. Some of them told me their boss was always working to not have their jobs outsourced.

My question is, how much, if any, of an advantage does this provide me? I don't want to be a developer forever, and I think I have the skills to provide smooth communication between Western companies and Chinese developers. Are there many jobs for something like this? Honestly, I have never heard of someone doing something quite like this, so I'm not sure.

I have a summer internship that I work at two or three days a week, and today I finished my work early and was able to leave early, which was awesome. I love my internship but really need a paying job so I've been applying all over my city, and since I was off work early I thought I'd follow up at a place at an outdoor market that told me they might have an opening.

The market is really cool and actually fairly famous, but the neighborhood it's in has its ups and downs. It's a bit ghetto and sketchy in places, but also contains a ton of historic buildings, some trendy independently owned shops and restaurants, and a gorgeous park that is probably my favorite place in the whole city. It still has a reputation (especially amongst the middle-class white people in my area) for being hood as fuck and completely unsafe, but from my experience 99% of the people there are friendly, cool, and helpful.

Anyway, I stopped at the market, still in my work clothes (a simple business-casual dress and flats) only to find that the hiring manager had left early and I'd have to stop back tomorrow. But it was a gorgeous day, and not too late in the afternoon, so I decided to walk down to the park I mentioned earlier and enjoy the sunshine for a while, then maybe stop at some of the shops in the trendier part of the neighborhood to see if any of them were hiring. 

On my way down to the park, I realized that the street from the market to the park was actually pretty long, and pretty sketchy. Nothing I couldn't handle, but a couple of jackasses started catcalling me as I walked by (one guy said ""hey baby, lemme get a slice of that pie!"" y'know, shit like that). Ugh. I felt a bit uncomfortable and embarrassed, but I decided to ignore them and go enjoy the park, which I did (had a long conversation with a sweet old black lady about Frieda Kahlo, which was unexpected but cool--like I said, 99% of the people in this neighborhood are friendly and awesome) and then wandered down to the shops for a bit. 

As I started the walk back to my car (which was still parked at the market) I realized that I had absolutely no fucking idea where I was. I turned down what I thought was the right street, looked around, realized I still didn't know where I was, lather, rinse, repeat, until I was totally and thoroughly lost, on one of the sketchier side streets of the area. At this point I was a little worried, but I've gotten lost in worse places, so I just pulled out my phone with GPS for directions back to the market. As I walked in the direction it told me to go, I passed another guy, with several friends, who shouted ""mm baby, how much for that?"" 

I'd never felt more uncomfortable, but I just tried to ignore him and kept walking, even though he was still shouting shit at me, and his friends had joined in. At this point I'm near tears, my feet have blisters on them from my flats, I just want to get the fuck back to my car and go home. I get to an intersection where I need to cross the street. As I'm waiting for the light to turn, I glance behind me and this guy and one of his friends had fucking FOLLOWED me to the intersection and were right behind me, still saying sexually explicit things to me. I turned around to just tell them to stop, thinking maybe that would do something, and saw one of the guys reaching out to try and physically grab my ass.

 At that point I literally ran across the street, because fuck the don't walk sign, and walked as fast as possible back towards where my car was. I made it back to my car, happily, but not before getting catcalled by TWO MORE DIFFERENT GUYS.

I got into my car and literally just sat there and cried for probably ten minutes before I felt stable enough to drive home. I'm probably overreacting, I didn't get groped or raped or assaulted, but I feel so fucking violated and somehow also really embarrassed and ashamed, like it was my fault for wearing a dress and makeup in a sketchy area, or just being in that area in the first place. I feel like if I tell anyone then they'll tell me it's my own fault, I just feel so stupid and ashamed and gross and I don't know what to do or if I should even do anything. All I wanted to do was enjoy a cool neighborhood on a Friday afternoon. Why can't I fucking do that without becoming like some fucking sex object that only exists to be objectified? Fuck.

I'm sorry for the long story and the rant. I just needed to tell somebody. Ugh.

EDIT: Wow, coming back to see all this support really, really helped. Thank you all so much for the virtual hugs and reassurances that it's ok to be upset and that I didn't do anything wrong. I think the most annoying part is that I know with absolute certainty in the logical part of my brain that their actions weren't my fault, and yet for some reason I STILL feel angry at myself. I don't know why that is, and it's as confusing to me as it would be to anyone else. 

For people asking why I didn't put them in their place or defend myself, I should explain that I've never been catcalled by so many people in such a short period of time, and I'm not used to being catcalled at all in the first place (I'm from a pretty suburban area). When that sort of thing happens and you're not prepared for it, your head starts racing and so many thoughts and feelings hit at once, and before you can form a coherent sentence in your defense, even if it's just ""fuck you,"" the moment's over and the people are behind you. I wish I'd said something in retrospect, but I'm trying not to beat myself up about the fact that I didn't."

I'm an avid reader of this sub, because although I work in a very tech heavy field I'm neither a network engineer nor a programmer so I don't have much to contribute until now.

As my company is, obviously, big on security when I went through the IT onboarding process I was exposed to a lot of new security software and procedures that I had never used before. We could use Keepass to keep passwords for some of the things like the VPN and some project related servers. 

However, I had never used Keepass before and when I changed my password from the default, I forgot to save. I had it reset, and promptly did the same exact thing all over again. Since reading this sub, I don't wanna be ""that guy"" who keeps having issues so I held off on calling tech support again trying to guess my password.... And was locked out.

 This morning I called tech support and explained the situation, he fuckin asked me ""Sigillite..... You're new right? Are you gonna be trouble?"" 

God dammit, no! I'm just young and stupid and I've never used this software before. Reset the password to default and I promise Ill never call about this again! I don't wanna be a luser :("

The power rankings were difficult but I don't mind it was fun (Sometimes). Anyway my final power ranking for this run in EVO.

1. Tuba, our commish, he's married has a kid and dealt with my shit for about 2-3 months. I appreciate what you did tuba and good luck being an adult.

2. Mori, you administer the league, and pain to your opponents. Not sure a lot about you but you were cool while I was around.

3. Dave, another admin, you're old have a wife and kid and blaze higher than my GPA.... Sadly the summer job I will have to turn down because I will be doing 35 hours a week at the boys and Girls club, but maybe during my college life you will need an intern.

4. Cowobys, you threw a shit ton of passes, and I always hated putting Jerrod Johnson as POTW, he usually could have won every week

5. Broncos aka Jay aka my PA relative aka my college rival, we'll see a lot of each other during college, so you'll hear my true feelings when we both get drunk and recreate the scene from neighbors.

6. Alpha, you led the division with pride and I wish I could have stopped Arian foster. You're a good guy, have fun with the AFC South

7. Lasser, again lead the division and I couldn't stop Ray Rice, other than that don't know much about you

I'm currently a Math major at UT Austin, wanting to be a Computer Science major. I have a 3.97 GPA, but I didn't get in this semester at a transfer to the CS department at UT. I'm planning on applying again next semester, but just in case, I'm looking at other schools. Currently, I'm looking at UIUC, UMich, UCLA, UWashington, Berkeley, Cornell, Columbia, and UPenn.

Anyway my point is, how difficult is it to transfer from UT to UIUC as a computer science major with a 3.97 GPA? I have about 46 credit hours here, and I'm done with Calculus and a semester of physics with AP credit for statistics, non Calc based physics, and computer science. I'll be taking Linear Algebra and Probability this summer and Physics Electricity and Magnetism in the fall along with differential equations. The rest of my classes are just core classes. I also have an internship at Microsoft, a smaller web development company, and I'm working on a tech startup with a grad student and professor here at UT.

It'll break my heart to leave Austin, but I need a computer science degree, and I think UIUC is a fantastic school and a great opportunity for me to do that. So, what do you think? Do I have a good shot?"

26c7c0,43,2014-05-23,Mrs. Frechette! All I wanted was to love you...,sadie1700,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/26c7c0/mrs_frechette_all_i_wanted_was_to_love_you/,"Adored, wild, strange, irresistible. I have no idea what was in her face that was vaguely lovable.

She molested my visions, provoked pathos. When I closed my eyes, I saw her grey hair tangle to the side, as she glanced at me from her crow's feet-embedded blue eyes. Whenever I was near her, her scent lingered, and I'd pause, let it wash over me.

I was 17-years-old. My mom asked me to come over to her travel agency to drop some food off, because she was still busy at work, and she didn't have time to step away. So my boyfriend left the car engine on, and I darted inside.

That's when I first saw Mrs. Frechette behind the cubicle. Her hair was in a tight bun, and her body was tightly wrapped inside a matching blue blouse and skirt. In the immediate moment, I felt nothing except a curiosity.

But when I came home later that night and drifted off to sleep, I couldn't escape her. There she was, so perfect and prim, grey hair, and laughter lines around her mouth. I felt a strong energy: lust, lust, lust, as she floated in and out of my dreams.

When I awoke, I felt stupid and mediocre. Who am I? What have I done with my life? How do I impress her?

Could I ever be lavished by her love, just for a moment, just for acknowledgment, just for ""the look"" that might as well be a kiss, a kiss that's all-too-brief (still not real), but a moment, yes, a moment that brings she and I closer to the cosmos?

For two years, I tried to escape her. I tried to pretend she didn't exist. But I kept finding excuses to come over to my mom's travel agency. 

""Hey mom, I brought you salad.""

""Hey mom, the accountant wanted me to personally deliver this message to you.""

""Hey mom, can my friend intern here?""

It was always to be around Mrs. Frechette. It was always to see if she knew I existed. It was always so I could smell her scent as I walked past her cubicle.

In the event she was gone, I'd try to remember everything on her desk: her motivational posters, pictures of her family, the Acer monitor tilted just so.

I couldn't mention anything to anyone, but quietly I broke up with my boyfriend, telling him I wanted to ""grow"" and ""explore life"". The reality is, I felt sick. I didn't know how anyone—never mind a girl like me—could ever feel satisfied. Yes, I was in college, now living in a dorm, seemingly with the world at my feet. 

But I didn't have Mrs. Frechette.

Then one day, my mom wasn't in the office, but Mrs. Frechette was alone. It was pouring rain outside—damp—a grey day. 

I walked by her desk, and I don't know what came over me. I just stared.

""What do you want?"" Mrs. Frechette asked me in her cordial, professional manner.

I smiled.

Our passions, dyed with blood from our beating hearts, did not match the present grey day. In that moment, it seemed time stopped—a thin curtain between now and a world of shadows. When our eyes met, it was like suddenly looking at the world as it actually was, instead of a dim looking glass.

And our eyes! They say eyes are the windows to the soul, yet when our gazes locked, I felt that I had to build stratagems and tactics—in the great hope that Mrs. Frechette would not turn contemptuous.

Mrs Frechette, so grey, so curvy, so stately, so *uhhhh!* She will always be beautiful, alluring, heart-stopping, laughing, winking, cajoling, her presence stomping on my dreams and allusions and songs, whispering with her red lips.

Then we kissed.

And all the while, I wondered, ""Mrs. Frechette, do you feel the impulse? Do you feel abandon? Is your stomach making flips, as though it's flung upwards by the wind?""

I felt a flame, and a kaleidoscope of wild colour, and heartbeats racing.

It was there—all in the kiss.

And I knew: I loved her.

That was 10 years ago. Two weeks ago, I married Mrs. Frechette. People think that because I'm her wife, I should call her by her first name—but she'll always be my Mrs. Frechette.

Here's my confession. It's a small one, but important. Last night, I wondered, ""What if our love grows cold?""

But just as quickly, I stared at Mrs. Frechette eye-to-eye, touched her flesh, and whispered to her, ""I love you.""

""I love you too,"" Mrs. Frechette replied.

""Good night, sweetheart.""

26c9bw,9,2014-05-23,I'm overtaken by loneliness and fear,XyphonX,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/26c9bw/im_overtaken_by_loneliness_and_fear/,"So here's the story. Bear with me, it's a long one:

High school was a blast - well, most of it, at least. I wasn't the most popular kid, but I wasn't unpopular, either; I just kinda 'hung' with the general group of friends (which was pretty big, about 20 people, but tight), and had a good time. I liked it like that; I'm not a fan of drawing attention to myself (ironic, yeah, but bear with me) and would much rather prefer to be a sheep in a flock, rather than a shepherd.

Then, high school was over, and me and the friends parted ways.  
As an Israeli (boo, boo, f*** you and your country, yeah yeah.), there's mandatory conscription after high school for 3 years (minimum; can be more), but you can do a year of voluntary 'community service' (not the 'pick up trash from the street' kind, the 'lead youth groups and/or volunteer in other ways' kind) before enlisting. Another option is to go to a college of your choice for 3 years (financed partly by the army), complete your BA. or BSc., and then serve for 6 years - 3 mandatory, 3 more as a 'standing army' soldier, who receives regular pay and has some more benefits.  
Many of my friends went with option b (voluntary community service for one year, then enlistment for 3). I went with option c (completing a BSc., then enlisting for 6 years) and so, while they were in communes around the country volunteering, I was studying. This helped push us afar.

Another reason was, I don't really like my friends' style of going out; they're very outdoorsy people who like to travel and hike, and also party people who love going out at night. I'm a very indoor person, who's into movies and videogames. So that, combined with not being very notable in the group of friends, and my tiredness of calling people to ask them what they're doing tonight - why can't they call me for once, invite me? - Led to the fact that I haven't seen my friends for months, and then for a few years. 

So now I'm making an effort to return to the group - any group (as the large group has split) - of friends, through the help of one friend who has stuck with me, bless his kind heart. But every time I go out with people to pubs or cafes (not movies where I can just focus on the escapism), I am reminded of how lonely I am as they recall previous evenings, and the hang-out turns sour for me (though, of course, I never show any signs of that).  
These are usually the evenings where the hypothetical picture of me, putting a loaded gun to my head and pulling the trigger, comes to mind most.

Aside from that, I've never had a girlfriend (I'm shy around girls, and was fat - my highest weight reaching about 300 pounds - before I underwent sleeve gastrectomy surgery in order to lose weight; I'm still overweight, but I lost around 80 pounds since the surgery, and I feel great physically).  
I only kissed a girl once, at a party abroad with the friends from high-school. The way I did it was pretty pathetic, too; through the power of alcohol, I approached a girl who sat alone and after some mild conversation, told her 'my friend' - pointing at a friend nearby - 'and I had a bet, who could kiss the most beautiful girl in the bar. Can you help me win?'. That led to a quick 2-second kiss, the only one I've had to date (I'm 22 now, this happened at 18).  
I can't use Tinder or OkCupid or whatever, since I barely have any photos of myself that I like, or stand, to see, and of course, if I don't like photos of myself, which girl would like them? Even suppose I got a match on Tinder, I wouldn't know what to say, or what to do if the conversation slows down. I find myself boring. (That's partly why I prefer being at the outskirts of groups - I like listening to conversations far more than participation in 1-on-1 conversations, or being the center of an evening).

Of course, never having had a girlfriend means I never had sex, or anything close to sex (I don't want to use a hooker, for a myriad of reasons). But that's the least of my problems; if I have friends again which I can rely on, if I have a girlfriend who loves me (or at least acts convincingly enough), I can live without that.

What else? I'm constantly hounded by the thought of what would happen if any of my family members died; I fear for my dog, my adoring and wonderful dog, who's age 10-ish (we're not sure, since she's adopted) and already showing signs of age; I have imposter syndrome regarding my work (I've enlisted after finishing my BSc. and am working - or at least, am supposed to work - as a programmer) - I'm currently in an internship stage, but I fear my skills aren't good enough or that I'm too lazy or both. Oh yeah, and I have nearly no real-life knowledge of finances/cooking/anything (I'm not even entirely sure how to swap a flat tire).

My first guard duty is about to come up soon, my first time with a rifle since boot camp. I'm considering pushing the magazine inside, cocking and making a go for it."
26ce3h,1,2014-05-23,Questionable Thoughts [M21/F19] [Somewhat Long],tossawayLDR,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/26ce3h/questionable_thoughts_m21f19_somewhat_long/,"First off: I decided against posting this to /r/relationships, because I don’t feel as if they would understand long distance as well as you guys do.  I do follow this subreddit on my main account.    
  
Here's the situation:  a little more than two years ago I met a girl online.  We hit it off and I ended up meeting her very shortly thereafter. I went way out of my comfort zone with that but it ended up very well. This is my very first relationship, and it is hers as well. I love this girl immensely.  I am not sure when we will be able to close the gap because she wants to get her masters, or doctorate even. She just finished up her first semester of college. I am about a year away from finishing my Bachelors and there’s an extremely low chance I will continue and get a masters. She occasionally begs me to move to her, 5 states away, after I graduate. I currently live with my parents and work part time while I finish up school, and I enjoy it. They also like my girlfriend for the most part.  Though, my girlfriend says I need to ""choose what is more important” that being, her or my family; and “live my own life” and be the one to close the distance as soon as possible. She has tried to make me promise I will move there to be with her and “it’s not like I’d be alone” as I’d have her there to help provide a little bit of financial support. I personally have no problem with the distance.  At times, however, she does.  She can’t handle it as well as I can.  I may just be a terrible person, but I value my time away from her (we use video calling daily) I have my own life to attend to, but that doesn’t mean I don’t make time for her.  I just want us to live our lives long distance for now and experience life before we finally live together, I’m (sort of) ok with that being a few years from now.  She wants the distance to end ASAP so we can get our life together started.  This is a girl I would have no problem marrying and starting a family with.  

Here’s the catch: I recently began a year-round internship with an extremely good company. I’m talking google-tier.  The experience and knowledge I will gain (and have already gained) during this internship will be very valuable to me, and having this company on my resume helps line me up for major success in the future. This is a position I would keep throughout my remaining 2 or 3 semesters of school and I would most likely be turned into a full time employee after I graduate (according to my uncle, who works there as well). She is extremely supportive and seems super happy for me and excited.  I wonder if she even yet realizes this hurts my chance at closing the distance almost entirely… or if she’s just not voicing it to me because she doesn’t want to seem unsupportive.  
She will inevitably ask it… Should I ever be expected to give up a good position in the future to move to her…? (This company has no presence in her state, so I wouldn’t be able to “just transfer”)  I could not imagine ever giving up an amazing opportunity like this… I don’t exactly want to be the one to make the move.  My family is pretty important to me.  A good majority of us are FINALLY all together in the same state. Everything is going well.  My girlfriend says she would also be giving things up, which I understand, but I don’t feel as if it is nearly as much as I would be giving up (I understand this is a selfish thought… I can’t help it.  She lived with her dad during high school and although they have a good relationship, he was happy to have “gotten rid of her” when she left for college.)       
  


And now… the bad thoughts I’ve been having for the past month: I've been told I'm a very attractive guy, however I never was able to talk to women without being awkward all throughout my teenage years and up until now. As much as I love my girlfriend, I feel as if I’m also missing out on a lot of experiences by being in this LDR.  My relationship has taught me a lot about myself, and overall transformed me into a more confident/likable person. My parents tell me to keep my options open, but it kind of hurts me when they say that because it’s like they think I should find a girl closer to home that is “less trouble.” Most of the time, I can’t imagine being with anyone else.  The really sad thing is, I sometimes sort of agree with my parents but I don’t want to risk giving up an amazing relationship for something so uncertain.  I also feel guilty for even THINKING about it.  I'm afraid of ruining the relationship, but I’m also afraid that I may be limiting myself and preventing myself from having an amazing relationship/experiences with someone else.   I don't want to end this relationship because it would absolutely devastate her and it would hurt me very badly as well.      
  

Am I being selfish?  Are my feelings warranted?  Do I really have a reason to end this relationship and try to find someone else closer to home? I don’t feel like we have any problems in our relationship (sometimes we fight, but that’s assumed with every relationship).  I really don’t think we should break up… I just want her to be happy but I need to set up my career before I do ANY moving.  I do realize we are both young… I just want some insight from some people with more experiences than myself.  Note, she has said she would move to me (after her schooling) if I never ended up going there.

At both meetings, they admitted they made a computing error and that my daughter should have been named valedictorian, but they refused to change the results and correctly name her valedictorian. Aside from all of the accolades and recognition that she should receive at the end of the school year, I am thinking that she may miss out on in terms of internships and job opportunities going into and during college.

A little about me. I live in PA, attend school in VT, and just finished a semester abroad in Montreal. Starting this fall I will be starting my senior year as a game programmer with a completed minor in mathematics. Clearly I love to play video games (when time allows), but on top of that I also read, cook, hike, watch anime, and consider myself an amateur astronomer. 

I do my best to constantly strive for self-improvement, in both myself and those close to me. Yet I never waste an opportunity to relax with friends or devour a bag of candy.

As I said in the title, I am mixed race, black and hispanic. I have naturally curly hair, but in about the fifth grade, I begged my mom to allow me to straighten my hair. Ever since then, I have been getting relaxers, with an about 18 month break, ending this past January.

I regret now ever relaxing my hair. It was gorgeous when I was younger, and I don't know if I will ever be able to get that back. I've also been coloring my hair, in various ways, since 8th grade.

First semester of college, I really started to grow tired of my hair. I attemted to wear it natural, but it just wasn't working. Over half of my previous relaxer had grown out, but the damage was done. I finally caved in January. My hair has been dyed red twice in this time frame, once in the fall, and again about a month ago.

Now I have new growth and its frustrating to straighten it every day. I could always get the relaxer touched up, but I don't want my hair to be any more damaged then it already is. I can't not flat iron it, but even then it gets frizzy and looks terrible. I have a job and an internship, I have to look presentable, but that is getting increasingly challenging. I honestly don't know what to do.

Thanks in advance for any help however it may come. I don't know how to put my hair though rehab while looking presentable day to day."

Let me explain my scenario. I am a (f18) and I am about to graduate from high school. These past four years have been nothing but my drive to succeed in school, study, and get straight A's. Along the way, I sacrificed my social life and relationships. I have been asked out on dates, i've had a few boyfriends- but it never worked out. This was due in large part to my crazy schedule with sports, my internship, peer tutoring, debate, etc. School has been my main focus for these past four years and I have never really felt obligated to get side tracked by a relationship. 

Well, my hard work paid off and I was accepted into a professional program that guarantees my JD Law degree in six years.
However, I resent the fact that I have focused on school so much because I forced myself to hold boys at a distance. Come my senior year, I was in a short relationship with a fellow debate partner of mine, and we split because I had no time for the relationship. This was in december, and after we split I decided no more relationships. I needed to focus on school, college apps, water polo, debate, mock trial, my internship, etc. (I have no idea how I managed to do all of this, to be honest).

At the time of my split, I got a paid reporting job that I could do on the side. My internship was not paid, so I had to make money some how. So I took the reporting job and was in charge of writing weekly articles on boys water polo. Through my job, I met many different athletes and got to know them on a more personal level. I was driven by this job because I found strength in my job because I channelled all of my anger and resent from my breakup into writing.

As I started to adjust to my job, I met one player. We can call him A. Now A was different from any other player that I had met; he was intelligent, considerate, and we clicked instantly. The first interview we had was over skype because I couldn't plan one in person, due to my insane schedule. Our interview went for around two hours, and we didn't really get much work done outside of talk about god knows what.
I got to know A throughout the season through a professional relationship, and I forced myself to keep it professional even though I thought he was extremely attractive.

Well, thanks to religiously reading Askmen threads, after the season was over, I admitted that I thought he was incredibly attractive out of the blue. It took him a day to respond, which made me nervous as heck, but we decided to establish a FWB arrangement.
This was in december. Fast forward to May.

The intent of this physical relationship was to just have sex. We both didn't want relationships, and we didn't want to be tied down. I felt like I was too busy for anyone, but I needed a way to release stress. Sex is something that I turn to as a way to relieve all of my tension.
Our FWB relationship has worked out tremendously because we have become close friends. I know these types of relationships aren't supposed to work this way, but somehow it just happens. As I reflect on these past few months, I realize what made this work is the mutual respect we established earlier in the arrangement. I did not talk to anyone about this because he told me he didn't want his teammates to find out about us being fwb. While this is a huge dick move, I just decided to say ""okay"" and proceed to keep quiet for the next six months.

A and I have become good friends. Although I initiate conversations 97% of the time, he's always willing to listen. (Although i'm sure that I annoy the shit out of him sometimes :) He knows about my friend's suicide, that my old editor's daughter is diagnosed with stage 3 lukemia (I visit her on a weekly basis, and she is very dear to me), and i've gotten him a paid internship at a law firm through my uncle. I know about some of his past, he's given me advice, and been (according to him ) ""the rock"". We both trust each other and it's taken a while to establish that mutual trust. In fact, he said to me, ""You're actually the first girl who hasn't run around and told everyone about us. I applaud you.""

However, the other day (tuesday) I was with my friends and we were discussing why I couldn't tell them about A. I have kept A a secret from my friends and family because those were his wishes. I thought this was fine, until one of my close friends said, ""Why do you defend him when he is just embarrassed of you?""

What she said made me think. I mean, if I was giving A a paid job, inviting him to my birthday party (it's going to be a gigantic bash!); why should I be friends with someone who's embarrassed of me? This angered the fuck out of me.

On a side note, I have been super stressed due to finals, and my friend's memorial is coming up. This is the friend that committed suicide. Lately my mood hasn't been the best and I have been trying to keep everything together. The impact of my editor's daughter's sickness is overwhelming, and it's hard to handle everything when you really want to cry. However, crying will not help, and I have to carry on.
Back to my story, I was feeling particularly stressed on tuesday due to the memorial, my senior project, and finals. But the thought that he was embarrassed made me so angry, so I sat him down the next day, and told him he couldn't be my friend anymore because I knew he was embarrassed. At one point I started to cry, and he just sat there in silence for a few minutes.

After I was done, I told him that he could leave. I didn't want to subject him to that situation and make him feel trapped. But instead, he said to me, ""can I please explain?""

He said: ""Look, I can understand why it looks that way. But you need to know that i'm not embarrassed of you. In fact i'm very impressed by you. You're smart, attractive, driven, the connections you have, and it's amazing how much you care about others. You have a lot on your plate, obviously, and I don't blame you for feeling stressed. I'm not embarrassed, and I never meant to come off that way. The thing is, I really don't like the guys that I have to play with that go to your school. I try to stay away from them because I never really got along with them. But now that we're leaving you can tell them. I just didn't want to deal with them asking me at practice about you and I, but high school is over and if they have something to say, then that's a risk i'm going to have to take.""

We sat there for the next three hours talking about life, relationships, and just chilling. Eventually we had sex in the back of my car hahaha.

Now here I am, talking to a boy I barely knew six months ago. We didn't want a relationship, we've grown close, and I thought he was just using me for sex. I have no feelings for this dude, but I have grown to care for him.

However, he admits to me that he's never had a best friend and he wants to get married so he can find someone to share that bond with (this is his reasoning, although it doesn't make sense). During his freshman and sophomore year, he wanted a girl friend so badly, and he's had a really bad experience with a girl. This was the night when I saw a more vulnerable side of him, and we was incredibly sweet and it was actually adorable listening to him explain his thoughts on relationships.

Well, as the classic tale goes, I can't stop thinking about him since that night. I realize that, even if I didn't want a relationship with him in the beginning, I'm starting to see that I have developed feelings for him. He and I click so well together, we bring out the best in each other, and there's so much trust in our friendship.

I'm not entirely sure where this leaves him and I, but I am so scared to tell him how I feel. He makes me feel happy, like I get this tingly feeling inside my chest when I think of him. No boy has ever done that before. I just want to be around him all the time now, and we could talk to each other for hours. I want him to be happy and successful.

But I am so nervous to ruin our friendship because it took a while to build something like this. I am also scared shitless of rejection. Give or take, I don't want to have a feeling of heartbreak- because when you meet someone who you think is so right for you, it just clicks. However, I have a high chance of rejection because he will be leaving right after graduation to go train overseas in Europe for water polo, and then he comes back in August to start training for college. I'm not really sure what to do at this point.

I asked my brothers and they didn't know either, and so I ask the people of reddit for their help.

We want to do maybe one or two weeknights plus weekends for raiding, but that may increase. After 6pm PST is when we will probably be free (don't have final work schedule).

We are both vets, I did hardcore raiding in Vanilla WoW (It's a bit fuzzy as I was young). He also played Vanilla WoW, and I know he was pretty into it but idk how much.

26d89e,2,2014-05-24,I think I'm going to drop out of university... again.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/26d89e/i_think_im_going_to_drop_out_of_university_again/,"TL;DR: made the mistake of choosing a course I didn't care about again. Inevitably going to drop out/get kicked out. Don't plan on going to university again anytime soon. What should I do now?

Good morning everyone, I'm a 20 year old from the UK.

So here's my story. In September 2012, I started a Chinese and Japanese course at University of Manchester after finishing A levels. I wanted to take a gap year but having Asian parents meant I had to go to uni. My mom forced me to pick a course from clearing. It wasn't entirely her fault though. Going to a grammar school made it seem like university was the only option. They didn't talk about what other paths to take. Anyway, I went to UoM for four months and decided to drop out without telling my parents first. I couldn't take studying something I didn't enjoy or care about.

For the rest of the year, I lived with my cousin in London and did a couple of internships at creative agencies. I really had a lot of fun and experience working around in the office with like minded people and going to video shoots to help out. I even briefly appeared in an online Microsoft ad.

September 2013, I started going to Aston University to do Multimedia Computing. Honestly, I didn't want to go to university again. But I also didn't want to dispppint my mom. I know, I haven't learned my lesson from the year before. I always say to myself to be more selfish, and to make decisions for myself and not for my mom, but I made the stupid mistake again. I managed to somehow get through a year of lectures but I hadn't learned anything. I thought the course would be a good mix of something I'd enjoy and something that would help me in the future as the course was supposed to be about creative media and programming. Turns out programming made up 90% of the course and the multimedia part of the course was useless, as they taught Flash which no one uses anymore.

Which brings me to now, May 2014. I have exams next week and now I know I won't pass them. Simply because I haven't taken anything in. I literally know nothing. I'm not enjoying this course at all. I've had such a bad experience that every time I open up my coding program that I feel a bit sick. 

The reason I don't want to go to university is because there's no courses I like that aren't Mickey Mouse courses. I'm a creative person and I like to learn practically so I can't learn by sitting in a lecture hall and reading presentations. All the ones I do like, like Filmography or Photography are apparently useless, and I'm scared because of that. I don't want to waste money on a course that won't help me in the future.

So now my question is, what should I do? In a better world, I'd get a job and rent a flat and move out so I wouldn't have to disappoint and rely on my parents anymore. Is that feasible? I just know that my mom is gonna get so mad and so upset that I failed university again. I feel so pathetic."

26dc7i,6,2014-05-24,(23/m - 8 years deep) Day 1. First serious quit. Beginning with a camping trip.,doingbusinessDOBIS,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/26dc7i/23m_8_years_deep_day_1_first_serious_quit/,"Well first let me give you some background. I'm 23, and I've been smoking for about 8 years, with 5-6 daily use, and 1 year of almost exclusive concentrate use. 

I've tried (to no avail) to curb my consumption for years, but I've only ever smoked more and stronger products as time went on. The last year, I've been smoking dabs almost exclusively, which has made it even harder. The feelings that I felt the last two times I tried to take a week off have shown me how deeply psychologically and even physically dependent I am on this substance.

I was always a kick-ass student, but I had a sad freshman year of college, leading me (or as a result of?) spending most of my time in my dorm numbing myself with sweet Indica. This time period was probably the first that I treated marijuana in a negative, dependent, crutch-type way.

And ever since then, I've been ""getting by"". I went to a state school for a degree in English, where it wasn't very competitive, and I could get decent grades doing very little, skipping lots of class, and handing in 90% complete research papers.

But I rode my privilege even further, and with very few credentials (no internships, and very little relevant work experience from those years, because ""who cares? let's just get high.""), I got a decent paying job as a web editor for a big corporation that makes web sites for small businesses. I was really excited to kick ass at something for the first time in a really long time. For once, to not know I could do better with effort, but to actually put that effort forth and reap the glory of a job well done.

I didn't smoke before work for the first month. Then, as soon as I was comfortable enough in my duties to feel like I could get away with it, I took a dab before work. Immediately, I started taking dabs before work every single day. Then one day on lunch break, I realized that I had an oil rig down in the car for the night that I would spend at my GF's. From that point forward, I took a dab AT WORK on every lunch break.

After doing this for a few weeks, it occurred to me that all the problems I had in college were creeping into my work life -- I became incredibly anxious around people, I tried so hard to be DL that I more or less stopped socializing with my peers, it made it impossible to think linearly resulting in terrible efficiency, I was sleepy all day every day, and overall, I was satisfied with the bare-ass minimum.

After several attempts at avoiding pre- and at-work dabs, always ending in failure (sometimes a couple weeks, other times only days -- because you and I know that there is always an excuse for why this one time is ok), it became abundantly clear that due to my lack of self control and dependence on this substance, I was at the bottom of the pack in my team.

In a major turn of events, soon after, my entire department was laid off and outsourced. We had 7 weeks to continue working through the transition period and find new jobs. Once again, I rode my wave of privilege and found a job as the social media manager for a small marketing firm. 

I would have to move, I would have to start a new job... And I had to accept, finally, that I could not succeed at this new opportunity if I am high all the god-damn time. I could not become comfortable in the work place with my co-workers, if I'm spending all my mental energy hiding this ""secret"" from everyone. I just didn't want to makes ALL THE SAME MISTAKES THAT I HAVE BEEN MAKING FOR 5+ YEARS.

So that brings me to now. Yesterday was my last day at my old job, and it was also my last day smoking/dabbing.

I'm going on a 3-day camping trip with some of closest, oldest friends, and I'm hoping that being in the woods away from everything will help to keep me in the moment and act as a natural anti-depressant, pending the inevitable anger and mood swings that I'm about to experience. And next week is all about getting my things packed up and moving to my new apartment, where I plan to bring NO weed things. Nothing. Nada. 

This will be the first time that I've gone more than 7 or 8 hours, without specifically planning for a way to get high at the first reasonable moment. And it's fucking scary. I'm scared. I'm anxious. But for the first time since I began this love affair (and oh it was a love affair), I'm ready to be done. Done with the social anxiety, done with the couchlock, done with the bad eating habits, done with my mediocrity.

So here I stand before you. Day 1. Strap yourselves in because it's about to be a roller coaster."
26dfc5,13,2014-05-24,Why do I do this?,[deleted],adultery,https://www.reddit.com/r/adultery/comments/26dfc5/why_do_i_do_this/,"I've had affairs for years, multiples, I've had several APs on the go at one time all while holding down a career and keeping a family going.
I just can't do it anymore. The lying, the identities I have to keep going. I've fallen for APs before and they for me but I can't ever leave my family life, I have young kids and they mean too much to me.
Every time I have to break off with an AP it kills me just a little bit more, I know I shouldn't get emotionally involved but I guess that's just me - APs for me are about more than just sex, I need that emotional attachment too and that's when it becomes dangerous.
When you have something that means so much to you and time and time again you have to break it off and start again with someone else.
It's like the most fucked up version of Groundhog Day you could find.
I've just ended things with AP.. I don't even know the number ? 50 something? She had to go back west and wanted me to go with her, as much as my heart screamed at me to just be with her my head wouldn't let me.
So here I am again, keeping my happy home face on and no one knows that I'm just dying inside, again.

26dgza,2,2014-05-24,Boss wants me to study,Daylen,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/26dgza/boss_wants_me_to_study/,"Hey guys,

Some time ago I accepted a job as a web developer. I get paid pretty much nothing (if you calculate taxes and everything I end up about €2 below minimum wage for people younger than I am, I don't think it's even legal), but it was a job and I needed it. I was promised that in 3 months I'd be able to sign a contract with normal pay as they just didn't know me yet and I had no references.

Now the 3 months are over and my boss sent me an e-mail with the following;

- July 1st they're going to upen up a new office (current one is at boss' home who just had brain surgery so that office can't be used until boss recovers (too much stress))
- They've been monitoring me, I'm a good programmer but planning and structure aren't good enough
- I can go study for developer
- If I do, I can keep working there to get more working experience

Basically, either I go study or they kick me out.

Now, I accepted the job purely because I was having a kid and I was unemployed. I would've said no straight away except my dad told me not to, and then they offered the below-minimum pay as compensation for the 3 months 'internship'.

Before that I was planning on simply expanding my own company. I had a base that was pretty decent and could've easily gotten that to a highly profitable business.

Now in the past 3 months I've had no time to work on my business; I have no new projects and the customers that use my services basically pay less than what hosting the services costs me.

So I have two options;

- Keep working for boss, boss is a cool person with a decent company. I'll have to go study, end up with a mediocre pay (the best payed programmer gets about half of average in the country, average of programmer in the country is twice average income). Until I finish the study I will simply be working my ass off for nothing, I can't even buy diapers from that. No risk, no reward.
- Take my company seriously. I have 3 customers but that's it. I have no website, no real administration, no portfolio, no nothing. I could build up a website with a way to easily gain customers in a week and I can hire my sister to to the administration. High risk but potentially very high reward.

For now my parents are very supportive. They let me, my girlfriend and our 3-month old daughter live in their house for free, they pay for everything we can't (including food, diapers and clothing) and they help us cover things like insurance. If I get a real plan my dad would help me build up my company, but he'd rather I just stick with my boss because it's safer.

What would you do in my case?"
26dlsj,1293,2014-05-24,TIFU by shutting down an entire airline in 1997.,BikerJedi,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/26dlsj/tifu_by_shutting_down_an_entire_airline_in_1997/,"While in college, pursuing a degree in Information Systems, I got a job at now defunct Western Pacific airlines. It was basically a paid internship to do all sorts of computer related stuff. They were a small airline based in Colorado Springs, CO, and then later in Denver. They attempted to take over Frontier airlines and went bankrupt in 1998.

One day before I left work, my boss gives me several long Ethernet cables and tells me ""Go patch in the new modems into the computer network."" So I head down to the data room.

Now, I think it is important that you know that I had only been in a real data room twice before, and I had never worked in one. For those that don't know, they have raised floors so you can run cables under the floor tiles, lots and lots of racks of computer equipment, tons of AC to keep it all cool, etc.

Anyway, I walk in, find the modem bank, find several modems that have no cables attached. I look at the ones that are wired in, follow the cables, figure out where they are plugged into, and wire up the new modems just like those. Then I replace the floor tiles I pulled up and head home for the day.

The next day I come in to work after class is out and my badge doesn't work. The guard tells me to wait. A minute later my boss and two security guards show up and escort me to the CEO's office. Inside the office, besides the CEO, are the CIO, CFO, my boss and the two bosses above him. They start questioning me.

What did I do yesterday at the end of the day? Did I get the modems working? Did I remove floor tiles? Did I notice anything out of the ordinary? Long story short, I had somehow kicked loose the power cable for the main pyramid server that ran the airline. So for 45 minutes, WestPac could do nothing. They couldn't sell tickets, make reservations, board planes, take off, etc. Nothing. I was told I cost the airline somewhere near $200,000. I don't know if that is accurate or not. Eventually someone noticed that the server had no power and plugged it back in.

I didn't lose my job over that. They all had a good laugh, and admonished me to be more careful in the future. I suggested that they find a way to lock the cable down, but they rejected that idea.

Since it's a summer thing, I'm looking for anything from sales to delivery tbh. From what I've seen, the only jobs in my area seem to be targeted towards females (nail salon jobs/hostess and such) or long term residents (delivery jobs require knowledge of the area, which I have none of)

I'm alright with minimum wage I guess (I won't be too picky, but more than minimum would be great)

Just looking to hear what some of you think, I hope you can help me with my job search by giving me some pointers as for what I should be looking for. 


Thanks in advance!"

Tell Dan to get his shit together. I just sat in traffic for 45 minutes because some idiot decided to shut down Tryon so a bunch of obese people could waddle their way through a 5k gasping for life. Your town is too fat for this shit. I sat 100 feet from my building watching fat people sweat for 30 minutes while a fat cop wouldnt even let me idle across the road between the packs and I was only at the halfway point. These people were so pathetic that they had at least a 30 minute spread a mile or two into the race. You look like a man who was in shape at one point of your life. We both know this is doable in under 30 minutes without training.

Im not saying we cant let them run. These people should be encouraged to run (even walk, as most were doing). Just intelligently set up a course somewhere. I can find plenty of rural roads on a map of NC if you need my help for that. If youre going to fucking shut down the pipeline to the heart of the city, do it for people who arent losers. I would only expect that kind of preferential treatment for athletes.

Those that haven't, still have their friends and family to support them through these difficult times.

Me? I have been rejected from every single place I applied to and have been called a failure. Now I have given up. And frankly I have had my eyes opened over the past year because every single company I applied to are corrupt and greedy motherf**kers. Even those bloody ""non-profits"" and charities where they pay their CEOs 6 figure salaries and their interns nothing. Why? Because it is in human nature to be greedy and selfish. The very act of competition means to stamp out the weak and that is how nature functions. I am WEAK and I am scheduled to be stamped out sooner or later...  I have no desire of living in a corrupt and injustice world where where liars and sociopaths are rewarded and the rest are trampled on and exploited. I don't want the government to have the luxury of taxing me to death to continue to support their illegal wars and assassinations in other countries rather than attending to the needs of their own struggling citizens.

I have no friends who can support me. Not even my god damn parents support me. My parents said that if I can't snap out of my ""current mindset"" I might as well ""jump in front of a speeding train"". Yeah its always like that with them.  My parents always had high expectations and only ever saw me as a tool to support their desires so that they can gossip with their friends and family.

So here I am now. Alone in my flat for another week and thinking of ending it all...because whats the point of living anymore...? This world couldn't care less if I lived or died... I never asked to be born in this HELL on earth so why do I have to be obliged to keep living and pleasing other people?

I am a full-time student at the University of Maryland who wishes to take on internships and studies abroad in Tel Aviv, Israel. I've answered any questions below.

&gt;**ABOUT ME**

I am a full-time undergraduate student at the University of Maryland majoring in Legal Studies (with a minor in Business Administration). I work as a paralegal intern in Washington, DC, but I live in Montgomery County, MD. I'm in the last stretch of my undergraduate program (and therefore trying to boost a 3.5 GPA to 3.8 before it's too late).

Upon graduation (likely Spring 2015), I will be aiming high for law school to focus on Business and International Law.



&gt;**ABOUT THE PROGRAM**

The program, provided by WUJS Israel ( www.wujsisrael.org), is roughly five months long, and would place me in internships in fields of my choosing (I'm shooting for entrepreneurship).

While in the program, I would be living independently among Israelis while working at an internship about 30 hours per week and fostering a command of the Hebrew language on the side. I would also be networking extensively and participating in group activities like field trips and hikes.

While I'm there, I will still be enrolled at Maryland via online classes, so any free time I have down there will remain somewhat limited as it is currently (I wouldn't have it any other way).

The price tag for the program is about $8,000 (pretty hefty to raise in only a few months).



&gt;**WHY TEL AVIV, ISRAEL?**

Israel is known as the ""Start-Up Nation"" and for a good reason: its roughly 60-year-old economy is flourishing beyond comprehension. This internship would provide me a wonderful opportunity to get involved in the start-ups that contribute to this boom from their earliest stages.

The majority of Israel's start-ups are in Tel Aviv, a thriving metropolis that absorbs the bulk of Israel's population (second only to Jerusalem). Most of these companies are hi-tech and have made significant advances in a short period of time.

A long-term goal of mine is to ""make Aliyah,"" meaning I intend to acquire Israeli citizenship and live there.



&gt;**WHY I CHOSE GOFUNDME (AND WHAT ELSE I'M DOING)**

Being a full-time student while raising money and maintaining a healthy and successful work-school-life balance has proven hectic—particularly in this case where the time-span is rather short—but I do what I can. I'm going out of my way to exhaust all available sources of funding outside of this platform.

•  **I've applied for numerous scholarships and grants and am always researching to find more.** I spend a huge chunk of my time drafting e-mails, essays, and letters to individuals and organizations that align with programs like WUJS asking about resources for funding.

•  **I'm posting flyers** to bulletin boards at my local Jewish Community Center, some synogagues, and other relevant establishments.

•  **I'm saving money** from my current internship. I anticipate that this will make up the bulk of the funding.



&gt;**WHAT YOU GET FOR CONTRIBUTING**

I don't enjoy the idea of being a beggar, but my monetary options are quite limited. So where my ability is lacking, willingness will have to do. With that in mind, I've decided among some options below:

•  **A Blog.** Blogs allow me to live vicariously through others. So, to update those who are curious about where their money is going (and anyone else for that matter), I'll be maintaining one. This content will include massive amounts of pictures, commentary, and video—all taken, written, and filmed by me. As long as I find Wi-Fi, there will be updates.

•  **""Thank You"" Letters.** I enjoy saying ""thank you,"" so expect some extensive letters saying so (and you'll probably get more than one).

•  **Souvenirs.** I love getting gifts for people. Just ask me for a souvenir and it'll be in your hands soon enough!

Admittedly, these perks certainly aren't extravagant, but they are among what I can offer for the time being. I am also open to more ideas as I enjoy giving back what I can.



&gt;**...AND SOME FINAL THOUGHTS...**

**$8,000 is a hefty price tag.** With that said, I feel that fulfillment of that amount through GoFundMe is an irrational expectation. I've seen causes much greater than this get extraordinary funding in mere days. This is more for my own benefit, so as stated above, I anticipate my own funding will make up the bulk of the payment.

**Nevertheless,** all contributions, from $1 (yes, really) to the highest anyone can give, are very much appreciated. Thank you!"
26etdz,10,2014-05-24,Scared with noone to turn to... Anyone please help?,teethadvice,Dentistry,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dentistry/comments/26etdz/scared_with_noone_to_turn_to_anyone_please_help/,"Hi all,  
  
I've been irresponsible with my teeth and I take full responsibility that I haven't been taking care of it as I should. But now I need advice and I feel like crying because I'll be all alone in this. And this is super long because there's a lot of history. 
  
Two years ago, I decided to go to the dentist by myself. I was 19. Mom isn't particularly fond of dentists and do not respect their practice. She has drilled in me since I was a kid that dentists just are out to get money by recommending treatments for patients that they don't need. Anyway, I had to make the appointment and arrange everything myself. I took public transportation and went in alone. The dentist told me I needed to have one filling and asked if I wanted to get it done. I said that I had to ask my mom first.  
  
Well, I asked my mom and she goes on this rants on how you can fix cavities and that I shouldn't get the fillings done and that she's not paying for anything. And, again, that made my self esteem feel low but I thought that maybe it wasn't meant to be as I have to return to college the next week anyway. I decided to listen to her wishes and be very diligent with my teeth as I came back to college. But, I was still planning to return during winter break to get it done and informed my mom of my plans. And she said it was unnecessary nor urgent and you can just wait till you get back the next summer. 
  
So, I was like okay. I didn't return home the next summer as I was doing internships and what not, but I think next christmas break  I finally decided to go to the dentist again. And then the dentist was like now I have 4 teeth that needs to get work done. And that the one tooth would need a root canal now because I waited too long. Of course, that made me feel terrible. Again, I told my mom what he said, and she started saying the same things and making me feel bad about any decision I was to make about my teeth. And that the dentist is fooling me and just wants money. In the end, I decided to go against my mother's wishes, and get the three new cavities filled, but I couldn't afford the root canal and there wouldn't be any time since I had to go to college soon. I broke down and started crying in the dentist seat because 1. I was alone 2. Just feeling overly terrible on how I caused this on myself and 3. Because I wasn't certain if I was making the right decision. Mother pretty much told me that whatever I was doing with my teeth would be my own decision, and she's against everything, and doesn't want to hear about it. When I look back at that day at the dentist, I feel super embarrassed because I was just crying on his chair and he even gave me a discount, but it was still not an experience I want to repeat. 
  
Now, I finally graduated. And it is two years after the fact and I haven't gotten the main tooth problems I needed fixed. And I have two really bad pains in my two back teeth on either side. Plus, one of my filling my previous dentist did is too high and I just dealt with it for a year (I was able to do this because of my bad alignment of my teeth from a braces stint has caused my top and bottom teeth to not really close together. Again I am planning to fix this once I have money and not rely on my mother's advice because when I lost my retainer, she told me that it wasn't necessary to get one. In fact, she was really upset when the ortondist put permanent retainers on me and didn't want me to wear the normal retainer and balked that people wore it for the rest of their lives)... Plus, I never really liked how my braces (since I had overbite) made my jaw protrude. It really affected how I viewed my attraction, and the orthodontist when I was younger recommended that I get some teeth extracted because my mouth was too small or teeth too big (I forget), but my mom went against it. Even my friends noticed it happening (my jaw getting big) and it's another thing, I deeply regret and wish I could somehow change.  
  
Again, I made alot of mistakes with my teeth and I just don't know what to do. I just graduated from college, and do not have alot of money. I'm just ashamed because if I just decided to come home for winter break that one time and get that main cavity filled I wouldn't be having this severe pain right now. When I tell my mom about my teeth pain, she again just tells me that I can fix it with special toothpaste and stuff. Today, I just asked her and swallowed my pride if she can come with me to a new dentist in my next appointment the Monday after memorial weekend, she declined and said no. That she's going to work and she doesn't want to hear about anything. 
  
Now, I'm trying to take initiative and not rely on others to make important decisions with my body and health. I am thinking that I would need two of my teeth extracted now because I let the infection go on for too long. Which really scares me.  I just don't know what to do. I have $5,000  saved up from school so I can pay for possible dentist work, but how would I know if I'm making the right decision. Dentists for some reason I can't fully trust and since I already broke down in front of one of them, that just makes it even more negative. And plus, what about my orthodontist work that I have to get done in the future, should I be somehow thinking about what I should do to make sure the treatments coincide with one another. I do want my jaw to return to normal size and my teeth to close and align again. There's just so many issues that I don't know where to start."

Not only just going out and being in social situations is draining enough,I got two sucky grades and got few things to do to get better ones,otherwise I might have to do a extra test to determine if I'll fail or not.

There's the activity hours I need to get from stuff like intern jobs,etc. And there's this thing in my country that you have a huge final project at college to show to a couple of teachers in front of tons of people. I'm graduating in 2 years and I'm not ready for that.

Most days I wish I didn't had to wake up,the only time I feel good is when I'm sleeping. I'm loosing touch with myself,I rather spend my time daydreaming about many different lives where I'm a girl.

Got other body issues as well. My hair is falling pretty bad,by skin is extremely dry and not only I will start braces after years with them(had to take them out because my former dentist was doing something wrong),my gum is in a awful state. And I'm pretty sure I got retinal detachment on my eye but after some tests my doctor said it's nothing.

Now my father says he found a therapist for my brother and I,and I'm pretty sure it's going to suck. And the worst thing is that I know I should just stop whining and find a job to do everything on my own,but I'm too weak. 

I feel like I'm going to burst at any time."

To the computationalists out there: Have you found an effective method of maintaining a lab notebook?

The method I currently have is using a binder and a lab notebook. The physical lab notebook contains information on the two projects I am currently working. It is presented in a problem-solution format with the pages dated and numbered. My problem-solution format usually looks like this:
&gt;
&gt;**Problem:** The Job failed
&gt;
&gt;**Solution:** Check log file.
&gt;      Job hit wall time.

My Binder has the following sections:

* Terminal/Unix - This contains some unix/terminal commands that I have yet to commit to memory and information about the clusters I can run jobs on.

* LaTeX/R A couple of quick reference guides and paper copies of any finalized code.

* Matlab- Matlab is split off because it is a central part of my second project so I have a lot more example code here.

* Working code/Project - This is mainly a pet project I have that contains some working examples of QM like a particle in a box and stuff that I made for practice. 

* Meeting notes/Workshop notes - Any group meeting or workshop notes go here. Personal meetings with my mentors on the project go in my lab notebook.

* Book problems- I have this subdivided between 5 books I work problems from: General chem, Thermo, Quantum, Biophysics and GRE. Remember I've been working on this for a while so I don't do problems from every book every week so I'm not ""overloading myself"" and I'm not going to ""burn out."" I say this because I've had to justify this to others before...

* Projects- General background info on projects such as publications (also stored on the computer in mendeley) and other readings go here.

I'm a biophysics major and CS/Chem minor so the lab notebooks have mainly been experimental in physics. I'm wondering if anyone ~~has the patience to read this~~ has a lab notebook method that they're willing to share. I know there's not just one way to do things so please share yours if you can that way we can all pick and assimilate the parts of others that we like."

Now that the wedding is drawing closer, I've had a few bits of nasty come my way, so why not share them? Nothing shockingly twatty, but I'll keep you not-bad people updated. :)

**Blurb 1:**

In April, I dyed the tips of my hair blue on a dare. (One of my friends has blue hair, and she said I could pull it off.) It was one of the cheaper brands from Sally's...the kind that washes out in a couple of weeks. I posted a picture on Facebook and my dad IMs me, frantically asking if the dye is permanent.

I tell him it's not, and asks why he was so concerned. He says, ""Mullet says you can't be in her special day if your hair is an unnatural color. She wants to leave a good impression on our family."" (Too late.) 

I could have done my hair in an updo and no one would have any idea. Still...I should have kept it blue.

**Blurb 2, in which I discover she's a racist (of course):**

When I got the formal invitation in the mail, I told the unlucky couple that I was planning to bring one of my friends (a penpal I had recently met in person) who has always wanted to visit that part of the country. (They got an internship and had to bail. Yay and boo at the same time...) 

Dad &amp; M misunderstood me and assumed I was talking about a different internet friend who's from a bi-racial family. My dad asked me, ""So, M wants to know if you're bringing one of those colored girls home? I don't care, but Mullet's family might."" 

(WHO THE F STILL USES THE WORD ""COLORED"" IN A FAR NORTHERN STATE? UGH.)

**Blurb 3, a question:**

My usual couch at the House of Pooh will be occupied by my future stepbrother's baby mama, so I was told I'd have to pay for a hotel room for the weekend. I can afford it, since I'll be staying with the K family for the month of June &amp; not paying rent between apartments. I tell myself to look at it as a comedy vacation.

Once my dad reserves the room for me, Mullet posts a Facebook status, saying how awesome it is that she has possibly found a free venue for her wedding shower/bachelorette party. (MY ROOM.)

...Would I be a shit person if I tell the front desk attendant that she's not allowed in to visit me? I don't want her meth-ed out bridesmaids getting wasted anywhere near my stuff. I can't really pay for wedding gifts, so I feel like I owe her and my dad. But I probably don't.

I know that the Internship period is supposed to be the best part of being an Accountant because of the hourly pay and the easier work, but I keep hearing that interns will be given the same type of work as First year Associates. If that's the case, wouldn't the work be pretty challenging? I'm just not really sure what type of work to expect (I will be in Tax).

26foez,5,2014-05-25,"I want to start losing again, but this time my situation is totally different so I could use some tips on how to make it a success!",[deleted],loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/26foez/i_want_to_start_losing_again_but_this_time_my/,"Dear loseit members!

Last year I lost 30 lbs in summer and autumn (165 lbs to 135, 5'6"" tall). I was able to do this because I went abroad for an internship and was living all alone and food was expensive over there. I counted calories and picked up running too and did the C25K running programme, which I finally finished in October I think. 

For who is interested in the progress I made back then: [Progress pic](http://i.imgur.com/Zt871ce.jpg). First picture is beginning of June, second picture is halfway September. 

Anyway. After I came back I continued running for quite a while and was still paying attention to what I ate. However, a lot of things have changed since then; I graduated from university and this year I started as a PhD candidate. I live together with my boyfriend again now and we moved to another place. The weight loss actually stopped in December, because we were visiting a lot of family which made it hard to count calories and go running. 

Now my weight has remained very constant over the months so at least I am happy about that, but I have the feeling that I am not finished yet. Especially around the stomach area I feel like I could still lose a lot of weight, and I would still be nowhere near comfortable wearing a bikini. On the other hand, I feel that I really lack muscle mass; Other people of a similar weight/height seem to look much slimmer and I can only imagine that it has to be a muscle difference. My younger sisters' BMI's are really near the lower border of healthy but they do not look like it, so I think this is caused by a skewed fat/muscle proportion (although I have no further references than them because the rest of my family are all overweight). I don't know if there is anything I can do about that or whether whatever I do I will always look fat. 

Therefore I am doubting what the best strategies are to improve my figure; I might be able to lose more weight by restricting calories again but I wonder whether it will make me look any better. Probably I could benefit more from exercise? But what type of exercise will help most? Due to doing a PhD I am really, really busy and am even working many weekends at the moment. Many times I come home I really don't feel like doing anything. My experiments involve several hours of walking outside every day but I don't think it matters much. I kind of quit running several months ago; lately I've tried it a couple of times and it sucked, not only because my condition got worse but mostly because I couldn't motivate myself that this was a GOOD way to spend time, I was mostly thinking ""I am wasting my time with this, I have to do (insert list of work and household tasks)"". I think that perhaps lifting would be more helpful than running, but I think it will take me even more time (running is only 30/40 minutes total) and I don't enjoy it at all. 

Foodwise, my situation doesn't really help that much. Fieldwork makes me hungry and I work in two large departments meaning that there is birthday cake about twice a week on average and that excludes the times someone brings treats for whatever party reason. At home, I already eat quite healthy. My boyfriend automatically splits our dinner in half though, giving us each the same portion sizes, and doesn't like it when I explain that I don't need the same amount of food as he eats. He also buys snacks often, but he is much better at controlling urges than me and can eat more over all. But I think he is the least of my concerns, he has been very supportive last time and if I tell him I am serious at losing again he will help me. 

So, my question to you is how I would be able to successfully do this this summer! How to I change my mindset of finding any type of exercise a waste of my time? What are the best ways to focus more on physique than on actual loss in numbers? I also don't really know what to make my goal, earlier it was simple; lose X lbs of weight but now that I lost it I am still not satisfied and I wonder whether setting another 'lose X lbs of weight' loss will help me. I sometimes look at my body in the mirror and think it is hopeless. 

Thank you for reading and I hope you can give me some motivation to make this a success!

I hope to take a grad-level CS class next semester on scientific computing (it includes molecular dynamics; my primary research interest).
Also not interested in MS in CS; even Google, Amazon, etc. don't appeal to me as much as modeling rxns for pharma companies or something.

The situation; I'm late to research:

- ~1 year of computational research (ChemE advisor). My first paper (probably not 1st author) will probably NOT be accepted by when I apply.
- Interdisciplinary computational research internship this summer at a federally funded R&amp;D center. No clue if it'll be publishable work.
- GRE: First practice tests showing around V: ~160 / Q: 165+. I have about two months to perfect this.
- GPA: 3.5x right now
- Web-startup, hackathon/code contest wins - who cares? See below

I'd like to believe my work in code could somewhat offset a ""lower"" GPA (BUT HEY, everyone's busy!). The difference is that I spent more time on that, while others (wisely?) spent their time on coursework and pure ChemE research. In the lab and stuff. A little regret here.

ChemE programs certainly won't care about my CS work! I'm wondering if the newer computational engineering programs WILL, though. These have been starting up in the past decade for engineering with a computing spin, and I love the idea.

- For instance: Stanford ICME (with chemE research) vs ChemE 
- For instance: MIT CSE (with a chemE option) vs ChemE

(Not that I expect to get into the above, but you get the idea now)

And would chemE letters of rec would be less meaningful for  computational engineering department apps? Though at both research sites, I do computational work... What if I have a chemE prof as my 3rd? Would a CS prof be better for computational engineering?

-also does anyone know any programs that really excel in chemE simulations? Perhaps outside the famous top10 range? :)"
26g1g4,0,2014-05-25,"Scored 590 on SAT math, but received As on Calc I &amp; II (COLLEGE). Can I become an Actuary?",[deleted],actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/26g1g4/scored_590_on_sat_math_but_received_as_on_calc_i/,"Hello,

Here's the thing that is bothering me:

I read somewhere that the average SAT score of someone who is taking the actuarial exam is 800. While that is obviously not necessarily true, it seems that people tend to say only people with really high SAT math scores are truly qualified to become actuaries or attempt to take that path.

But here's the thing: I don't really believe that (and correct me if I'm wrong), please read the following:

I am currently a Math major at a university who is in the top 40 in the nation according to the U.S. News College Rankings (Don't want to say which one it is)

I finished 4 semesters and I have a 3.93 cumulative GPA and I am a math major (I LOVE math and I am very passionate about it)

I received an A on both Calc I and II (student averages are around 70 in my school)
Here are my scores on the exams:
Calc 1: Exam 1: 100. Exam 2: 91. Final: 92.
Calc 2: Exam 1: 98. Exam 2: 96. Final: 96

I finished my second out of 5 years (You can think of me as an upcoming sophomore in the actuarial science path, even though I will be a junior overall.)

Managed to get an actuarial internship in P&amp;C which I will be starting in about a week (even though I have not taken any exams yet, still have to take Calc III and probability theory to take  exam P)

My roommate who is also a close friend of mine got 700 on his SAT math (with no studying) and yet struggled in calc I and II and only got C's on both. He needed my help many times.

I am a very hard worker and very diligent. Also I am very passionate about education in general especially anything math related (math, statistics, economics).
Also I am minoring in Statistics and Economics.

Does my 590 on the math SAT say bad things about my capabilities? Am I considered not ""smart enough"" to become an actuary even though I work really hard? 

I honestly consider myself good at math. Calc I and II were really fun and I did not struggle much to understand them and be able to master the topics.
So my big question is (and THANK YOU so much for reading this far, I really appreciate it):

Are SAT math scores an accurate indicator of your mathematical capabilities, even though I strongly believe I do better in math classes than a lot of students who scored way higher than me on the SAT math.

I do not know if I just became good at math out of nowhere due to a lot of studying and practicing (also, I always liked math but MUCH MUCH more once I started taking college math classes)

Thank you for your time! Any input would be greatly appreciated!

P.S.
If I made it sound like I am doubtful of my intelligence; that is not true. I believe I am a smart student, not just a hard working one. But I do not want to deceive myself. How smart do I have to be to become an actuary? Are average or slightly above average intelligence and A LOT of diligence good enough qualities to go on the actuarial path?"
26g3xv,11,2014-05-25,Advice for student entering college for CS?,maxucho,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/26g3xv/advice_for_student_entering_college_for_cs/,"Hi all,

I'm a student about to enter college this fall, intending to study Computer Science and I was wondering what advice you might have for how I could best position myself during my first semester to be competitive for some kind of software development internship during the summer after my freshman year?

I know it might be a bit early to start thinking about next summer, but from my research it seems programming internships are competitive to begin with, and of course I will also be at a disadvantage as a freshman applicant competing with upperclassmen with more experience.

For context, the school I'm going to be attending is an Ivy League university with a small but well-respected CS department. I also already have a few years of programming experience under my belt, with a few small side projects online and on GitHub. This summer I also will be interning (unpaid) with a very early stage (read: not yet launched) startup in my area, as a web developer.

With all this in mind, do you have any suggestions for things to do this summer, classes to take this fall, or specific internships to apply for next year (I understand certain companies have internship opportunities specifically for freshman and sophomores)? Any help on this would be greatly appreciated. Thanks."

I may have mentioned in my last post that I landed a job out of my internship! It was an exciting moment that was marred by the situation my brother and his girlfriend had put me through. I dredged on and put a smile on my face. I have been working so hard to create a stable life for my son and I that I can't let anyone get in the way of that. 

I thank everyone for their insights and comments because each and every one of them helped me out. I created a legal contract for my brother to officially sign that included stipulations of his girlfriend not trespassing on the property, sharing chores and etc. And he signed it. 

 I enrolled my son in daycare and he loves it. When I come home from work I am noticing that he's generally much more happy, laughing and smiling. He's always been a happy child but there's something more vibrant about him. 

I am still dealing with my own emotions on the matter. A lot of good is happening for me but it seems that I've snapped into a depressive episode and I'm struggling a little. 

As far as my brother is concerned, ever since I gave him the ultimatum to sign my contract or GTFO, he's been peaches to me. He wished me a Happy Mother's Day, he's been in a very very good mood and very pleasant to me. 

So, once again, thank you /r/Mommit, I needed a supportive group of ladies like yourselves and it's improved my situation 100-fold. I love you ladies :)"

This'll be my first build. I'm starting to plan it out now, but I'll actually be building it in August when my internship is over. I don't have any plans to overclock. I planned to spend about $1000 (flexible) not including monitors/keyboard/mouse. 
A few questions:
*Should I buy thermal paste?
*Do I need the CPU fan? Or will the stock one do?
*I noticed that Newegg's got a promotion going on for $15 off on the case, $20 on the PSU, and $20 each on the monitors that ends tomorrow. Is this something I should jump on today, or can I expect similar prices to pop up over the next 2 1/2 months?
*More generally, is it safe to watch for sales on these parts and pick them up gradually over the summer, or should I be worried about defective parts and expired warranties when I actually build in August?
*My school offers a Windows 8.1 Professional upgrade download for $20. I've seen some guides floating around for a clean install from an upgrade disk for Windows 7 and 8. Will I be able to do something similar?"

Much information!",shibedesign,dogecoin,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/26h2as/a_little_anecdote_about_doge4doge_twitchtipping/,"Hi fellow shibes,

I'm currently making my bachelor of science in engineering and am a long time doge lurker. I love the doge4doge initiative and will offer my services in another post in some time to come. I see a lot of potential for doge4doge. 
I am a design shibe. I could offer services in video editing, audio processing, compositing, 3d design, a little bit of coding (but only a little bit, like I said I'm fresh out of school and programming wasn't one of my strongest suits)
I've seen a few posts recently from +\u\ShibeShen regarding his doge-shop which sells exclusive doge merchandise for doge and I think the idea is great. Other design shibes like me could work on t-shirt designs and distribute them through the site. There could be limited edition shirts in which would give people incentive to spend their doge on shirts like we saw with the nascar shirts. Maybe there could be a weekly limited shirt which will only be available during this week (or month) and is designed by a fellow shibe and voted in by the community. These Shirts could be a little more expensive than the rest on the site but the designer could be paid a little bit of doge, and another bit could go to a charity after +\u\ShibeShen substracted his expenses. This could become a huge thing if we could rally enough talented design shibes behind it and the support of the community.
If you have some time and live in Europe plz have a look at his post and give him some feedback:

http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/26eduj/doge4business/

I am also extremely excited about dogetipbot twitch integration. If we can make doge the dominant gaming cryptocurrency that would be a huuuuuuge deal! Gamers are easy to adopt new technologies and if we get big name streamers like maybe Kripparrian to accept dogecoin (all it would take for him to accept is for someone to sell orange juice for dogecoin in Canada or deliver there, plz make this happen reddit!) 
we would have an enormous amount of new shibes interested in doge and maybe investing a few bucks each month to support their favorite steamer or buy a few things like doge merchandise or steam keys which are sold plenty on dogemarket.


But for now enough on that. Just a little more till the giveaway, I promise ;)

but before that a little backstory:

I recently wrote my thesis about indie game publishing and stumbled about the dota workshop publishing feature, which allows you to design and publish items for games like dota (to be honest I never played a lot of dota, I know of it and know it's popular, but I never got into it). During my internship I had some downtime and thought to myself I could try to design an item. I had some 3d design experience during my bachelor and so I gave it a shot.
This is the result:

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=263172037

If you play dota and like the item I'd appreciate a rate up ;) 

to the giveaway part:

Like I said my dota knowledge isn't immense so I thought I'd ask the doge community for some feedback. Put some feedback here on reddit regarding the item or dota, which character do you play and why, if you bought items through the valve workshop, why you bought the item or which character you'd like to see items designed for. Plz include ""dota 2"" in your post so I can maybe have tipbot tip every comment with the word in it? If so I'd appreciate some instructions or a link. When I have some spare time I'll go through all the posts and will tip special contributions again if I have enough doge. If you don't play dota write that and you will be tipped too ;) and if you voted for my item plz don't tell me so I can tip you without buying votes! much thx!!!

plz give me some time with the tipping of the feedback because I first have to authenticate this account and transfer the doge but all posts containing the word dota will be tipped, maybe I'll also use the new make it rain bot if I figure out how it works, although I haven't got a huge amount of doge at my dispose.

thx dogecommunity &amp; I love you!

26hbui,7,2014-05-25,Haven't done drugs in 35 days but am having a very hard time not using again,throwaway9883483,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/26hbui/havent_done_drugs_in_35_days_but_am_having_a_very/,"For starters, I'll give you some background. I'm a 20 year-old female who is addicted to benzodiazepines, specifically Klonopin (but also have used Xanax and Ativan). I have really severe depression, anxiety, and OCD. I quit taking drugs in late April cold turkey when I was taking about 10-15 mg of Kpin a day (I should've tapered, I know). I had really bad withdrawal that landed me in a mental hospital because the anxiety was so bad. I've been in a psych ward once before for something similar. I take Zoloft for depression/anxiety and Ambien to sleep.

 This past year has been the worst of my life. 1 year ago, I was a sophomore at a very good university with a really prestigious government internship in the field I would like to work in when I graduate. After going to the hospital 2 times and developing this addiction, my GPA, which used to be really good, fell, I lost my internship, many of my friends, and am now stuck at home for the summer. I was feeling okay at school, but now that I'm home I'm a mess.
I still have a lot of Klonopin left and want to take some so badly. I should have gotten rid of it, but I guess it was a way to subconsciously hold onto my addiction longer and have a safety net.
What do I do? I've tried so many different medications and Zoloft has worked best, but I cannot seem to shake this. I've done therapy (still do), never forget my meds, and try really hard. Sometimes the anxiety or depression is so bad I feel like I'm going to internally explode, jump out of my skin, something. I almost physically cannot bear this."
26hdug,3,2014-05-25,"I [22/F] absolutely hate my in-laws, and I'm afraid that it will hurt my marriage",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/26hdug/i_22f_absolutely_hate_my_inlaws_and_im_afraid/,"This will be long, and I apologize in advance for that. I just don't know who to talk to and need to get this off my chest.

I [22/F] recently got married to my husband [22/M]. We dated all through college, for four years prior to getting married. I have an incredibly strained relationship with his family, however, and I have come to strongly resent them and any involvement that they have in our lives. I don't want to force my husband to choose between me and his family, and don't want to stick him in the middle of an unfair tug-of-war between allegiances. I am afraid that my growing inability to get over or hide my feelings will do just that, though, and may jeopardize our marriage. 

The problem started almost immediately after we became engaged (they were very friendly and welcoming while we were dating). They started trying to control aspects of our life together that weren't any of their business; aspects such as trying to plan the wedding out from under us, asking invasive questions about our sex life and trying to ""slut shame"" me after we refused to talk about our intimate details with them. They also randomly starting fights with both my then-fiance and myself over seemingly inconsequential ""slights"", such as my use of the phrase, ""If it helps your feelings,"" in conversation. They went so far as to call us ""immoral adulterers"" at Christmas, then demanded that we not invite the extended family and family friends from my husband's side because they were too ashamed to be associated with us. 

The problems escalated throughout our year and a half long engagement, culminating in them starting a rather large fight with me a month before the wedding (it was over a small, trivial detail related to the honeymoon) that resulted in them threatening not to come to the wedding at all. My husband made peace with them, but they never attempted to contact or speak to me again. Then at the wedding, they said nasty things about me within earshot so as to ensure that I heard it. They acted blatantly angry throughout the ceremony, to the point where my wedding party was too uncomfortable to look out into the crowd due to the ""evil stares"" that the father was giving everyone.  They spent the whole day complaining about having to be there, and deeply hurt my husband's feelings on what should have been a happy day for him. They also made a point of refusing to speak to me throughout the day, just to drive home the fact that they do not approve of me.

I understand where the disapproval stems from, but I can't apologize for it. At Christmas of this past year, I went on his family's annual trip rather than going home to see my own family in an attempt to start bridging the gap between the two separate families. This was incredibly difficult for me to do, because my grandmother (whom I am especially close to) has a terminal illness and is declining in health; it may have been her last Christmas alive, but only time will tell on that front. 

They spent the entire trip making passive-aggressive statements towards my then-fiance and myself, before finally laying all of the cards on the table and staging a full-family attack on my husband; he hurt his leg and needed to return to the condo, and they took the opportunity when he couldn't easily get away to quite literally get in his face and yell at, insult, and thoroughly demean him. They told him that he wasn't a good enough son, attacked his religious expression (or lack thereof) and made incredibly crude, inappropriate, and judgmental conjectures on our sexual relationship. I have never seen family behave so cruelly to one another. My raw feelings at being away form my own family and my outrage at seeing anyone treat my husband that way lead to me defending him. I was respectful (somehow) and held my feelings back on the matter, but that didn't help at all. The family then turned their full rage on me, telling me that I wasn't family and had no business interjecting, before slut-shaming me for whatever they imagined to be going on in my bedroom. This went on for two days. 

The day before we finally had enough and decided to leave, they changed tactics; the mom pulled me away from the group to ""have a talk"" with me. She tried to manipulate me into feeling sorry for her, to get me on her side in controlling my husband. Meanwhile, the father, brother, and sister-in-law took another opportunity to attack him while I was away and couldn't support him. My husband got so upset that he stormed out and nobody could find him. When I tried to go after him, they physically restrained me long enough for the brother to leave to go after him so that I couldn't get to him first. 

I have my degree in psychology; my internship experience is in child and family therapy, so I took the alone time with his parents as an opportunity to try to help mediate the fight, get to the bottom of it, and try to soothe their doubts about our relationship. For the time, it worked. However, it only took them a day or two to decide that I had ""manipulated"" them, which sent them into an even blinder rage than before. Things progressively got worse for the four months between then and the wedding, as mentioned above. The father took to blatantly starting fights with me to get under my husband's skin.

According to my husband and his childhood friends that I have met, his parents are just ""like this.""  Saying horrible things about family members, being manipulative, and having seemingly emotionally-unstable screamfests are just par for the course with them, and I should just get used to it since I married the family. I witnessed first-hand that his parents treated his older brother's wife the exact same way leading up to her marriage, so it is partially my fault that I didn't brace myself for the storm that I should have seen coming. However, I don't think that I can just accept it or get used to it. They are adults and have no right to treat others this way; it's childish and frightening. However, no matter how I approach it with my husband or how upset it makes me, he will not sever ties with his family and I do not want to force him to do it.

It's reached a point, though, where the mention of his parents immediately makes me angry. I put of writing my thank-you cards after the wedding for three days because each time I started to write the card to them, I got uncontrollably angry and unfairly lashed out at my husband. I can't sleep for three to four days at a time and have panic attacks any time that I know we will have to see or interact with them. I've fantasized about them dying in a freak accident so that I won't have to spend my life dealing with them. I can't hide or control my feelings anymore, and I know that it's only a matter of time before it really starts to take a toll on my marriage. 

My husband and I are otherwise incredibly happy and very much in love; I'm just not sure how long we can be in this position, because I know how unfair it is for both of us. I've tried to talk to my husband, but he just gets mad at me and treats me like I'm at fault for thinking too much about the familial problems. I've tried talking this out with my mom, who tells me to just deal with it because they're his family. I've tried talking to friends, but they are too selfish to spend longer than 5 minutes talking about anyone but themselves. I desperately need advice on how to handle this situation, before I snap and say or do something that I shouldn't. 

tl;dr- I think that my in-laws are truly bad people, and I no longer know how to contain my hatred for them for my husband's benefit after a number of horrible encounters with them, including their behavior at my wedding. "

Also, sorry if this is not the correct place to post this. But since you guys have had personal experience with the whole Jehovah’s Witness thing, I bet you of all people can help me try to understand what is up with my former classmate. Get ready, because this is a long one. But for you impatient bastards, there is a TL;DR at the end.

I started my PhD about two years ago. I don’t like to brag or anything (who am I kidding, of course I do), but my school is very, very well respected in our field, which would fall under the STEM category. So the students I see on a day-to-day basis are pretty damn sharp. Sometime last year, I met this one girl, a PhD student who started the same time I did. Man, I’m telling you, she was way out of my league and I am no slacker. I was looking at her résumé and my jaw was on the floor. She had achieved so much in her life. Internships, extracurricular activities, scholarships, and awards left and right. And to top it all off, she was funded by one of the most prestigious fellowships that a STEM grad student could ever ask for. So yeah, she was kind of a big deal.

Despite all that, I never felt intimidated by her because she was also one of the sweetest people I have ever met. She was very kind, polite, chatty, smiley, and above all, humble about her accomplishments. So getting to the point here, she mentioned that was a devout JW. I knew pretty much nothing about them (beyond the whole door-to-door quirk) and I didn’t really care all that much to learn. I figured, hey, if that’s what motivates her to be the awesome person that she is, then who am I to get in the way?

I honestly thought that if she kept going along the path that she was already on, she could end up becoming a world leader in our field. But then about a month ago, she announced that she would be leaving grad school after her MS because she found a job. It was more of an industry job than a research job. And from the way it sounded, I felt that it wasn't challenging enough for her. Still, it was directly in our field, which is a tough one to find employment in, and it paid well so I was happy for her. 

But I started to get curious. Why was she even looking for a job in the first place when she was on a fellowship for a PhD? She seemed to enjoy her work and it wasn’t like she was facing financial problems or anything. So I asked. She told me that her research was too time-consuming and that she wanted to spend more time with her congregation. I found that to be a rather silly reason. Yeah, I know from personal experience that we grad students work long and odd hours. But for the most part, our advisors are cool with what times we work as long as we make sufficient progress overall. She definitely could have fit her religious obligations into her schedule if she really wanted to (at least that’s what I thought at the time). I wondered, what the hell could possibly be so damn appealing about this religion that you’d be willing to walk away from such a golden educational opportunity? So then I started to do a little research about JWs...

Holy. Fucking. Shit.

I thought Mormons were kind of weird, but at least they allow their followers to have a little bit of leeway. JWs on the other hand seem to have every single aspect of their lives controlled by their congregations. I don’t need to go through that whole list of things that they’re not allowed to do. You guys know that all too well. But if they decide to bend the rules even just a little bit, then they risk becoming complete outcasts. Families have been ripped apart over this. To me, there is nothing to like about this religion. Whatever good there is can easily be found in other religions. Going back to my classmate, I am now completely bewildered by her existence and I am trying to rationalize it. Here are a few questions that I have for you.

---

How do JWs feel about STEM education? If they are against it, I’d be surprised that she got into STEM in the first place.

How do JWs feel about women empowerment? Again, if they discourage it, I’d be surprised that she had high career ambitions to begin with. Also, for what it’s worth, she is super fit. I can’t imagine someone like her ever participating in a religion that forces women to be weak.

How do JWs feel about traveling and seeing the world? This girl loves going on adventures in different countries and meeting different kinds of people. If she was forced to stop, she would be devastated.

How strict are JWs about no blood transfusions? Her major in undergrad was medicine related. What kind of self-respecting student of medicine would ever frown upon a blood transfusion?

How common is the practice of disfellowshipping and how severe are the consequences really? From what I read in this subreddit, it sounds absolutely awful. But again, this girl was such a sweet person. I just cannot imagine her ever treating anyone so cruelly even at the risk of having the same thing happen to her. It’s just not in her nature.

And finally, do you think there is a chance that her congregation may have pressured her into leaving school against her will? That is a huge conclusion to jump to and I’m a bit hesitant to do so. But if that is the case, then the only thing I have to say to that is, what a colossal waste of what could have been.

So yeah, that’s pretty much it. Obviously you don’t know her personally so you can only make guesses based on your own experiences. I can try to answer some questions you may have, but I’m sure you’ll understand that I won’t say anything that could possibly be used to identify her. But please, help me try to figure out how a person so seemingly full of contradictions could exist. Thank you.

---

**TL;DR:** Overachieving classmate happens to be a JW. She leaves school before realizing her true potential to spend more time with her congregation. I learned more about JWs and I am now confused as to how she could be one. I have some questions that I would like to talk about to try and make sense of this."

Right now I'm currently in Gilbert, AZ and thinking about moving to Kirkland.

To give you a background I have two years experience in IT with an associates in It (Linux professional cert) and an A+ cert. My Dad wants me to take as much classes as possible so I'm looking for part time work (20-30 hours a week).

I'm just curious before hand if there is any such part time work in that field such as an internship or a regular job that pays decent. Also any tips you guys can provide to me? I've visited WA before a couple of times but didn't stay for longer than a week each time. I am quite nervous about this big change in my life."
26hqvn,2,2014-05-25,My life's at a stalemate.,IAmNotMrRager,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/26hqvn/my_lifes_at_a_stalemate/,"Summer's starting and I have no Idea what I want to do with my life. It's not like it matters. My family is probably gonna move in like a year and then I have to start everything all over again. 

My parents basically forbid me to apply to anywhere but a nearby Community College, That I had no intentions of going to. I wanted to go to film school or something like that I don't know. I wanted to study something that I was interested but I couldn't. My guidance counselor was dim witt and didn't do anything for me. the cost of applying to other schools was too high and I had no disposable income and my parents wouldn't even pay for me to apply to see if I would get in so I stopped caring about school and my senior year of high school my grades dipped but I didn't give a fuck. 

My mom got diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer during the beginning of my senior year so I had to do my duty as a son to stay with them. It sucks when you know you have no control and you see other people getting into their choice schools because they worked hard and their parents supported them meanwhile my parents want to do whats best for ""The family."" I just felt really shitty because whenever people asked me what school was I going to they would just give a ""oh, okay."" and I fucking hated trying to explain to them why I had to and I just gave up at some point, cause fuck whatever they think. 

Anyways so I start the new college semester and its fine. it's a shitty school. I work in a gas station so my life's divided between work and school like normal. My best friends on probation but we still drink once a month because life is shit and booze makes you feel good. I met my old theatre teacher and asked if she needed an intern at some point for one her shows. 

I like directing. that shit's dope. I like interacting with the actors and the set and all that good stuff. It makes me feel in control because I have no other control in real life. My whole life has been dictated to me by my parents and I can't take control of it. I can't just get away from my parents. I have nobody. we moved to the US like 5 years ago when I was 14 and all my friends and family are 300000000000000000000 miles away. Taking control of something as small as the way an actor saying something makes me feel good. Makes me feel like I'm actually good at something.

Oh yeah, I don't have any skills. I don't have good grades, I'm not musically talented, or a born artist even though I try sometimes and have bursts of shitty artistic expressions here and there. They are bad but fuck you, I made them. I liked doing theatre, working with cameras and stuff during high school but I'm at a place in New England where nothing happens. I try to go out of my way to find out if I can't find something cool I can take part of. A production, or like, I don't know anything. But I can't fucking find anything. 

So I started going to shows because I was working and I had money so fuck it concerts and shows it is, I went to 5 concerts in 3-4 months and a Broadway production in New York City (Waiting for Godot, Starring Patrick Stewart and Ian Mckellen.) I couldn't afford legit tickets so we went to the previews. That was awesome. Those nights were like bursts of happiness in my vast plain spectrum of life. Shit was cool.

I withdrew the first semester of Community College because I stopped going to class. I hated it. I wasn't motivated. It was stupid. I wasted like 5000 dollars I have to pay back but fuck it who cares, I wasn't happy. The only thing that keeps me going on is the thought of interning for my theatre teacher. its like the only thing I think about day and night. 

finally the day comes. I start interning for my teacher. the productions great, I love the people I work with. during the production I sign up for second semester of college. I start going to school again and this time I stick it out. I get a bit lucky and get decent classes. I still don't do any homework for math and thats a problem. but I do okay in other classes. I miss 3 consecutive days of classes because I had a moment of weakness but listening to Joe Rogan and Aubrey Marcus talk about being strong and sticking it out so I apply that to school. I still can't focus.

I see my doctor and tell her I can't focus. I can't sit down and read. I have trouble relaxing and I'm always freaking nervous. I get nothing done. She says it might be ADD. I have no clue.  I missed my follow up appointment. Haven't done anything about it since.

The production ends. The show was great. I'm gonna miss these guys. I date one of the actresses from the show after it ends. I get to involved with her. The most emotional month of my life. Stupid things are said and done. Emotional teenage drama. nothing new.

My dad leaves. for buisness. He is never around when I need him. He only wants to provide for the family.

During all this I foster homeless animals. give them a home. why should they suffer from being stranded in life. at least they should belong somewhere. However temporary. I like working with animals too. I feel comfortable working with them.

Right now at this moment, I haven't signed up for next semester classes. I don't know if I should. all I wanna do is do a theatre production, or something like that. I wanna go around and have fun during the summer. go to more concerts. take some classes. meet some new people. There is nothing around here tho. nothing. I looked up. if there is something its expensive. too expensive for me. I wanted to take dance classes but a decent one costs 200 dollars for two weeks. I don't make that much money. I hate where I'm living. I wanna get away, but my parents think if I drive far I will get in an accident and die. I have ambitions but I feel ever so restricted. I have 5 people I hang out with from time to time and thats it. I don't do much but I want to do so many things, but I can't.

My life's at a stalemate, and I hate it.
I feel defeated at life."
26htxs,1,2014-05-25,How long should I wait to email regarding a follow-up?,mllax,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/26htxs/how_long_should_i_wait_to_email_regarding_a/,"So last week I posted this: http://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/25ztb9/not_sure_what_to_make_of_this_interview/

recapping the most important bits: 

1) No HR department, just one lady transitioning from broker to HR.

2) Everyone thought my interview went well based on the info I provided

3) Was told I would get a follow-up regarding second round interview by the end of this (last) week.

4) Only one intern with interviews the entire (last) week.

My problem is that from the description of the internship, they expect someone to start June 1st (recruiter might've said something about this being the estimated, but most likely been talking about flexibility of schedule), and again, there's second round interviews. This makes me assume that I'm not being considered anymore, but the curiosity and wait, since it's already the end of the week, is killing me. 

And so, should I wait until Tuesday for an answer, or is it acceptable if I wrote to them now or tomorrow? Also, based on the long wait, anyone want to give a shot at my chance of a second round interview?"
26hvra,15,2014-05-26,I guess I've been in denial for three years. Hi.,magical_realist,infertility,https://www.reddit.com/r/infertility/comments/26hvra/i_guess_ive_been_in_denial_for_three_years_hi/,"Hi r/infertility. I've been lurking here for a few months and figured I should do an intro. I've been with my manfriend for almost 11 years. He's turning 34 this year, I'm turning 31.

The next part is going to be super TLDR so feel free to skip to the last paragraph.

We've been trying for about three years according to our RE, and about two years in my opinion. The first year we were ""not trying not preventing,"" which my RE flatly told us is not a thing, but I don't think she fully grasped how infrequently we were having sex that year (I was doing a full university course load and part time job, manfriend was working 50+ hours per week, so we weren't meeting up much and when we did see each other we were exhausted.)

Six months after we started really actually trying, it worked... sort of. It took me a long time to fully untangle the timeline, but eventually I worked out that this is what happened: that cycle (Nov 2012) we had sex two times, day 18 and day 20. So conception occurred no earlier than day 18 and potentially as late as say, day 24. I didn't know it at the time, because I got my period on time at day 30. It was a seemingly normal period. I started getting pregnancy symptoms during the next ""cycle"" and took a test on Dec 21. Not only was it positive, it was REALLY positive - a dark line that appeared right away. I did one of those Clearblue digitals and it said ""pregnant 3+ weeks."" Hmm. That was weird, because I wasn't even at my missed period yet. We had had sex on day 8 so I thought maybe I conceived then. Everything seemed normal, except I had never been pregnant before so I really didn't know what normal was. I had some painful cramping, but I read that can happen in early pregnancy from ligaments stretching or whatever and there was no spotting, so I chalked it up to that.

I knew I was pregnant for 20 days, from Dec 21 to Jan 10, and I know it's terribly cliche but that was truly one of the happiest times of my life. Any time I felt sad or stressed I would just think ""I'm going to be someone's mom"" and I would instantly feel better. My SO was so happy too, he couldn't wait to be a daddy. Jan 9, I had some spotting. I hadn't had any cramps in several weeks. I was referred for an ultrasound the next day, where they told me they thought I had a tubal pregnancy and I needed to go to the hospital immediately, at which point I lost it and just started bawling. Manfriend left work to pick me up and take me to the emergency room. We spent nine hours there, all of which I was compelled to spend lying on a gurney with no underwear on bleeding all over while random doctors popped in (including a Doogie Howser-esque intern and an older doctor who came in, said not a single work to me, shoved his fingers into my vagina, complained to the nurse that he couldn't feel my cervix and left). The gyno gave me the option of surgery or methotrexate and I took the methotrexate. They also insisted on sending in a grief counsellor to talk to us... she was like ""it doesn't matter if it's just six weeks, that's the same as losing a baby at nine months."" Um, no. That's not the same.

Afterwards, I was worried but people kept saying all that encouraging stuff about how I'd be pregnant again in no time and blah blah blah, and I basically chose to believe it. Cue cycle after cycle of disappointment. I finally got my doctor to put in a referral for the fertility clinic and we had our first appointment at the end of January. When the RE walked in, the first thing she said was ""Three years. That's a LONG TIME to be trying."" (Emphasis hers). I was actually taken aback. I can still hear in my head exactly how she said the words LONG TIME. I think that's when the bubble burst for me. Up until then, I assumed I would eventually get pregnant. For the last few months, I've been coping with the realization that it might never happen. Never. NEVER. I've been working on getting through the battery of diagnostic tests that were assigned - had an HSG a month ago  and both tubes are clear. We'll be done all tests by the end of this cycle and then hopefully get some sort of plan in place to progress from there.

TLDR: trying for 3 years, one ectopic, don't know what's wrong, basically in denial about the situation until a few months ago, haven't tried any treatments yet but that's coming up next."

I'm having an issue with a former friend of mine who keeps pestering me to spend time with him even though I am completely through with our ""friendship"" and wish to cut off contact.


I met this person 6 years ago in high school (2008). We dated for a couple months during freshman year until he broke up with me. After that, we were very good friends during sophomore year (2009). During junior year, we started being friends with benefits (FWB), which got very messy and ultimately led to us not speaking for awhile (2010). We became friends again during senior year of high school, and became FWB again for a short time during the first fall semester of college (2011). After that, we've been strictly platonic.


He treated me extremely poorly during our relationship and during our FWB phase. It was borderline emotional abuse and manipulation, since he knew that I loved him so much that I would do anything for him, and used that knowledge to take advantage of me. I honestly think he is borderline sociopathic since his complete lack of empathy can be disturbing. He has always had a reputation for treating girls rather poorly, but I was so blinded by affection for him that I only realized how horrible he was until after our last FWB encounter almost 3 years ago.


We have hung out intermittently since high school graduation, usually just getting coffee or lunch. My extreme dislike for him has increased every single time. This person is manipulative, passive aggressive, narcissistic, controlling, and has zero empathy for anyone. For example, he recently yelled at me for declining an offer to go to a concert with him, even though I explained that I was instead choosing to plan a weekend with my father who I see once a year. My former friend knows about the situation with my dad and still chose to make me feel guilty for ""ditching"" him.


My former friend is leaving soon for a summer internship, so he has been especially pressuring me recently to hang out with him before he leaves. He has very few friends and I understand that he might actually want to spend time with me, but the thought of hanging out with him makes me nauseous. He is probably my least favorite person that I know, and I would prefer to never speak to him or see him ever again. 


My question is, how do I avoid seeing this person? I'm using all of the excuses I can, but each time he guilts me and accuses me of lying (which some of the time, I actually am out of desperation). I know he is just trying to manipulate me into seeing him, but it still makes me feel guilty due to the fact that we used to be good friends. I truly dislike this person and I need to figure out a way to not see him while not blatantly admitting that I don't want to see him.

Thanks so much in advance!

I'm heading over to London in a little over a week for a financial internship and have some questions on how to dress while I'm over there. I need to bring business clothes in addition to causal clothes. I'm coming from Arizona, so my wardrobe is probably drastically different that what I need. I posted in /r/london as well, but wanted your points of view on the fashion side. Anyways I am over there from June through August. Any general advice would be great too.

1.  Do I need a rain coat to put over my suits, or is this unnecessary? 

2.  Any advice on a light jacket that can double as casual and business casual?

3. Shoes. Right now I'm bringing 2 dress shoes and a pair of vans. Should I add another casual shoe to my list...I have suede bucks, but I feel like these wouldn't do well in the rain. 

4. Building off the last question, should I invest in a nice pair of boots that I can wear when it rains on and off the job?

5. What is good to wear casual? I'm planning on bringing jeans, chinos, and button up shirts. Do not know if I should bring any tees or polos or if a good variety of button ups would hold up well enough.

6. Is there anything I should buy out there that I cannot get in the States?

Any other advice would be great! I'm really excited for this summer, but I am a bit overwhelmed. Thanks in advance for any help. If any other questions come up, I'll add them."

I've read through resume threads and haven't really found what I'm looking for. Basically, I'm wondering if experience in another field is preventing me from getting interviews for computer science internships. 

A little background - I'm a second year computer science major who switched to a bachelors in CS after finishing an associates in journalism (I didn't find writing challenging enough, now I'm right where I need to be with computer science).

The problem is... I have a ton of internship and management experience with journalism and a resume very sparse with formal CS employment. And I can't get an interview.

I completed two full-time internships with papers as a writer and editor. I also acted as an interim manager for a local paper after their managing editor suffered from a heart attack and died.

I've managed teams of 6-15 people, overseen operations, am competent and literate and can program. I know 4 programming languages, have project experience, have my own blog/website, etc.

Would I be better off taking all of my journalism experience off the resume? My resume is strong and can get me interview is any other field... but I need something related to my field.

I even applied for a technical document specialist where the qualifications were journalism/writing experience and working towards a degree in CS. Couldn't even get an interview there, when I feel like I was cookie-cutter what they were looking for.

Any help would be appreciated!"

Four weeks and a day ago, I quit gaming completely. I'd just finished a 13-week internship in Amsterdam and one thing I really wanted to hold onto after it was done, was my sleep rhythm. Go to bed at 10.30, get up at 7.30, e'rryday.

Late in the evening, on the first sunday after my internship, I was playing Titanfall on my desktop. When I play Titanfall, I'm always saying to myself 'just one more game'. They're just the right (wrong?) length! It's a very satisfying and exciting game, as I'm sure you know. Soon, the clock turned to 10 pm, then 11, then 11.30.

11.30 is by no means an ongodly hour, but seeing as it was outside of my intented rhythm, I was pretty miffed. I'm getting ready for bed and I think to myself 'okay, this isn't cool, but cut yourself some slack, man!' But I didn't wanna cut myself any slack. The moment I'm done with my internship, I'm back to being some gaming cave-dweller with no control whatsoever? Hells no. I wanted to stop, but I couldn't. That's an addiction right there, right? So what if I delete all my games? What if I just *do that?* See how it goes. Maybe just for a week, or until I finish the remainder of this year's schoolwork.

I did it. Deleted everything that night. 60 gigs on my game-drive. It looks pretty neat in explorer. Games (D:) - 0% used. I still have access to my Steam library and the games on my shelf, but I just don't pick them up. That was four weeks ago now. The weird thing is I missed gaming for maybe a week, but I don't now. I'm 25 and I filled up the majority of those years with gaming. Now I'm off it and I don't give a shit anymore. It's utterly weird, but I guess I just realized it's not how I want to spend my time anymore. I reinstalled a game here and there and gave it a whirl. I played short bouts of Dishonored and Risk of Rain. The experiences were 'meh'. Not like previous times I played them. Too much effort for too little satisfaction.

Via family sharing, I have Dark Souls 2 installed. My best friend plays it. We both played DS1. He'd like me to get it. We played some while he was over at my place and while I definitely had a good time, I still don't want to buy it. I can just *see* myself losing track of time, losing myself in this game and coming out the other side not satisfied *enough*.

It's bittersweet, you know? On the one hand, I'm very glad to be free from this magnetic force. On the other hand, I spent so many thousands of hours gaming. Thousands! Maybe tenthousands! I could have lived so many beautiful moments in those hours, but I filled them with a frenzy of button-pressing and mouse-clicking and I hardly even remember the details of it all.

Not that I'm some mega-productive superhuman now, but life is definitely better. I'm pretty proud of myself. I think this means I'll sell my desktop now.

I just thought I'd share this. Thanks for reading. I hope you find this a good contribution to the subreddit. To anyone struggling with gaming addiction: stay strong. This squeaky clean feeling is nice. :)

**tl;dr: quit gaming on a whim 4 weeks ago, don't miss it at all. Happy I learned the true value of gaming (for me), but sad about all the hours that could have been better spent.**"

I've no preference over any specific technology so I guess I should go where the money is. During my internship I've been playing with frontend/webdev stuff (PHP, AngularJS, ...), but it seems to me that relative to the Java's and .NET's of the backend/enterprise stuff the pay really is worse. This appears to be mainly because webdev shops tend to be a lot smaller and relatively easy to get into. 

So I guess my question is this: what is currently the best bet to follow as a career in terms of income and stability ? Where should I really specialize ?"

I could see that my mother was overwhelmed taking care of her, so I decided to go to a local university and live at home to help take care of her.

There have been ups and downs over the years, but the bottom line is my mother relies on me too much. She leaves the house for 6+ hours a day and I'm stuck at home taking care of my aunt. She refuses to hire someone to watch her even though Medicare would probably cover it. When I explain my frustration to her, she says that she needs to get out of the house and that I can go out whenever I want to. But whenever I go out, after about 1 hour, she seems a barrage of text messages asking when I'll be home.

I have spent my entire college career stuck at home in my bedroom. I have developed pretty bad social anxiety because I've been out of touch with the world so long. I don't know how I will find a job with no internships, jobs or relationships with professors.

I no longer have any sympathy for my mother because she doesn't do anything to help anyone but herself and refuses to hire anyone to help. I wanted to go on a short 4 day vacation this summer, but my mother freaked out and said I couldn't go alone. I'm 22. 

I want to see a therapist but I don't have health insurance and I only have $1000. Most low-cost therapists in my area want $75+ a session. I've been to my college counseling center, but they only offer 3 free sessions (and they weren't helpful).

Even if I graduate college in the spring, it will still take me several months to find a job and save up enough to move out. I can't take another year of this. I don't see any way out of this.

I am just so, so sad. I have no fight left in me and no desire to live. I know that things will get better in the long run, but I am struggling so much right now. I don't have my own identity anymore. I don't have the energy to say ""fuck you"" and go on vacation and do whatever I want. It's so hard to wake up every day. This house is literally a prison."

However, as I mentioned in my title, I've been reading a lot of horror stories about shipping times on Lenovo customs being very drawn out (I can deal with it if I get the laptop before mid-August for the new semester) as well as unacceptable quality differences between LG (shite) and AUO (pretty good) screens being put into assembled units -- uncharitably referred to as the screen lottery because there's no way to control which you get and fighting support to get the AUO is a PITA (I'm not up for replacing the screen myself)

The rMBP 13"" line looks good as well (UNIX environment and I can use my company's AppleTVs for demos, yes please!), but I have a hard time stomaching:

* The price. With a student discount, the midline 13"" model comes in at $1400 before tax (plus a little to pick up mDP adapters for VGA/HDMI, plus a bit more if Apple has somehow locked out third party adapters). This puts it just above the t440s, and I trade 256GB of drive space for a Retina display. Potentially worth it.

* Interacting with the OS, coming from Ubuntu. I currently have a loaner from my work for the summer, and so far I'm unimpressed with the experience. OSX conflates the command key with the other modifier keys (see: ctrl+c, alt+tab, super == com+c, com+tab, com+space) although this might be fixable with some rebinding apps. I haven't found a way to do window snapping yet, the maximize button is weird, I can't middle-click to bury a window, can't alt+drag to move windows, etc. ... it's all really petty stuff but it adds up when I'm interacting with it all day.

Lenovo's t540p also looks tempting with the 3K IPS screen, but it's a bit heavy for my tastes and I really don't need/want a numpad (especially when it uncenters me from the screen).

A lot of my usage will revolve around having a half dozen chrome tabs open, a few Intellij or Matlab editors running, maybe an IRC client, jumping from workspace to workspace in Ubuntu3D. Intellij work is a lot of code editing, unit rest running, gradle deploying. A lot of the Matlab code I work with is resource-hungry, but I generally have a smaller dataset on my machine then deploy to a remote for the full runs. I'm not huge on note-taking during class, but I do like to be able to get some work done during/between lectures on battery.

They never have, and I imagine they never will, but it feels so much worse now that I know what is like to not live at home (live at college) and in this hostile environment.  There is always tension that is shown via attitudes, arguments, or yelling matches.  I cannot handle it.  I am only at home during the summer for a full time internship, but even being away for 40 hours a week is not enough.  I will do everything in my power to remain in my college town for next summer (I am a rising junior) but I honestly don't think I can handle this summer.

My mom is always micromanaging my dad, getting very passive aggressive (sighing loudly and making annoyed faces) when my dad does anything she disapproves of.  The list of things my mom dislikes goes on forever, but the top issues are him clearing his throat (which he does often because he has sinus problems - not his fault) and eating chips (Mom will say things like ""are you going to have something other than chips for lunch?"" when my mom is the one who put the chips on the table, knowing dad would have a few handfuls).

My dad has a very short fuse and carpooling with him to and from work is stressful because of his horrible road rage.  He claimed that a driver was incompetent and unfit to drive because they forgot to turn their turn signal off after safely and legally passing us on the left.

I used to have extreme anxiety problems from living at home, and the combination of being away at school during my sophomore year, getting out of an abusive relationship, seeking therapy for everything, and beginning a wonderful relationship with my current boyfriend, I have gotten so much better managing my problems...but now that I am back to the house with the people that taught me to live with these problems, I am seriously struggling.  I can feel myself slipping back to my old self and being very anxious, letting my OCD take over, seeing no way out and just wanting to end it.  My supportive boyfriend is the number one thing getting me through this.

I called my boyfriend today and was very upset after my parents had an argument about something I did (turning the lights on in an area they didn't believe needed illumination) and we were on the phone for about half an hour, and 15 minutes later, I called him back hysterically crying because my parents were screaming at each other and it scared me (I am very sensitive to yelling).  He told me it would be okay and he will see me next weekend and he loves me and stayed on the phone with me for another thirty minutes.

I don't want to burden my boyfriend with sustaining my happiness, but I honestly can't find anything to look forward to other than Skyping with him every night, and our occasional visits when we force our work schedules to cooperate with one another.  I am attempting to train for a half marathon (finals week derailed my progress a bit, so I'm not as far along as I would have liked) and I am capable of keeping myself busy, but the only thing that honestly makes me smile is him and I am worried about him being overwhelmed by how overwhelmed I am...

I am more than willing to be there for my boyfriend just the way he is supporting me now, but I don't have the capability of getting myself to his place.  He has a car, while I have to borrow my mom's.  I feel like the weak link in this relationship.  He has low self esteem, but he is honestly the most wonderful, attractive, fantastic person I have ever met...and I feel like all I will do is complain this summer.  I don't want to be that girl.

Please help me cope with being at home.  I realize it might not sound that bad, but I have struggled with OCD, panic attacks and depression my whole life, and this past semester, I genuinely felt like I was conquering it.  Being home is so rough on me and I have no support from my parents when it comes to my own emotions unless they view it as a good reason to be upset, and they deny that the arguing and yelling even happens on a regular basis.  (They also never believed that my OCD was real or that my panic attacks were for a good enough reason and just got angry with me about it.)

I have been hiding in my room all day, crying most of the time I've been in here, listening to them have multiple loud arguments and one screaming match, and I know I will be told that I'm being ridiculous for hiding away up here, but I don't care anymore.  I could borrow my mom's car, but I live in a town with basically nothing for just one person to do and there is no where else to go because all my friends from around here stayed at their respective universities for the summer.  As immature as it sounds, I never want to come out of my room, unless it is to leave with my boyfriend and go back to school.

---   
**TL;DR**: My parents never stop fighting/yelling and after bettering myself emotionally over the past semester, I feel like all my hard work is going down the drain after just 2 weeks of being home and I have 3 months left.  I don't know what to do..."

26k10o,1,2014-05-26,[21/f] Got into a fight with boyfriend [21/m] and left for five days. Don't know what to expect when I get home.,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/26k10o/21f_got_into_a_fight_with_boyfriend_21m_and_left/,"So, kind of a long story. We've been together almost a year (June 12), and have been dating ever since he got back from AIT for the Army. He's always been a huge party kind of guy, always had it easy with the ladies. He of course settled down on the ladies with me, but continued drinking.

I took internship last fall, turning our romance into an LDR temporarily. It worked fine, but he got black out drunk and made out with/went home with/did not sleep with a friend of a friend of a friend after someone's birthday back in October. He called and told me what happened literally the next day (when he was coming to visit), and went into a depressed kind of state, a little bit of self-harm and some obvious self-loathing for doing me wrong. He started counseling, and we took a break for a few weeks then got back together when he decided our relationship was based largely in friendship, not just sex. He stopped counseling.

We moved in together in January, and things were great! We take care of house well together, and were able to respect each others' need to be alone when necessary, even in a 1-bedroom apartment. In April, my family started falling apart (tl;dr, dad went to rehab, mom went to looney bin, divorce because dad had an affair, little bit of disagreement among siblings, on and on), and I've spun into a type of depression I guess over it. I haven't been able to make it to counseling so naturally all this gets taken out on him and my one girl friend. 

He's continued to go out recently and drink with his friends (which is fine), but I haven't wanted to leave the house much and so haven't participated in things like ""$2 tea tuesdays"" at the local bar. Well a couple weeks ago he came in black out drunk and said that one of his friend (Let's call him Asshole Friend, AF for short) spent an hour listing why he should break up with me. I asked if he agreed and he went on a brief bit about how I ""ruined him, am controlling, haven't tried to make him happy,"" and that I ""don't think his career is good enough to match mine""

This is not when the fight happened. The next day he woke up and apologized for everything, saying obviously I've made him happy, and have supported his career choices. He told me to remove the alcohol from the house (gonna stop drinking, we're on diets anyway and it isn't good for me and I'm an asshole with liquor), and said he wasn't going out to the bar district for ""a long time""

Cue last Tuesday. He convinced AF that we should do a calm evening, chill at the pool. He had work the next morning at eight, didn't want to be out late again, really didn't want to get drunk again. Then our other friend (Cool Friend, CF for short), was hungry and was in the middle of making dinner, so left the pool. So we all left the pool. After leaving, AF convinced Boyfriend they should go out tonight. ""it's tradition, I'll go and have one drink and drive myself home alone if I have to"" he said. So BF decided he'd go too. When I asked how late they'd be out, he said ""surely not past midnight."" Cool, the previous end time on our fun was 10 but ok 12 isn't bad either. But I texted at 1130 to ask if he'd be home soon, and he said ""We're chilling with AF's buddies, so whenever he wants to come  home, he has DD rights""...Well okay cool surely they won't be out all night. Doesn't matter, really, I fell asleep at 1230. 

But I woke up at 2, and he wasn't home. So I turned on my phone to see if there had been any updates; nothing. As a normal human woman, this both scares me and kind of pisses me off. He could have gotten in a wreck, been arrested, gotten wildly drunk, on and on, since last I had heard from him. I was slightly irate when he got home (sober enough) at 2:20. And I said I was upset he had been out so late since he said he wasn't going out in the first place. But he got really mad at me for being upset because ""he didn't even drink that much. Like maybe 5 drinks in the last five hours."" He then rolled over and went to sleep, ending the argument without discussing why I was upset. I can't sleep when he's mad at me, so after a half hour of trying, I woke him up and said I wanted to talk about that. All I wanted was in the future for him to send an update text, but it turned into a huge HUGE fight. 

The next day he was sick puking (I gave him my stomach bug, oopsie), and I brought him powerade and took care of him as a peace offering. It was a dumb fight, I know. I can get over it, we can move on. We watched one of his favorite movies together and things seemed okay. But late in the evening I asked if he was still mad and he said ""yes, a little....a lot"" and he slept on the couch again that night. 

Wake up next morning, he's still sick. I said we need to talk about it before I leave on a weekend trip. Which turned into another little mini fight about how I'm always ""judging, controlling, and yelling"" at him, fighting with him all the time anymore. I said that I just wanted to know if when he has his career and maybe a kid to attend to, will he still be going out until two in the morning. He said yes, that he wasn't ever going to stop having fun just because the world said he was supposed to. He also said ""clearly this is how you are, and this is how I am, and it isn't going to work,"" rolled over and went to sleep again.

So this time, I'm over it. I packed my stuff up, rescheduled an appointment I had that afternoon to morning, and got ready to drive to Oklahoma. He woke up again while I was about to go to the appointment and asked where I was going and I said ""to my appointment and then to Oklahoma"" and he asked (seemingly upset) ""Now?"" and I said ""does it even matter?"" and kind of fought tears to not clue in the person I was meeting. I returned after the appointment to pick up the dog and he asked if I was really leaving now, and I said yes to go to Oklahoma. He apologized again, saying he was ""mad, but not THAT mad"" about it, but I held strong and said I thought he needed some time to cool off. 

We haven't been in contact much since I left. I've been drinking every day trying to have fun. I know he's drank plenty since I left. He asked when I was coming home yesterday, but I can't tell if that means he misses me or if he's secretly just moving himself out. I made an apology at some point but he didn't really accept it and said he didn't want to talk all ""super serial."" 

I'm leaving and driving through the night to avoid traffic tonight, getting home around 4 or 5, so he'll be asleep. Anybody have a guess as to what I can expect when I get back??

TL;DR: we're both assholes, had a pointless fight, I just want to get back to the fun relationship I was in before my world fell apart."

26k8cn,1,2014-05-26,"Job, internship, or post-bachelor program? What should I do before applying to graduate school?",[deleted],biology,https://www.reddit.com/r/biology/comments/26k8cn/job_internship_or_postbachelor_program_what/,"I have found myself stuck in a quandary while deciding my next step in science. To illustrate this problem, I'll give a bit of background first: I attended a small (but somewhat prominent) college in the US, and because of its liberal arts system, I had some time to choose my major. Initially, I wanted to study neuroscience, but ultimately, I chose to major in biochemistry. By that point however, virtually all of the research opportunities offered by my college had already been taken by other students who had decided earlier than me, and because of various scheduling conflicts (as well as the obvious limitations of being a small school), there were many classes I could not take. 

Although I completed all the necessary classes and did graduate with fairly good GPA (3.45), I felt like I did not know enough to have any kind of inclination towards a particular field, nor did I have enough research experience to make me a competitive candidate, and so, I didn't feel prepared to apply to graduate school.  

But, as fate would have it, I had to carry out my obligatory military duty in my father's home country, which luckily bought me some time to think about how to boost my skills in science as well as what kind of scientific field I would like to focus on. I worked as an unpaid intern in a lab for a small biotechnology firm for the few months before my military service started, but I ended up leaving early after I realized I was not learning anything.

I am now planning to return to the US (to upstate New York) to prepare myself for graduate school after I finish my military service, but I have no idea how to do so. I know that biochemistry has a wide range of options, of which biotechnology fascinates me the most (especially agricultural biotechnology). But getting a job, internship, or post-bachelor program are three different ballgames altogether, each with their own set of pros and cons (e.g. getting paid versus having to pay, acceptance rate, different learning conditions, etc). I just want to be in the best environment to increase my molecular biology/genetics/computer skills, as well as have good networking opportunities. So I wanted to ask, can anybody recommend me one game plan over the others? And does anybody know of a specific program they could recommend?

26k9l6,4,2014-05-26,Me [20 M] with my overbearing Muslim/Indian mom [51 F]. She does not approve of me dating. What should I do?,obviisobvious,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/26k9l6/me_20_m_with_my_overbearing_muslimindian_mom_51_f/,"Background: I am an only child, and I currently live with my parents. I was born and raised in America, and I identify primarily as an American. I attend a university that is only a couple of hours drive from home, and I live in an apartment off campus during the school year. During Christmas and summer breaks, I live at home. I do not own my own car, and my parents are supporting me financially through college.

My mother has never been okay with me dating. She has always said that I should graduate and find a job before I start dating. I've tried reasoning with her before and telling her that that is not normal behavior in America, but it is difficult to reason with this woman. She had an arranged marriage back in the old country, and she's extremely Muslim, so appealing to ""Western"" ideals of independence, young love, exploring one's identity, etc., don't work on her. Just to understand what I'm dealing with here, this is a woman who believes that many ""Western"" women are asking to be raped based on what they wear.

Problem: I met an awesome girl my freshman year, and we've been going out for almost 1.5 years (my first real relationship), but the toxic environment at home surrounding dating is really putting a strain on this relationship.

When I first started seeing this girl in 2012, I told my mom about her, under the delusion that my mom would accept this relationship. Instead, my mom responded with hurtful vitriol like: ""Your girlfriend is just a girl from the streets"" (in reference to the fact that my girlfriend is not as financially well off as I am).

I went pretty ballistic because I couldn't believe what my mom was saying, and I told my mom that I hated her, that she had been meddling with and ruining my life since the day I was born, that she was stuck in her ways, that I didn't respect her or what she had to say, etc. Pretty hurtful stuff, I know, but I was incredibly hurt and frustrated and angry.

Eventually we made up with the understanding that this was just a phase in my life, that this relationship was temporary.

Fast forward 1.5 years. I'm at home for the summer, and my girlfriend is taking summer classes at our university. I work weekdays at my internship, and my weekends are pretty free. So this weekend, I told my mom that I wanted to drive up to see my girlfriend, and my mom freaked. She prohibited me from driving up to see her, and she said things like, ""You're still seeing this girl? I thought it was supposed to be temporary. There are better girls out there. You don't need to be with this girl from the streets"", etc.

And once again, I flipped my shit. I told her to fuck off, that I didn't care what she had to say, that I wanted her to stop meddling in my life, etc.

My mother is making it very hard, nigh impossible, for me to see or do anything romantic for my girlfriend. She tries to justify her words and actions as just ""looking out for my best interests"", but I feel like she's just trying to control my life. She claims that I am being led off the straight and narrow path, that I am being distracted/corrupted by my girlfriend. I'm unsure as to how I should proceed. I want to continue seeing my girlfriend, and I just wish that my mom would accept her/this relationship.

TL;DR: Been going out with a girl that I met at college for ~1.5 years. Mother does not approve and is making my life difficult."
26kecz,5,2014-05-26,How do I get back in the game?,[deleted],ems,https://www.reddit.com/r/ems/comments/26kecz/how_do_i_get_back_in_the_game/,"It's been about 5 years since I last worked on a rig. My employment with a large private ambulance company in central California had ended with my being terminated after a week-long investigation into allegations about a **co-worker's** behavior towards other drivers and improper usage of a company vehicle. In my ""unusual occurrence"" report, which I was asked to write, following the complaint, I had dismissed any and all claims regarding her alleged ""poor behavior"" towards other drivers (including flipping people off and other supposed obscene gestures) with the supporting evidence being the drive cam footage that was able to be obtained and reviewed, showing that these assertions of rude gestures were, after all, unsubstantiated. In summary, I stated that our trip from our last destination returning to our station (during which the complaint/call in question was received) had been uneventful and unremarkable. 

I was shortly thereafter asked if I would like to revise my written statement, which I declined to do. Just over a week later, I was called into the station, read a script off a computer screen by one of the station managers that stated that the company ""was no longer in need of my service,"" handed my last paycheck, and escorted out of the building. I had to move back in with my parents as I couldn't afford continuing to pay rent and the countless other costs involved with trying to live on one's own.

It took about a month before the effects of losing a job that I really enjoyed started to set in. I still feel like complete and utter garbage, as I've always tended to measure my self worth based on the type of job that I do. 

Since then, I've done odd jobs here and there. I've kept my EMT-B up-to-date and worked as a part-time on-site EMT at a local industrial site. I worked at Tesla Motors for a short while, on the assembly line, building the Model S (which was *really* an enjoyable job), but the long shifts combined with the often-3-hour-long commutes back home wasn't allowing me to keep my head above water in my classes.

I went through a local Paramedic program a couple years ago. Finished didactic with flying colors and spend 6 long, but insightful months in the ED during my internship while waiting to be placed with a paramedic preceptor for my field time. I never made it any further. The owner of the school I had been attending filed bankruptcy and closed the doors, leaving me out $12,000 in tuition and a little over a year in time lost. Some of that money had been borrowed from family who were hurting enough, financially, but ultimately wanted to see me reach my goals.

I've just finished up my 4th semester of prerequisite classes for the RN program at one of the local community colleges. I'm still doing the part-time industrial plant EMT thing, but it's not cutting it. My mother fell recently and suffered a concussion, which has affected her ability to work, so the family's income has been suffering a bit as well. I'm trying to do what I can do to help with things, giving the parents my paychecks, buying/restoring/flipping things on ebay, etc., but I lack a full-time job that would allow me to be of more help and eventually allow for me to have my own space again.

I've applied *numerous* times to other local ambulance companies, hospitals, etc in hopes of being hired. I think my main point in all this spilling-of-my-guts is that I feel that this **""terminated""** label is following me around like a dark cloud, making me appear as too large a liability to hire and ultimately blackballing me from ever working on an ambulance again. I'm so incredibly torn up about it. Any time I try to fill out the ""explain the circumstances of any previous employment termination"" field on an application, I feel that I appear as if I'm trying to take blame off of my self and place it on others, which looks awful to prospective employers, I'd imagine. I don't think very highly of my self, which I'm sure you've assessed if you've managed to read this far, but integrity is one character trait that I can say that I'm proud to possess. 

Has anyone been through a similar situation? How did you get back on your feet? I've lost contact with many of my previous connections from work, so getting my foot back in any door through networking is nearly out of the question. I'm at a loss and just want to work on a rig again, even if I'd be driving dialysis patients around all day. I need something to take pride in. I've had too many doors slammed in my face.

Sorry for the length, but I just needed to spill my guts to *someone* and I appreciate *anyone* taking the time to read through it."
26kewr,1,2014-05-26,I'm addicted.,TwoHundredDollaSuit,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/26kewr/im_addicted/,"Hi there!

As you've undoubtedly been informed by the title: I'm addicted. Specifically to:

* Porn
* Masturbation
* Internet
* Computers
* Video games

I've tried NoFap at least ten times. The furthest I've ever gotten is a laughable four days. But school's out now, my life is relatively stress free &amp; simple for the next two weeks until an internship starts, and I'm want to try again and do it *properly*.

For me, NoFap isn't just about PMO. It's about taking disciplined measures to improve your life, remove bad habits/addictions and introduce good habits. I see browsing sites like Reddit (well, if you only browse the default subreddits like I do) as just as bad as PMO, perhaps worse. So I want to fix a few things in one go. Specifically:

* I want to stop watching porn/masturbating entirely.
* I want to limit internet usage to 1 hour per day, and stop browsing sites like Reddit entirely and restrict my access to more interesting/fulfilling websites (lettersofnote.com comes to mind).
* I want to stop playing video games entirely.
* I want to limit myself to a maximum of two episodes of a TV show a week, or a single movie.

I also have some more long term goals (to be reached within 6 months):

* I want to gain 30 lbs over the course of the summer (increasing my weight from 205 lbs to 235 lbs).
* I want to strict press 100 kg x 5. 
* I want to squat 230 kg x 5.
* I want to clean 165 kg.
* I want to jerk 140 kg.
* I want to read a book a week over the summer and continue the habit into the school year.
* I want to visit a new place at least once a month and actually explore my surroundings rather than getting stuck in a bubble.
* I want to be more adventurous---both in activity and socially.

I really believe that your habits/behavior in your late teens/early 20s (my age) shape who you are for the rest of your life. And I want to make sure that I'm becoming a person that I can be proud of and like. To help me towards that goal, starting tomorrow, I'm going to comment in this thread every day with the following information:

* Current weight
* Hours slept the previous night, time I went to bed, time I woke up.
* General eating habit summary
* Books read today, how many pages
* My activities for the day
* Any new friends/social activity
* If used the internet, what pages were visited. Any interesting articles. Who was spoken to on chat. How long was it used for it?
* If watched TV/movie, what movie was watched.
* Any challenges for the day, especially in regards to PMO.

So I'm going to use this thread as a log to keep myself on track for my goals. It's not really meant to be read by anyone, but the fact that it's public and people can see it will hopefully further incentivize me. 

My counter will not only serve as a measure of how many days I've gone without PMO, but how many days I've adhered to my plan to reach my goals. I'm resetting it for 05/27/2014.

I'm going to do this.

26knc2,0,2014-05-26,Studying concerns during internship year. Can you offer your advice?,thecheetah16,medicine,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/26knc2/studying_concerns_during_internship_year_can_you/,"I am curious to know how I should study during internship. 

I have observed myself during 3rd and 4th year and I have noticed some  patterns I would like to somehow address. I seek the meddit's advice in remedying these issues. 

One consistent issue has always been that there is a lack of time to study at the end of each day. I find that once I arrive home I am tired from the day, I have to make dinner, and prepare my clothes for the next day. Ultimately, I am able to get in about 2-3 hours of reading maximum. This is a huge problem for me because it is hardly enough time to review my old notes AND review new material. 

I have already taken steps to make everything as efficient as possible by trying to make a large dinner once a week and often pre-preparing earlier in the week for each individual day.

I should state that I must review my old material because as it stands right now I have been forgetting more material than I would like. Subsequently, when I am called upon to discuss a topic I come up short because it has been several months since I last read that topic. Please note I am not forgetting everything! 

One day weekends... As I have already stated above I need to review my old material and one day weekends means less time for sleep and less time to study. 

I am truly concerned about this. I am not the kind of student who can go home read some thing and repeat it back verbatim the next day. I have always needed to take time to learn material. My 3rd and 4th year of medical school has been grueling since we spend so much time in the clinic or hospital and little time preparing for shelfs. I passed these exams but not by wide margins. 

I also want to add that I was allowed extra time off to study for boards. This was great since it allowed me to learn the material much better than I could have otherwise. I used Doctors in Training and Kaplan videos to prepare myself and I did well on Step 2. I owe my great score to those review materials and to the time I had off. 

I know internship year is supposed to be difficult for everyone but I am even more concerned about myself since I know I am at my best only when I actually get time to be prepared. With a minuscule amount of time at the end of each day and one day off a week how will I be able to do this? How will I be able to study for the next Board exam? How will I be able to study for in-service exams at the end of each month? How will be able to service patients well? "
26kse7,8,2014-05-26,SO's overseas family want to come visit soon after the baby is born. I'm so stressed. What do you guys think?,kazielle,BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/26kse7/sos_overseas_family_want_to_come_visit_soon_after/,"My fiance and I are first time parents. His parents live overseas and we haven't seen them in three years. This will be their first grandchild, and naturally, they're excited to come meet baby as soon as they can. They want to pay for two of his siblings to come too, which means four visitors total and flight costs of over $8000 total. However, they've been pushing to come mid July, and I'm due June 11th. I'm not comfortable with how soon that is and I've made it pretty clear. My partner and even my mother think I'm being unreasonable, but I'm putting my foot down over this. Still, I'd like to explain the situation and get some advice from those who have been there before.

I'm due June 11th. My mother went to 42 weeks with both my brother and I, and then had to have an emergency c-section with both of us. We both have very petite builds, not sure if that's a factor, but due to my mother's history, I'm planning for a very real possibility that I might go to 42 weeks AND have a c-section. That means the baby might be induced June 25, arrive on the 26th, and I might have to stay in the hospital until around the 30th. That means that if everything goes wrong and they come mid July - around the 14th - I might have only had baby home for two weeks. Only two weeks of learning to be parents, only two weeks of learning some kind of schedule that works, only two weeks of learning to breastfeed. I think of the pain of stitches and tearing and recovery, I think of sleepless nights. 

The thing is, I love his family. I'd love to see them again, and I can't wait to have them meet the newest member of their family. And this is one of the biggest reasons I don't want them to come right away! I want to be able to spend some quality time with them, and more importantly, I want my fiance to be able to spend quality time with them. It's been years since he's been able to do that, and it might be years until he can do it again. Instead of being sleep-deprived, anxious, stressed from brand-new parenthood (and the fears that come with it - why won't baby stop crying? is he sick? do we need to take him to the doctor? i'll have to cancel that thing my parents were looking forward to and won't be able to do again!) and trying to juggle spending time with his family who will only be there for a couple weeks, I'd like them to come after a few months when we have a handle on what we're doing and can spend relaxed time with them (and not be jealous about handing over the baby all the time - it's going to be hard to deny grandparents who won't be able to see their grandchild again for a long time). I know I'm going to need a lot of support from my fiance in the first few weeks of our child's life, and I don't want to have to weigh my need for his help against his need to spend time with his family who won't be here for long (and I know what will end up happening is that I won't request his help when I want it so that he can spend time with him, but then I'll resent him for making me feel like I can't ask him - even though he'll gladly help whenever I need it. I just don't want to be needy and deprive him of limited family time). 

My fiance and mother keep mentioning that ""my due date is June 11th so I'm making a big fuss over people who will probably only arrive 5-6 weeks after the baby comes"". It's all well and good to plan for the most convenient scenario for everyone, but what if they book their $8000 trip and the worst case scenario DOES happen? Why am I the only one who sees the possibility there? 

I'm sorry, I've written a book. There is so much more here that bothers me. The main reason they want to come in July is because his sister starts an internship late July, and she wants to come (a free $2000 trip, who wouldn't?). So everyone pushed pretty hard for July or earlier, just so she could make it. I do love his sister, but she lives interstate, goes to school and travels the world entirely on his parents dime, while he and I struggle to pay day-to-day expenses. When she already gets so much help from them and we get none, it makes me blood boil to be pressured into inconvenience solely to suit her convenience. 

The other thing is, my fiance and I are HUGE on traveling, ALL our savings until this baby appeared have been spent on seeing the world together. Our lives have always revolved around each other and the next overseas trip we're going to take. We've spent thousands upon thousands of dollars traveling. My fiance's brother has more money than him and had significantly less expenses, and his sister, as I mentioned, lives an impressive lifestyle using his parents money, while we've always tried to be independent and never asked for help (actually, my fiance has helped out everyone out in the financial department, including his millionaire parents - yes, it's weird). But now, right when we're having a baby and are poorer than we've been in our entire lives, his parents are paying $2000+ per flight for his siblings to come visit us here, and all accompanying expenses. And I GET it, I absolutely do, and I know I should be grateful that we get to see them. I get that it's a family visit. But it really, truly upsets me that my fiance and I's lives have revolved around seeing new places and we've scrimped and budgeted and planned in order to see the world, and now that we're poor and unable to do that, his siblings - one who has a lot of money and has never bothered to leave the country, even at our urging and invitations, and one who lives in an expensive high-rent area and goes to an expensive school and travels overseas using their parent's money - get free $2000+ trips across the world. It just doesn't seem fair. I actually suggested we all meet up in Hawaii - it would be over $2000 cheaper to fly the entire family, including us, to Hawaii than for the four of them to fly to Australia where we live. And then my fiance and I would get to go to a place we'd never been and take a holiday we're not going to be able to afford to have for a long time. 

But I digress, and I'm so sorry. This is a really long vent. It all came pouring out!

Anyway, I was wondering - how soon do you guys think I should allow them to come? They won't necessarily have to stay in our house, though we do have room for them. His father has a cat allergy and we have three cats, so I think they might try to stay in a hotel anyway (although I think it would be easier to have them stay with us, so that we could all go places when it suited, instead of having to 'meet up' at a certain time and place and having to potentially cancel/delay when baby won't stop screaming and we can't figure out why.

Everything is all a mess. I've never done this parenting thing before. How soon is too soon for overseas visitors to come? AHHH. Help. :("

Let me introduce myself, my name is Vereenz, I’m 18 years old and I’m born and raised in Amsterdam The Netherlands.

I have made accounts on different social media, to keep it professional. I’m not very active yet on these accounts, because I want to sort things out first before I’m going to focus on that.

For the record, I don’t ask for donations or sponsors, although it would be nice but I now ask for some understanding and help.

I am a creative person and have been to creative schools, That's why I want to dedicate myself entirely to editing and streaming videos.

I also have a blog with on there a few video’s that I’ve edited just as hobby and to build some experience.

That’s been awhile ago, when I was in school.
The link of my blog and video’s that I’ve edited are here:

Meanwhile I went to many different schools, I had to walk internship, I had several part-time jobs, but it's hard to count on.  Because they do not see that I have rheumatism, and it is difficult to see that from the outside, so there is little understanding shown. I find it sad, but I also understand that.

But now I come back to the point for which I wrote this post, I have some money saved up over the years.

it is not a large amount, but it is a start to invest some + I get a monthly benefit for rheumatoid arthritis that I have.

I do not live in luxury, and also not in poverty, I accept the conditions in which I live and have my rheumatism also Generally accepted. 

Now to go about my life in detail, I don’t think that people are waiting for that. who knows in the future.

So what I am asking is; if anyone can help me to invest my savings into a new PC to stream and the necessary gadgets. I cannot pay anything in one amount, but can pay back each period. 

I also want to make a video on my blog of the people who want to help me and make a review of the PC and the necessary gadgets so that anyone can follow how it went.  I do not mind to mention Sponsors or names and brand advertising 

if you want to help and show interest, you can contact  through my social media.

26l3nq,0,2014-05-27,"Three outcomes, not sure if there is any choice.",[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/26l3nq/three_outcomes_not_sure_if_there_is_any_choice/,"I am a graduate with a Political Science Degree.

During my time in college, I set up sights into 3 possible places after I graduate:

-------
Doing an internship with a state representative

Doing an internship with an advocacy group

Working as a local canvasser

-------

Of the three, 

I will need to contact the interviewer to say that I'm done with school and that I am able to bring my full undivided attention towards interning for their campaign for state representative.

The canvassing job was willing to hire me, and the things I need to do will be set up sometime next week, I can still decline the job if I choose not to work over there.

The advocacy job won't start until I get e-mails. Seems the e-mail will take some time... so not sure if I want to risk everything on that when the possibility of getting it isn't guaranteed, although I do know the people doing the internship (sort of.)

I would much prefer that I work under the representative's campaign as an intern and work my way up through there, but I am uncertain if I'll be able to get it for the current 6 months that the campaign will be going for. I would love to work as a fellow for the advocacy group too if the option to interview and such came out sooner. The canvassing job is basically my last resort (it is paid, and it'll be valuable experience in speaking.)

Of my favorable choices, it would be campaign internship&gt;advocacy fellow&gt;canvasser. Of the three, only the canvassing job would be paid, the other two will be mostly as internship and a possible leg up into the portions of the degree that I do want to get into.

The likely scenario, as time goes by, is the canvasing job, even though it sounds like something I don't want to do, do I really have a say in it.... and should I just take the job because it is paid?"
26l4gi,3,2014-05-27,Inner struggle,CorporateGoose,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/26l4gi/inner_struggle/,"I feel as if I should seek help, but I don't know where to begin but here. So just to get some steam out, I've been living alone for 3 years and just graduated last december. I had an internship and scored a job out of college. Sounds like I got it worked out, but getting to this point was my ability to push through everything I shouldn't have ignored.

My freshman year of college I was talking to a really attractive girl online living two states away. I've been through this kind of love scenario plenty of times and I didn't think it'd become a reality. Come christmas break my great grandfather passed away to natural causes. Then my world came to a halt, flipped upside down and put into overdrive. My father was killed in a car accident a week after my great grandfather. If I could only begin to describe the bond between us then you could understand my situation a little better.

I'm a focused driven person and I get the job done when it needs done. I didnt take a break from college, I went back, started dating the girl, and she moved in with me the following summer. My mother started dating out of no where that fall and got married again the next spring. The girl and I split apart that summer and went through a long drawn out breakup to the next winter and finally broke ties the following spring. Since then I went through countless dates and super short term relationships. Shit was simple before college, I knew what I wanted in life, had a plan and was making my way. Now I feel so empty after achieving what I wanted, not able to hold a steady relationship, and still living alone. I've made it this far because of the emotional stamina that crosscountry in highschool helped me build. 

Now I'm at the end looking back and seeing everything that I once knew shattered or missing. I feel greatful for what I have, but I'd trade it all for what I miss. The emptiness hurts."
26l6g2,4,2014-05-27,My perfect end to a perfect vacation,[deleted],happy,https://www.reddit.com/r/happy/comments/26l6g2/my_perfect_end_to_a_perfect_vacation/,"The last 5 or so days have been the best I've had in quite a long time. I'm feeling really good about things right now and I'd like to share with everyone. For a little backstory, the last 2 or 3 years have been kinda hard on me, with the death of my dad and long bouts of unemployment and depression it's really nice that good things are starting to come my way. This year in February I started a dream internship and got my life and career moving in the right direction and on my birthday in April, my mom and grandparents both chipped in to get me a flight to visit my high school best friend for 5 days in California.

The vacation was entirely awesome, on the flight there the plane was not crowded, and I [ended up getting a whole aisle to myself](http://i.imgur.com/jy3ZYVF.jpg) which is nice because tall people and airplanes don't usually play nice. We both just turned 21, so the first night there we went to the store and basically fill up the card with beer and spirits with the intent of drinking it all by Monday (which we succeeded in doing, by the way!). The next day we drove up to lake Tahoe and [had fun at the river and the beach](http://i.imgur.com/vJOpkws.jpg) and then made our way to the casinos in south Tahoe city, where my friend ended up winning 82 dollars in two rounds at the penny slots which we used to buy dinner on the way home.

Over the next few days, we [visited Silicon Valley](http://i.imgur.com/WsiSdaS.jpg), saw the trees at [the redwood forest](http://i.imgur.com/DyQ4v7B.jpg) and explored San Francisco (which I don't have pictures of). We also had some awesome [games of Cards Against Humanity](http://i.imgur.com/s7PwDOF.jpg) and [volunteered on the safety crew at a racetrack](http://i.imgur.com/0dXwXjD.jpg) and I got to [take a ride in a legit racecar](http://i.imgur.com/IGuXalm.jpg). Basically a jam-packed vacation with awesome around every corner.

As if that wasn't enough, after my flight home I got into a shuttle from the airport and ended up sitting next to a very cute girl. We immediately hit it off and chatted the whole ride back about music, TV, our trips and everything else. She told me she doesn't really know anyone in town who she can just hang out with randomly without tons of planning beforehand. She ended up giving me her number and I said I'd call her this week to do something spontaneous. 

So yeah, there it is, the perfect end to my perfect vacation. Thanks for reading everyone, and I hope you have yourself a great day!"
26lci1,0,2014-05-27,"So I'm binge-ing on Scrubs, first time watching. I'm 4 episodes from finishing Season 5 and I HATE JD.",lnpeters,Scrubs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scrubs/comments/26lci1/so_im_bingeing_on_scrubs_first_time_watching_im_4/,"So at this point in the show, Turk and Carla are pregnant, Dr. Cox and ex have their son, Elliot is in a completely inappropriate relationship with a very very sexy intern, and then there's JD.

JD's screwed up all of his relationships, which is no surprise to me since the character is like a perpetual child. I'm not talking about all the nerdy and kiddie stuff he does with Turk, I mean he has no maturity in his other relationships. Personal or professional.

I know the show is really light-hearted, and as a drama-tv watcher, it was a bit of an adjustment for me, but once I got into season 2, I was getting the flow of things and just laughing at the outrageously dumb jokes.

But the problem is that JD just gets more and more annoying (with Elliot coming in a close second.) But Elliot is the stereotypical blonde bimbo (oops, I mean, Barbie), but what's JD's excuse? Does he really have any redeeming qualities? Sure, he's got a good bedside manner, and I guess he's a decent doctor (they sure don't do much medicine on the show), but what else?

His idiosyncrasies just keep multiplying and compounding... Like the episode where he dates that really pretty girl who never laughs and just says, ""That's so funny."" Except I can't make that leap into _liking_ any of his quirks. And that f'ing nose of his... God damn, why do actresses have to get nose jobs and boob jobs and botox and acid peels when male actors can just show up looking like JD and get the lead role in a 9 season show?

Bottom line, and I honestly don't know why I'm posting this, but I hate JD. I hate the character, I hate the immaturity, I hate his voice, I hate that after 5 seasons (over 100 episodes) his character growth is infinitesimal, I even kind of hate the actor.

My question.... Does it get better after Season 5? 'Cause as much as I fucking love Dr. Cox and (JD's older brother), the irritation to sex appeal ratio on the show is only getting worse and worse."

She is my first cat, and I've been trying to stop her biting and scratching from the moment it started hurting. Her biting stems from her younger days when my friends and I played with her and allowed her to bite, but now it breaks the skin. 

I've tried spraying (nope), time out (nope), blowing in her face (nope), distractions with toys (still goes for arms) etc. I have no clue how to positively teach my cat not to bite, because when she feels like cuddling up and being kind, I conveniently tend not to have treats around. 

I feel so down about Flippy. I'm sure I've driven my cat into aggressive biting. She preys on us during playtime, and she reacts to unwanted petting or picking up by biting. And sometimes it's really without warning. She'll be purring one moment and then decide to bite. Hard. I'm scared to pick her up because she bites.

I'm hoping it's not too late, but an acquaintance of mine is trying to give her cat, Cory, away because she is moving across the country for an internship after she graduates. I am thinking of taking this cat in and very slowly introducing Cory to Flippy. I'm still mentally preparing for it.

I've spoken to my housemates and friends about this.

They are both shy. Same age. Flippy is very territorial but Cory is very chill. **Would taking in Cory help Flippy stop biting?** 

I'm also hoping they'll be cuddle buddies and playmates once they get comfortable with each other. Not sure if that will happen. I'm excited for second cat but also very worried."

26lmpw,1,2014-05-27,Relationship is making me depressive,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/26lmpw/relationship_is_making_me_depressive/,"I [28/m] wanted to post this in relationship_advice, but into writing this, I saw no point in posting it there, so here I am, just want to write. And side note: I'm from germany, so things about studies or moneystuff is a bit different, than in the us, but thats not the important part of this post. Just to keep in mind, when you think, my english sounds a bit silly. Also sorry, I usually (with my normal account, this one is obviously just for this post) don't write such long stories. But I guess, thats what you have to do to get something r/offmychest.

I'm [28/m] in a relationship for more than 5 years now with a woman [30/w]. The first year was cool, but her jealousy about everybody who I talked to or interacted with, was driving me nuts. She also wanted to make me jealous sometimes, but I'm that kind of a person, that when I'm really convinced about the relationship, I have 110% trust in the other person, and therefore there is no jealousy. Trust =/= Jealousy. But she sometimes thought quite the opposite, that I just don't care about what she does. 

But time went on, she stopped eventually with the jealousy and the first nearly 3 years were quite like I think it's normal for that timespan. 2 years into the relationship she moved into my flat, which was to big for 1 person anyway, but is quite to small for 2. Or it's not to small, but it's kind of a loftthing, so everything is one huge open room, and then there is one very very small room too.

So our life situation was/is also not that normal, but whats normal anyways: She finished one field of study (translator for 2 asian languages) when we first met, but really wasn't happy with that. So she started geology studies, but they were to expensive. So after 2 semesters, so she had to stop that and work for 1 year. Than she started biology, and finished her bachelors degree last year and is now in the masters program. My situation was also not the ""normal"" way. After school, I started to get grip in the television business. I did some internships and worked for almost 2 years on different tv shows (as aufnahmeleiter, I really don't know how to translate that, sorry), tv movies or studentprojects as cameraassistant. But I wasn't that happy with the whole television industry, how that worked here in germany. So I started studying, but something in a completely different field. I really wasn't happy with that either, so I swiched and found my dream studies in design. Now I'm at the end of that and I'm writing my final thesis.

Jump back to the relationship: After nearly 3 years she was partiing and didn't come home that night. She just texted me, she was staying with her friend (another girl), because it was so late. So I, with my stupid 110% trust thought, strange, that she didn't phone, but only wrote a text, but, its ok, what could go wrong....

So after that night something changed in me and I started to lose trust somehow. I don't know why, but it just slowely went. I started asking 2 or 3 times and I have to say, looking back, I can't really recognize myself of that time. After 1 month than it came out, she was staying with another guy that night. She said to me, they kissed, but she backed off after 5-10 minutes because of our relationship. 

Now what could I do? I didn't belive her, but than again, I thought, the only way to rescue a love is with trust. So I struggled, but I managed after a couple of months to trust her in her statement, that they ""only"" kissed. 

But year no 4 of the relationship was terrible. We argued all the time, about everything. I hate argues. I really hate them. Since the incident we didn't had sex, even in the month I didn't know what happend. We tried about 8 months after that, it was weired, because it was so long ago, but felt normal. But after that it never happend. And I talked a lot about that topic, but she said, it stresses her out to talk about that. Now I really strongly believe, that you shouldn't have sex with your partner if you don't want to, just for the sake of pleasing him. I really think, that sex is something positive, that both partys have to want to do. And I also think, it's naturally that you do things to your partner that makes her happy, and that this makes you happey. 

But you see the conflict in this 2 things? I don't want her to have sex with me just that I'm happy. But I so often do stuff (or buy or whatever) that makes her happy. And that fact that she is happy, makes me happy. Sorry, I'm really struggeling with my english here, it's so complicated to explain.

But after a horrific year 4 came year 5 and it changed again. I started to sleep on the couch (in the same room, remember it's quite huge), I stopped talking about sex, I stopped talking about problems we had, what happend. I just went on. But this led to a kind of seperation. I started not to care about everything anymore. After half a year we had the idea to move the bed to this small room. There is only space for one bed and maybe 2qm left. But in the end she now sleeps there and I now sleep on the couch in the other room. Now since 5 months. And I have to say, after all this talks and problems and stuff, I like it to really sleep calmly without thinking of discussions at night in the bed or without thinking of the hope of sex, what would't turn true anyways. I got used to this. 

But she made a 180 in this 5th year. She started to watch shows about brides and weddings, talked about, that she is now 30 any you can't wait to long for children. 3 of her friends also got married in this timespan. And shes asking me a lot of stuff about our future. 

Now, we are finally in the present time of my story. I have the feeling, I'm more far away from her, than ever bevore in out relationship. I mean, we don't talk about problems, we don't have sex abit more than 2 years, we even don't share the same bed for the last 5 months. And she wants to glue it all togther with marriage? My parents were divorced, my grandparents (of one side) were divorced (and that was reeeeeally uncommon for that time, where they lived), and I said to me: I will never make the same mistake. I want to relationship to be 110% solid, and the marriage should only be the reminder, that its that solid. It shouldn't be the glue that puts two persons together.

So after reading this, you probably say, what I did wrong, what she did wrong, or have questions, for example, why we still live together. Well it's quite easy I think: Offcourse, we know us quite well, but its also the situation, how our life turned out. We are bound by our financial situation. We both have no family here, where we live. So move there is not an option. We also don't have financial support, execpt our sidejobs next to our studies. We have to share livingcosts. So why did't I have the proplem at the first place when I got this flat? Well back than I had still money left from my time, were I worked at television. I never would have guessed, that I change my studies midway and have to start studying something different from the beginning. So money is really scarce these days. But in 2-3 months I will be finished with my studies and hopefully find a job somewhere, just to get money at first. 

But I really don't know what to do with the relationship. I mean, I can't leave her, when (if) I finally get a job, because, she can't finance a life on her own, as long as she is doing her masters. So its at least another year, before she is finished. But what than? I feel guilty, because I don't want to marry her, and she wants all this stuff. But she is already 30 years old. She could have found somebody else to have her dreamlife much earlier. You know, if you are 30 as a woman and you want a family, how much time do you have? First you have to find somebody, than you have to get to know him, and than you are 32, 33. I mean, sure, you can also get kids with 40 (the second wife of my father did that), but you also increase the risk of the child to be disabled or not be alive and all that stuff.

Well, I really don't know what to do... But at least its r/offmychest

thanks reddit

edit: Right now I saw my title ""Relationship is making me depressive"" and thought again about it, and no, I'm not depressive in the medical way. I know one person, who has a real depression and it is horrible. I don't want to say, that my problems are even the quietest as large as of a real depressed person. But I wanted to say with that, that I feel really really down with that whole situation, because its just such a big part of my life (and of hers). I blame the phrasing on my lack of proper english :) A smiley at the end, what a symbol to end this post...

Basically i plan everything out, then at the end of the year we have tests and such that we have to pass to graduate that year. Im doing this because it gives me some opportunities in a couple career fields that i am interested in. 

Basically, i havnt dont my school this year, i just didnt see the importance of it and was to lazy to fix anything, i had the chance around january to fix my shit and get caught up, but i let it slip through my fingers. So now i am at the point a couple days from an evaluation were someone looks at a portfolio of my work and says whether if i learned or not this year. Working my butt off i could make up a lot of the school work, and just make it probably. But i would have cheated for those grades and school work. But i would graduate so there is that. 

Or i can stop this shit now, say i havnt done it and suffer the consequences, ruin my summer but hopefully get my shit together. Ive got Chemistry, some English and math that would need to be done. I currently have 2-3 jobs/internships which i may or may not be able to keep if i do this. I dont want to loose these internships because they're an awesome learning experience and something i dont want to give up, i fucking love them. I dont want this to happen which is why im thinking of faking through it and just hopefully learning the stuff i cheated on on my own over the summer, which may or may not actually happen cuz i probably wont be able to apply myself.


There is no way i can do all the school work i am behind on in time for evaluations in a legit way. 

If i say i havnt done it best case scenario i get to keep my internships and i have till the end of July to finish the school if i can do it by then and then i graduate. If not then it looks like im going to be failing this grade and i will be the laughing stock of all my friends and i dont think i will be able to leave my house because of embarrassment. 

Or i can just fake it all graduate this grade and then what? Be stupid because i dont know chemistry and geometry? Shit i dont know what to do. Advice?? "

I was wondering if anyone had any advice for breaking into infosec. I am currently 28, and will be graduating with a computer science degree from an ABET accredited school.

I have plenty of unprofessional experience, mostly linux-based and am familiar with distros such as Kali. I have two listings on osvdb.net and in my spare time like to keep current with the latest threats and trends. I am proficient in GNU C, C++ (for windows), java, and python, though not an expert in any.

All that being said, I have no professional experience. I work for a surety company (think insurance) as an account manager, which is like a cross between underwriting and clerical support. I maintain tons of sensitive data - social security numbers, credit cards, bank statements, etc for our clients, so I'm hoping that gives me at least a nod  from a company that I do have good ethics. 

I am not sure if any of this helps any, which is why I am asking advice. I have kids to support and leaving my job for an internship is pretty much out unless I could do it over a couple weeks or so. I am not getting any younger and would like to get out of my current industry and do something I actually enjoy, now that I finally will have a degree. Would and certifications help? I know the big ones like CISSP require professional experience, putting me in a catch-22 situation.

Any advice?

26m9yf,2,2014-05-27,So this month has major ups and downs....,PattyQuake,rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/26m9yf/so_this_month_has_major_ups_and_downs/,"Hey long time lurker, never felt the need to set up an account. That is until this month... happened. I feel this may be a long one so bear with me.

I am a senior set to graduate this December. I'm in the middle of spring term when at the beginning of May I get a phone call from my mom. Now my parents and I don't talk very much, they're well off and pay for my siblings education. But they don't approve of the college I enrolled in (They wanted me to go to a closer one, I'm still in-state though), so they don't cover mine. Which is fine. I'll make my own path. So I work full-time too.

Anyway, I receive a call from my mother and she informs me that my grandpa is now on hospice care and that doctors estimate he has 6 months. Needless to say but I'm crushed. Everyone loves their grandparents and this man is no exception. The next day I go to work and the soonest time I could schedule time off was memorial weekend. So I put in time off request, so I could go and see him. the next week goes off without a hitch. I attend a career fair, get some excellent job and internship opportunities. I apply, follow up with emails, and see if I get any opportunities. I get one email back out of the probably twenty I sent out. I've gotten an interview for a software development position! I'm ecstatic and excited (I've worked in retail for the past 3 years, and I've been working min wage since I was 16, the prospect of not living paycheck to paycheck is invigorating). 

THE VERY NEXT DAY, I'm sitting on the sofa after a very long day of school and work with my gf and roommate, my mother calls me again....

My grandfather passed away. 8 days after he was placed on hospice, he was gone. And I didn't get to see him or say good-bye. 

I called in to work and told my boss I needed a day which he was perfectly fine with. I emailed my professors and informed them, they also were very understanding, for which I am so grateful. His celebration of life is May 17th.  I cancel everything and reschedule.

May 14th, I have my interview. And it could not have gone any better! I'm not done but I've progressed to the next stage which is the technical interview. I feel confident in my basic skills and the company I interviewed for is rated high and they treat their employees well, with excellent pay. It's truly exhilarating. I've been working on my BS for 5 years (23M), been paying out the nose to achieve this, and I can see the finish line. 

May 17th I get up at 5 am, jump on a plane and arrive at my destination all fine without a hitch. My dad picks me up, I ask him how everyone is doing... ""not the best, as you'll see."" We get to the place where the celebration of life is being held and I see lots of familiar faces. Smiles, and tear stained cheeks. I joined them. I mourned the loss of my grandfather. But that wasn't the painful part. 

Listening to people talk to him, listening to my mother speak about him, her memories, the pain and loss in her voice. My family was in tears. Everyone. After the ceremony we went and visited his resting place. After that weekend I've had my fill of death mausoleums and cemeteries. 

A few days later I get an email. It's from my the lady who interviewed me. She says she'd be happy to help me plan and space out these interviews to coincide with my graduation. I take it this is a good sign. very uplifting. 

May 22nd, I got let go from my job. My boss let me go because I had the lowest numbers and ""it seems that work isn't a priority"". Well no, school has always been my priority. That was never in question. But I never brought my school to work. The company I worked for is bleeding. It's a sinking ship and all the bosses know it. They come up with all these plans to somehow save the company and cutting employees is one of those ways. Why was I chosen and not someone else? I don't know, maybe my attitude changed after my interview. Maybe I got caught looking ahead.  Fortunately I  have a small amount of money saved up but it won't last for long. Now I get the fun task of finding a job to last for the remainder of my college career. 

Today, I'm sick. I didn't sleep last night. even with nightquil. My nose was so plugged I couldn't breathe. This morning took dayquil in some vain attempt to relieve my symptoms. Now I'm pretty sure it's the only thing keeping me awake.

I apologize if this is lengthy. I needed to rant. thanks for listening.

TL;DR grandpa died -&gt; had great interview with greater feedback -&gt; celebration of life is easily one of the most painful experiences ever-&gt; poised to have a job straight out of college-&gt; lost current job-&gt; SICK AS FUCK. 

Have a good day."

I'm a 22 year old student majoring in computer science, I play sports (lacrosse/tennis), and I'm diagnosed ADHD. My parents barely drink, my maternal grandparents are both alcoholics, and my maternal grandfather is diagnosed bippolar on top of that. I however, drink often. It has affected me greatly since I began college 4 years ago.

All of my life I have been praised for my intelligence. I went to college on an academic scholarship from my ACT score, and essentially partied it away. Since then, I've only had one semester of college that could really be considered *good* grade wise. Before the ""good"" semester, I was at a lacrosse party and blacked out. I blacked in on a curb talking to a police officer, with a large bump on my head. One 600 dollar ambulance ride later I woke up in the hospital. I spent that entire semester sober until my 21st birthday (~75 days). 

Since then, I've gained about 30 lbs of excess weight(200 to 230, I'm 6'). I drink 4-5 days a week, for some strange fear that I'm not going to be able to sleep. Even though my parents and SO know that I drink, I often hide from, drinking in my room or attempting to talk to my SO on the phone and claim (I'm a shitty liar) that I haven't been drinking. 

I have spent time sober in the past, and I understand how successful I was then. I am just having trouble making that final push into abstaining from alcohol in general. I am living at home in an internship right now. I do have a problem with free time - it is for sure one of my triggers. 

Any advice would be appreciated. "

Let me explain you my plan before you think that I'm implying that being a Game Developer is easy.

I'm from Brazil, and currently I have a pretty busy routine. I'm finishing my Bachelor Degree in Business Administration, will be concluding it by July 2015; At the same time I'm cursing a Two-year career college in Game Development, which will also be finishing in July 2015; I'm also working at two jobs, one Internship in the International Trade of an Import/Export company and as part-time Business Consultant for the Building Company of my family (Believe me it's the hardest one of them all!)

In two-year career college they are giving the Jack-of-All-Trades deal; We are learning 3D Modelling/Animation in Maya, Texture and Concept Art on the Photoshop(with NDO for Texture), Basic of C++ Programming aimed at game development, and we are learning the ins and outs of UDK(Probably will be changing to UE 4 soon); It’s a pretty solid course and there is plenty of subjects that I haven’t started(Audio, Debugging,…), it’s considered one of the bests here in Brazil and I’m pretty satisfied with it. Specially because I’ve been selected as a Texturer for a commercial project by the school itself. In my spare time I’ve also learned the basics of Good GDD elaboration (Business Administration is so similar to this you wouldn’t believe it) and I’ve been doing small tutorials in Unity(Pong, Brick Breaker, Mine Field,…)

Anyway, my goal right now is to gather enough money so I can take one year vacation, after I finish my colleges, where I will be only focusing on making my games. I’ve made a pretty decent personal finance calculator and I’ve established the amount of money needed for my personal living.

Now, I need you guys help me to estipulate the costs of working  as a self-funded Indie developer, in order that by the end of that period I can have my first published game.

Here some things I’ve already decided:

-	I will not make it alone, and have found one other partner who is willing to the same plan, so every cost will be split between us
-	We will be using UE 4, since is the Engine where I have more experience and seems as the better for option for the kind of game we want to make
(USD 19,00/month * 12 = USD 228,00)
-	We will be buying Ikinema license to substantially diminish the Time spent in Animating and Rigging
(USD 19,00/month * 12 = USD 228,00)
-	We will be buying the Quixel Suite, in order to have access to the MegaScans technology
(USD 249,00 Indie License)
-	We will be using ZBrush and Adobe Photoshop to 3D Modelling, Texture and other arts; It’s the more logical since I can get them free
-	We won’t have any expenses with location, internet and energy; Since I’ve already managed a sweet deal to use a friends office during the nighttime until the early hours, and I have second location, internet and energy with zero expenses as well in the bag, just in case something happens.
-	We already have work capable machines that we will move in the location as soon as we start, but I’m considering at least another five hundred bucks for maintenance, and that’s very optimist because he has some contacts in the Hardware department.

That’s what I have so far. I’m working on the marketing money and thinking the options we have, it’s what scares me the most because we won’t be able to be attending Indie events on other countries so easily. We are also deciding on three finalists GDDs that we have created; one as First-Person Arena combine with puzzle solution, the second one is a turn-based procedural generated urban post-pandemic survival and the third is an Open-world third-person story driven adventure. As you can see they are very ambitious projects, and one my current thoughts is to lower my goal to have a published goal by the end, to be able to make a playable prototype so we can get a pledge fund, be it private or public.

What your opinion? Are there in other costs that I’m not seeing? I’m doing something wrong? 
Please help us plan this dream of ours, so we can truly achieve it."

[Did you ever have a case where children clearly should not have been removed from household in the first place? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26lqzk/as_long_as_its_topical_i_am_an_attorney_who/chs9wb6?context=5)|All the time. The state has an obligation to try to offer services before they attempt to remove a child. That is one of my biggest arguments at the 72-hour pick up hearing - leave the kid in the house, let the parent comply with services, and keep an eye on the situation.
 |Probably the worst cases where there shouldn't be removal are with medical neglect cases. Kids have complicated medical needs, and social workers aren't always the best at identifying when there was issues. One kid of a client reportedly had scabies, but they were at the doctor two days before the removal and the doctor didn't note it. But the kid was removed anyway even though they had been getting on-going medical care for her. 
[What's the worst parenting job you've ever seen? Also, have you ever seen such an unfair trial that you were upset by it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26lqzk/as_long_as_its_topical_i_am_an_attorney_who/chs7l1r?context=5)|Hmmm... tough to say. I think some of the worst have been people who live in houses with tons of people running around, doing drugs, and making drama are pretty situations to figure out are unsafe. One family was grandparents with adult children and other children. The adult children had kids. Everyone was doing meth together. Every kid in that house, regardless of parent, got removed.
 |Having 13 kids is rough, too. Pretty impossible to parent that many kids in a city and being in poverty.
 |But probably the worst was a delusional schitzophrenic. The kid was almost ten, couldn't do buttons or a zipper, and was convinced his mom was a terrorist. Like a real terrorist.
 |As for trials, you'd be surprised how few the issues are contested and trials happen. But I lost one and the decision was basically because my guy hadn't parented before. I thought ""you can say that about any first time parent!!""
[Could you elaborate on that one ? It seems abviously idiotic to render a decision based on that argument.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26lqzk/as_long_as_its_topical_i_am_an_attorney_who/chseoya?context=5)|The case is on appeal right now, so we will see what a higher court has to say!
 |The problem was that this case went to trial and the state did a terrible job proving its case. There were allegations my client had other issues - for example, the mother said that they did drugs together.
 |Rules of evidence applied at the trial and I used that to my advantage. The only witnesses called were my client (no 5th amendment rights like in criminal cases because it is a civil, not criminal, proceeding) and the social worker. I knew the social worker hadn't done any work on the case and would be near worthless.
 |So the only testimony that meant anything was what my guy said on the stand. He didn't admit to having any issues.
 |But the judge knew there were other allegations and didn't feel comfortable, in her gut, to place a baby girl with a middle age dude who chopped wood for a living that she knew nothing about. So, she made her decision on what she wanted and tried to work through the evidence to get there.
 |But the state put on such a bad case that she had to make a very weak decision. 
[I was removed from my mother twice and placed into the Washington State foster care system. Each time I was removed, it was due to her drug addiction and neglectful qualities that often are associated with addiction. My mother wasn't present in my twin brother and my life much. I can remember times when we were both much younger, that she was around and very cheerful and loving. However, once she started doing meth and drinking very regularly, she hardly had the ability to care for us appropriately.  The first time we were removed from her care, it was due to her inability to care for us while visiting a local lake. She was drinking and drugging with her friends while my brother and I did our own thing. At age five, this wasn't a very good thing. I remember one of her friends, most likely on drugs, swinging me around in circles by my hands and dislocating my shoulder. My mother was so high and drunk, that another person enjoying their time at the lake grew concerned and offered to let us spend the night. This woman claimed she was a friend of my mother's sister, but I guess anything can be believable while intoxicated. My mother allowed it and long story short, the woman took us to her home, fed us, bathed us, and allowed us to play video games. Once we fell asleep, the woman called the police who came and took us to a foster home.  This foster home, in my opinion, was very mentally abusive. They had their own children (no harm in that\), but they clearly treated their foster children very differently in the ways they fed, punished, etc. Having been without food, many times that I could remember, my brother and I would hoard food. Rather than allow us to eat more during meal times, they would lock us in our bedroom at night and even went so far as to place an alarm on our door if we were to get it open. This made my brother and I have to find other ways to relieve ourselves when it came to going to the bathroom. We'd poop out the window and pee in the corner of the bedroom, which we were severely punished for, even spanked to the point where we developed bruises on our backsides. Long story short, we were in this family's care for three or four months while my mother got her act together. Once my mother was deemed as a fit parent again, we were released back into her care, though, the care she provided was not much better than the foster family we were placed with.  My brother and I lived with my mother again for the next four years. In that time, my mom had two more children. The first, being my oldest sister. There was a custody battle between her father and my mother, resulting in the father taking custody of the child. To make matters worse, my mother decided it would be good idea to have another child with the same man, who before took custody of my sister, her father.  My brother and I were eight when my youngest sister was born. My mother, never being around, basically left us to care for her. We changed her diapers, dispensed her cystic fibrosis medications and treatments, fed her, etc. My brother and I would go door to door asking to do chores to make money to buy the diapers and formula. The pharmacy would allow us to pick up her medications. Taking care of anybody with cystic fibrosis is very tough, let alone children. We often missed school because my mother was never around to care for my sister. Going to school would mean my infant sister was all alone at home and we couldn't let that happen.  One morning, my grandmother wrapped a belt around my neck and tried to choke me because I took a slice of bread from the kitchen. I ran away for the day and came back later that evening only to find her vehicle not there. I snuck inside through a window and began making myself something to eat and of course, my grandma comes home. She comes in screaming and yelling at me, asking me where I've been. I start running towards the phone to call the police and she takes a sharp knife from the kitchen and begins to chase me. I carried the phone with me as long as I could until the cord couldn't reach anymore. She cut the damn phone line. Luckily, she had another line in her closet, which she connected and proceeded to call the police herself, on me. She claimed I was crazy. The officers, having been to her property before, knew she was a little off so they took me into custody and put me into a group home. My brother was on a fishing trip with my cousin, so lucky for him, he wasn't home at the time of the incident. Unlucky for him, after telling the police he was gone but would be coming back, the police did nothing. My brother was placed into foster care six months later only after my grandmother beat him in the head with a cast iron fireplace shovel.  My brother and I aged out of the foster care system after living with three separate families and a couple of different group homes. Long story short, I had never met my biological father at that point though he was paying court ordered child support the entire time. He had his own family, now has two children of his own, a beautiful house, is very well off, in perspective.  My brother and I aged out of the foster care system.  I guess my question is, is why do you think my brother and I never placed with my biological father, although he knew we existed and paid child support? He didn't have issues with drugs or alcohol and had his ducks in a row. Can a biological father, who has no interest in his kids, just allow them to be wards of the state though he would be perfectly capable of caring for them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26lqzk/as_long_as_its_topical_i_am_an_attorney_who/chsdgsa?context=5)|I'm sorry to hear about what you went through... I can't imagine life as a foster child in relatively stable homes, let alone in the mess you and your brother had to go through. Even though my job is to represent parents, I often find myself talking to clients about what we can advocate for their children for their best interest.  There is no easy answer for why your bio-dad was not involved. That is a question for him. If you were aging out of the system, you likely had a hand in what was going on and at least a little aware of what your bio-dad was doing to regain custody. In other words, I'm sure you remember if he was making motions or requesting placement. It doesn't sound like he was.  The most likely answer was that he did not want to get involved, as terrible as that may sound or as hard as it may be. It sounds like he had his family and didn't want to reach out for your brother and you. The state cannot force a parent to take custody of their children. If a parent admits they are not a parenting resource for any reason, good or bad, the most the state can do is offer some sort of service to help them get there. If they aren't interested in that, there is little or nothing else they can do.

 |But most are pretty valid. The line is usually where children should be removed or not. A lot of the time, the argument is ""keep these kids in the home, make a safety plan, have the parents engage in corrective services, and see what happens."" The issue isn't that the allegations are bogus (most of the time) - it is that removal from the home is a much more drastic remedy then is necessary.
 |The problem is that most removals happen *ex parte*, or without a parent having a right to respond to until after the pick-up happens. And once a child is removed, it becomes much harder to put them back.

(no pun intended).
[You have mentioned that an alternate guardian should have no prior relevant cps history. Does ""history"" include being a ward of cps? For example, I currently lead a stable life with my wife. Aside from the prior history outlined in my previous post, does this exempt myself from providing care for other family members?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26lqzk/as_long_as_its_topical_i_am_an_attorney_who/chssoml?context=5)|I can't speak for Canada or other jurisdictions, but in my county, it depends on a lot of factors.

When I first came into this, parents, regardless of their issue of the child's age, would get two hours of supervised visitation of week. If someone physically abused there 13 year old, two hours per week. If a mother was a serious victim of domestic violence and was too afraid or not yet ready to leave her abuser, and spent every waking hour with her 15 month old daughter, it was two hours per week.  This was supposedly based on budge constraints by the state (they have to pay for supervision). But they had no proof of it, and they could pay for expensive evaluations from psychologists which did little but push their own agenda. I worked to get parents more visits, and now have moved our county to a whopping four hours per week average.  The other one was a trial I did recently. The state wrote my client off a long time ago. They have an obligation to provide her with corrective services, and they barely tried. Then they tried to terminate her parental rights, and I got a pretty good victory with that case.
[Ideally, I'd like to hear a story about total bullshit and complete tomfoolery, but I'll settle for less.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26lqzk/as_long_as_its_topical_i_am_an_attorney_who/chs979f?context=5)|Oh, boy. There are so many. I was shocked when I first started doing the work. I think one of the biggest shockers was relative placement issues. When kids first come into care, the preference is for them to be with relatives, usually grandparents, but it can range to cousins and far out.  But the state has a list of things that disqualify people. If someone has a shoplifting charge from like 10 years ago, the state can't put them as a relative placement. The judge can order it, and does sometimes, but very often doesn't go against the state.

[*two hours of supervised visitation of week... This was supposedly based on budge constraints by the state (they have to pay for supervision\).*  Interesting.

Not every single person needs a psychological evaluation. Second, decrease the extent of supervision. Not every one needs supervised visits (eyes on/ears on the entire time). If someone has a drug problem and thats it, monitored (checking in every few minutes) is fine. Its pretty unlikely they will pull out and use their drugs right there unless they are in a reaaallly bad position. And these people's only danger issue is drug use, not even abuse or neglect.  They aren't in a better position to do it. They have to take care of the kid, make sure the placement is funded and appropriate, provide the parents with services, provide on-going case support, provide visitation, pay for attorneys. And that is starters. It takes a TON of resources to ""prosecute"" or file one of these cases, whatever you want to call it.
[Ahh!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26lqzk/as_long_as_its_topical_i_am_an_attorney_who/chsbefq?context=5)|Maybe. Its hard to ""regulate"" these situations - each is incredibly case specific. And you can take ten judges and ten social workers and have twenty opinions.

 |I have had parents get kids back after physical abuse. Either you prove that the allegation isn't true, or it is and the person engages in services. Anger management, domestic violence treatment, more serious mental health counseling, drug and alcohol treatment, parenting classes, or any combination of those. Once they show they are committed to making a change in their life, you start to move slowly back towards reunification with less restrictive visitation and movement towards a full return home. They have to prove themselves to be safe and appropriate at each level of supervision.
 |None for me after sexual abuse. If sexual abuse is proven, there often will be criminal charges, and a lot of the time the person can end up going to jail or prison for a long enough time to make them not relevant to getting their kid back (for reasons more complicated than I am going to get into, parents have about 1-2.5 years to show they fixed there problems). It would be up to the other parent to show they can be safe. If its not proven, it is a contested issue and makes it complicated. The parent needs experts to sign off that they are safe.

I want to take it with me into the after life, and you are the only people I can trust. When my casket goes down in the ground, you'll need to put your share in there with me.""
 |At the funeral, each places their sum in the casket. At the reception, the three are talking. The priest breaks down and says ""I'm sorry! I have to admit something. I didn't think I was fair for him to keep all his money. I have been building an orphanage in the inner city, and it desperately needed money, so I took $200,000 out of my share to pay for it. I feel terrible, but the money shouldn't just sit in the ground with him!""
 |The doctor says ""oh thank god you said something. I have been feeling so awful. I took $400,000 and put it into an inner city medical clinic I have been working on. It where that money really belongs, but it has been eating at me!""
 |The lawyer looks at the two others with disgust and says ""I can't believe the audacity of you two. I placed a personal check in there with him for the entire amount!""

[*But in order for foster parents to adopt, you need to prove that there are current parental deficiencies and they haven't been fixed.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26lqzk/as_long_as_its_topical_i_am_an_attorney_who/chsbtd7?context=5)|In my jurisdiction, evidence rules only loosely apply in motions and non-trial hearings. The other side can talk about bond with foster parents all they want. But if a parent doesn't have issues anymore, the other sides will need to FIND an issue if they don't want the kid returned. And they do that all the time. They nitpick on issues that aren't big deals (a parent needs to be minimally adequate, essentially a D grade) so they can get what they want and keep the kid there. That is infuriating.  At trial, evidence rules applies. A foster parent's bond, at least to me, would be irrelevant to the issue of termination and whether a parent has corrected or can soon correct their deficiencies. It is only relevant to the issue that continuation of a parent/child relationship hurts a child's chance for permanence. But even there, only the existence of a potentially adoptive home is important, not how great that home is. I would fight hard to make sure that material was not part of the record. 
[Legally this is true, but I have seen some astoundingly liberal interpretations of that, especially when healthy infants and toddlers are involved.  What about the experts testifying about bonding with the foster parents?  I have seen that referenced in many decisions.  This is totally irrelevant to whether or not the bio-parents are fit, which should be the only issue.  Have you ever tried to exclude that testimony on relevancy grounds?  What was the result?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26lqzk/as_long_as_its_topical_i_am_an_attorney_who/chsbtd7?context=5)|The issue where I can picture this being most problematic would be with a relative placement. For example, a client wants their child placed with a grandparent. The state and/or CASA would come in a say ""this child has been with these foster parents since birth and is very bonded to them and should not be removed."" The parent would say ""the grandparent has known the child for a long time and is a suitable placement, and its family.""
[Are the foster care homes really that bad as they are portrayed in movies and on TV ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26lqzk/as_long_as_its_topical_i_am_an_attorney_who/chs7qgs?context=5)|Depends. You'd be surprised how little I know about the homes. Its not even that common for me to even meet my client's kids. And there are lots of laws protecting foster care confidentiality.
 |That being said, there are some horror stories. Lots of good ones, too, though. In my experience, what is overlooked is not the foster parents - they go through rigorous tests. What is over looked is the other kids in the home. Those are the ones who are more apt for sexualized or dangerous behavior.
 |But there are bad foster parents, too. We just got a tape of one saying she would ""fucking beat the shit"" out of this kid if he were her child.

Thats a better question for someone who works more directly with the kids, like the social worker. Like I said in another answer, I barely see my client's kids.
 |But its earlier than you would probably think. Kids are sharp. One time, a social worker came up to me to talk about an inactive, not participating parent. She said the kid, who was almost 5, said ""I think I know what I did wrong now... I think I know what I have to fix to be back with mommy again.""
 |So as much as they try to shield kids, they know.

A public defender, or an attorney who represents indigent clients by appointment of the court. If you can afford an attorney, you can hire a private criminal attorney at your own expense.  In this field, it is hard to find an attorney who specializes specifically in children being removed from care. Most are due to mental illness and drugs. It is rare that a person can afford an attorney at all. And because these cases can be multiple years long, practically no one can afford it.  In other words, while a private criminal attorney may have the expertise to defend you in a criminal case, you will be hard pressed to find a parent's representative attorney in the private field who has worthwhile experience. You might be able to get a private criminal or family law attorney, but they won't be familiar with the judges or the state's attorney.  You want to have someone who knows the field, and the only people who do are the attorney's appointed to indigent defense. 
 |Both have advantages and disadvantages. A public defender probably deals with your type of case all the time. They know the prosecutors personally and deal with them all the time. They know the judges and how they make decisions. But, generally, they have a high case load and cannot devote as much time to each individual as a person might like.  A private attorney likely does less cases than a public defender. They generally specialize in one area, usually DUIs or maybe DV, where their typical clientele may have money. They likely deal with the prosecutors and judges not nearly as much as a public defender. But they will be able to provide you more time than a public defender and may have more opportunities to present time-consuming issues and motions.

 |#1 Don't forget why you got into it. Don't stop giving a shit about the people and their families. Don't drink the kool-aid if you get into an environment that talks down clients and people; work to change it. But at the same time, don't get burnt out. Some of the best social workers want to help out so much they can't do anything after 6 months because they put way too much time in.
 |#2 Don't stop trying to change things. Yes, the system is what it is and we need to work within it, but we all know there are issues that probably can be dealt with more efficiently. Just because you get back the bureaucratic push back doesn't mean you should stop trying to change things when you believe it is right.
 |#3 Talk to people and get the issues out there. It is very sexy to say ""I care about foster kids"" and all that, but most people don't know what actually goes on. Social workers are overworked, and in my state, they won't even give them over time. These cases stagnate (see some of the other answers) because social workers have too much stuff to do. If people really cared that much, there would be more support to help move things along for kids as quickly as possible.

One kid can have - the state attorney, the social worker, a CASA, the CASA's attorney, a kid's attorney, a mom's attorney, and potentially multiple attorneys for dads if paternity is not established for any one father. Add in multiple kids with multiple dads and it gets more complicated. Imagine my case with 13 kids in it!

Where I work, the state's attorney has the most cases, but has the help of the social worker to keep there stuff organized. It may seem hard in court, but you know what cases will be on which days and you prep for that day. And even if you don't know 100% what will happen in a given case, you usually know pretty well based on the judge or the other parties. Just like you said - the course of the case is kind of known.

It really bothers me when any party, or even a judge, isn't respectful. Yes, a lot of them have done bad, even terrible things, but they are still people.

Like you said, we generally know the course of the case. Getting a parent to admit they aren't going to win is a difficult and long road. It takes finesse to convince them what the outcome will be and what the right thing to do is. But, there are parents who have made steps and should be changing the course of the case. And they need a good advocate to help try to re navigate the ship.

 |Another was where the kid, a little girl, was molested in care. I wanted her to go back to her mom so bad. I would lose sleep. But her mom's termination trial had come up, and even though she was doing way better, it wasn't enough just quite yet and she would have lost. We had to convince her to relinquish her parental rights to get an open adoption agreement. It was rough. 
[Have you ever handled a case where the parents were seperated, and one was clearly ""fit"" but the child still went into the system?  If so, could you explain why that might happen?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26lqzk/as_long_as_its_topical_i_am_an_attorney_who/chsdcwd?context=5)|All the time. On both sides (fit and unfit parent).
 |Theoretically speaking, the fit parent should get the kid at the outset. In our jurisdiction, the court and the state stick around to assist the fit parent in obtaining a protective parenting plan from the unfit parent.
 |Practically speaking, dads get screwed a lot. A lot of the time, there is a very unstable, unsafe mother, and a father who isn't around a whole ton. This could be because they don't have enough time and are deadbeats, or it can also be because the mother kept the kid away from the dad. Even though the state makes no allegations against the dad, the kid gets removed anyway and placed in care. Its very frustrating from my point of view as an attorney - how do I fight allegations of unfitness when there aren't any? And it puts me in a position where I have to prove fitness. In other words, practically speaking, the burden gets shifted for me to prove the guy is fit.
 |The same happens for women, too, but not as much. It is much easier to get a child placed with a mother when there are no real allegations than the father.
 |Why does it happen? Because these are cases that involve children. You can find dirt on any parent, anyone, if you want it. And often times, the state makes no allegations one way or the other - good or bad. And in an abundance of caution, albeit a completely unfair one, judges remove the children to give the state more time to investigate the presumably fit parent. (Note that presumption is a legal term - any parent is preemptively fit until proven otherwise.)

26mlgz,2,2014-05-27,"New York for 6 months as an intern from the UK, aged 28 - advice needed.",LNDtoNYCviaDoubt,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/26mlgz/new_york_for_6_months_as_an_intern_from_the_uk/,"Hello there.

Where to start.

I am a 28 yr old (f) living in London. I'm from London and have lived here for most of my life. I currently live alone in a very little studio flat almost bang in the middle of the city. Without wanting to get into it, as that's not what this sub is for, I lived with someone for 7 years until one day they left. So since then, I have been here sort of trying to figure things out and in some ways start again.


I work for an arts and culture publisher. I joined the company about four and a half years ago and via a graduate trainee scheme. At the time I earned about £12k and having worked my around a few departments (I can't really say I've worked my way up) I now earn nearer £20k. It's not been the easiest place to work and during the two winters before last I was working until 9pm many nights, in line with perfectionism of the company and the working culture there. It can be very negative. People will always point out what's gone wrong/artistic temperaments etc. So, having been there for a long time now and in some ways having never quite established myself (I've always been an assistant, in editorial and in digital) I have been starting to feel the need to get out.


I don't have a huge amount of confidence and faith in myself and often feel I don't deserve things/am worthy of things. That's one reason why I still live in this tiny room, I think (and yes, I have had therapy in the past and depression has been with me most of my life). Since the loss of that relationship, I have continually blamed myself, no matter what anyone tells me.


However, living alone has helped me in a lot of ways. During particularly good periods, I have done a LOT more - I don't own a television any more, I go to talks, I take photos, I started learning a new instrument, I read. I'm very good at going to things alone (music/cinema/openings) and have now travelled alone to quite a few places in Europe (and loved this feeling, for the most part).


So I had been considering a move to Berlin as I speak a bit of the language (and would love to learn), I spent a very happy time there 18 months ago, it's an arty city, it's relaxed, it's full of history, I just sort of took to it. Thing is, lots of other people of my demographic also want to move there so it's not really quite as simple as that. You also really do need to be fluent in German.


This year I applied for some good jobs that I wanted in the UK. In two instances I was told I was down to to final two, with no bad feedback but that 'someone more suitable was found' etc. I also applied for a couple of things in Berlin, but no joy.


Something else I applied for was an intern programme at a US arts foundation. I had a Skype interview. I had a further phone chat. I was then offered a place.


However, they had their initial doubts as to why I was applying, given my age and the fact that I already have experience. For anyone familiar with J1 Visas, they could have me on a Professional Training visa, rather than an intern visa. They find me an attractive candidate because of my experience but worry I would be bored. Other participants in the programme tend to be (though not *always) around 23/just finished school or finished with a little experience.


My answer was that I have never had the experience of moving to a new city, that being in New York for six months would be great in terms of personal development and that it is an opportunity I might not get again.


So. I could do this. It would mean using my savings and investing a lot but I could do it.


So why am I scared? Why am I wondering if I should go to Berlin? (which may just be a pie in the sky idea.) I am scared that because of my age I will be the 'weird older one' to others there or will struggle to connect. I am worried that the fact I have experience gives the impression that I know how to do lots of things - not really. As explained above, I've been somewhere a while but don't believe I've made a good impression or have lots to show for myself.


I have been to New York before (once) and obviously know what a cultured, exciting, insane place it is. I fear I won't be able to keep up and that everyone will be wildly ambitious and dynamic (especially if I am with 23 yr olds). Is the culture of the city just too much? (I'm someone with a love of the calmness and lack of population in Scandinavian countries [my favourite place in the world is Iceland] but also someone who often draws energy from the 'challenge' of London.)


But to do it would be a way to break a cycle, perhaps, of 2 and half years spent feeling very lost in a city I love but which is currently weight down by many ghosts.


I'm scared I will never find anywhere to live, that for all my 'being good at travelling alone', giving to live abroad is something quite different. I'm worried that I have bluffed my way into this offer and neither I am quite the candidate they think I am and they aren't quite the opportunity I hope they are. But if I didn't do it, is that a bigger failing?


Reddit, does they seem like something I have haphazardly engineered or a genuine chance? Or could one turn into the other? Has anyone moved to NYC in a similar way? Any UK redittors who have spent a good chunk of time in the city?

Apologies for not explaining that too well, I can try and answer questions about any of the murky bits.

26msic,9,2014-05-27,Just Need To Be Honest With Someone,[deleted],OpiatesRecovery,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpiatesRecovery/comments/26msic/just_need_to_be_honest_with_someone/,"I first used opiates recreationally in college.  I don't remember a first time specifically but I'm sure someone gave me a Vicodin or Codeine or something like that.  I smoked pot in high school and tried psychedelics and ecstasy, but steered clear of anything harder.  By the time I was in my sophomore year of college I was mostly in to working and traveling.  I would use drugs if someone offered, sometimes I would drink, but that was about it.  I was a stripper, and I only cared about making money.  I didn't focus on a career, although I did enjoy learning.  I figured I would get married and a man would take care of me.  That's the kind of mentality stripping breeds.  When I got out of college I had no plan, an although I had a few successful internships and some promising starts, I didn't really have a clear goal, and I fell in with a group of people who loved cocaine.  I felt superior to them because I never used, although I had recently become friends with a CNA who had access to all kinds of pills.  That's when my love affair with those started, almost by accident.  Then I tried Oxy, and a friend did some heroin with me.  I loved money more than drugs so was unwilling to buy much of anything, and after moving to a new town for a fresh start I pretty much quit using pills but I never forgot how good they felt.  I think I just didn't have access and didn't hang out with people who offered them to me.  Over those years I did heroin a few times when it presented itself, or pills.  I started dating a man who was very abusive, and by that time I was using pills whenever they were available, and buying them.  I would use only at night, or only after my work was done for the day.  I even got a Master's Degree during this time.  But then during that horrible relationship I got injured, and got a heavy prescription for Norco.  I eventually used as soon as I woke up, all day, every day.  It kept me sane.  During that time I managed to break up with my abusive boyfriend and move back to my hometown, where I met my future husband, who had never used drugs and is without a doubt the most amazing, kind, caring and decent person I have ever met in my life.  But I had a problem by then.  I used Norco all the time, and needed it, suffering withdrawal symptoms when I couldn't get a refill.  I had to switch doctors when I moved away and I was honest with the new doctor, telling her I had been taking this drug full time for almost two years and needed her to taper me off of it.  She refused to write a prescription and said I was not withdrawing.  I tried another doctor.  She said the same thing.  At that point I was buying pills on the black market but when those ran out I could only find heroin and slowly over a few months I began to use that, and a lot of it eventually.  I smoked it, but probably would have shot if I knew how.  I hid this all from my boyfriend at the time, and we even got married during that year.  I was high at our wedding, or by that time I would just say I was normal, because I needed it to feel normal.  Eventually he noticed that there were days when I was sick, when I couldn't get the drug, and finally he confronted me and I was honest.  This was a very emotional time, and I kept using, constantly.  One time we went away for three days and I was sick the whole time.  As soon as we got home I used.  When I was high I felt like quitting would be no big deal, when I wasn't I felt like getting high was no big deal.  We were moving to a place I knew no one, and I figured I would quit then.  He said he would get me help then.  We moved.  I withdrew.  Lasted a week, then got a doctor to give me morphine pills.  They didn't really get me high, but kept the edge off.  Then I met someone over the internet who could get heroin.  And I got some.  My husband noticed but I kept lying and keep lying now.  He cut off my access from money, giving me only a credit card so he could keep track of how I was spending.  When we had to go home for a visit, the first thing I did was spend the cash I had on dope.  Enough to keep me high for weeks.  Then I ran out.  And withdrew again.  I bought more but my connection in out new town was horrible.  I want to be high, I want to be sober.  I love my husband but I think he only loves me high and just doesn't realize it.  I feel terrible for what I've done to such a wonderful man.  He says he misses the happy me, and once when he was angry at me for using and lying to him he asked me how I could do what I did to him, how I could have married him without telling him about my problem, he said he felt like I didn't love him when I acted like that.  At this point the only the keeping me sober is my access to drugs, nothing more.  I would pop a pill in a second if I could get a doctor to give me some.  I'm afraid.  And I feel like my husband wants me gone, but is to decent to admit it.  And I feel like I'm a horrible person if I stay.  Losing him is not worth the high, but I cry all the time, I'm anxious, and I'm making him miserable I think.  This post is horribly long.  Sorry for that, I just need some help.  I don't want to quit, I want to want to quit, if that makes sense.  I don't know how to want to be sober."

In my first 6 months, I had already shipped apps in Rails, PHP (with Slim and Twig), and iOS. So, there's an immense amount of exposure to different popular (and thus highly marketable) skills and technologies. And autonomy and experimentation are valued and protected, so there's a _very_ good chance that list of technologies will grow with our whims. And we will definitely keep up with modern technologies as they come out and become viable for us.

We have some of the hardest workers and most talented people I've ever met, but we have a lot of fun too. We grill during Cardinals day games and enjoy various festivities on a regular basis. The people are all friendly and the work environment is laid back, yet professional.

Throwaway on the off chance my employer uses reddit.

Alright so heres the situation I'm in. For the last six months (since december) I have been working at a very small (2 employees) fiber optic fabrication facility. It is just myself and the senior engineer. The place I work is based in the east coast though and the owner of the facility lives on the west coast.

The facility is a small fiber optic manufacturing business that attempts to make fiber that can be used in high power lasers. However, the company is a bit of a shitshow having gone from 10 employees when the current owner purchased it in 2001 to just the one senior engineer prior to my hiring.

There is obvious friction between the owner and the senior engineer, the owner requires us to work in some pretty awful conditions (no disposal of waste chemicals, refusal to pay for repairs of equipment, hasn't given the engineer a raise since he started working here 7 years ago, etc.). 

Now this might be somewhat palatable if the company showed progress at all, but not a single sale of fiber has been made in the companies existence, the owner in constantly wanting to jump from one process to the next and expects us to solve issues in weeks that the large fiber companies spend years and $$$$ on when he refuses to buy separate tubing so that we don't cross contaminate our preforms with the different dopants we use.


Anyways for the past month and a half or so, the owner has been pushing me really really hard towards being able to run all the processes on my own. Which includes an MCVD lathe, Fiber draw tower, RIP analyzer, SAP analyzer, and fiber concentricity analyzer. On top of all this he wants me to research and understand (at a PhD level) the theory behind rare-earthed dope fibers so that I can solve the problems and develop his million dollar fiber for him.

On top of this each day he expects a daily report accounting for all of my time in 30 minute increments along with a work plan for the next day in 30 minute increments for both myself and the senior engineer. Along with determining daily,weekly,monthly goals for both myself and the company.

Did I mention that I only get paid $12.50 an hour?

He has a number of times mentioned to me that he wants me to be able to run the facility by myself if it came to it, and be able to train any additional employee that he hires. Giving me the impression that he intends on letting go the senior engineer and expects me to carry on at a fraction of the price.

Now I can run all of these machines at a basic level think I can push all the buttons and watch everything happen and understand what all is going on, but if anything were to go wrong I'd be fucked as far as troubleshooting is concerned.

I really enjoy working with the senior engineer and I don't want to give the owner the impression that he can just fire the guy and that I'll be able to take over no problem.

Right now I'm in the process of trying to negotiate my summer wage, I'm pushing for $20 an hour since I'm basically a full blown engineer at this point but that's beside the point.

So now that you have a little bit on the background of where I'm working here's my question: 

Should I just suck it up and keep working here for the summer/my senior school year for the experience/resume padding, at the expense of my sanity, or should I just go home, coach sports/bag groceries/whatever I can get for the summer?

Would going from being an ""engineer"" to doing something else for the summer hurt my resume?

TL;DR Internship has turned into an extremely stressful and unsatisfactory work environment due to owner having unrealistic expectations and demands, is it worth it to suck it up and stick it out for that sweet resume padding"

This last year I was searching for a summer internship and did not get anything. Instead I interviewed with a bank to be a summer floating teller. I did this because I thought it would look good to have something else on my resume that other than working for my family business for the past 7 years.

My dilemma: I absolutely hate it already! It has only been a few weeks and I am technically still training but I can not stand this job. I thought it would be good to try the banking industry because it could open doors for me in the future but I can already say with confidence that I do not want to work in any sort of bank setting in my future. I would really like to just say hell with it and quit and just go back to working for the family (where I also make more money) but there are a few things holding me back.

1.) A family members good friend who is high up in the bank put in a good word for me to get the ""summer help teller"" position.

2.) It is probably ethically wrong for me to waste their time and money from the training I have already received.

3.) I don't want to be the type of person who quits something they just started. That also looks bad.

..But on the other hand, I rather be happy than miserable all week at a job that I can not stand. And I also plan on never working in a bank after this.

When I first met her, i was doing an internship at a local engineering firm and life was pretty fantastic for me, and for her as well. As time went on, I returned to school to finish my final year, she took courses to up her marks for med school. I graduated, and then we went travelling for a couple months around the world, and since then I have been looking for a job related to my degree but haven't had any luck.

Now, the job search has decreased my morale and motivation, and can make me very upset when I see my friends around me getting jobs that I didn't and all that. But, I would associate that with me, myself and I, and no one else.

However, lately, because it has been getting me down (having taking night shifts doing general labour jobs on top of a part time sales job, all while not getting any reponses from my engineering job search), my girlfriend is starting to believe that since we started dating, that she is causing the bad luck that is happening in my life. I've had some bad moments in the past year in particular; job rejections, lots of car malfunctions, night shifts messing up my sleeping pattern and when i'm actually 'awake', running low on funds (therefore, not really hanging out with friends). However, lately, she keeps bringing up the fact that it's probably all her fault, and that I should leave her because she can't do anything for me.

Now, I'm fairly independent, and am very used to being sheltered and kind of having a cynical view of the world. I've grown up believing that I can't expect help from anyone, or shouldn't ask for help ever. I'm not sure if I'm making her feel useless because when she asks how she can help, I usually respond ""dont worry about it"" or ""nothing, it's not your responsibility"" etc etc.

So, anyways, I guess thats the gist of it. How can I let her know that it's not her fault and that I think her ""I'm a bad luck item"" idea is bs?

Thanks, and hope to hear some responses soon!

26ngu0,0,2014-05-27,What should I be learning this summer?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/26ngu0/what_should_i_be_learning_this_summer/,"Hey guys, I just recently finished up the freshman year of my Computer Science degree, and now I really wanna prepare myself for the internship search in the fall. What are the key things that I should be learning/making this summer to increase my knowledge and impress employers?

So far I've:

- Made a bunch of applets and other stuff in Java

- Made a pretty fleshed-out Flash game

- Made a small personal website with some light CSS and JavaScript

- Begun messing around with an Arduino kit


Where to next? Learning something in the C family? Making something more complex with JavaScript? Maybe something for mobile? I feel like my knowledge base is really rudimentary right now, especially compared to some of the people around me. I'm also not really sure whether I wanna go into web development, or software development, or what (kinda hoping I'll start to figure that out this summer), so I'd just like to get a good baseline that will convince recruiters that I know my shit enough to be worth hiring. If anyone can talk about what ended up being crucial for them, that'd be awesome."

26nmox,1,2014-05-27,Me [27F] with my ex-bf [27M] of 3 years wondering if I made the right choice moving away,speakfromtheheart,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/26nmox/me_27f_with_my_exbf_27m_of_3_years_wondering_if_i/,"Hi Redditors,  

Could use some advice... I was dating a man for a few years and we broke up a few months ago due to distance (we lived across the country from each other and had done long distance) his laziness and 
lack of motivation both in his own life and in our relationship. Everything was fine and we both moved on in our own way and thought it was the best decision. Before we broke up, I had planned on moving closer to him when I could but after the break-up I didn't factor him into my decisions. I was happy with our decision to break up, went on a few dates, traveled, etc and he was too.  

When I visited his hometown and had a chance to see him it felt like nothing had changed and when we found ourselves living in the same town again it was like we hadn't broken up and still get on very well. I still like him and like spending time with him and we seem to always end up in some sort of relationship where we end up falling in love and everything is wonderful (he feels the same). He seems to have improved some of the qualities that resulted in our break up in the first place, however, I'm moving away for an internship soon and this man is making me question all of my previous decisions. When I made and thought about this decision, he wasn't a factor in it as we were only talking as friends. He encouraged me to make the best choice for me. I had a really hard time making the decision but decided it was a good opportunity. 

Now that I have had a chance to spend time with him I find myself wondering if I should have taken a position closer because of him and this idea that we could live happily ever after despite our issues and because I also miss being close to my hometown very much. 

Reddit, would appreciate any advice you can give. Thanks. 

---   
TLDR: Took an internship really far away after breaking up with bf a few months ago. Have started hanging out with ex-bf again and realize I still care about him a lot and am very upset about moving so far away because being in this town has brought up old feelings.  "
26nq6u,0,2014-05-27,"Low GPA, startup experience, can't get internship",throwmyway1,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/26nq6u/low_gpa_startup_experience_cant_get_internship/,"This is more of a rant that I need to get off my chest.

I am a fourth year (going to graduate in 5 years) student at a top 20 undergraduate program. I am incredibly smart, passionate, and driven but I cannot get an internship no matter how hard I try. I see my classmates who are clearly no where near as smart as me getting internships and that makes me upset. How can companie pass up on an individual of my caliber?

The one negative that is causing me harm is my GPA. I have a 2.4 and I don't mention it on my resume. In some online applications, I have to state it; or during interviews it comes up and I feel like I get disqualified because of it. The reason it's so low is because I don't like the way CS is taught at my school. I understand the concepts perfectly, do decently on projects, but fail at examinations.

Also, for the last two years I was working with my friend to create our own startup company. Our company was working on neural computation and I was the CTO. My friend was the CEO, but I pretty much did all the real work. He handled some business stuff and did some programming, but I am a much better programmer than he is. I dedicated almost 100 hours per week to this company because I was dedicated and that's also a reason why my academics suffered. Last month, we stopped working on the startup because we couldn't get any funding or customers. I guess that's normal since many startups fail. My friend was able to secure an internship almost immediately and I still haven't been able to get one despite searching the entire year.

Over the year, I've sent out about 100 applications to both large and small companies. I've had about 20 interviews and for half of them, I've been invited on-site. During the interviews, I nail all the technical questions. There's only been 1 question which I haven't been able to answer. My solutions are the most optimum, written cleanly, and I honestly can't think of anything wrong with them. As far as cultural fit, I think I would fit in well into any company. I have a ""get shit done"" attitude and I work very extremely hard. I don't think I would even require much training if I was to intern at most of these companies. They have great products and I have ideas about how to improve them and how they do development. I feel that I am smarter than some of my interviewers and I've even been a CTO which is more than what some of them will be in their entire lifetime.

I'm also trying to network more now to improve my odds. I'm really at a loss as to why I haven't gotten a single internship. I'm not expecting a 6k/month internship from Google, but is even one too much to ask for? Just because I didn't get As in some classes, does that mean I am unworthy? I've done more in the last two years than most people accomplish in the first 10 years of their career. I just need one chance and I can't believe it has been this hard."
26nvd0,41,2014-05-27,What the hell just happened between me [22F] and my dad [62 M]?? [UPDATE],[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/26nvd0/what_the_hell_just_happened_between_me_22f_and_my/,"Original post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/26gwg6/what_the_hell_just_happened_between_me_22f_and_my/)

Edit: So I wanted to thank you guys for really helping me think out the event from a lot of angles. 'Talking' through it helped me feel like I had a little bit of control in my life and I appreciate the support.



Shit got real tense real fast. I spoke to my mom the same night. She asked if I was ok and gave me a hug. She said “I’m fine so you should be fine.” I said that I was pissed at dad and that I was angry at how he treated me. I said I didn’t think I had done anything wrong, was she really upset that I hadn’t gotten her a gift? She said she did expect a gift and that ""these things only happen a few times a year. Something small, but something."" She asked how I would feel if I didn't get a present on my birthday and I said that I didn't think that was a valid argument and that the way my dad treated me was inappropriate. She got annoyed and said that wasn't about her, told me that if I felt that way then I could keep crying, and left. Well ok then.

I woke up the next morning and my mom once again came into my room, but she was very angry. She had NO IDEA what my dad had told me until I told her and now was pissed that I got her a gift ""because I had to"" not because I wanted to. She said she was returning the gift because it was given out of hate and not love. I tried explaining that I had planned on getting her that all along but I felt like I had to wait until I got paid to buy it. She said that my dad was being protective and that Mother's Day should be honored, that if I couldn't afford something expensive I could have done something cheap, but that she deserved to be honored with SOMETHING. She said my dad has no idea that I'm even upset and that he will never apologize to me for it. I asked how it was my fault and she said that ""saying that not getting birthday presents is an invalid argument is invalid."" And she stormed out.


It is almost a possibility that to try and prove their point, they will not get me birthday presents. Which, I mean whatever, I'm an adult and I don't need presents, but knowing that it's coming from a grudge is pretty hurtful. I wanted to ask if that would be happening so I could celebrate elsewhere, but I let it go. I left the house for the whole day, spent it with great friends, and came back when everyone was asleep.


This morning my mom had an endoscopy and was coming off of anesthesia. She started talking to me normally so I responded and the situation was totally diffused. I have no idea if she will actually return the perfume or not. My dad however is ignoring me. He walked into the room I was in and turned around and walked out without responding to my offer of giving him the space. 


I'm less angry because it's exhausting but I am still hurt and want my apology/respect. I feel the urge to play his game. I know that if I act normal, he will act normal, and the whole situation will be forgotten...but I don't want to forget. I also don't want to waste my energy being angry and upset any more. I'm going to my best friend's house tomorrow to speak to her lovely mother about the whole situation. It's coming down to the matter of whether I am going to let the issue go and try to patch my relationship back together with my dad while preventing it from happening again, or sacrifice my emotional health and keep demanding that he see the error in his ways and apologize while living in his house.





**Edit 2:** It's pretty interesting to see how divided people are on the issue of commercialized holidays. With more distance from the situation, I've calmed down a lot. I know I was wrong to not at least tell my mom I wanted to do something with her to celebrate Mothers Day, or send a card. I know now that in my family, gifts are expected for holidays. I know I should have apologized immediately to my mom and realize that I didn't want an apology, I wanted to be understood. I'm going to wait a day, write out what I want to say, and apologize to my mom for hurting her. With my dad, I'm just going to ask that he try to understand that what he said and how he said it hurt me. If he chooses not to consider my perspective, he doesn't have to respond to it, but at least I tried. After that, I can only let it go and be polite until my internship ends. And I have also learned that narcissism is a big deal around here.


---   
**tl;dr**: shit got real, then shit got normal, but shit is still tense and I can either let it go or be butthurt. Tempted to do both.


**tl;dr**: hindsight is helpful and a lot of people now think I'm an asshole"

Before I get into the specifics, here is some brief background info about me:

* I graduate this December from a state university in Florida with a Bachelors in CS. 
* I am currently in a full-time position as a Software Engineer making around 60k$ (Florida). 
* When I graduate I will have about 3 years of experience. (1 year as a full-time Software Engineer and 2 years in a full-time internship)
* All of my work experience is in VB.NET/C#

When I graduate, I would like to move into a more challenging position, preferably at a startup or at a Big 4 company, but I am quite worried about getting through the interview process. This is mainly because most of my work is very high-level in that I do alot of software architecture design and all of my code is in C#, leaving me isolated from both web technologies and lower level coding. Because of this I have been considering resigning from my current position at the end of August to focus on getting plenty of studying and more side projects coming along to boost my knowledge in all areas. I can survive financially for 3-4 months on my savings given my current expenses, but I would be giving up a 60k$ job to do this.

Now, I know in the long-term I am not going to be happy in my current position. I work at a startup software company providing enterprise solutions to other businesses; this is a smaller company of about 30 people, only 6 of which are developers including myself. I am not trying to sound pompous or egotistic, but all the developers here, save for 2, are terrible at what they do, and I regularly have to fight battles to do things in a professional way. It is kind of hard to explain so here is a somewhat brief list:

* One developer regularly deviates from design specifications and implements his own features without consulting anyone. This is done without reprimand. 
* Best practices are never taken seriously. Ex: Administrative plaintext passwords were being saved in text files. Homegrown encryption was implemented in the product.
* Another developer regularly walks out of design sessions and meetings because hes bored and hates meetings, again without reprimand. 
* Solutions are generally not vetted out by merit and it is looked down upon to spend time on researching what the best solution is.
* I have been told by an executive that they would prefer to be bought-out for their IP rather than organically building the business itself. This results in many short-sighted decisions and shortcuts being taken.

Should I follow through with resigning and focusing on expanding my knowledge base before graduation? Given my current experience in architecture design and coding, what kind of salary should I expect after graduation? What do you recommend I do in my situation?

WHEN: Saturday, July 19, noon-4pm 
WHERE: Bus tour departs from The Daily Dose, 1820 Industrial St., Los Angeles, CA 90021
COST: $63/person 
VIDEO PREVIEW: Tour host David Smay at an iconic Echo Park Tom Waits location - http://youtu.be/ctDPOa2D178
MORE INFO: visit http://www.esotouric.com/waits or call 213-373-1947

LOS ANGELES- Fans of the legendary singer-songwriter Tom Waits just don't get a lot of chances to get together. And the last time he toured, fans in his old hometown of L.A. were out of luck—the closest show was in Phoenix, Arizona. 

So once each year, Esotouric, the bus adventure company whose offbeat tours expose L.A.'s secret history, offers a bus tour celebrating the life and work of Waits, a rare opportunity for fans to scratch that gravelly voiced itch in good company. 

CRAWLING DOWN CAHUENGA: TOM WAITS' LOS ANGELES  is the definitive tour of Tom Waits' formative creative life and the people, places and late night pastries that shaped it. 

Calling all rain dogs, gin-soaked boys and Gun Street girls! Climb aboard as your hosts David Smay (author of the acclaimed 33 1/3 series book on Tom Waits' ""Swordfishtrombones"" album) and Esotouric's Kim Cooper (a Zoetrope Studios intern who'll tell how she used teenage subterfuge to arrange a private concert by the man) lead you on a scrupulously researched ride through Waits' epic misdeeds and shenanigans, from the Trashing of the Troubadour to epic nights at the Tropicana. 

And oh, there are such tales to tell, from food fights with L.A. Punks and smackdowns with L.A. police. We'll crawl through the Sewers of Paris, tattle on the Ivar Theater, and get the lowdown on Waits' legendary performances at the Wiltern and elsewhere. 

Before departing for points rural, Tom Waits left his mark all over L.A., from Francis Ford Coppola's Zoetrope Studios to Sunset Sound to Skid Row. We'll show you where he found his true love and collaborator, Kathleen Brennan, and how all the pieces came together to transform a drunken, desperate singer into the multi-faceted, multi-media artist he'd become.

Raised near San Diego, Tom Waits launched his musical career in L.A., signing with David Geffen's Asylum Records in 1972, living in a famously cluttered room in the raunchy Tropicana Hotel (where he sawed off the kitchen drain board so his piano would fit), and building a reputation as a songwriter willing to risk his own health and sanity to get inside the sad sack characters that peopled songs like ""The Piano Has Been Drinking (Not Me),"" ""On The Nickel"" and ""Pasties And A G-string (At The Two O'clock Club)."" 

By 1980, Waits was 31 and starting to feel the effects of his hard living. While scoring the music to Francis Ford Coppola's ""One From The Heart,"" he met Kathleen Brennan, whose influence would completely transform his life and his art. After a whirlwind courtship the pair married and began a 30-year creative and personal partnership, beginning with the revolutionary album ""Swordfishtrombones,"" the subject of tour host David Smay's latest book.

Passengers gather in the historic Arts District, the neighborhood that best evokes the gritty 1970s-era downtown where Waits found inspiration, before boarding Esotouric's luxury coach class bus, where the mood is set with vintage photos and live footage. CRAWLING DOWN CAHUENGA spans Tom's personal city, from The Nickel (aka Skid Row) to once-ratty West Hollywood, favorite strip clubs and midnight diners, recording studios, night clubs, record labels and film studios, before rolling back downtown with plenty of time to get the night started right.

ABOUT THE HOSTS: Longtime collaborators David Smay and Kim Cooper co-edited the books ""Bubblegum Music is the Naked Truth"" (""quite simply the most fun music book I have ever read."" --Bucketfull of Brains) and ""Lost in the Grooves: Scram's Capricious Guide to the Music You Missed"" (""the perfect book for the advanced record collector"" --Ear Candy) before penning their solo 33 1/3 series books on Tom Waits and Neutral Milk Hotel. Kim hosts Esotouric's true crime and occasional rock and roll history tours and is author of the acclaimed mystery ""The Kept Girl"" starring the young Raymond Chandler. David Smay lives in San Francisco, where he is working on a history of the Beats.

26o8mi,0,2014-05-28,I felt like writing about my dating life for a little bit. This includes my experience on OkCupid and life in general. Thanks for reading.,[deleted],OkCupid,https://www.reddit.com/r/OkCupid/comments/26o8mi/i_felt_like_writing_about_my_dating_life_for_a/,"**Highschool Rewind**

I'm with my first girlfriend. We have a typical first time relationship, everything is new and awkward and pretty intense. Looking back it was your typical teenage relationship, things were uncertain and both of us didn't really know what we were doing. 

Eventually after almost a year together, we mutually decide to break it off. At that moment in my life, I asked myself: *I've been together with this person for a year, do I really want it to keep going?* The answer was no. Later, she wanted to get back together, and despite feeling lonely and missing her a bit, I just couldn't do it. I wanted to move on. We are on good terms now, though. 


**My Senior Year**

After I had broken up with my girlfriend, this old friend I had known in another city before I moved pops back into my life. It had been a while since we last contacted each other, and I was pretty excited to be able to see her again. Despite going to different schools, we went out a few times and I started falling for her. We had a lot in common, wanting to go into the same field of work, similar goals and aspirations, ect, ect. 

I believe that she eventually sensed that my feelings were getting intense for her, and for whatever reason, she faded. She stopped responding to e-mails and contacting me. After this happened, I was pretty upset I decided to take a break from the whole relationship thing for a while. *I needed time to grow up and enjoy life, I thought.* *I'm too young for this shit.*

**Fast forward**

Still single, and still away from the whole relationship scene. At this moment in my life I guess it just wasn't my direct focus. I don't know how else to explain it.

I believe this was a mistake I made - once you're away from the dating scene for a while, it takes time to get back in it. You not only need time, but you need to learn all of the skills that are associated with dating. It's like I had to learn to walk again. 

What a coincidence, I run into my old friend at work (where she was doing an internship). She explains to me that she's in a long distance relationship with someone in another State, and I'm okay with that. At this point, I just wanted to be friends, but I would be lying if I said I didn't feel some feelings towards her. 

We're at a co-workers house warming party. My friend makes some moves on me and BAM! It's like all those feelings I had for her came back with a vengeance. We started going out and I went out of my way to be with her, give her my attention, *everything.* We never got intimate though, besides making out a few times and cuddling. I was clearly being pulled along here, and I fell for it. 

Opening up to her again was a huge mistake, as she ended up fading on me again. This time, it left me absolutely heartbroken. It seemed like her relationship with the guy in another State was on the rocks, so that's why I continued to be strung along. I was in a trance here, a hypnotic trance of infatuation that left me thinking about her and wanting to be with her. How it ended up developing is a long story and that's not really the point of this, so I won't really continue. All I want to say is, I don't really fault her for what happened, she had her reasons. There's no hatred in my heart for this person what so ever. Shit happens, and this was a very big, fundamental life lessoned that I learnt. I don't talk to her anymore and have no interest in ever doing so again, but I really do wish her well. 

This is where my current ineptness with dating originates. I was as in love as you could be with a girl without being loved back. All of the time I was spending with her I could have spent pursuing other girls that actually were interested in me. I'm to blame for this, I acted like a love intoxicated fool. 

I'm generally horrible at getting the signals from women and bad at flirting ([this meme comes to mind])(http://weknowmemes.com/2013/05/what-girls-think-is-enough-of-a-sign/) Looking back though, I had many chances that I just ignored or indirectly brushed off because I was way too infatuated with someone that didn't want me. As I said, what happened to me was a huge, huge lesson. 

**Now**

Thus, we arrive at the present time. Still single, and not getting too many dates. A good friend suggested I get OKC since he found his current partner on there. 

I've had three dates so far. The first one went terribly. Girl arrives late, and leaves early, not to much chemistry. 

The second date went well, we chatted and had good chemistry. She stopped responding to my texts and deleted her account (only to reactivate it later, I noticed). Obviously, it didn't go as well as I had thought it did.

My third date, which I had just recently, went the best of all. She talked for hours, we got on pretty well and are going to see each other again soon. 

In all honesty, I'm scared shitless. I'm now thinking: 
*what do I do*?, 
*do I actually like this girl?* 
*how can I be less awkward?,* 
*what are the next steps?.* 

- Among a plethora of other things.


All of this is fucking frightening. I pride myself for doing things in the past that have taken me out of my comfort zone, but this whole OkCupid thing is really, really hard. I mean, from the point where you initiate that first message, until you meet whoever it is you've been chatting with - everything about this process is difficult. Creating chemistry out of an online correspondence is almost impossible. It has to arrive naturally, and that's what so terrifying. 

Overall, My OkCupid experience thus far can be compared to an insane up and down emotional roller coaster. Sometimes I hate Okcupid because my good quality messages are ignored. I've sent out tons to people that I thought would be good matches, tons. 

Sometimes I think about how incredibly stupid online dating is and how we judge prospective dates (at least initially) on appearance. OkCupid has made me depressed, angry, conflicted, and a whole set of other emotions. There are times that I get so frustrated that I just want to delete it and continue living my comfortable, but solitary life. 

However, coming from a guy who has been single for a long, long time, I have to say that it's helping me at least on a very minimal level. somewhat. That's what I have to focus on. Some days I'll think this It's made approaching girls not a big deal for me anymore. Even if I don't get anymore dates, I feel a little bit more confidence in real life because I can go up to a girl and ask her out with a little more ease. 

*I got rejected on Okcupid tons of times, who cares if It just happens to me in real life?* I know it's silly to make that kind of connection with online vs real life, but it's true. 

I don't mean for this to be a ""OkCupid changed my life post"" because it didn't. The point is that *I* am changing my life, OkCupid just kind of pushed me to do it. Dating should not be the primary focus of anyones life. We live in a society where it is imposed on us. 

Life is one big journey, and we just have to be who we are.

26oa4a,1,2014-05-28,Is My Friend Using Me?,321man,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/26oa4a/is_my_friend_using_me/,"*Tried to obscure some details about us so he doesn't immediate recognize I'm talking about him, hope it isn't too vague.

I'm a 21 year old male, with a year left in college. One of my friends (21 Male) who just graduated from his university moved to my city, and doesn't have a job. His family owns (but doesn't live in) a place here and so he stays there and doesn't have to worry about rent. I've known the guy and have hung out with him on and off for about a year. We have a lot of similar interests, and we generally get along pretty well.

He seems to struggle with anxiety and low self-esteem at times, alternating between making remarks like ""I'll never have a girlfriend"" and then at other times spontaneously boasting about girls who have hit on him. He constantly gets down on himself about being anti-social and not really having friends, and at other times, he goes into explicit details about some of his friends from college, pointing out how cool they are. He's not a bad looking dude, and had a cute girlfriend two or so years ago, which didn't seem to last long. Other than me, he has one or two college acquaintances living in the city, but doesn't hang out with them as far as I can tell. He talks about how lonely he is here and it's only been a couple weeks since he's moved here.

I have a couple internships with music related companies we really like, and I've mentioned that I would be down to submit his resume if I ever hear about internship openings, despite his career focus being directed towards a completely different field. I also felt bad and said I would introduce him to my friends since he doesn't really have any other than me. Not sure if this was a mistake, because since then he's been really adamant about tagging along with me wherever I go each day. I like hanging out with the dude, but spending too much time with anyone can get tiring. He texts me everyday asking me what I'm up to, wanting to hang out, and what other people are up to. Lately though, I feel as though he's been hanging out with me primarily to make more friends and meet people working in my industry, rather than to just hang out as friends, given how often he tries to get me to introduce him to people, and tries to tag along to different events I'm going to.

He keeps talking about how he's going to apply to jobs related to his career path, but hasn't applied to a single one since he's arrived. He seems to be somewhat spiteful about me having the positions that I do, often making remarks that he's not working in my field because he is unlucky and never had the right connections like I have.

I'm not sure if I'm being too mean, or paranoid, but I have some sense that he doesn't like me as much as he seems to lead on, and is acting too desperately about trying to permeate my social life without even trying to establish a professional one. I've been trying to build a bit of distance to make things more comfortable. I was originally really excited about him moving here, but now I'm expressing some doubt. I don't know how I should build space and proceed, without severing our friendship.

TL;DR, friend is trying really hard to permeate my professional and friend social circles, sort of coming off as being manipulative. Dunno how to build distance without ruining the friendship."

Outside of Googling gender therapists, I really don't know what else I should be doing to search for someone. I will do my personal research, makes calls, etc. But I figured I might as well ask here first. I live in the Baltimore area if anyone has any recommendations, and they'd be much appreciated. But more to the point: 

* **How'd you find a gender therapist?**
* **Is there anything I should look out for when looking for a therapist?** things to avoid? what makes them a good choice?
* **Were you satisfied with the experience?** Why or why not?
* I'd like to minimize the amount of sessions I need to get a letter. I don't feel like I really need long term therapy and I don't want to spend all of my money on this. **Would I be able to expect or ask a therapist to give me a letter in as few sessions as possible?** I know there is technically a minimum, but I've heard of some people getting away with just one session.
* **What should I expect in therapy?** I guess it varies, but this is the part that scares me the most to be honest. So I'd like to be prepared for it.

- She only works 2 days a week as she's currently in school, I work 5.
- We don't have a lunch room, so everyone just eats lunch at their desk. 

Basically, any form of communication is impossible. We talked yesterday while we were waiting for an executive to unlock the door, and we ended up leaving at the same time as well.

The main question: would it be weird to ask her to lunch the next time she's in via email? I figured I'd pull the old ""I forgot my lunch, want to go grab something?"" card. I don't want to ask too soon, but there's not even a guaranteed chance we'll interact when she's in.

26p96u,7,2014-05-28,"Help - In-house Tech Writer/Designer, No Web design experience, being pushed to redesign corporate website",Fizzbit,Design,https://www.reddit.com/r/Design/comments/26p96u/help_inhouse_tech_writerdesigner_no_web_design/,"Quick background:

1. I moved to a new city (EDIT: husband got new job, I didn't move on my own), started looking around for a job. Found a Technical Writer/Graphic Designer job and applied. Had a great interview, sure I had the job.

2. A month after the interview (owner constantly out of town), I was told that the owner of the company not only wanted a designer who could also write for technical documentation AND marketing literature (difficult to find already) but also could design websites. Coming to find out that also includes web development. The only web design I know is how to design visual layouts, slice graphics, and edit HTML and CSS. Coding and actually structuring are where I fall flat. I panic when code is put in front of me. For fuck's sake, my portfolio is an Imgur gallery.

3. I was hurting for a job and the department was hurting to fill the position. They hired me knowing that I knew fundamental HTML &amp; CSS editing skills, but the ""Web design"" was kept in the job description.

4. That ""Web Design"" keeping there is hurting me professionally. Despite being added in to the job description AFTER my interview and literally moments before they offered me the job, I'm expected to redesign the corporate website. 

Now I'm not the first to admit that the corporate website is HORRIBLE, and the back end is incredibly sloppy. It needs a complete do-over. Start from scratch. 

Again, my problem is I am not a web designer. I am a Designer &amp; Tech Writer. And some of the elements the owner has hinted at in the past (""Build it yourself"" purchasing system, automated ordering, etc) are jobs for a web developer, not a designer. I'm still trying to design my own portfolio website. 

My manager and I have tossed the idea back and forth of proposing hiring a paid intern to design our website for us if I can design the overall layout and provide graphics. 

I guess what I'm looking for is 1) How to approach this demand, and 2) How the fuck do I get over my phobia of code? I went through Codecademy and got familiar with fundamentals of CSS &amp; HTML but tell me to actually build a site and I freeze up."

We've had an extremely happy relationship. He goes to college while I dropped out and work full-time. In order to graduate, he must complete an internship in his field.

However I can't afford to move with him for just those three months, so I'm staying home and working.

We've lived together for the last year, and we do literally everything together. We both work and go to school and immediately come home to hang out, play videogames, cook dinner, binge-watch TV series together. I can't even begin to imagine having to live the next 3 months without him by my side. I already know that I struggle with long distance relationships due to a short bout where I was commuting away for 4 days a week.

[Was your gig at Animal Planet something you just stumbled upon, or how did you get into that position? Something like this has always been my dream job ever since I was a kid.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26p2ge/im_dan_riskin_biologist_turned_animal/cht410a?context=5)|I was working as a scientist in a basement, when the phone rang. A production company was doing a show about evolution (called Evolve, for the History Channel), and they needed ""an evolutionary biologist who is not an old man."" They'd gotten my name from someone who had seen me give talks at conferences. So the take-home for me is that my enthusiasm as a researcher drew me smoothly into being enthusiastic about science for a living on TV. A lot of it was luck, but I believe that you can totally get any dream job if you just try to be the person who deserves that job.
[What did you want to be when you were little? Did you feel inspired by Steve Irwin?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26p2ge/im_dan_riskin_biologist_turned_animal/cht8o5d?context=5)|I remember thinking ""not scientist because they have to do math."" I didn't fall in love with math until part-way through my PhD. I sucked at math in high school and undergrad, but once I saw how it connected to bats (through biomechanics), I fell in love, and found out I'm actually pretty damned good at math. I wasted all those years thinking I was incapable. I always keep that in mind when people tell me they suck at Math. They probably don't.
[Were there any good (or bad\) practical jokes on set that you can relate?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26p2ge/im_dan_riskin_biologist_turned_animal/cht3y8d?context=5)|It wasn't a practical joke, but one of our craziest days at Daily Planet was when we had someone in the studio burning magnesium and he'd kind of eyeballed the amount and it ended up being way too much and suddenly everything was brighter than the sun and the cement floor had permanent craters in it. Also, our camera guy, Art, had to get new shoes because his were burnt. Good times.
[What parasite do YOU personally find the most interesting? Do you think parasites control / affect human behavior the way, say, Cymothoa exigua affects fish?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26p2ge/im_dan_riskin_biologist_turned_animal/cht3rau?context=5)|To me the cat's ass of parasites is Toxoplasma, because it changes behaviour in rats in a way that makes a lot of sense evolutionarily. Normally rats are scared of the smell of cat urine (and therefore avoid cats, on average). But when a rat is infected with Toxoplasma, it becomes SEXUALLY AROUSED by that smell, which makes them more likely to be eaten by a cat. So the parasite gets passed on, and wins. That, in itself, is awesome. The kicker, though, is that humans get the parasite, too, and it measurably changes our behaviour.
[Hey Dan! I saw you speak at Ontario Biology Day a couple of months ago and thought what you had to say about your PhD and Postdoc work with vampire bats was so incredibly interesting. It was amazing to hear how passionate you were about the research you got to do and I hope to find a project that I'm just as passionate about for my future work. I was just wondering since you've moved away from the research field, do you miss it? Or do you miss even certain aspects of it, like the travelling you got to do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26p2ge/im_dan_riskin_biologist_turned_animal/cht44ki?context=5)|I do miss research, to be honest. As I said at OBD, there is no greater pleasure in the world than seeing some fact about the world before anyone else. When my PhD advisor, John Hermanson, and my then undergrad (now PhD student), Gerry Carter watched those vampire bats running on a treadmill, it was like finding buried treasure - no, it was like finding buried treasure that was put there by aliens. It was indescribable. We just laughed and laughed. Here's the video. [Link to www.youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ukIZRD1mzLg)
 |I want to fill my life with more of that, and I will.
[Dan - your passion is palpable through the text. But I have to ask what was groundbreaking/new about the bat on the treadmill? The similarity to other mammals running? The fact that they could run? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26p2ge/im_dan_riskin_biologist_turned_animal/chta8ii?context=5)|Common vampire bats are the only lineage we know of that lost the ability to run (bats can't run) and then secondarily evolved it again. The great part is that when they independently evolved that ability, they had all this musculature associated with the arms compared to the weak legs, so they developed a unique gait of running push-ups, which no other animal does.
[Hey Dan, I'm a huge fan of Daily Planet!  I love how Daily Planet is always at the forefront of cutting edge technology, and was wondering what new emerging technology/science you are personally most excited about?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26p2ge/im_dan_riskin_biologist_turned_animal/cht3vb6?context=5)|Thanks. I'm really proud to work on Daily Planet. We have such a big team of talented and smart people on our team, and we cover some great stories. The stuff that gets me psyched right now is graphene. It's got such incredible potential. At the same time, though, I think of the plastics revolution that we're still trying to clean up, and I wonder what the ecological impacts of graphene might be.

What are some of your favorite adventures?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26p2ge/im_dan_riskin_biologist_turned_animal/cht3z70?context=5)|There are more than 1,200 kinds of bats in the world, and I want to see all of them. In my life so far I've seen 106. For fun I like to see new places, and looking for bats is a great way to do that. Some of my favourite experiences so far have come from those trips. Like the time I saw an endangered brown lemur while I was in Madagascar looking for sucker-footed bats. You know. That was nice.
[I assume you've had your rabies shots..](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26p2ge/im_dan_riskin_biologist_turned_animal/chtag7w?context=5)|Yes.
[I just started reading your book. Congrats! How can we avoid having Mother Nature Kill us? What is your best health advice?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26p2ge/im_dan_riskin_biologist_turned_animal/cht50mp?context=5)|Thanks! One of the big things I argue about in my book is that companies manipulate you by calling things ""natural"" and then expecting you to think that means ""good."" That's insane. Sure, there are lots of healthy things in nature, but rattlesnakes are natural, too.
 |Get this: There are &gt;250,000 kinds of plants in the world, and humans get &gt;90% of our calories from just 15 species. FIFTEEN! That's 1/160th of a percent. If nature's so good for us, how come we only eat a select number of plants, which by the way, we've been domesticating for thousands of years to make them healthy?
 |Nature has lots of healthy things in it, but to describe nature as this loving basket of harmless fruit that is actively trying to take care of you is silly. If anything, Mother Nature is Trying to Kill You. Hence my title.
[What the most interesting animal to you and why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26p2ge/im_dan_riskin_biologist_turned_animal/cht5fnm?context=5)|I love bats. They can fly. Most of them echolocate. They hang upside down. They have incredibly diverse faces. They're enigmatic. Nobody is indifferent about them. Some people hate them (losers) and some people love them, but when there's a bat in the room, people notice.
 |When you study bats, though, you find out they're even more interesting than their first impression would suggest. There are scientific papers about bats giving oral sex to one another. There are scientific papers about bats peeing on themselves to cool down. The sac-winged bat fills pockets in its wings with urine, semen, and saliva, and then sprays that mixture onto other members of its species. Love that.
[My kids and I are big fans of Daily Planet and watch it every day.  Thanks for hosting such a great show.  My family is saddened by what happened to the educational content on TLC and History over the years (and even Discovery sadly\) It must be difficult for the team to walk that fine line between keeping it interesting and diving into the science details.  Do you get to contribute to the discussion of how in-depth a segment goes?  Any segments you wish you were able to dive deeper into?  Any regrets about airing segments that were more entertainment than science?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26p2ge/im_dan_riskin_biologist_turned_animal/cht5vbf?context=5)|(I love that your kids watch the show - thank you!)
 |TV is harder than most people think. A lot of incredibly great, well-researched shows get made but people just don't watch them. A lot of stupid fluff gets made that people can't get enough of. For those of us in the biz, it's NOT FAIR. We want good ratings for good shows, but it often doesn't work that way.
 |The game, then, is to make intellectually great shows that people will watch. Very hard. I think Daily Planet and Monsters Inside Me are both great examples of that working. COSMOS is another, and there are many others. But until people stop watching Honey Boo Boo hunting alien ducks or whatever those shows are, we've got no choice but to play this game.

[My question is: What's your view of STEM education in Canada and around the world. How can we convince more kids to get interested in Science and Math?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26p2ge/im_dan_riskin_biologist_turned_animal/cht3zfi?context=5)|As far as STEM goes, I think it's a beautiful time because of places like Reddit/Wikipedia. Everyone is starting to question everything. Your teacher tells you something in high school and you fact check it. That's the spirit of science. Science isn't about knowing the periodic table, it's about questioning authority. In general, governments need to do more to help teachers, but I'm excited by the exponential increase in the number of resources available to STEM teachers through the web. It gives me optimism.

What do you think is the most disturbing thing that goes on in nature?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26p2ge/im_dan_riskin_biologist_turned_animal/cht4hvx?context=5)|Great question. There are so many answers. Bedbug sex (traumatic insemination - where the male just stabs a female with his knife-like penis and injects sperm into her abdomen) is a good contender. So is hyena childbirth (where the tubular, penis-shaped clitoris tears open in the process). That must hurt. To be honest, that's kind of the starting question I used when I wrote my book [he said, plugging his book]. So my full answer is there.
[I'm pretty disturbed.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26p2ge/im_dan_riskin_biologist_turned_animal/cht4uu9?context=5)|I did my PhD on vampire bats which are parasites of mammals and birds (they drink their blood), but my expertise is biomechanics and/or bat biology.

I've fallen in love with the parasites, though. They're super creepy and brilliant and awesome. What's not to love about a worm that comes out of your ass while you're sleeping to lay eggs, so you'll be itchy in the morning and then get those eggs all over your fingers? You couldn't make that stuff up!

[Morbid kinkiness of nature? Care to gives us your most favorite and/or most disgusting example of that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26p2ge/im_dan_riskin_biologist_turned_animal/cht9igt?context=5)|There's a flatworm on the great barrier reef that is hermaphroditic. When two of them mate, they have to pick who will be male and who will be female. The male just has to ejaculate and then gets to leave. The female has to incubate eggs. So both of them want to be the male. They settle their argument by penis fencing - each of them has two penises and they have a sword fight. The winner stabs the loser, injects it with sperm, and then swims away, the victorious dad. The loser has to be the mom.
 |It's a neat system because you will only ever have to be the female if you've had sex with someone who fights better than you do. In other words, it will always have been worth it, in terms of bettering your offspring's chances of being good penis-fighters.
[You ever heard of this bat expert called Roger Ransome? He's one of the leading experts in the U.K, for sure, maybe even Europe and beyond. Only curious because he's my great-uncle.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26p2ge/im_dan_riskin_biologist_turned_animal/cht40k8?context=5)|Yes.

And I'd probably get it on my left calf. Probably in 1997.
[Hey Dan, I'm a big fan. Would you rather study 100 bat sized horses or 1 horse sized bat? Also the bat spits acid.

That's the beauty of biology - there are exceptions to almost all of the rules.
[Why do orangutans eat the brains of lorises?(or is it lorisi?\) Is there any DNA we could potentially take from vampire bats to aid in other species or our own for diseases or other harmful things?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26p2ge/im_dan_riskin_biologist_turned_animal/cht6xhw?context=5)|We think of orangs as the peaceful, wise, old orange things that are vegetarian peaceniks, but when slow lorises are available, an orang won't hesitate to smack it out of the tree, climb down, and eat its face, the palms of its hands, and its brain. That's the kind of thing I love about nature. Everybody thinks of nature as this gentle utopia, but it's actually pretty rough out there.

Joe Bahlman did past of his PhD at Brown on just that.
[Hey Dan, thanks for doing this. My question is about bat flight from a physiology perspective.  In university I had a prof that was explaining bird respiration to us and how the efficiency of having a continuous circuit of fresh air passing by the respiratory surface allowed the flight muscles to stay well fed with oxygen. When I asked him how bats were able to fly given their boring old mammalian lungs he didn't know. So, do you know how they can afford to fly without a steady stream of O2? Any special adaptation that help then achieve this? Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26p2ge/im_dan_riskin_biologist_turned_animal/chtbjfr?context=5)|I believe that recently they've found that the unidirectional flow of air across the capillaries of lungs, which was thought to be unique to birds, seems to also be present in crocodilians, suggesting that while it might help birds out in flight, it isn't as important as we thought, and certainly doesn't seem to be the key to being able to fly. Birds probably had that long before they evolved flight. Bats fly without it and crocodiles (thankfully) can't fly even with it.

Pooped-out blood in your hair? Honestly.
[In my reading I gathered that the evolutionary history of bats is vague, at least. Can you tell us what your idea of where they evolved from is?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26p2ge/im_dan_riskin_biologist_turned_animal/cht8mxk?context=5)|The evolutionary history of bats was a bit of a mess, but recent work by Emma Teeling, Nancy Simmons, and others has cleaned a lot of that mess up.  They were arboreal animals until after the dinosaurs disappeared. Then flight and echolocation evolved and boom. Bats exploded in diversity.
[I've been watching Daily Planet for over 5 years, and I think you're a great host, my question is; What was the best experience you ever had on the show or ever?(I haven't seen every episode\) I thought the CN Tower thing you did with Ziya was pretty cool! thanks for doing this AMA!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/26p2ge/im_dan_riskin_biologist_turned_animal/chtcnlm?context=5)|Standing on the edge of the CN tower was a blast.

The vampire bats kick ass, but the New Zealand Short-tailed bat is super-enigmatic, and in the absence of terrestrial mammals with which to compete has become a largely terrestrial animal that can fold its wings up and crawl around looking for food like a shrew. They also strangely have a second claw underneath every claw on their toes and thumbs. Why? No one knows.

It uses that tongue to lap up nectar from very deep flowers that it visits, like a bee or a hummingbird.

I was wondering if you had an opinion or comments on the relative value of publishing in scientific journals versus popular press. As a recent M.Sc. grad I'm feeling the pressure to be published in journals, but my writing for those is by necessity full of jargon, and will (generally\) only be read by fellow scientists with a paid subscription.

The outreach is great, but its value is hard to quantify. When I did research for my book, I didn't trust anything in the popular press. All of my facts had to come from scientific papers. They're all that ""count,"" as far as I'm concerned. The outreach has value, but if you're trying to get ahead in academics, scientific papers are what you need to publish. If you're not trying to stay in academics, just publish enough to get your degree and then write for the masses.
[Thank you for taking the time to do this AMA. I'm currently in grad school, working on a PhD in Engineering. I'm interested in science outreach as well as science and technology policy.

I'm from Boston, but am coming to Santa Monica for the summer for an internship. I'm not very familiar with the area, or where to look in terms of safe areas. I'm looking for something furnished, and ideally around $2000-3000, but that budget is flexible. It just needs to be from around the middle of June until the middle/end of August. Any recommendations for an out-of-towner?"

After losing my faith in Christianity and its teachings I realized how far behind I was socially and thought it would be best to dive right into the secular social world in my last semester of college while I still could and learn about sex, drinking, and picking up girls. So I took an internship out of state to get away from my Christian friends and figure out life without God. 

Long story short I met a girl that I liked, was honest with her about my inexperience and she gladly showed me the ropes. I had hit the jackpot! I had my first make out session, oral sex experience, and sexual intercourse ever. I was thoroughly unprepared for how physically taxing it would be, but the girl I was with was quite accommodating and was enjoying teaching me all these new things. Needless to say it wasn’t like the movies, I was really bad at the whole thing, but I couldn’t wipe the smile off of my face. I had finally done “it”. Well since that day in February I have had a few one night stands (six in total) most of them occurring during my graduation weekend (last weekend) where I slept the three girls in two days. 

For a guy who was a virgin for 22 years I think I might be overdoing it and am starting to feel that hole that Christians say consumes your heart after “living in sin”. I feel like a scumbag; dirty and morally bankrupt and I regret some (not all) of these easy lays from these college parties. I think I’m going to take a break and reevaluate my moral compass. I’m probably going to wait until I’m in a relationship with someone I care about before having sex again. Just needed to vent this today. "

Home. $450(bedroom) OR $550 (master),Blackwater22,ucf,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucf/comments/26prxw/roommate_needed_aug_1st_home_450bedroom_or_550/,"Never thought I'd have to post one of these but recently one of our roommates moved out to take a job in Indianapolis. The replacement roommate did not meet the rental qualifications which leads me to this post. 

**Details-**
[**PHOTOS**](http://imgur.com/a/3JKBX)
The house is perfect. Right behind UCF in regency park. It's a 3/2 house with a 2 car garage.  We would prefer you take the master as it's much more private (private bathroom, quieter etc).  The second bathroom is small and shared which makes things difficult. However if you wanted just a small bedroom I would be willing to move to the master. The landlord owns the home and is very responsive to our needs. We keep the house clean 24/7, do not throw parties, and live in a very chill environment. Friends over is always encouraged but this is by no means a party house. However we do drink a lot of Jameson. The family room is converted into a living room and the living room converted into a large office space where we do our work. (photos below) 

**The roommates-**

u/thethirdlegend is a computer science and math major. He will be graduating this year from UCF. Loves; league, scifi, tinder, anime and of course all things code. Works from home at a non profit doing web design. 

I (u/blackwater22) am a Junior at UCF working toward a degree in Information technology. I currently have an internship with Picerne real estate. Personally I'm deeply into politics, edm, running and all things related to technology. 


**Financial details-** 

Rent is $1400 and it includes water and power split three ways. We pay for medium tier bright house speed which adds an additional $20 per roommate bringing the rent to either $450 if you want a bedroom or $550 if you want the master. (Master pays $100 more) 

**Rental qualifications-** 

This is where is becomes tough. Every Tenant must have their parents (or some adult) as a cosigner. This is nonnegotiable lease terms. I have close to 850 credit score and offered to pay 6 months of rent payments upfront and they still required a cosigner. The landlord is very protective of his home and it's reflected in his strict rental qualification. You can move in now or August 1st. The last roommate has already left though is still paying rent for the next few months. You can take over those payments if you wanted to move in now.

26pwmy,2,2014-05-28,"My (23F) boyfriend (22M) has destroyed our relationship with his manipulation, confused and lost [serious]",FeelingWorthless100,dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/26pwmy/my_23f_boyfriend_22m_has_destroyed_our/,"[WARNING: long, but I've tried to make it concise, but all of the details are necessary to get a clear picture of what's going on]

We'd been together four years; initially he was the most genuine and truly kind person I'd ever known. But he's always had an issue with self-esteem - he'd been in therapy as a teenager because of a birthmark he has that affects him psychologically to this day (though it's not visible under clothing). He once got a haircut he didn't like that made him cry. He is a nerd (which I like - rather, liked), but he would try to hide his hobbies because they weren't ""cool.""

When he went to college he broke up with me because he was four hours away (and obviously wanted freedom). He got into drinking, so much so he was falling asleep under tables and not doing his classwork. His parents pulled him out after a year and sent him to a community college because they pay for his tuition and didn't appreciate him throwing away the education they were paying for. I don't have a problem with him drinking, but I also didn't like the person he became when he drank, and since he's a lightweight it only takes half a beer for him to start to lose it. Though we had little contact after breaking up because he didn't want to speak to me, he once texted me drunk, telling me the booze made him a better person.

Six months later he wanted me back. I agreed, on the condition he lay off the alcohol to the extent he was taking it in - I don't have an issue with drinking, I just don't like people who have to get shit faced every time they drink, like he was. For the next four years we were fine, though he always held against me what he perceived to be me not liking him drinking AT ALL. I don't know how many times I've said over the years I DON'T MIND if he drinks with his friends, and that I only didn't like when he took it to an excess, but he never stopped thinking I just didn't like it at all and, by extension, didn't like him spending time with his friends.

His issues with me were that he didn't appreciate that I had to work to put myself through school (he's never worked through his five years in college) and thought I spent too much time there and not enough with him. He wanted me to come visit him but when I couldn't get the time off from my job he resented me. He resented that my dad initially wasn't ok with me spending a weekend with my boyfriend four hours away and told me I needed to stand up to him. Every issue he had, I acquiesced and made the changes he asked of me. 

Last summer he had an internship, where he became chummy with a group of Ivy League kids who wanted to party hard with him. He got sucked in, broke up with me, and completely broke off all contact with me (mind you, we live just up the street from each other, so that was especially hard). But he kept flip-flopping about leaving me, telling me he loved me and didn't want to hurt me, sleeping with me (though I'm not blameless because I let him) and telling me he wouldn't leave me like he did freshman year of college. He ended up cheating on me with an intern, going out with her and the other interns and lying to me about where he was. He ended up completely fucking up at that internship, to the point where his bosses were so disappointed in him he was the only intern that they didn't ask to give a final presentation because he wasn't doing any work while he was there. He officially broke things off when he went back to school in September, and I was devastated. In response he told me I should go to therapy, like he did, to come to terms with it.

It wasn't until December that he admitted to me that he cheated. We were in his car and I flung open the door to storm out, and he grabbed my arm and wouldn't let me leave. He pulled me back, locked the doors, and begged me to give him another chance, telling me he wasn't a bad person, but someone who made big mistakes. That the therapist he saw told him he shouldn't tell me the truth about what happened if we weren't together anyway. He told me he loved me, missed me, and that he would work to rebuild my trust in him.

I went to see him at school in February, then in April, and each time he treated me like he used to when we first started dating. But something felt off. I NEVER used to try and see his phone or look through his social media accounts before the internship incident, but after the endless string of lies he started telling for three months, I became that ugly girlfriend that started to snoop, because I wasn't getting the truth from him, ever, anytime I asked. But when I saw him this last time, I went through his phone and found things that made me realize what was going on.

In March he went to Vegas for his friend's 21st bday. After Vegas, I noticed he started following some random party girl I'd never seen or heard him talk about before on Instagram. I figured he had to have met her there. When I went through his phone in April while he was sleeping, I found a photo of her on his phone. I confronted him, he claimed one of the interns he was still in contact with saw the girl and wanted a photo of her, so he screenshot it and sent it to him (which made no sense because her profile is public). He claimed he didn't have her number in his phone, that she walked up to him in one of the casinos in Vegas and asked him to follow her on IG, so he did.

After coming home I noticed his interactions on IG with her becoming more frequent. My college graduation was last weekend and he didn't come because he conveniently contracted strep throat. On a hunch, I logged into his Snapchat - he'd been chatting with her, meaning he lied again to me when he said he didn't have her in his phone. Her story on her Snapchat included a close-up of her tits with the caption, ""Real or Fake?""

I was so disgusted, so incredibly betrayed, that I finally told him I'd had enough. I couldn't take the thought of sharing a bed with him while he was communicating with some skank he randomly met in Vegas that he wouldn't have told me anything about if I hadn't been paying attention to his IG. He pinned the blame on me, told me I'd always been too negative, that he's met a new set of friends and doesn't have time for me - he has another internship this summer. I also discovered that around two weeks ago this girl came down to his school to party with him and his friends, something he again hid from me, when he claimed that he's ""honestly been so depressed lately about what he's been doing to me that the guilt is tearing apart his insides."" Guess he wasn't so depressed and torn apart inside that he couldn't party with her and his friends.

He tried claiming that he's never done anything with this girl, whose name I don't even know because she carefully hides it on all of her accounts, and again insisted he loves me and that he can't tell me enough how important I am to him. That I'm his best friend. I feel sick to my stomach waking up every day knowing that I was used for sex, that I allowed myself to be used, denying every feeling I had that he was lying to me. They say cheaters have a tendency to cheat more than once, and I kept wondering not if, but when, it would happen. I'm convinced he has, because every detail with this girl parallels the situation with the intern last summer.

The day I told him I couldn't take any of this anymore, and he said good bye to me, he continued to Snapchat the girl.

He's always been desperate for social acceptance, gravitating towards party animals because he's always felt insecure about being a nerd. He won't dress how he likes to dress while he's at school because ""nobody else around there dresses like that,"" he claims over and over that he doesn't like to drink but drinking is, literally, all that he and his new friends do when they're together, he admitted that he let himself get sucked into the non-stop party life with the interns last year because he'd never felt so socially accepted before, yet admitted to me that he knew that they didn't like him for him but liked him because he had the money to party. He hides his interests in video games, Magic, and computers and doesn't really engage in them because they're not what the bros he hangs with like to do, then claims he merely ""doesn't have time for them anymore""

What really hurt was when he said that he cheated on me because he didn't feel loved, by me or his parents. His parents, who pay for 100% of his existence and would do anything to help him succeed, who hold his hand through college, and me. Me, who have told him every day without fail how much I love him and how much he means to me, who has given him everything I have to offer and have told him that if I had more to give, I would.

Please help me. I am so distraught, so depressed, that I'm feeling and thinking things I know I shouldn't be. And feeling like worthless, used trash. 

TLDR: boyfriend has cheated on me, I took him back, he's fooled around again behind my back, has pinned all of his mistakes on being mistreated by me and his parents, prioritizes friends, now I'm feeling confused and lost, need help."

26q23u,8,2014-05-28,"So, there's this boy...",[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/26q23u/so_theres_this_boy/,"I know that a lot of you will think this juvenile and lame and if you don't want to hear an eighteen-year-old ramble about boys then I suggest you stop reading now. I also don't know if this is ""gender-related"" but I don't really know where to post this. This community is really kind and supportive so I figured I'd go for it, haha.

So, I've been at uni for a year now, and the whole year I've been single. I'll occasionally hit up guys I'll meet at a club (I'm studying in China, so legal age = 18), or kind of flirt casually with guy friends here at school. I personally really enjoy being single. It's nice kind of just caring for myself, trying to wade my way through the pool of sweaty nervous freshman without another half next to me. However, I also like sex and I'm also very quick to fall in like (yes that was on purpose). [It's rough](http://cdn3.whatculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/house-gif.gif).

At the beginning of the year, I really liked this one guy, even though I *knew* he didn't like me back. But I still allowed myself to embarrass myself by being really flirty with him even though I knew he wasn't that interested but was too nice+awkward to say so. Cringe moment - he and I were watching a movie together in my room (Silenced, or 도가니 in Korean. Absolutely tragic movie and based on a true story. It's a great watch but a sad time), and I put my head on his shoulder. Near the end of the movie, I started crying (*it's a really sad movie, okay*), and he just kept his eyes on the screen. I'm sure he felt ridiculously awkward and uncomfortable and ***ugh I cringe evrytim***.

Throughout the year, I've had this one friend who I met at the very beginning of the year, and the first thought I had was, ""Wow, this guy is *seriously* cute."" And he is! He's really attractive. He's going to intern at *Vogue* in Hong Kong this summer. Like seriously...wtf. 

The whole year, he and I have just been friends (probably more like good acquaintances, honestly...), but recently, he's started being very...personal. Like, he'll just really compliment me, or put a really comforting hand on my shoulder, or other things that are just the right amount of sweet but also respectful. Tonight, we went out and he paid for everything and opened every single door for me. He even pulled my chair out for me! I've always found that incredibly gentlemanly. 

The cynical side of me is saying that he just wants to get into my pants, but the optimistic, love-dovey, romantic side of me is saying, What if something good might come out of this?

My last relationship ended up with me calling the cops on my boyfriend because he'd gotten drunk and was threatening to cut me up with a knife. He broke into my apartment - literally banged my fucking door down - and started screaming at me for denying him sex (we'd had sex like the day before he did this) and when I tried to get him some water and sleep he ran into the kitchen, grabbed a knife, then came back, sliced a chunk of my hair off, and waved it in my face saying, ""You want your nose to be next, you dry little bitch?"" 

The thing is, I had no idea where that came from. He and I had been dating for a year and a half and we'd had a really great relationship (for those of you who believe high schoolers can't have serious relationships, I promise you, we were an exception of that belief). We were sexually active but healthy about it, and he'd gotten drunk in front of me multiple times with no negative events. He'd also show up at my house drunk a lot, and I would just give him water, help him wash up and go to bed, and make him breakfast in the morning. We'd *never* had an issue like that, and I honestly will never understand what happened.

So now, I won't lie, I'm a little scared to let my ""walls"" down. I'm finding it hard to trust people just because I'm *so scared* something like that will happen again, completely unprecedented. I've been sticking with the casual and trying to keep myself from getting too comfortable because scary shit can happen out of nowhere. 

But tonight, we were coming back from our dinner+movie group date when I caught a glance of myself in the window and kind of grimaced a little (my thighs are so *jiggly* ***ugh***), and he noticed. He looked at me and said, ""You look really beautiful tonight."" [And then he kind of just touched my cheek a little and smiled.](http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2012/362/0/1/i_got_a_boy_tiffany_by_maribeat-d5pis6p.gif) 

[mfw](http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130607195419/degrassi/images/f/ff/Tumblr_lhn2fgjYLH1qaz51t.gif)

And it was just such a genuine, kind thing to say...I haven't had a single guy talk to me like that so sincerely since my exbf a year ago and I just...I don't know. I think I've just been really lonely. Maybe it's time to open up a little?

Okay. If you made it this far, thank you. I'm kind of nervous to tell my friends about this because I'm afraid I'm overreacting and it won't actually work out, then I'd have told my friends for nothing, haha.

26q4qf,0,2014-05-28,I dropped out because college was getting in the way of my education!,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/26q4qf/i_dropped_out_because_college_was_getting_in_the/,"I completed approximately 3/4th’s of a CS and Math double major in two years before having a liberating epiphany.  I'm 20 years old and I've always been a little too clever for my own good.  Dropping out was a complicated decision and had many facets too it, but the gist is I know I can learn more and faster on my own!  


Why not learn on my own while completing a degree?  


Well I've always been a great learner, but a terrible student.  Educational systems are designed for the weakest link.  The degree program is designed to be passed by the least gifted student the university deems worthy of the degree, and thus not designed for me!


Since I was very young, school has moved at a snail’s pace and fills my time with fluffy or boring assignments.


And once I moved onto college I began paying out the ass for pressure to perform well in a system that places learning second to following the rules.  The reason school needed to go was to save precious time, money, and buckets of anxiety.  I'm foregoing a degree in the pursuit of a higher education, so to speak.


There are a lot of things taught and tested-on that seemed obvious, or that I already knew, or that could easily be forgotten in lieu of a google search.  I'm aware that through the whole degree process you learn some more subtle and subconscious skills that cannot be explicitly taught, but I believe universities have no exclusive claim to these skills.


So while I have major bones to pick with formal schooling, I’ve found a true passion in Technology!  CS, math, and the sciences in general simultaneously excite, terrify, and humble me every day.  I’ve been programming for less than two years but computers have indisputably become MY THING.  Humans are amazing; we’ve created so much and I want to learn about ALL OF IT!  This obviously won’t be possible, but I can try my best.


The dropping out is not in question.  It's already done.  So I'm NOT looking for advice on that (unless you have a thought-provoking case to make for going back).

With that in mind here is my plan -

Coursera, and similar websites, essentially offer university level education and courses with a lot of the fat trimmed off.  I’m going to continue “studying” through these free resources.  I’ll be taking a mix of core courses, stuff I’d be learning if I continued college, along with interesting or potentially unrelated courses that intrigue me.

I was learning the bulk of my college material the night before tests.  Essentially my semester consisted of three or four days of intense learning for each class.  This means I can (and have already done in the past) complete your average 9 week coursera course in about a week.  This sort of immersion and focus on a single topic suites my learning style and the furious pace makes me feel in control of my education.

All the while, I will be saving my code and cataloguing it in Github.

There are also many great text books I can work through to improve my knowledge in specific areas or technologies.

The second part of my self-education will be in projects.  I already have one big solo project near completion and several ideas for a variety of others.  Again, I will put these on Github and open-source them (unless they become commercially viable).

I’m going to be living in my college town for the next year, so I will still be able to leverage the resources of my university, which officially views me as a student on leave.  This means access to Hackathons, clubs, brilliant professors, and an awesome career fair where I hope to swing an internship.

If I can get a full-time offer afterwards I will explain that I want to begin working immediately.  I want several solid years of industry experience, while maintaining some extracurricular learning.  My ultimate goal however is to find or develop a business idea I can helm and to build my own company from there.


If you’ve read all this thank you very much for your time!  Now if you’ve got any more time, rip my plan apart as best you can!  Ask some questions!  Or just give me some honest advice!  It will all be appreciated. :)"
26q60z,10,2014-05-28,[f19] I can't help but feel increasingly guilty that I want to move out the same time my roommate (f20) does. Please talk to me straight.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/26q60z/f19_i_cant_help_but_feel_increasingly_guilty_that/,"I posted [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/26inlr/my_roommates_cat_20f_will_be_a_victim_of_a_murder/) a couple days ago about a minor issue of her cat waking me up all the time. It turned out to be a facet of a much bigger problem. 

**The background**

---

June and I aren't like, super best friends, but we hang out sometimes and discuss boys. I moved in february of this year and have dutifully paid rent and utilities since then. I didn't have a job, shaken from my last horrible roommate experience, but was happy to see that June was self sufficient and responsible. I even looked up to her. She made me aware she was leaving June 20th (before the lease ended) and I guess I never really considered that because I'm so new to leasing and generally adult related responsibility. 

So, I went around getting a roommate for just one month in july, then moving into a new place come august. That was plan 1. However, I didn't want to live with strangers (for my own safety) so I thought I had one with an old ex of mine. He ended up not being able to be my roommate for that month. Then, the people I was going to move in with turned out to just be way too new to adult type responsibility or just lazy, and I couldn't deal with the constant ""I dont knows"" and ""I'll have to ask my mom"". 

After the most recent fallthrough, I've decided to just live by myself. Its been several months and I know now that I can't put up with another person in the same living space as me if they aren't responsible with their finances.

**The Problem**

Well, to catch up with June and I's situation, *I was never put on the lease officially.* I remember telling her that I really needed to be on the lease so that I can get a state ID (and this is before I knew that I didn't), but she was busy so I just left it alone and gave up and went to the landladies and asked what I could do. One of them ended up sort of putting me on the lease, but it wasn't official until June signed it. The day I got back from the DMV, I told June point blank that it wasn't official until she signed it. 

Couple weeks went by, I ended up forgetting about it because I had to deal with a death and staying up all hours looking for a job. 

Well, lo and behold Jenn never signed me on. I asked her about it and she told me that she must had not been paying attention or drunk or whatever. I said okay, well I'm not on the lease anymore AND, I can't stay here anymore. I don't want to live with a stranger for a month. Well, turns out that June didn't know when the lease ended; she thought it was the end of July but it was the end of August. School starts for us both August 25th. This puts another cramp in the haphazrard plan because she's moving out June 20th to a new apartment, and said she'd be paying double rent.

She uses loans and her job to pay off her housing. I use what little I make off of freelance and what little money my dad sends to get by for now. In looking frantically and at all hours a day when I finally found both an internship AND a job oppurtunity... two hour bus ride away. But! It was a job! And I was estatic. I've yet to be hired at the second job but its a good chance I will be. I also found another place to live much closer to both school and work.

AND, I spoke to the leasing office and said well.. I'm not on the lease, so I'm not financially responsible. However, June did help me out so I decided I will. The landlady said I had six months to pay backowed rent (which would come up to 614, and I can pay 100 a month easily without stretching myself thin) so it worked out. Or so I thought.

June blew up and was so pissed. she said she wanted me to stay here because she didn't want to break her lease (even though she's moving out two months ahead of time). I told her that one, I couldn't afford to stay here because of how far away it was from everything, and two, the bus rides at night for when I get out of work/school is too dangerous for me to be alone on. She then told me to either take a cab or get a friend to drive me, but she didn't want me to leave. Find a roommate or something, she says. 

And then, she told me that we'd have to write a contract to say I'd pay it back, she siad six months was too much and do it in two or three, and all sorts of other things that I simply cannot afford. I'd rather be barely getting by in a safe area 15 minutes from work and 5 from school than two hours away on a bus just so that she doesn't have to break her lease. But if I stay until the end of August!!! most places wont have vacancies. This is my only window to get that ONE available unit in the place I found, and I can't guarantee being on time to school/work which'll lead to me getting fired and losing a credit. 

However, I feel like my safety is in jeapordy if I stay here. I'm not even on the lease so a have a lot of people telling me to not even bother and dont pay her, but she'll be a senior in college and I don't want to mess with her thesis. I mean, I Thought we were friends, but after the argument we had the other day I was shaken that she'd rather me spend four hours a day on the bus than move out and have me pay for six months- of which thats guaranteed money! 

Today we tried to discuss it again. She told me she didn't remember me telling her about it at all, and that it was my fault I didn't get on the lease, and that its ridiculous to expect her to pay for six months at this place. I can MAYBE swing three months, but I'm already working on 50 or less on food a month, and thats without it. When I get hired I'll be making a little over 2K a month! I still have to pay back my SO for some plane tickets and a medical bill.

After she stomped upstairs and clsoed the door, I felt so frustrated. I felt like I did everything right. I jumped on the ball and got myself on the lease cos I couldn't wait for her. I spent two months staying up every night looking and applying for places to work. I spent extra time working on commissions so that I can get some money. She got angry I spent 15 dollars on a chair and a lamp the other day because I thought I could maybe at least get something nice if I move out anywhere since the only furniture I have is a folding table, a bed on the floor and a desk chair. 

----

TL;DR: I moved in with an acquaintance several montsh ago. She intended to move out two months before her lease ends, and expects me to stay here so that her lease doesn't get broken and won't hear out any alternatives of me paying in six months. I'm extremely poor and can't safely get home if I stay in the area I'm in. Please help me see who is 'right' or 'wrong' and what I should do. "
26q8lg,14,2014-05-28,London --&gt; New York for 6 months as an intern aged 28 (on a professional trainee J1 visa) - stupid mistake or opportunity?,LNDtoNYCviaDoubt,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/26q8lg/london_new_york_for_6_months_as_an_intern_aged_28/,"(originally posted in r/advice)

Hello there.

Where to start.

I am a 28 yr old (f) living in London. I'm from London and have lived here for most of my life. I currently live alone in a very little studio flat almost bang in the middle of the city. Without wanting to get into it, as that's not what this sub is for, I lived with someone for 7 years until one day they left. So since then, I have been here sort of trying to figure things out and in some ways start again.

I work for an arts and culture publisher. I joined the company about four and a half years ago and via a graduate trainee scheme. At the time I earned about £12k and having worked my around a few departments (I can't really say I've worked my way up) I now earn nearer £20k. It's not been the easiest place to work and during the two winters before last I was working until 9pm many nights, in line with perfectionism of the company and the working culture there. It can be very negative. People will always point out what's gone wrong/artistic temperaments etc. So, having been there for a long time now and in some ways having never quite established myself (I've always been an assistant, in editorial and in digital) I have been starting to feel the need to get out.

I don't have a huge amount of confidence and faith in myself and often feel I don't deserve things/am worthy of things. That's one reason why I still live in this tiny room, I think (and yes, I have had therapy in the past and depression has been with me most of my life). Since the loss of that relationship, I have continually blamed myself, no matter what anyone tells me.

However, living alone has helped me in a lot of ways. During particularly good periods, I have done a LOT more - I don't own a television any more, I go to talks, I take photos, I started learning a new instrument, I read. I'm very good at going to things alone (music/cinema/openings) and have now travelled alone to quite a few places in Europe (and loved this feeling, for the most part).

So I had been considering a move to Berlin as I speak a bit of the language (and would love to learn), I spent a very happy time there 18 months ago, it's an arty city, it's relaxed, it's full of history, I just sort of took to it. Thing is, lots of other people of my demographic also want to move there so it's not really quite as simple as that. You also really do need to be fluent in German.

This year I applied for some good jobs that I wanted in the UK. In two instances I was told I was down to to final two, with no bad feedback but that 'someone more suitable was found' etc. I also applied for a couple of things in Berlin, but no joy.

Something else I applied for was an intern programme at a US arts foundation. I had a Skype interview. I had a further phone chat. I was then offered a place.

However, they had their initial doubts as to why I was applying, given my age and the fact that I already have experience. For anyone familiar with J1 Visas, they could have me on a Professional Training visa, rather than an intern visa. They find me an attractive candidate because of my experience but worry I would be bored. Other participants in the programme tend to be (though not *always) around 23/just finished school or finished with a little experience.

My answer was that I have never had the experience of moving to a new city, that being in New York for six months would be great in terms of personal development and that it is an opportunity I might not get again.
So. I could do this. It would mean using my savings and investing a lot but I could do it.

So why am I scared? Why am I wondering if I should go to Berlin? (which may just be a pie in the sky idea.) I am scared that because of my age I will be the 'weird older one' to others there or will struggle to connect. I am worried that the fact I have experience gives the impression that I know how to do lots of things - not really. As explained above, I've been somewhere a while but don't believe I've made a good impression or have lots to show for myself.

I have been to New York before (once) and obviously know what a cultured, exciting, insane place it is. I fear I won't be able to keep up and that everyone will be wildly ambitious and dynamic (especially if I am with 23 yr olds). Is the culture of the city just too much? (I'm someone with a love of the calmness and lack of population in Scandinavian countries [my favourite place in the world is Iceland] but also someone who often draws energy from the 'challenge' of London.)
But to do it would be a way to break a cycle, perhaps, of 2 and half years spent feeling very lost in a city I love but which is currently weighed down by many ghosts.

I'm scared I will never find anywhere to live, that for all my 'being good at travelling alone', giving to live abroad is something quite different. I'm worried that I have bluffed my way into this offer and neither I am quite the candidate they think I am and they aren't quite the opportunity I hope they are. But if I didn't do it, is that a bigger failing?

Reddit, does they seem like something I have haphazardly engineered or a genuine chance? Or could one turn into the other? Has anyone moved to NYC in a similar way? Any UK redittors who have spent a good chunk of time in the city?

Apologies for not explaining that too well, I can try and answer questions about any of the murky bits.

Thank you, for reading, really thank you."
26q9ln,1,2014-05-28,Job pulled out from under me.,fekkinpissed,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/26q9ln/job_pulled_out_from_under_me/,"Since 2011 I  had the ultimate goal of getting into a Video Production/AV position at a local museum.  My schooling (I believe) basically revolved around a position in an institution similar to the one I have been working at since graduation in 2010.

Starting in 2011 I was an unpaid intern doing the stuff I went to school for, shooting web videos for this institution and having them (the museum) promote events and activities using my videos.  I got a lot of constructive criticism that allowed me to hone my skills in video production that was/is extremely valuable.  These videos and internship were done under the largest department the museum has.  Fast forward two years, and I've found a day job, because I need money to live and eat.  In my spare time, I find freelance jobs where ever and whenever I can.  A local university hired me to shoot a lecture series for a single class lecture and gave me an intern.  This intern was very rough around the edges, he mishandled equipment, had zero production experience and ultimately proved to be more of a hindrance than as productive member of the team.  Whatever.  After many months of teaching this guy the ropes, he's finally at the point where if I bring him on to future projects, he isn't as much of a dope, than a handy extra pair of hands.  
The project wraps up and he graduates.  I'm still doing videos for the museum at this point, about one every two weeks and my 9-5 job is taking up more and more of my time.  I'm not one to shy away from stress or anything like that, but having both positions required me to be in two places at once.  So I brought him on, at first as just a second camera, and then I could offer different perspectives on new videos since it was just one camera and me for the previous projects.  Again, let me clearly say that he was only apart of the museum because of me and was not, at any point, an actual intern that went through the proper channels (like I did) to secure a position.  At some point, someone at the museum asked him for a resume, he listed internship at the museum as a job reference and they weren't happy that he was doing that since he never actually had been in the position.  For some reason, instead of ending it there, they gave him an internship on the same level as me, to make his reference on his resume legitimate. Again, whatever, I've been spread thin and there's no way at any point will this guy (due to his lack of real world experience and work ethic) will ever work his way past me.  

Some time goes by and he ends up working more with the AV department rather than the previous department we started at.  I'm working random events for both AV and the initial department but because he is a recent grad, and living at home, he has more free time so he works more often.

Starting at the beginning of this year, we were offered two part time positions at the museum due to the extra events booked this year.  So on top of the usual duties at the museum with videos, I'm working evenings because my 9-5 is obviously, taking up my time during the day.  20 hours a week, nights and weekends, (I should also mention that my fiance is a school teacher so the only time I ever get to see her is nights and weekends) and I'm there, doing what I went to school for and, for the most part, enjoying it.  My fiance understands the sacrifices we both have to make because she knows and understands my goal is to be hired in a full time capacity at the museum.  

The next big project at the museum is live streaming events.  They bring me in for consultation for cameras, microphones, and other equipment because I have some broadcast experience.  This other guy, has ZERO clue.  We've done a couple of streams at this point and the higher ups in the museum LOVE it.  At this point, I'm thinking that there isn't a thing I could do wrong for them to not offer me a full time position when it becomes available.

This guy and I also have teamed up for a couple of freelance projects.  The first project went extremely well.  We actually won second place in a competition, including prize money.  The second, not so well.  To give him credit, he found the job in the first place, thanks to his parents saying that he was this video whiz at the museum.  I told him that he can take the lions share of the projects money, as I'm taking the training wheels off because I'm busy my other jobs.  He coordinates interviews and ended up doing the majority of the editing, but I had to take off work to help him set up shoots (costing me money) and rent equipment (which we budgeted for, but he didn't ever pay me for it).  Once I got the final check, I find out that I lost money on this project.  SIGH.  Ok, the project looks awesome so it's not a total loss...

Two weeks ago, the museum finds money in the budget to offer someone a full time position.  I'm thinking here's my chance, it's been 3 years, I've got countless real world experience, I've shown my dedication to the museum via my work in both departments and the sacrifices I've made.  I'm thinking the interview is going to be a shoe in.  Nope.  Got word this morning that the job has been offered to this younger, less experienced guy who I had taken under my wing to help him get on his feet, professionally.  Only because he worked for the A/V department longer than I did.  Which he wouldn't even have had the opportunity had it not been for me, and the museum just handing him an internship without going through the proper channels.  

I am pissed.  They've since asked me if I want to continue my part time position but at this point I've had it.  Obviously me and my talents aren't appreciated and even when I calmly explained to them that this sets me back professionally, and I respect their decision (not like I'm going to delete all the videos I've done and burn bridges flipping the bird on the way out) my supervisor refuses to write me a letter of recommendation. Kicking me while I am down. 

Personally, I feel like what I have gained out of this experiences doesn't make up for what I have lost.  With the dedication I had to get real world experience out of college, I would've grown professionally anywhere and doing anything.  The museum was just a place that I always enjoyed going to growing up and my interest in history in general.  I feel used, looked down upon, and betrayed by this guy who never had any interest in working at the museum and was completely under qualified! I know your first reaction is that I'm not telling the whole story, but the only explanation to me as to why I wasn't offered the job was because and they said that it ultimately came down to his time in the AV department."
26qd7a,11,2014-05-28,"My (23F) boyfriend (22M) of four years has destroyed our relationship with his manipulation, confused and lost [serious]",FeelingWorthless100,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/26qd7a/my_23f_boyfriend_22m_of_four_years_has_destroyed/,"[WARNING: long, but I've tried to make it concise, but all of the details are necessary to get a clear picture of what's going on]


We'd been together four years; initially he was the most genuine and truly kind person I'd ever known. But he's always had an issue with self-esteem - he'd been in therapy as a teenager because of a birthmark he has that affects him psychologically to this day (though it's not visible under clothing). He once got a haircut he didn't like that made him cry. He is a nerd (which I like - rather, liked), but he would try to hide his hobbies because they weren't ""cool.""

When he went to college he broke up with me because he was four hours away (and obviously wanted freedom). He got into drinking, so much so he was falling asleep under tables and not doing his classwork. His parents pulled him out after a year and sent him to a community college because they pay for his tuition and didn't appreciate him throwing away the education they were paying for. I don't have a problem with him drinking, but I also didn't like the person he became when he drank, and since he's a lightweight it only takes half a beer for him to start to lose it. Though we had little contact after breaking up because he didn't want to speak to me, he once texted me drunk, telling me the booze made him a better person.

Six months later he wanted me back. I agreed, on the condition he lay off the alcohol to the extent he was taking it in - I don't have an issue with drinking, I just don't like people who have to get shit faced every time they drink, like he was. For the next four years we were fine, though he always held against me what he perceived to be me not liking him drinking AT ALL. I don't know how many times I've said over the years I DON'T MIND if he drinks with his friends, and that I only didn't like when he took it to an excess, but he never stopped thinking I just didn't like it at all and, by extension, didn't like him spending time with his friends.

His issues with me were that he didn't appreciate that I had to work to put myself through school (he's never worked through his five years in college) and thought I spent too much time there and not enough with him. He wanted me to come visit him but when I couldn't get the time off from my job he resented me. He resented that my dad initially wasn't ok with me spending a weekend with my boyfriend four hours away and told me I needed to stand up to him. Every issue he had, I acquiesced and made the changes he asked of me.

Last summer he had an internship, where he became chummy with a group of Ivy League kids who wanted to party hard with him. He got sucked in, broke up with me, and completely broke off all contact with me (mind you, we live just up the street from each other, so that was especially hard). But he kept flip-flopping about leaving me, telling me he loved me and didn't want to hurt me, sleeping with me (though I'm not blameless because I let him) and telling me he wouldn't leave me like he did freshman year of college. He ended up cheating on me with an intern, going out with her and the other interns and lying to me about where he was. He ended up completely fucking up at that internship, to the point where his bosses were so disappointed in him he was the only intern that they didn't ask to give a final presentation because he wasn't doing any work while he was there. He officially broke things off when he went back to school in September, and I was devastated. In response he told me I should go to therapy, like he did, to come to terms with it.

It wasn't until December that he admitted to me that he cheated. We were in his car and I flung open the door to storm out, and he grabbed my arm and wouldn't let me leave. He pulled me back, locked the doors, and begged me to give him another chance, telling me he wasn't a bad person, but someone who made big mistakes. That the therapist he saw told him he shouldn't tell me the truth about what happened if we weren't together anyway. He told me he loved me, missed me, and that he would work to rebuild my trust in him.

I went to see him at school in February, then in April, and each time he treated me like he used to when we first started dating. But something felt off. I NEVER used to try and see his phone or look through his social media accounts before the internship incident, but after the endless string of lies he started telling for three months, I became that ugly girlfriend that started to snoop, because I wasn't getting the truth from him, ever, anytime I asked. But when I saw him this last time, I went through his phone and found things that made me realize what was going on.

In March he went to Vegas for his friend's 21st bday. After Vegas, I noticed he started following some random party girl I'd never seen or heard him talk about before on Instagram. I figured he had to have met her there. When I went through his phone in April while he was sleeping, I found a photo of her on his phone. I confronted him, he claimed one of the interns he was still in contact with saw the girl and wanted a photo of her, so he screenshot it and sent it to him (which made no sense because her profile is public). He claimed he didn't have her number in his phone, that she walked up to him in one of the casinos in Vegas and asked him to follow her on IG, so he did.

After coming home I noticed his interactions on IG with her becoming more frequent. My college graduation was last weekend and he didn't come because he conveniently contracted strep throat. On a hunch, I logged into his Snapchat - he'd been chatting with her, meaning he lied again to me when he said he didn't have her in his phone. Her story on her Snapchat included a close-up of her tits with the caption, ""Real or Fake?""

I was so disgusted, so incredibly betrayed, that I finally told him I'd had enough. I couldn't take the thought of sharing a bed with him while he was communicating with some skank he randomly met in Vegas that he wouldn't have told me anything about if I hadn't been paying attention to his IG. He pinned the blame on me, told me I'd always been too negative, that he's met a new set of friends and doesn't have time for me - he has another internship this summer. I also discovered that around two weeks ago this girl came down to his school to party with him and his friends, something he again hid from me, when he claimed that he's ""honestly been so depressed lately about what he's been doing to me that the guilt is tearing apart his insides."" Guess he wasn't so depressed and torn apart inside that he couldn't party with her and his friends.

He tried claiming that he's never done anything with this girl, whose name I don't even know because she carefully hides it on all of her accounts, and again insisted he loves me and that he can't tell me enough how important I am to him. That I'm his best friend. I feel sick to my stomach waking up every day knowing that I was used for sex, that I allowed myself to be used, denying every feeling I had that he was lying to me. They say cheaters have a tendency to cheat more than once, and I kept wondering not if, but when, it would happen. I'm convinced he has, because every detail with this girl parallels the situation with the intern last summer.

The day I told him I couldn't take any of this anymore, and he said good bye to me, he continued to Snapchat the girl.

He's always been desperate for social acceptance, gravitating towards party animals because he's always felt insecure about being a nerd. He won't dress how he likes to dress while he's at school because ""nobody else around there dresses like that,"" he claims over and over that he doesn't like to drink but drinking is, literally, all that he and his new friends do when they're together, he admitted that he let himself get sucked into the non-stop party life with the interns last year because he'd never felt so socially accepted before, yet admitted to me that he knew that they didn't like him for him but liked him because he had the money to party. He hides his interests in video games, Magic, and computers and doesn't really engage in them because they're not what the bros he hangs with like to do, then claims he merely ""doesn't have time for them anymore""

What really hurt was when he said that he cheated on me because he didn't feel loved, by me or his parents. His parents, who pay for 100% of his existence and would do anything to help him succeed, who hold his hand through college, and me. Me, who have told him every day without fail how much I love him and how much he means to me, who has given him everything I have to offer and have told him that if I had more to give, I would.

Please help me. I am so distraught, so depressed, that I'm feeling and thinking things I know I shouldn't be. And feeling like worthless, used trash.

TLDR: boyfriend has cheated on me, I took him back, he's fooled around again behind my back, has pinned all of his mistakes on being mistreated by me and his parents, prioritizes friends, now I'm feeling confused and lost, need help."

Some back story for those who care, I was originally doing computer science at my local university. After three years in the major it just wasnt for me since I wanted to do IT work but the school offered only a few courses and people I talked to said it really didnt teach them much. So I felt my only option was going to community college so I took that route, and here I am about to graduate next semester with a associates in computer science and a few certificates from the school.

Just before this summer break started I tried to apply for an internship hoping it would help me learn the ropes, but sadly after sending my resume out I got no responses. I was curious if this was because of my education or lack of experience, thus began my deep anxiety. So now I am looking into a certification with cisco for a CCENT or with microsoft for a MTA for now and move up later when I have the money. The problem for me to move onto certificates is a class in my state costs over $2000 and I feel its a big step to take.

Any opinions or advice would be much appreciated. Thank you in advance."

I am an electrical engineering student with 3 years completed. I had an internship last summer at a major metal compagny and I ended up programming VBA apps and playing with databases for the whole summer. I was bored as hell, and I thought I just had a job that didn't suit me really well (although I love programming, I was the webmaster of our student association and I enjoyed it a lot). I just said 'Whatever, the next one will be more fun'.

Now, I'm currently working for a major power compagny and this time, I feel like I am doing stuff withing my field. After a month, I mostly did data parsing and analysing within Matlab and I am currently writing procedures for electricians and technicians on replacing equipments. Sounds good, right?

The thing is... I find myself bored to the bones.

I don't understand... I love the field a lot, I have a whole lot of fun making circuits and playing with my Raspberry Pi, I absolutely love to learn stuff (I easily spend complete evenings on Wikipedia learning about anything physics related). I have good grades, I love learning in school, but when it comes to work, I don't enjoy it. 

Is it because this is only an internship and engineers mostly give the boring tasks to their interns? Are all engineering jobs boring? Am I in the wrong field? Am I lazy?

My boss (engineer) says I am doing a good job, but I end up doing what he asks me to do in a short time and then I browse reddit for the rest of the day.

I feel lost, I don't know what to do. Were your internships like this, and then it changed when you had your first job?"

I'm used to having shorter hair since that allowed me to hop out of bed and not having to worry what my hair looks like. Lately I have been growing it out to give you guys some more options. I am about to start a nice internship and I want to look the part. I'm getting it cut/trimmed tomorrow so I would appreciate ideas and advice!

Needs to be business professional. I don't want to spend too much time on it each day (around 5-10 minutes). I also need lots of advice on hair products because I have next to nothing.

At the end of my album I have a hairstyle I tried that you could give feedback on.

Thank you so much for any help you can give!"

This idea is based off the experiences in my life and wanting to give other people the same opportunities I had.

In a nutshell, I want to create a non-profit organization that provides low cost IT and computer services to businesses and individuals alike. That may sound pretty basic, but what makes my idea different and special to me is that I want to use the business side to offer training and internship for troubled young adults (17-24). Basically the staff would be made up of individuals who need help getting into a career but can't afford college, or someone who is involved with substances and trying to get on the right path. The organization would provide mentoring, training, and a wage (~$10/hr). IT is the perfect industry for this because anyone can learn the basics and then branch out into so may different areas after time. 

This idea is still in its infancy and I am just looking for input on it. Feel free to critique it if you'd like. 

Any help on where to get started on something like this would also be great!

Thanks

26qno4,1,2014-05-28,I need help with MS Access =O,[deleted],learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/26qno4/i_need_help_with_ms_access_o/,"I have little experience with MS Access aside from a basic college class on the absolute basics, and now my internship position requires me to construct a usable and practical database to store and access service tickets.  If this isn't the correct subreddit to post this in, let me know and I'll move it.  Otherwise, here's the scoop... if anyone could help me, I will be forever in debt.  I've been researching every how-to on Access I can find and I think I've reached the point of being paralyzed with too much information.  A guiding hand of someone who knows what they're doing would work wonders!

I'll give whatever details I can, without giving any confidential info.  If you could help guide me through the big picture of things and how to even begin this, I'd be happy with that.  


1.  This company keeps an excel sheet (A HUGE Excel sheet) containing their service tickets that track bugs, enhancements, and other things that need to be completed on their systems.  The Excel sheet has well over 600 rows, and it has 30-ish columns.  The columns are along the lines of Ticket ID, Date Added, Description, and tons of very granular descriptive things.  Also, there are multiple types of ""Priority"" rankings that are put into an equation in their fields to come up with a total ""Priority"" ranking that helps them determine what jobs get done first.    

2.  They're tired of the excel sheet because it's cumbersome.  They want an Access database that will do the following... 

      1) Import new Excel sheets as a means of reconciliation and updating the Access database with new tickets.
    
      2) Export printable reports on open tickets in the database to various formats.  (Top 10 highest priority, oldest open tickets, tickets related to bugs, type, category, etc, etc)

      3) Display the information in a clean, but informative form that is easier to use than the Excel sheet.  (They will utilize this in virtual meetings with developers on what jobs need to be done and which ones can wait)

      4) Enter tickets directly into the Access database.  (In the case of individual tickets, not existing excel sheets of tickets)

      5) Perform calculations given the different types of priorities.  In the excel sheet, there are different Sub-Priority rankings.  (Customer impact, financial impact, etc)  These columns are put into an excel formula to come up with a total Overall Priority number.  This calculation should be performed in the Access Database, the same way it was done in Excel in the past.  


       If you read this far, thank you!  I'll take any help I can get!

I was morbidly obese as a kid. I was the social reject in high school and couldn't get a date to save my life. And when everybody in my senior class was getting their acceptance letters I left school empty handed and headed on over to community college after graduation. I

One of my childhood friends' mom referred to me as ""The Black Forest Gump"". My coaches and teachers thought I was dumb and soon I truly believed I was dumb. Especially when my class rankings came out and I was in the bottom 50%.

I had a job at Target as the cart attendant or better known as ""The Store Bitch"". I basically did everything anybody else didn't want to do.
I was in the break room one day reading ""Howl's Moving Castle"" and one of my co-workers came in and looked at me so surprised. Almost as if he thought I couldn't read. And I'll never forget the day when an old man asked if I was retarded and I think something snapped inside of me.

I picked up web development courses at my community college and I practiced hard and earned myself a nice internship at a beautiful company. After that was over with, I became a project manager who oversees a team of developers. I did this all without a degree to define who I am and I'm just here laughing at all of the people who called me stupid my whole life.I have a beautiful fiancee and we have a deep love that most people would envy. Now whenever I look at other girls, they come off as basic and insignificant to me, even if they are pretty.

However, this had made me pretty arrogant. I know that there are millions of people better than me at what I do. There is just a buzz I get out of seeing people blow all of their money going to school for a piece of paper. I get a buzz out of watching the people who waved their expensive university degrees in my face who are now working average 9-5's. I may not be making as much money as them yet, but I know that my potential will be much higher.

Just watching the student loan balance skyrocket into the billions and watching people get their monthly bills of $300+ is amusing. My siblings are going to be in debt for awhile, and I should feel bad for that but I just don't feel bad... at all. They got both got elite private school educations while I got put into a special needs school. Which I appreciate, don't get me wrong. They helped me deal with my learning disorder and turn it into something good.

I see people who major in business and marketing as people who are just looking to get into the bottom barrel of a company and hope to crawl their way up. The whole education system isn't broken. People just go about it the wrong way. It is a tool, not a gateway. If I flashed a community college degree at someone expecting to get a job, I would get laughed right out of the building. But if I combined the education I received and continued to refine myself with it, I'd become successful. This is a working progress, but I'll let you know if this is true.

I have taken pride in knowing that my boss has hired me for my brain and the blood that runs through my veins and not a piece of paper or a school I went to. He even told me that it's just a piece of paper. I have a long way to go and I'm not making much but I feel as if my hard work and defying the odds just makes me better than all of those university graduates. My mom wants me to get a degree while she's on this earth, but I just don't see that happening.

What do you think? Does that just make me evil? What are your thoughts on this?"

It's been a little while, hasn't it? Gallerian did give me permission to tyoe up his stories with FancyHam and share them with you all. I tried to get him to do it himself, but he's kind of scared of Reddit so I'm the messenger. All of these have been related to me by him. I did not. However, personally witness them, so they may have been embellished a bit. 

Characters: 
Gallerian Marlon: mid-twenties client/tech-team liasion dude. Badass cancer survivor, and my ex (although we're still very good friends). From a very wealthy family and... admittedly, does like money a lot- this is important later. 

Large Marge: A secretary at Gallerian's company. Middle-aged, quite obese, but a pretty fun person overall- I met her at the company Christmas party. Sometimes will quite literally throw her weight around though if you piss her off. 

FancyClient: A balding middle-aged man of average weight who is one of the biggest clients of Gallerian's firm- he owns a business that does work with his company. Has about as much personality as a bowl of oatmeal, and tries to make up for that by wearing really expensive suits. 

FancyHam: FancyClient's wife. Middle-aged as well. I met her once- fairly short, probably getting close to 400 pounds. Is disturbingly attracted to Gallerian despite the fact that she's married. 

It was supposed to have been a pretty normal day for Gallerian- makin' dat money, bullshitting clients, you know, the usual. He had two meetings with clients that day, one with a woman who had ordered some payroll software for her business, and FancyClient. Neither was going to be a big deal- the woman had given Gallerian (and by extension, the programmers) the go-ahead to do whatever as long as it was functional, and Gallerian has been working with FancyClient for a while. The first client came and went, and Gallerian got ready for FancyClient. 

All of a sudden, though, Large Marge knocked on the office door. 

&gt;Marge: Heads up, FancyClient said he's bringing a guest to the meeting. 

&gt;Gallerian: Oh? 

That was a bit weird because FancyClient had *never* brought in someone to a meeting before- he always came alone, but Gallerian can roll with thiings. But then things got even weirder. 

&gt;Marge: I honestly don't know how many guests he is bringing, though, because when he called he requested that there be two dozen donuts in the meeting room. So I sent one of the interns to Dunkin Doniuts to get them. 

&gt;Gallerian: 24 donuts? How many people is he bringing! They won't all fit in my office! 

&gt;Marge: Well... that's the weird part. He only said he was bringing “a” guest, not “guests.” Well, whatever. You'll handle it? 

&gt;Gallerian: I guess, yeah. 

So the intern returned with the donuts, and Gallerian set them up in his office. He mooched a few chairs from his coworkers, hoping that there really wouldn't be that many guests, because he wasn't sure if they would all fit. 

Then, he heard this thundering sound. One thing you should probably know about Gallerian's office building is that it's in a refurbished block of what used to be townhomes. The stairs leading up to the floor his office is on do have this weird hollow quality that makes even a little kid going up them sound like a herd of elephants.. This... this sounded like someone had strapped metal shoes to the elephants. Gallerian and Marge looked at each other,, and then the door flew open. 

A woman approximately the size of Marge herself, probably a bit bigger, barged into the room. According to Gallerian,, she was dressed like she was going clubbing, and had on these sky-high stilletto heels- that would explain the strange sound of the stairs. FancyClient was right behind her, poking his head around the massive woman. The woman wasn't impressed with what she saw. 

&gt;FancyHam: This is the firm that does the work for you? It's so cheap and tacky looking! 

&gt;FancyClient: Dear, we've used this same company for years and we've never had a problem with it before. 

&gt;FancyHam: Hmph. Whatever. 

&gt;Marge: Ah, FancyClient! It's good to see you! Are your other guests coming? 

&gt;FancyClient: Oh, no, only one guest. My wife, FancyHam, wanted to come check out the company, so I said okay. 

&gt;Marge: Oh. Okay. Well, Gallerian is waiting for you, so if you'll just go right ahead into his office... 

FancyHam thundered past her and barged straight into Gallerian's office. Gallerian is somewhat frightened and looked up to see this woman bearing down on him. 

&gt;FancyHam: Well aren't you just the cutest thing! I could just eat you up! Awww, and you got me donuts, too! 

Gallerian watched in horror as FancyHam picked up an entire box of dozen donuts and started snarfng them, but not before she complained that there weren't any vanilla cream-filled donuts. 

&gt;FancyHam: Make sure there's vanilla cream ones next time, those are my favorite! At least a dozen of them! I need donuts in the morning! 

FancyClient came in and he and Gallerian talked shop while FancyHam snarfed the donuts- all two dozen of them, one after another. The rest of the meeting went well, at least, Gallerian thought it did. Just before they left though, FancyHam turned to Gallerian and smiled at him- he said it reminded him a bit of a very hungry shark. 

&gt;FancyHam: I'll be seeing you very soon, my husband just does so much business with your company! 

Gallerian later told me he knew *exactly* how Nozomu must have felt when Banica was hitting on him. 

TL;DR- my ex meets a client's wife, said wife devours 24 donuts and ominously predicts that they'll be seeing a lot more of each other.

The local library's internet doesn't allow for League and every other WiFi spot in the godforsaken town isn't fast enough to play League and I have disconnected in almost every match. -.- So, I was going to upgrade my data and use my hotspot(which works surprisingly well!).

When I went to Verizon the sales people told me this was a really bad idea because hotspots are horrible for my phone and would mess the battery up permanently and do other damage. They said if this was my plan for just browsing the internet, it would be mostly okay...but since my plan was League, they thought it was a really bad idea for my Iphone.

So my question is: Is this true or just a way for them to try to get me to go with the more expensive option/maybe are uninformed? Is there another way to get internet connection for 2 months? Help!

Those of you without cars should know how frustrating it is to need be be somewhere but not have any car to get there. I mean, I can't even get to a fucking interview cause my parents work and they need the cars. I can't get choose the schedule of classes I want cause of no car. I can't work more than two days a week cause of no car. I can't be with my friends cause I don't have a car. I've missed out on so many opportunities because I don't have the job hours to keep up with car, insurance, and gas payments. 

Jesus H. Christ! I remember as a kid how much I took transportation for granted. If I needed to get to school, I got there. If there was a concert for me to perform, I got there. If there was a doctors appointment, I got there. Now, as a near adult I find my parents bailing on my internship interviews. I can't hang out with the few friends my introverted, unsociable self has cause they can't spare the gas or the time.

And yeah, yeah I know, work more hours! Find a cheap car! Get a friend to ride you! Easier said than done...

If there's one good thing it's that I've gotten desperate enough for transportation for me and my parents to agree that all I ought to use  my financial aid money to get a car, even though it was explicitly given to me for the use of tuition, books, and fees. Oh well, hope the donors don't find out, and if they do and they're disappointed, then sorry but thats what desperation does to ya...

How much does Accounting knowledge from courses help when it comes to real world practice? I always hear people say that what you learn in school is useless when it comes to the real world, so I'm not sure at all if I would be a good or bad Accountant. 

I will be doing a Tax internship at a B4 this Summer and I feel like I'm not going to be very good at it. I have a pretty decent GPA and I do well on Exams, but I remember the one time in my Tax class where we had to actually file a Tax return. Everyone in the class was clueless and we all consulted our textbooks throughout the whole project and even then, we still struggled a lot. So while I make good grades, I feel like I struggle with applying the Accounting knowledge that I learn. 

Is an internship the true weed-out process to see if you are good at Accounting or not? Is there any other way to tell if you'll be cut out for it? Also, how good is the training that interns and new hires go through? Will someone with poor Accounting knowledge (I just feel like I don't remember very much from my Tax class a year ago) be able to learn what is necessary to do the job well?

I didn't make friends or get close to anyone because I was ""too busy"".  I did really well in my interviews and was hired over people who have more experience because of a gut feeling my bosses had about me.  

Now I have this job and I feel like a wreck a lot of the time.  I am around the most important people in my region and I can hardly speak.  During meetings I can barely make a sound.  I've encountered a lot of these important people in different settings where I feel more confident, but I keep freezing in the workplace and making myself look like a fool.

Small talk is so important and yet I can't seem to even make a sound in some situations.  I know a lot of my coworkers forgive this and brush it off as youthfulness or inexperience, but there are people not much older than I am in positions of ""power"" who are social and friendly.

I don't expect to become a pro overnight, but I need help surviving and thriving in the workplace.  It has already been six months and I still feel immense fear as if I just started.  I spend a lot of time hiding in my office working and hoping no one stops by.

I do have anxiety, though, and have been in a group therapy for it. But right now, I am certainly depressed.

I really have no idea why. I just feel sad and worthless. Like, what's the point of anything? I recently finished my first year of college and it was a blast! But when April started coming to an end, I fell into a terrible depression. Like, couldn't get myself out of bed, eating my feelings in Chipotle depression. The thought of leaving my beautiful college town and new friends broke my heart.

And now I'm home, back to working at the fast food place I've been employed at since I was a junior in high school. My friends and I meet up every now and then and my boyfriend and I text nearly everyday. But I'm just sad. 

Mom wants me to get more hours at work. I know 20 or so a week isn't enough but going there is so painful. It's not a bad job and my coworkers are kind and funny. But doing the same thing over and over again, being berated by customers for stupid mistakes I shouldn't even be making is hard. I dread going to work. I can't even make the time go by quicker. I don't sing as much as I used to while doing the dishes or wiping things down. 

I know I'm spoiled. I had it so good in college. Between the freedom to walk anywhere I want (the town I live in during the summer has no sidewalks and you can't get anywhere you'd actually want to go without driving 15+ minutes) and the family I found in my speech and debate team, I had a home. And now I'm here. And yes I do want to sleep all day so this summer can go by quicker. I had a few plans for summer (jogging in the mornings, getting an internship at a local newspaper), but I can't motivate myself to follow through.

I love my parents dearly and I'm happy to be here, but I want to go home. And I know my mom thinks my change in mood is because of her or to hurt her but it's not. There is literally nothing I can do to raise my spirits or cheer up. I've tried. I don't know what to do, and because I feel guilty for hurting her, I ended up hurting myself and I'd gone 6 whole months without doing so. 

I was happy for a while today when I got a job get for next semester, but it all came crashing down when I had to remember that FASFA screwed us over and we lost thousands in financial aid and have no idea why. 

I just want this mood to end. I'm sick of being sad. I don't want to hurt myself anymore and more importantly, I don't want to hurt anyone else."
26rg27,2,2014-05-29,Scared,nahob,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/26rg27/scared/,"So I have been afraid about my job recently. I'm not even exactly sure why. I tried to explain to someone earlier today but I don't think I got my point across at all.

I guess, put simply, I'm afraid of not being good.

I have no reason to be afraid of not being good... I mean I've done well at school and I've done well on my own. I've done well with projects, for school and outside of school. And I enjoy doing it, I get things working. I've helped other students. There's not a reason as to why I should be scared of not being good.

It's just the work environment. I am afraid of not being good in the work environment. Not being able to fully understand everything I need to in order to be a productive member of a team. I try though, I really do. I'm at my first internship now and I think... I'm doing ok. Not fantastic. For example, this week I'm aiming at getting ~20 points (Keep in mind I wasn't even assigned 20, and the points are arbitrary, and the rest of the developers aim for getting 50...) for my first full-time sprint.

Okay, all that aside I am still scared. Like Office Space and all those software engineers just not making money or just not liking their job and stuff like that. Is it really like that? If it is, how do I avoid that? I feel like my current job is like that... Jesus it's sort of identical to it. Low pay, irritating office environment, and I'm even writing bank related applications to top it all off.

I'm just afraid of that. Of not being able to support myself in this career. Of being dirt poor even though I'm working. I know my skills are highly demanded and they take a good amount of knowledge and skill! BUt there are those people saying you don't need a degree to get a job in this field. Isn't my degree worth something?

Working what I think is a dead-end, soul sucking job as a bank teller. Stuck at a fork. I don't know which route to take. Would love to hear some opinions with folk in either industry.

**Programming Route**

I'm currently in the process of sealing the deal for a temporary internship as a data analysis/programming position at a startup. This was the route I wanted to take initially. I figure, get my foot into the tech industry. Study as much as I could on my own (Excel, SQL, and a programming language) while I absorb as much as I could at this company. Then potentially get proficient at programming. Proficient enough for me to land a job in San Francisco. I've always had a thing for computers and I figured this ""would be the one"" career I'd be happy with.

* Cons: 
* I'm not sure how far I can get without a BS in CS.

**Loan Officing Route**

Now I have an older friend (almost like a mentor) who is a successful loan officer in LA. Makes quite the living for himself. We recently had lunch and he is more than willing to take me under his wing and teach me the ropes. Its something I think I can be decent at. He told me to think about it and contact him if my internship falls through. 

* Cons: 
* Not stable. Unsure of market outside of LA.
* Not sure how sustainable it is (long-term)
* Want to move to SF in a few years. Not sure how mobile this career is

Any help would be nice. I'm trying to approach this at as many angles as I can. "

26rpek,5,2014-05-29,Econ or CS? [SERIOUS],crasss,makemychoice,https://www.reddit.com/r/makemychoice/comments/26rpek/econ_or_cs_serious/,"I know this question's been asked before [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/makemychoice/comments/1x2b0s/should_i_pursue_an_economics_degree_or_a_computer/) but my situation's a little more complicated and versatile. 

As of right now, I'm a freshman at UCLA in Engineering Undeclared currently taking CS and Economics classes. So if I do transfer to Econ, I probably cannot switch back to CS.

Also, I have this sort of fantasy that whichever one I do, 1. I'm going to try to land a job in some artsy / media company like Vimeo or Adobe or 2. I would somehow incorporate my passion in film and art with the job or 3. I would make the mulah and be able to afford to travel and make films. 

So far, the workload for CS is crazy and I've had no time for anything, so I'm wondering if it does get easier or if you just get used it (by that I mean you still spend ages on a program but you just have more patience). 

As for Econ, it's definitely a lot easier and if I do switch majors, I would be learning AfterEffects and making videos on the side (as well as be more involved with clubs and social stuff). I might even try to do film internships on the side if I get good enough. But also, idk about future jobs in Econ. 

I know I don't want to do the film major, since my interests are more on short films &amp; commercial edits and not on narratives but I am open to other majors.

TLDR: is there a job that incorporates creative arts and compsci / econ / (some other major that makes money)? I would like to get some professional degree and keep one foot in the arts"

i'm not generally an anxious person. 

but i had a phone interview the other day and my heart was exellerated which made my breathing uncontrolled and my voice shaky. my hands were shaking and i was blushing badly.

i am a young adult so ive not had too many 'serious' jobs in my life. i know i am capable of interviewing decently and 'faking it' (confidence) as i have done it before, however that interviewer was relatable/welcoming and i was feeling confident at the time.

i left my last job (only 'serious' one- in corporate) recently, which i was at for a year and i interviewed terribly there. i remember thinking it was so formal as there were 2 interviewers and it was downhill from there. looked so uncomfortable, blushing, barely answered q's, umming and ahhing. they gave me the job which was ridiculous, but i guess they saw on paper my potential and were willing to give me a chance as it was an internship.

so yeah, it seems i do have anxiety under interview situations when i dont feel confident? plus now as i said, it has been over a year since my last interview, which was shit anyway.

can anyone relate or offer advice about minimising my nerves,  controlling breathing, looking less uncomfortable??

26safm,79,2014-05-29,[OC] The Egixus War: Chapter Seven,Manufacture,HFY,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/26safm/oc_the_egixus_war_chapter_seven/,"Chapter 7: People of Earth

The break room was well-stocked. Its spacious interior had enough room for fifteen tables, dozens of chairs, four coffee makers, a pair of refrigerators, and a state-of-the-art food printing machine. 

In the corner of the room was a small couch made of compression foam and covered in expensive hand-stitched leather. Upon it sat a ten year old boy with unruly black hair that hung well down his forehead. 

He sat motionless, save for his breathing which was slow and relaxed. His grey eyes, which everyone was quick to say matched his mother's, were transfixed on the opposing wall. 

The entire wall was alive with motion and color. The nano-circuitry meshed into the wallpaper let you change its design to whatever you felt like. Normally, a singular setting was chosen: a meadow with chirping crickets and grass blowing the breeze or a window looking out on a famous city which allowed the workers at Ethereal Concepts to watch real-time footage of what was happening across the entire planet as they ate their lunch. 

Displayed on the wall today, however, was a podium. Flanking it were two huge flags colored red, white, and blue. Behind it was a great eagle embronzed upon a seal. 

Across the front, a red banner repeated ""President to Speak about Crisis"".

Erik Wren wasn't scared anymore. When his father had changed their destination and called his mother, Erik was so afraid that he could hardly breath. 

""Karen,"" his father had said over the XLR's built-in phone, ""I need you to pack up everything now.""

""What do you mean, Thomas?"" she had asked him.

Glancing at his young son, Thomas pressed a button on the console of the car and the conversation was transferred to a small silver and blue speaker in his ear.

""Turn on the news."" He said, with a strange expression on his face.

After a few moments of silence he spoke in response to a prompt that Erik no longer could hear.

""Honey... Karen... calm down."" He paused again. ""Karen, look at the pictures. There's no way they...."" 

Thomas's face looked pained.

""I know... darling, I know. Karen, please focus. They're gone, Karen.""

Erik reached up and grabbed his father's datapad from where it sat, forgotten, on the front passenger seat. Displayed upon it was the same picture that his father had received a few minutes earlier. Erik looked at the burning buildings. 

""Whoa"" he said, with an awe that only a child can muster.
Then he read the caption at the bottom of the picture: ""Los Angeles Annihilated"".

*That's where grandma and grandpa live!* He thought. *I wonder if they got to see what happened.*

His father's voice grew louder and interrupted Erik's thoughts. 

""Karen, you need to listen! There isn't anything that we can do about that now, I need you to pack our things."" his voice dropped down again, ""Darling, please, for Erik's sake.""

There was a long pause as Thomas listened intently. Then he spoke again.

""Ethereal Concepts....""

""Yes, we'll be there....""

""I'm sure he'll be safe Karen.....""

""Ok, see you soon....""

""I love you.""

His father pressed a button and ended the call. For a few moments he stared blankly out the front windshield at the passing suburban landscape as the car made its way out of the center of the city. Soon it would pass rolling hills and then rocky edifices on its way to his offices.

""Daddy?"" Erik asked, his voice small. ""What's going on?""

Thomas gave his son a helpless glance. Then he took a deep breath and began to speak.

Now Erik knew and he wasn't scared anymore. As he watched the news, he wondered if Grandma and Grandpa had made it out alright. He was sure they had. Grandpa was  a tough old man, he had been in the military. He'd give these aliens a fight, for sure.

""Stay right here."" His father had told him before leaving to find anyone who hadn't yet fled home to their families. Erik had heard him muttering something about needing to ""accelerate preparations for departure"" as he left the break room. His balding head shining in the white fluorescent light.

""Ladies and Gentlemen,"" a voice sounded from the screen, ""the President of the United States.""

A woman with long red hair walked with a stately stride out from the right side of the screen. Erik heard the shutter of clicking cameras. She took her place behind the podium at the center of the screen.

He thought she looked tired. There were lines on her face and bags under her eyes. Her suit looked wrinkled. He was certain that she could have fallen asleep standing if she had needed to. 

""My fellow Americans,"" she said, sounding exhausted, ""to fellow nations, to all of the people of the world."" 

She paused and took in a long breath, lifting herself higher off the podium.

""As of this morning, we found out we are not alone in the Universe.""

""Something terrible and malicious has found its way to our home. These beings have shown no mercy.""

""As I speak to you, Bejing, Hong Kong, London, Tokyo, Manila, Berlin, Rio de Janeiro...."" she paused, ""Los Angeles, and San Fransisco have all been destroyed.""

""The death toll is in the hundreds of millions. Perhaps even greater.""

""Our military responded rapidly and appropriately alongside our allies, but this foe has an insurmountable technological advantage over us.""

Erin saw tears well in her eyes. Soon they were rolling freely down her face. She didn't seem to notice.

""So far, none of our conventional arms have been able to significantly impede their assault. However,"" she paused, and something flashed across her face. It looked defiant. ""a secret project instated by my predecessor has been re-purposed to fight these aliens. A Lunar magnetic acceleration cannon has been fired at the alien vessel in low Earth orbit. It was a direct hit.""

She paused, letting the words sink in.

""As of right now, it appears damaged and shows no signs of activity. Clearly, these things can be damaged and destroyed. To that end, I have ordered the First, Third, and Fourth Fleets stationed near Hawaii to begin their assault on the ship still near San Fransisco. These brave men will be joined by the entire home-based US Air Force as well as several thousand surface missiles.""

""We are going to bring that fucking hunk of metal out of the sky. We are going to retake the initiative. They may have started this fight, but we are damn well going to finish it.""

There was thunderous applause that came from somewhere off screen. Erik clapped excitedly from his spot on the couch. His grey eyes were wide with interest.

An intern ran up to the President from off-screen. He leaned in close to the President and attempted to whisper in her ear. He spoke too loudly, and Erik heard what he said.

""Madam President, the ship has powered back up. The Hammer is not yet prepared to fire another round.""

The room was still roaring with applause, but Julia Edwards suddenly looked anything but excited.

26sw9h,1,2014-05-29,I [20 F] am not sure how to move forward with my boyfriend [21 M],[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/26sw9h/i_20_f_am_not_sure_how_to_move_forward_with_my/,"i have been in an on/off relationship with my boyfriend for the past (almost) three years since the beginning of college. we are now heading into our senior year. we broke up last december and essentially got back together last summer but did not make it official until this past november. because of the nature of our relationship, i never pushed for anything. he made the move to want to get back into a relationship, and due to a shitty housing situation, he also moved in with me this past year. reasons that we broke things off in the past were because he felt like he needed time to figure stuff out for himself and because we communicated very poorly which led to a slightly hostile environment at points, but we never lost feelings for each other. when we got back with each other this year, things were great. we learned to communicate well with each other and we're very open, we haven't fought about anything in ages, we haven't lost any sort of affection towards each other. i felt like we've really grown in the relationship. 

yesterday, he asked me if we could talk. he felt like things were weird and he just wanted to discuss it with me. i was happy that he was being honest about how he was feeling (because in the past, we have had issues with that). basically, what he said was that he feels like he hasn't had a true college experience because he has just been dating me and doing work the whole time. he hasn't been able to go out and have that much fun (which is mostly due to work, in my opinion) and i think he feels slightly tied down by the relationship...which is true but for me, i don't mind because i think it's worth it. he also feels like he doesn't want to date me for X number of years and not have us get married in the end because we've put a lot of time into this. but at the same time, he doesn't really see us getting married at this point. and he would feel bad about himself if i was the only person he dated and we didn't even end up getting married for that long. i am confused as to why he is already thinking about marriage, when we're barely 21. he said that since people get married after three years of dating, and he cannot see us like that, he doesn't know how he feels. but i think that's crazy -- i mean, dating in college is much different than people dating for three years in the real world and deciding to get married. i, for one, do not want to think about marriage for another 3-4 years at least.

at the same time, i do see us potentially having a future. i would like to see how our senior year goes, but i could see us staying together after college if it works out that way. 

why is he so stressed about our relationship and marriage? i would love to get someone's perspective on this. it seems like he is partly thinking about all of these things because during the year, with schoolwork and everything it is hard to think about things...but now that he has a lot more time, i almost feel like he's over thinking. and i really don't think he would've said these things if we were still living together like during the year. i feel like the lack of contact over the summer + the time to think about things really isn't helping. i told him i could give him some space to think about things, but i don't know how to feel. it's making me doubt the relationship even though i thought things were fine. to make things more complicated, he is leaving the state for an internship this weekend for 9 weeks so we won't be able to see each other except on the weekends every now and then. 

tl;dr my boyfriend cannot seem to get over the fact that i am the only person he has dated through college and feels like he might be missing out because he does not see marriage in our future at this point"
26szjz,815,2014-05-29,TIFU by farting in my doctor's hot interns face,badbrained,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/26szjz/tifu_by_farting_in_my_doctors_hot_interns_face/,"Although this happened many years ago, the humility scar will always remain...

I was 13 and taking my annual physical for football (american), and it was the first time my mother allowed me to go into the doc's office while she waited in the lobby. I had just started going through puberty and was extremely proud of the hair i had sprouted around my business, and in a fucked up way was somewhat stoked to have the doc see the man I had become.

So I get escorted back to the exam room where I wait for 5-10 minutes for the doctor to come in. He comes in with a smoking hot 20 something intern with clipboard in hand. I'm thinking to myself, ""all good..shes just taking down my vitals and she'll be outta here""...that thought lasted seconds, up until the doc said ""Hey Badbrained, this is such and such my intern, are you ok with her being here for your exam?"" Inside, I was screaming FUCK NO IM NOT OK, but in an effort to not look like a bitch, I agreed to her attendance.

Knowing that I'm moments away from exposing myself to a drop dead gorgeous intern, I end up wigging myself out to point that my 13 year old junk had completely turtled inside my pelvis. I panic, and start thinking of ANYTHING arousing to pop the guy back out, but to no avail. I was so nervous, I thought I was gonna puke.

Doc gets to the hernia exam portion of the party, and both he and the intern crouch down to inspect my tackle. He's facing me on one knee, while she's off to the side slightly...but RIGHT the fuck up in there. He tells me to turn my head and cough, and I oblige. Evidently I didn't cough hard enough, so he asks me to do it again. This time, I cough so fucking hard I twist my body along with my head, and accidentally blast her right in the face with an out of control fart. Doc looks up and says ""Yeah son, not THAT hard"".

I was so embarrassed that I made up some bullshit months down the road to my mother so she would be down with me switching doctors. Good times. "
26t10l,23,2014-05-29,[Hospital/Medicated/Positive/VBAC] Penelopes' Birth Story!,chantpleure,BirthStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/BirthStories/comments/26t10l/hospitalmedicatedpositivevbac_penelopes_birth/,"It was early in the morning on the 16th of May 2014.

I was woken up by Arthur but I was too tired to actually get up and get dressed.  Both of us had come down with some sort of terrible cough-your-lungs -out cold a few nights before.  So I brought him into my bed and closed my eyes, hoping he'd get the hint (this never works).  So I was laying there trying in vain to get a few more seconds of sleep when I felt something snap inside me. 

Shit.  Shit...shit shit shit.  Definitely waters breaking.  Shit. 

I lay there for probably a full minute with Arthur staring up at me thinking to myself, well.. If I don't move, nothing will happen..right?

Tentatively I stood up and fluid fell out of me onto the carpet. 

Shit...I meant to get the carpet cleaned this weekend too.  Bollocks. 

I grabbed the nearest cloth, my pajama bottoms and wedged them between my legs.  Then I grabbed my phone and called Brian.  It rang for a while and I thought I might have to call his school and talk to the secretary.  Thankfully he picked up the phone just before it went to the answering service. 

""Hey, my water just broke"" I said and the reality of what was happening was starting to sink in because my legs were shaking from adrenaline at this point. 
""Ok, crap..really?  I just got to school.  Ok, I'm turning around."" 

I had to wait half an hour for him to come back, during that time contractions started in earnest.  This was a surprise as I never really experienced them with Arthur.  I wandered around the house with my pajamas between my legs, catching more fluid.  I went to the toilet at one point and more gushed out.  This made the contractions more painful. 

I called my parents house and spoke to my brother, ""I'm having a baby today!"" i told him and he laughed.  Then I spoke to my mum.  I wish she had been able to come. 

Finally Brian arrived and we got everything ready for Arthur to go to my friend's house and be watched by the nanny.  Then we drove to the hospital.  I had the bright idea of stopping in walgreens on the way to pick up some pads.  I had packed my underwear with cloth diapers and believed that I wouldn't have another big gush.  We walked around the store for a few minutes.  It felt really weird to have the staff greet me while I was having a contraction.  The day seemed brighter, more vivid somehow... and the people just going about their ordinary business seemed out of place in my world that was changing so rapidly.  We were standing by the cold case looking at drinks when there was suddenly another uncontrollable gush of fluid.  It seemed to go on and on.  I grabbed Brians arm and said 'Shit shit shit shit' While I felt certain that there must be a puddle around my feet and I'd leave a trail of fluid when I tried to leave.  When the gush finished Brian checked me and there was no puddle, no river of amniotic fluid.  So we went to the cashier.  She looked at my belly and at me as I had a contraction and I said, 'We're having a baby today.'.  She wished us luck and congratulated us.  Then we went to the hospital. 

There was an elderly lady (I'm guessing a volunteer) working the welcoming desk.  She told me that someone else was being checked in and would I like to sit down... so I told her I didn't want to leave a puddle on the chair.  She said she usually had pads in her desk but that she had run out.  So she handed me a teeny tiny facecloth to sit on.  I felt really silly perched on the edge of the chair with this tiny square of cloth protecting the fake leather upholstery.  Unfortunately I am a typical Brit and hate to make life harder for other people. 

When we got back to triage the nurse hooked me up to the monitors and offered me juice.  I watched the contractions with interest.  They had definite peaks and were coming every 2-2.5 minutes.  They were painful but not too bad.  The sensation of fluid dripping out of me every time I moved or did anything was probably the hardest thing to get past.  When we potty train we're taught that that wet feeling is bad and it's hard to let it go and relax enough to just let it happen. 

After about 2 hours in triage the nurses who were going to take me to my labour room showed up.  The main nurse was called Debbie and she had an intern with her whose name I don't remember (sorry!).  They walked me down the corridor to Room 10, where I would spend the next 7 hours.  Debbie had this habit of opening her eyes really wide when she was talking to me which drew my attention to the spidery application of her mascara.  She had really pretty blue eyes and fair hair.  She was a great nurse and never broke eye contact when she was talking to me, even though I looked away plenty of times. 

Debbie brought me the birthing ball and Brian decided he would go to the canteen to find food.  Honestly, at this time the contractions were becoming so painful I didn't want him to leave me but I knew he was hungry so I told him to go.  I had always thought that I would want to move through the contractions to help with the pain but it started to get so bad that I became very insular and still during them. 

At about 2pm I decided I wanted the epidural.  Debbie had been on the phone with my OB and she suggested starting pitocin to try to get things moving faster.  I really wanted to avoid another cesarean and I thought this might be the best way.  Between feeling water coming out of me and the pain of the contractions I was unable to relax in between them. 

The epidural insertion was fine.  Brian didn't have to leave the room and the anesthesiologist was fairly gentle though he seemed to not believed me when I started to talk about my previous c-section and the pain relief I received.  At this point I was thinking that I would have a vaginal delivery so I just hoped that I wouldn't have to see him again. Something I never read about is how the epidural doesn't take effect right away.  It takes about 15 minutes for the pain relief to get to its maximum.  Once it got there I felt pretty good.  Debbie had me propped up on a pillow to help the epidural spread to both sides. 

At around 3PM I started to develop a slight fever and Penelope's heart rate was not coming down in between the contractions.  An oxygen mask was put over my face and I started to feel scared that a cesarean was going to happen.  I was shaking.  My Doctor showed up at some point in there and checked me to find I was at 6cm.  She suggested tylenol to see if that brought the fever down.  So I took the tylenol with the smallest amount of water possible just in case I needed a cesarean.  No one offered me ice or water anymore.  I felt like it was going to happen and there was nothing I could do about it.  I started to feel very scared and like I wanted to get up and run out of there.  Debbie raised the bed so I could sit and hopefully Penelope's head would put some pressure on my cervix.

My Doctor came back with the repeat c-section paperwork.  She put it on the table and I turned my head away from it while trying to suppress the tears I felt welling up inside me.  Brian said he knew I'd be devastated.  Everyone was talking about me like I wasn't there and with the oxygen mask over my face I felt as though I had been gagged, that I couldn't say anything at all. 

My Doctor decided to check me again at 4:15PM.  She smiled at Debbie as I watched them and told her 'she's a 10!'.  Maybe it would be ok. 
She told me most women push for at least an hour if not more with their first labours and she wouldn't let it go on for too long because Penelope's heart rate was still staying in the 180's.  I felt disconnected from everything at this point.  I still had the mask over my face.  They said with the next contraction I could try pushing.  When it came I pushed and my Doctor and Debbie both let out sounds of exclamation, with one push I had pushed Penelope's head all the way down the birth canal so it was peeking out of me.  When the contraction ended Debbie went to get the mirror so I could see.  The stupid mask was removed.  I was allowed to have ice!  It was going to happen!  I felt overwhelmed at this point because she was nearly here and I was going to birth her myself.  I became very internal.  My doctor left the room to talk to NICU and I pushed again with some more contractions.  Debbie knew when to call back my Doctor and in she came.  I was barely holding back sobs at this point.  I remember as she put on her blue outfit and the mask I felt so overwhelmed and excited.  I pushed two more times and the head came out.  I stopped pushing and started to cry, 'don't stop Sophie! One more push for her body, come on!' so I pushed once more and felt her slide out of me and she was placed on my chest.  I was crying, she was crying.  I stared at her and finally stopped sobbing enough to say hello.  She instantly stopped crying and opened her eyes to look at me.  It was magical!  After a little while NICU needed to look at her so they took her to the warmer and I lay back, so relieved.  My Doctor caught my eyes and I exhaled what felt like the breath I had been holding the entire day and smiled at her.  She said it was the best smile she'd seen me give for a while."

I'm a 20ish european guy that often thinks about suicide, I enjoy the lilttle things about life but wonder what's the porpuse of life, isn't easier to end it all together?

I'm doing a 3 months unpaid internship ending in july and it was one of the worst things that could happen right now because I I literally don't do nothing in it, I could care less about that area, I wake up at 6am, see that girl on the subway sometimes and think to myself I would never get her because I would never talk to her and if I did I would dissapoint her.
I wonder on my way to home if being alone and wait for the end of the internship is worth just to go to the university.

I have very good friends, we talk about almost anything, we often hang out, get drunk and relax together.

I don't know if I'm making sense but I get angry, sometimes about nothing at all, I just show it more physically when I'm drunk, and in bad mood during. I'm really agressive on my soccer play style, I have this friend who is 1,90m and +150kg, when I'm in bad mood I usually doesn't stand a chance and sometimes he gets some injuries. Btw I'm lilttle, 1,75m and 75kg.

I just can't find a reason to live if all I do is wake up, study/work, get sad about don't finda that girl, get home, do something for 2h and sleep. It can get better but the sun is shining and I'm often not smiling while I think about my pathetic life.

I think about suicide often and would do it if he it wasn't for my close family and friends. Is all of this normal or I should get help? I don't want some profissional help because my parents would flip if they found out I think about all of this."

Ten minutes into the party and she already had beer spilled on her going out dress. At least in Kim's mind it was a going out dress. Her going-out-on-Friday-night clothes looked like everyone else's Wednesday afternoon clothes.    

Why did she let Angie and Dawn drag her to these things? Roommates were the worst part of college. She could be back at the dorm.     

Weekends were prime League of Legends time and she was certain her rank was going down with every stumbling drunk couple she passed in the hallway.
    
And her head hurt something fierce. Her roommates thought she'd been using the headaches as an excuse to be antisocial. They were so insistent that telling them that this was one of the worse ones yet. It wouldn't just sounded like a bigger, lame excuse.
    
The downstairs bathroom line was practically out the front door. Kim found her way upstairs to a second bathroom that reeked of vomit and possibly other body fluids she didn't want to think about.
    
There was a guy passed out in the shower, not the bathtub, the shower, door closed, his face smushed against the glass. Maybe he wanted to get away from the smell but still needed to crash.     

She checked herself in the mirror, the beer stain was larger than she though. A big wet, brown circle running down the front her top.    

Her head was throbbing. She checked the medicine cabinet for aspirin. The only bottles she found in there was for some mouthwash and Pepto Bismol. Did Pepto work on headaches?    

Another stain appeared on her hand while she was reading the label. A tiny red dot. She brought her hand up and it came back dripping with blood.    

She closed the cabinet. Her nose was bleeding. Her nose never bled.
She scrambled for something to wipe it on, realizing the bathroom had no towels or toilet paper. She ended up accidentally rubbing her nose on her sleeve before she thought twice about it.    

Once she saw the bloody streak on her shirt she felt a quick burst of anger rise up – why was she so awkward and stupid!?    

CRACK, the bathroom mirror broke. It didn't shatter but now there was a fracture crawling right up the center.  
What are the odds?  
She sat back onto the rim of the tub and reeled back when her hand came back wet.  
She didn't have to wonder about the smell anymore. It was very clear someone had left a stomach load of vomit in tub. The guy in the shower wasn't so dumb after all.  
Who's house was this anyway?    

-------


Eddie loved Jeff Struber's parties. Good music, good people, and a smoking hot brunette that was guiding his hand up her dress.     

Eddie had his eyes on her all semester. Angie he thought her name was. “Angie” wasn't a knockout, but she had firm tits and knew how to work a dress that was two sizes too small. She was only one of at least 12 chicks he had invited to the party, but she was the one he wanted.    

He also loved that it wasn't easy. This school was full of what he called Two Drink Minimums, get two cocktails in them and it was pretty much all good to go. “Angie” (maybe her name was Allie) could hold her liquor and had been surprisingly good to talk to. Eddie was the type of guy who liked a bit of tit for tat – it made him feel like his game was that much tighter. And he'd been on fire the last few months. His roommate Pete had given him this weird book all about the power of suggestion. Basically you believe and want something hard enough and the universe gives it to you. Pete was trying to use it land an internship at a tech startup. Eddie had been using it to get girls.
And if Angie/Allie wasn't proof of the power of suggestion he didn't know what was.     

He'd suggested they go to the backyard because there'd be fewer people. But when it ended up being just as crowded and he suggested they carry on anyway, she got to it. The girl was a 7 at best but she made out like she was earning payments into her 401(k). When the headaches started up, Eddie was annoyed at first, but he kept pushing through. Tequilla shots were usually enough to quiet them down. He'd been having more of them lately. Pete joked it was probably just his “eternal hangover.”    

*Please don't let my period start now.*    

Eddie heard her voice clear as day. Impossible because their lips were locked at the time, but it was unmistakably her voice. “What's that?” he asked. She gave him a confused look, then pulled him right back in for another cigarette-flavored kiss.    

-----
    
Angie and Dawn wouldn't answer their phones.    

Kim was a mess, too embarrassed to go back downstairs. Instead she was sitting, curled up on the hallway floor. Whenever someone came by she put her head down, pretending to be passed out.    

One or two nice guys asked if she was okay, but she was too embarrassed to look up. She gave them a nod, head buried between her knees and they moved on.    

She could still feel the headache. But at least the nose bleeds had stopped.    

Her phone buzzed – finally!  
But it was a text from her mom – random characters. Her mom was the queen of the butt text.  
A second buzz gave a little more hope, but it was just a Facebook update. Someone had released the new ranking rules, it'll be based on your current ELO and top ELO from the preseason. That was good to know. But she knew somewhere there was a kid in Korea practicing to kick her ass.    

She texted Dawn again – Where R U Guys? I think Angie is wit sum dude. I need -  
Another text from mom popped again in the middle of her typing. Kim cursed and her phone flew out of her hand, crashing into the far wall.      

Had she thrown it? She crawled over and picked it up, it was smashed to shit, the screen wouldn't even work.  
She hoped that crack in the wall where the phone hit had always been there...    

-------    

Eddie was downstairs pounding another cup of beer. His head was killing him.    

He'd lost track of Angie (Allie?...Alice?). Pete found him and asked what happened. Eddie lied and said he'd gotten a blowie.    

The truth was...he wasn't sure. Things just got weird. The more Eddie thought for her to do something, the more she did it. It was like she was reading his mind.    

But there was also an impression, not voice, just a really strong feeling – like he could tell she didn't really want to be doing this. He felt other notions to: he felt she wanted to quit smoking, she didn't want to be a finance major, her roommate with all the computer game shit kinda grossed her out. As they continued to kiss Eddie got a strong flash of an image of Angie/Allie/Alice, it was of him, standing at an altar at the end of an aisle, dressed in a tuxedo, then putting a ring on her finger.
Too weird! Eddie pulled back. He was gone before she could say anything.    

It was too crowded and loud down here. This was the fifth time they'd blasted that damn Drake song. The one song in the whole universe of top 40 hits he couldn't stand. And each time they played it everyone acted like it was the first time.    

Upstairs was a good plan. He hoped he wouldn't find a bunch of people rolling on mollies or something weird up there.    

------

    
“You okay?” She was leaning up against the wall. She tried to play it like she didn't notice, hard to do when you're the only two people in the hallway. “Huh? Yeah I just, I lost track of my friends. And my phone broke.” She showed him. It was more like a handful of crumpled parts than a phone.    

“I uh, I guess I dropped it.” She said, anticipating his question. “Who're your friends?” “You know Dawn and Angie?” “I know an Angie...I think.” “Did she have some guy's tongue and fingers meeting through opposite ends of her body?” Eddie felt a wave of embarrassment, he wasn't sure why. But that image of him sliding a ring on Angie's finger popped into his head again. “Uhh, nope nothing like that.” “Wasn't the same Angie then.”    

Who was this girl? He hadn't seen her at any of these things before. His head was starting to feel better. The idea that he'd stumbled across an untouched freshman excited him. It could have been the alcohol finally kicking in...better late than never.    

“Rough night?” He'd taken notice of the stains on her clothes. Kim had been angling away, hoping he wouldn't notice.   
 
She'd seen this guy around before. His name was Ed or Pete or something like that. She remembered Dawn gushing all over his Instagram one night. Kim didn't realize you could take pictures of your abs from so many different angles.     
   
“Just clumsy I guess,” she finally replied. “Lot of people down there.” “Yeah, that sort of thing tends to happen at parties.”   
 
He didn't know why he was so sure, but he was certain this chick was thinking about his abs. Dudes at the gym always said don't skip leg day – sound advice, but ab and core day was the work that got you laid. Just be nice, he thought.     
Be nice to her. She needs help. You can be the hero that swoops in and saves the day. She'll do a lot for that.     

Kim knew there was no reason to, but there was a warmth coming off of this guy, something alluring. Kim hoped deep down she wasn't a slave to Instagram abs like Dawn.    

“Something I can help with, you need a ride home maybe?” Say no, she thought. Just say you're fine and stay right here. You can sneak out when the party dies down.    

Tell her you'll walk her home, Eddie thought at the same time. It'll be like chivalry. Let her know you're a nice guy. 
“I mean we could just walk if you're not comfortable. Are you in one of the dorms?”  
Kim found herself stepping toward him. She hadn't even realized she'd started walking. He seemed like a nice guy. 
Eddie thought the girl was actually pretty cute. If you ignored the stains and the fact she was dressed like Old Navy was her favorite store, the girl was at least a 6. Sixes were totally doable. He wondered what her tits looked like.    

Kim was close to him now. Close enough to see those Instagram-famous abs poking through his shirt. Had she even said she would like a ride home? She couldn't remember.    

Her head was pounding. It was hard to think straight.  
She pressed against him. She wanted him to know what her tits felt like. Eddie smiled. It was always the quiet ones. She didn't protest when he took her hand and put it around his waist.  
She likes that, he thought. She likes guys that take charge. They all like that. Just make a move man.  
They pressed again the wall and for an instant Eddie felt like he knew a lot about this girl. He didn't mind the impressions this time. He felt impressions of a grey cat with white stripes, a woman butt-dialing someone?!...When he closed his eyes he saw flashes from some kinda video game.    

--------
    
“What's League of Legends?” he blurted out.  
Something snapped in Kim. How had she ended up in this position, up against the wall with this guy? Who was he?  
She'd had one drink downstairs. Had someone put something in it? Had this guy put something in it? It didn't seem plausible, but why else did her head hurt so much? Why was she so dizzy?  
No she, thought. She'd been warned about this sort of thing.This always happens at these kinds of parties.Who was this guy? This was Angie and Dawn's fault. Who's house was this?    

“Jeff Struber.” His answer surprised her. “You just asked whose house this was.”  
Had she asked? It didn't feel like she'd said anything.  
Kim thought about fighting. But he was so much bigger. If she did it might just make him angry...don't fight.  
Another sudden image came for Eddie – a flash, this girl naked, lying curled up on the floor, crying. Torn clothes on the floor. It hit him like a punch in the nose, Eddie stepped back.  
“What was? -” She wondered what he was doing. This was her chance, she had to call for help. Maybe someone would hear over the music. Someone would have to hear.  
He seemed as confused as she was. He was probably wasted. As soon as she thought about it she could smell the tequila and cigarettes. He took another step toward her.  
NO! Kim wanted to shout, but no words came. Instead the pressure in her head hit her like a lead pipe.  
Eddie had been punched in the stomach before. That's what it felt like. But he was certain the girl hadn't moved.  
It was only when he noticed her moving away from him that he looked and saw his feet floating up off the floor.  
It happened in slow motion first. It was like that moment on a roller coaster when you're teetering over the first big drop, waiting to go down.    

Then it hit him all at once. He flew back with a force that took his breath away. He hit the wall behind him and felt it give out, splintering around him. His feet dangled two feet off the floor.  
Then the wall gave out and crumpled. Eddie fell sideways, tumbling down the stairs.    

When Kim opened her eyes there was a hole in the wall across from her. No sign of the guy with the abs. The music had stopped. She could hear the yelling from downstairs. A few girls screaming. Guys yelling for someone to call 9-1-1.    

What happened?    

Kim moved to the top of the stairs. She saw the guy, lying at the bottom. The floor had cratered where he'd fallen. His knees were touching, but his feet were pointed in opposite directions. No way he was that flexible.    

He wasn't moving. There were guys standing over him calling his name – it was Eddie. They told him not to move, help was coming.  
Eddie saw her. The horrified look on her face. Her nose was bleeding. When did that happen?    

She came a few steps downstairs. Their eyes met for a moment, it seemed to frighten her. Or maybe he was really messed up. He couldn't move enough to tell. He couldn't feel anything but the hammering sensation in his head.    

He felt another impression before she disappeared back upstairs. She felt sorry. Why? This wasn't her fault It couldn't be. But what had happened? His head hurt too much to remember.    

...Kim. The thought hit him like he'd know it all his life. Her name was Kim.    "

Is there anything I can do to increase my chances?,[deleted],ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/26t94c/not_happy_currently_as_a_business_systems_analyst/,"I work for a Fortune 200 company and I was hired on from an internship after working at the helpdesk for a year.  I am currently working as a Business Systems Analyst but the position doesn't really seem that ""IT"" to me.  It's more customer facing and not what I envisioned doing for my job.  

I held an internship back in college where I put up server racks and did networking and other hands on support which I LOVED but it was only for 3 months.  I also held a job as a computer technician at my university for 1.5 years which was less involved but I still got to play ""hands on"".  

I'm just not happy with my job.  It's not terrible and in fact I probably sound ungrateful because they pay me very generously.  The thing is I AM SO BORED.  I literally do maybe 2 hours of work a day.  Some people would call this a dream job, but even redditing for 6 hours a day is boring.  I want to go somewhere where I can do hands on stuff like a System Administrator job.  

I am afraid to start applying for System Administrator jobs because while I am working in IT, I'm not getting the ""experience"" I should for that positions even though I've held those types of positions in the past.  I know I can go through training and learn quick but I don't think a company will see that, unless they see something in me in an interview.

I expect to get a lot of responses regarding certifications but I'm not sure how to go about those or which one to get, let alone if I want to do all of the studying and paying for the test.  Does anyone have any tips?"
26tgus,3,2014-05-29,Did you switch to Web Dev from an entirely different career?,NoobPwnr,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/26tgus/did_you_switch_to_web_dev_from_an_entirely/,"I’d love to hear what it was like if you switched to Web Development from a completely unrelated career. 

I ask because I’m slowly considering it and would like to limit any unrealistic expectations – that the grass is greener, so to speak. 

If you did, what was it like? What's different about your daily work life, your metrics, your work relationships, your overall happiness? For example, I ponder what it will be like working with people who are more technically-minded than I'm used to. What it will be like having metrics that aren’t based on sales number. What it's like to be in a situation where my output (code) must sync with a group (back end, UI, etc), as opposed to something like sales where I’m an ""individual contributer"".

About me: 30 years old, basically been in sales since my degree in business. This includes retail sales, some retail management, web startup sales, and now a web startup position where I’m responsible to build traction via customer acquisition, product feedback and innovation, marketing, you name it. 

I love computers, am creative at heart and enjoy building things. I have a knack for design and web products and actually serve as a intermediary between our sales team and the Product Manager. I considered pursuing it but feel that I'm more creative and less analytically than the PM role requires. Over the past year I’ve been spending around four hours a week familiarizing myself with HTML, CSS and JS via studies and projects. I feel like I’m reaching a point where I’m starting to imagine the realities of pursuing it as a career, and this is causing these questions to arise. 

I might have lofty expectations, but I figure I should also explain how I foresee the future looking. Feel free to critique: *continue studies and building out small projects. Get into boot camp here in SF in six months. Land intern or junior position at a company that doesn't ask for highschool GPA / what it was like working for McKinsey. Snag a role model at work, work hard, continue my education, and either work my way up there or find an entry level position at a new company. Either continue on that path, or try my hand at freelancing / starting my own small web development company.*

Thanks in advance for sharing any similar experiences and words of advice."

26tln0,4,2014-05-29,Why is the UW screwing over students so hard in tuition?,[deleted],udub,https://www.reddit.com/r/udub/comments/26tln0/why_is_the_uw_screwing_over_students_so_hard_in/," Why is the tuition a whopping $12.5k a year when the UW is sitting on an endowment bank of 2.3 billion dollars up 235 million on last year? If they took the 235 million dollar increase from last year and put it towards lowering the tuition of the 29 thousand undergraduate students they would  have lowered it by over $8k meaning it would instead cost us only $4.5k. They would still have their 2.1 billion dollar bank that they had last year.

And to make matters worse despite the overpriced tuition and large endowment the university still won't get its act together regarding the abysmal acceptance rates of its engineering schools and other programs. Computer science and engineering has dropped below a 28% acceptance rate and other programs are having similar funding issues.

What the fuck is going on and why the fuck are we getting screwed over so hard? What happened to this being a public university? I don't know how they expect students like me to be able to afford $27k a year costs. The only reason I'm able to keep attending is because summer software internships pay well and I work 40 hours each week while going part-time(which doesn't save much on tuition...). Which is pretty pathetic for a public university. By no means is the problem only relevant to the UW. It's an issue across the entire American public university system at the moment. However that doesn't make it any better."

Thank GOD my program starts tomorrow, I am so freekin bored! This morning I went on a small adventure to find breakfast as well as just see more of my area. I found a super market that's way closer than the one I went to yesterday and also found one of my favorite street food breakfast items. I'm not sure what the Chinese name for them is, so I just call them crunchy egg wraps. Tons of street vendors make them, all in their own unique way... However they all include at least a thin layer of cooked egg (it ends up lookin like a huge crepe) with these crunchy bread things and spicy jam (same thing I put on my noodles for lunch yesterday, did I mention this stuff is everywhere in China?)l mine included cilantro and also ginger I think. At some point I HAVE to make it over to the university, they have by far the best street food I've found in Shanghai.

I took my food back to the hotel and ate while screwing around on the internet, thankfully it's much faster than the last time I was here (still easily 10 times slower than any US internet I've been on). After I finished I sat out on my balcony and realized my hotel has a whole park for guests, there's even a really cool pool and gym. So I decided if I'm gonna be bored I may as we'll be bored and sexy, so off to the gym it was!

So the gym was a nice break from boredom, even if their equipment wasn't great... Point is it got the job done. I had to buy a swimming cap for the pool since I guess they don't want hair in the pool? I felt like it was a little redundant considering the amount of hair on my face...

After the gym it was back to my room for a shower. I was watching tennis when the front desk called me to let me know I needed to check out in about an hour, so I got ready to leave. Lucky for me, the hotel I was staying at for my internship was only about 2 blocks away so walking there was no problem. 

After checking in.... Holy crap is this room nice! Looks like I will have only one roommate as well considering this apartment only has two bedrooms. Since I was the first to check in, I snagged the big bedroom and got unpacked. Another thing to like about this place is that I have wifi and it's not too bad (again shit compared to almost anything in the US). So, I did some planning for places I want to go this weekend. There are some incredible museums in Shanghai and they are super cheep for students so I'll surely be hitting those up. I also want to make it down to ECNU (CSU's partner school) to find out when the CSU kids are getting there and also to eat my body weight in delicious street food and Muslim noodles!

Tonight there is a dinner for the interns where we will also get our SIM cards for our phones. I can't wait to see what other kinds of people will be interning with me. 

Damn were there a lot of cool people! My room mate is from CSU, but he's the only other person I've met from Colorado. There are a few British kids, one from Germany, and then another from Italy. Kind of as I expected, people are gravitating towards me because I speak Chinese. Last night we went to Nan Jing Dong Lu, the famous walking street in Shanghai. After that we attempted to walk down to the Bund. Unfortunately we ended up taking the most inefficient route there. What should have taken about 20 mins ended up taking over an hour! Since we took so long to get there, we ended up missing the last subway back to the hotel. Getting back was easy though because the taxis here are super easy. I'm pretty sure that once we all got back, we went right to bed from being so damn tired.

How do I deal with this and the stress.,[deleted],needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/26txlt/financial_woes_with_dad_how_do_i_deal_with_this/,"I just need to vent and see if there's anything that I can do. I graduated college 6 months ago and my dad did all of my financial aid, which likely includes forging my signature on paperwork and god even knows what. He never discussed my financial situation with me even when I've asked. 

I saved some money by being an RA. I didn't have a car until I was about to start my junior year of college so getting a job was not really an option because my father refused to let me take public transit and university transit went only to a very limited number of stores. I was unable to get an internship.

Now that I'm out of school I have a double major in psychology and Spanish in an area with a decent sized latino population. Well, it's been hard finding a job as you can imagine. I figured some businesses would take psych degrees and I could get my foot in the door in business but that hasn't happened. I did land a job which is in mental health and is 30 hours a week. Well, the job is extremely demanding and as you can imagine I'm barely getting by with the insane amount of time I put into this job. My job in mental health is finding people with disabilities jobs and things with that have been going really poor the last month or two because of a new manager and some really bad policies that are taking up our time.

So my dad is trying to get me to take a second job at a grocery store or something but my first job doesn't have a reliable schedule so it's not been easy to get a job like this because I don't have stable availability. I can't even find my client's jobs so how can I get a second job?

So I've been living with my mom (parents divorced) for the last six months and now the loan payments are coming in and I'm so stressed out. My dad didn't realize that he is 38K in the hole with MY student loans and just dropped this bomb on me 2-3 days ago. I also have my own 29K in my name. I stood up to him for the first time in my life 

I had no idea my dad put himself in this kind of debt for my education. Why the hell did he not build me a college fund? He takes my stepmom on nice exotic vacations. I was supposed to housesit for him while he goes to Cancun or something next week. Now he's getting my stepbrother to do it because for whatever reason suddenly I'm not responsible to him. And he doesn't want me spending time with my boyfriend that I've been with a year and he supposedly likes alone. They're super conservative Christian parents. I really needed that week away from my family to de-stress and now he's taking it away from me as a punishment whether he admits it or not. I have no outlet for my stress. My boyfriend just graduated school and is in the unemployment boat himself.

Very obviously my father is stressed out because he did not manage my student loans well and never spoke to me about them. He still has financial control over my car and cell phone because I'm poor right now. He seems to think a job is just going to magically appear and it isn't. So now he's taking out his poor management of money onto me and driving me deeper into stress when I'm already stressed out about the fact that I can't find a full-time job, my job is unreliable and I don't even get paid for the amount I work, and I can't even get my clients jobs right now let alone me. So how do I survive? I'd take any job that's full time. I'd really like to work for the county but I don't have any connections. How do I make him stop taking his stress out on me and punishing me for standing up for myself to him for the first time in my life? My mother is just blindly following him on this and is talking about charging me rent on top of this horrible financial strain."

26u8nm,1,2014-05-29,SEO: Buyer Beware - How Can You Protect Your Business From an SEO Agent Who Just Wants Your Money,[deleted],SEO,https://www.reddit.com/r/SEO/comments/26u8nm/seo_buyer_beware_how_can_you_protect_your/,"SEO, or search engine optimization, has gained quite a reputation in the past decade or so.  Businesses turn to Internet marketing firms or SEO specialists to discuss how to advertise on the web.  In the early days of SEO, and for various reasons, there wasn't much consistency on how a business could advertise their products or services more than a competitor's while still retaining fairness to both companies.  Google seemed to be the great arbiter in all of this: as a result, SEOs devoted a lot of thought how to think like Google, and therefore maximize their SEO techniques.  As one might imagine, two camps emerged: those who played by the rules and within the parameters set by Google, and those who wanted to crack Google's algorithm and invest in fraudulent ""black hat"" techniques to game the system, gain notoriety, and look like heroes.

SEO: How It Works

If you think about it, businesses have a personality.  Look at their logo, or brand, and read some of their marketing material.  Immediately you'll determine whether the company is buttoned-up and conservative, or loose, friendly, or environmentally conscious.  This message is just as important as their logo, getting it wrong usually ends with with someone looking for another job.

SEO done right, works.  The first step is to work within the company's message. Determine what unique keywords set the business apart from the rest of the herd.  This sounds easy, but it's not.  A list of two word or longer keywords needs to be drawn up, analyzed with real world data, and reviewed to see how well it performs against competitors.  This process alone can take days to finalize.  Once completed, the company's website is ""optimized"" against these keywords.  In other words, steps are taken to improve the likelihood Google will find your site's homepage or subpage when a specific keyword is typed into the search engine.  Once completed, a variety of SEO strategies are implemented, some on social media, to encourage word of mouth, and entice users to visit the website.  The goal, of course, is once a user arrives at your website, they will ""convert"" into a client.

Where It All Starts To Go South

SEO firms make a lot of money.  As mentioned before, SEO takes a lot of time, hard work and effort to produce results; sometimes it is difficult to attribute an increase in business with a successful SEO campaign.  Regardless, there are always people who want to make a lot of money, get all of the credit, and do very little work.  

Meanwhile, businesses treat SEO agencies as they used to treat conventional advertising budgets: here's some money, make me popular, and trust I won't ask questions. Like most con-artists, SEO charlatans count on the fact you won't ask questions, won't supervise the SEO process reviewing all changes, won't address consequences, or hold the SEO agent accountable by backing up their promises and tasks in writing within the SEO contract.

Protect Yourself From SEO Charlatans &amp; Cover Your Ass

Never go into an SEO pre-sales review alone.  Make sure both participants are awake, engaged and can ask the SEO Agent the really hard questions.  

Don't be dazzled by impressive looking reports with data that isn't meaningful to you.  Make sure you understand everything and that the SEO agent takes their time, addressing your concerns along the way.

If it sounds like a promise, it probably is.  Protect yourself and have them put everything in writing in an SEO contract, including reasonable consequences and a clause to call the whole thing off, should that be necessary.  It should go without saying, review your SEO contract thoroughly before you sign it.

Your website should be attractive, engaging to users, and optimized for SEO.  Some SEO agents will try and ""think like a computer"" by ruining a website's aesthetics in favor of attracting users with SEO techniques and ugly calls to action ""above the fold"".  Never sacrifice your brand, your message, or your website for SEO. 

Website calls to action need to have a purpose.  The explanation why is your product or service is the best, the ""what's in it for your client"", has to come first and before the inducement to fill out a form.  No one is going to fill out a naked form without some kind of incentive.  Thirst always precedes the drink.   

Not all businesses have engaging word of mouth content.  Sure ""gulf oil rigs"" is a unique keyword that probably won't have a lot of competitors. An SEO agent dreams of such a viable keyword to capitalize on, but ask yourself: would you or a casual reader really read a blog with ""gulf oil rigs"" as its focus, even if that is your business?  SEO agents often miss the forest for the trees and are afraid to admit not all businesses are sexy.    

At its core, SEO is not that different from traditional advertising: it should inspire word-of-mouth while driving people to investigate and purchase your product or service offering.  If SEO fails to do that, it fails.  

For the right business, blogs can be wonderful arenas to let your hair down, discuss what you do, and engage visitors along the way.  If, however your blog is boring and no one is going to read it, don't let your SEO agent convince you to devote time and money toward its growth.  

If your SEO agency has a media consultant who writes your blogs, social media, or press releases, demand you meet them personally.  Ask to see their credentials and find out whether or not they will be writing your content 100% of the time.  Some SEO agencies outsource their content creation to high school interns or to overseas representatives.  Keep in mind you are signing over your entire business's message to someone else. Do you feel confident they will always have your best interests in mind, preserving your brand's integrity at all times? If they don't ask questions or seem indifferent to your brand, RUN.

Morally corrupt SEO agents will want to string you along, promising improvements, but never giving you the whole solution.  Though it is true SEO takes time and there are always things to improve, that is a far different situation from an SEO agent knowingly giving half-measures so you'll be a paying client longer. Know for sure which situation you are in.  Ask questions.
 
Ask what work was achieved to determine the list of keywords and why these keywords were selected in favor of others.  Some SEO agencies won't even devote the time or energy to develop a keyword list, opting instead to use the same boring, generic keywords as the business's competitors. Regardless, it is pointless to optimize a website's keywords if they perform poorly.     

Have the agent explain their entire SEO campaign vision from start to finish: how will they start, what will they do, how will they report their results, once completed, what will be the next step, and the step after that.  What SEO strategies will they use to draw clients to the website and convert?  If the SEO agent can't explain in simple English what steps they are going to do, there is probably a reason: they don't know or they are incompetent.  Either way, you should walk away.              

Make sure you're checking on all news articles, blog and social media posts, and SEO campaigns. Independently determine how well things are going and ask questions if you feel you don't understand. Take the SEO agency reports with a grain of salt, because sometimes SEO agencies will spin things in their favor to justify their existence.  Trust, but verify.

An increase in SEO performance does not necessarily equate to an increase in clients or revenue.  An SEO agent might maintain an increase in organic or PPC rankings from position 7 to position 5 will result in an increase of 25% new clients.  They will say, ""since you told me that each client is worth $500, you're going to be netting $5000 in no time and I've barely even gotten started!"".  Not true.

Don't forget, you have an existing client base.  Sometimes SEO agents will see conversions from users visiting the site and immediately take credit for their job well done.  In reality, repeat clients are merely coming in and using the website as they're supposed to.

Don't let the SEO agent overwhelm you with SEO technobabble.  Example: In pay per click campaigns, such as Adwords, there is something called CPC, or cost per click.  SEO agents tend to devote lots of discussion to the inexpensiveness of CPC, all while neglecting to mention CPC is determined by cost, or bid, divided by click, or searches.  If the bid amount is high and the client has a low ineffective budget, CPC becomes irrelevant as there are few to no clicks toward that specific keyword.  Moreover, the entire campaign will be confined to perform only to within the customer-defined budget.  If your Adwords or PPC discussion doesn't center around performance as a function of budget, you are probably not being given the entire story.

Google ""black hat SEO"" and familiarize yourself with these fraudulent industry techniques.  Constantly be on the lookout by ensuring the SEO agent isn't risking your business with these illegal SEO strategies. Buying followers for social media is very common."

26ue1c,43,2014-05-29,Possible negative correlation between alpha personality attributes and intelligence?,[deleted],TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/26ue1c/possible_negative_correlation_between_alpha/,"Just wanted to get some input from fellow redpillers... perhaps they have a better explanation. This is something I have consistently noticed throughout my life but have struggled to accept. It seems that an alpha personality is almost always accompanied by a lack of intelligence or more specifically analytical skills. I have yet to meet someone who possessed high degree of both of these attributes at the same time.

My observation mainly comes from working in a prestigious software corporation. My coworkers are the cream of the crop of this field (which is already mentally demanding). There is no place on earth with a higher concentration of beta men. Out of 100s of guys in their 20s not a single one has an attractive gf. The few times we get an attractive marketing intern, the beta attitude literally drips from everyone. The few guys that are slightly better off than others are serious under performers and are in easier roles.

Other thing I noticed is my personal inability to be analytical and alpha at the same time. Time and time again I have noticed that whenever I start to workout more, increase my risk tolerance and intentionally force myself to become more alpha... my job performance goes down. (despite the exact same amount of time devoted to it) My mind simply does not see the patterns as quickly and effectively and is no longer as creative at finding solutions. It's like I cannot afford to have a relaxed alpha attitude if I want to perform well in this line of work.

Anyone else feel the same way?"
26ujas,1,2014-05-29,Request for Academic Advice from a Confused Post-Bacc,goodapollo901,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/26ujas/request_for_academic_advice_from_a_confused/,"Disclaimer: I fully realize that the path I take in life is up to me alone, and I should not depend on others to tell me what’s best. However, I deeply value the perspectives of others and believe that no matter what input I receive, it can only lead to more informed decisions. 

I’m posting here with the hope that some members of this community might have suggestions on how I should pursue my current interests. In the following, I’ll give a little background on myself and what I hope to expand on in the future. Any words of advice would be greatly appreciated.

 I graduated a year ago from a top university with a degree in psychology along something my school calls the “neuroscience track.” Basically, this meant that on top of roughly 12 psychology based classes (ranging from evolutionary psychology to clinical animal models to psychopharmacology), I had to take 5 “hard” biology classes, three of which had to be higher level. In addition to these, I took a number of classes outside of my major and got a very liberal arts type education. During my time as an undergrad, I only worked in one lab unfortunately.

I came out of school certainly happy with what I had learned—I garnered knowledge in a number of fields and found myself able to be interested in anything I attended to. However, I felt, and continue to feel, fairly spread out and lacking the ability to decide which of my interests I want to pursue and how. For the past year, I’ve mostly traveled, but am currently doing a somewhat menial internship with my state’s environmental conservation department. I know I want to go back to school at some point, but need more experience before I decide for what.

As of now, my strongest interests lie in cognitive science, neuroscience, evolutionary psychology, environmental sciences, and complex systems (modeling self-organizing dynamics and studying emergent properties arising from the interactions of entities). My current thought is to find a cognitive science based internship to work once I’m done with my current internship in order to retest and revamp my skills in the discipline. Then, I think it would be great to spend a couple years in Boston U’s LEAP doing system engineering or a [similar program] (http://www.uvm.edu/~cmplxsys/teaching-learning/certificate-of-study-in-complex-systems/) that focuses on complex systems. My interest in this area mostly stems from a class I took in fractals my senior year that seemed to assimilate everything I had learned up to that point and I believe that knowledge in the field is applicable to any discipline—especially that of the brain. Subsequently, I would want to complete a masters or PHD in a cognitive science/neuroscience related field. 

In the area of cognitive science, I think my biggest interest lies in cognitive training—using what we know about the mind’s processes to create “training” software or techniques that could be used to help mitigate deficiencies in individuals, to improve education, or to simply sharpen and strengthen the different cognitive abilities of average people.


Here are a few particular questions I have in mind:

Do you agree with the utility of educating myself in complex systems to apply it to later studies that deal directly with the processes of the mind?

What type of cognitive science internship might I pursue given my interests?

I haven’t taken calc or pure physics since freshman year, would I be in trouble when it comes to trying to pursue complex systems? I assume I could take a couple of low level classes to catch me up before going this route.

Does anyone know of any post-bacc  general science programs similar to a pre-med program that might fit with my interests and be beneficial to pursuing study in complex systems or cognitive science?


Yes, that was fairly long winded. I hope that some of you out there have gotten through it and have the time to give your reaction—whatever it might be. Thanks.

I've (27M) been engaged with Sarah (33F, not her real name) for about two months. We've been together for about 7 years. We were roommates before we started dating and only lived apart for about 9 months while I was doing an internship out of college. Our families get along great and we rarely fight, but lately a few issues have become really apparent. 

I've begun to develop harsh criticisms of who she is (internally) and I'd appreciate Reddit's opinion on whether or not these criticisms and concerns are significant enough to call it off.

1. She doesn't exercise. I exercise a lot. I'm an active person. I'm not a gym rat, but I really enjoy walking, jogging, swimming, and playing soccer. She will go jogging with me occasionally, but she just doesn't have the drive. In recent years, I've noticed her ability to bike and hike with me has waned. She has always been a bit heavier, and I don't mind that, but her fitness is preventing us from enjoying the kinds of activities I'd like to do together.
2. Television... she watches SO much television. She typically gets home from work at 4PM and I get home around 7PM. She'll watch television 4 hours a day or more, and I really have no desire to do that. I like playing video games together, and I enjoy board games and reading with her. It really irks me how much she watches television. 
3. Sex. We were very active when we started dating. At least 5 times a week, but probably once a day. Nowadays, on average less than once a week. She shows no interest unless I get things going. Our sex life is gone.

I feel like these are really basic irreconcilable differences. I'm not the same person I was when we began dating 7 years ago. She isn't either. I believe we're both better people, and we'll continue to change in the future. I'm just not sure it's a wise decision to settle down with someone with whom I now share so little."

I am a software developer from Germany with around 4 years of experience, mostly in (ASP/C#)DotNet + (MS)SQL, but a lot off little additional experience here and then (HTML ofc, ObjectiveC for my first app, a few lines of PHP and so on and so on...

After a few years of Freelancing I got a job offer for a normal position around 30km from me, what means no travaling any more, no hotels any more etc.

I'm in week 3 and I really like the ppl who work with me here and I like the boss, *BUT* (!) I am so much of underestamited and underworked. I have freaking nothing to do. It's not that the company hasn't work to do but the firms pay so much more hours then we need, what gives so big ""nothing to do"" holes... e.g. I got a little project which was estimated with 3 days of work and get payed 3 days (so 24 hours) of work. I did the whole thing in around 8 hours. So when I told my boss that, he smiles (not because I am such a good developer, because he knows we get much more paid then we have to do)  and tell me to ""educate myself"" what in fact is the company intern term to ""play diablo 3"" or ""surf on facebook""... yes, my boss ask me to do rifts in D3 with him... 

So in fact, I dont want to be a grinch but Im so hard bored right now here, I dont want a job in which I play D3 or surf on FB, I want a freaking job in which I can do nice software-development work!

Our product announcement in Dec13 gave us fantastic media coverage in the biggest tech blogs in the world (The Huffington Post, The Verge, Pocketlint and VentureBeat to name a few) and strong traction. By its innovative design concept, Jetpack is disrupting the gaming industry and has been saluted as a serious challenger to traditional PC and console gaming, and a serious candidate to be the next Steambox of reference.

We’re on the verge of launching our product into the world. We have very busy weeks ahead of us, therefore we ‘re creating this role for an intern to join us as soon as possible. This 3 months position could rapidly turn into a full-time paid role if the launch proves to be successful. This is a unique opportunity to join a fast growing start-up adventure from the very beginning!

Scope of the role:

-Help us with all aspects of the launch of the Jetpack
-Help us manage all customer requests coming in during launch and after
-Manage all our social networks by creating exciting and engaging content and keeping customers up to date on the company’s activity.
-Maintain and grow our fan base by keeping the conversation going across all social networks.
-Actively reach out to gamers and computer enthusiasts communities to help grow our user base.
-Generally provide us with help dealing with any ad hoc request.

Profile of the ideal candidate:

You are a keen gamer (PC and/or console) and you’re aware of the latest news in the industry. You’re generally enthusiastic about gaming, technology, computer hardware. You regularly keep up to speed on gaming blogs, forums, Facebook, Twitter and Reddit, and ideally you are an active contributor on those platforms. You’re excited about the upcoming release of Steam OS in 2014.

You’re also into computers and computer hardware, and the occasional computer hacker. You like buying your own PC components. You’re excited about the latest innovations in gaming gear. Steam boxes, Oculus Rift, are familiar (and exciting) words to you.

You’re a good communicator. You can produce content quickly and keep the conversation going on all our social networks with great, engaging content (photos, videos, editorial). You are familiar with video editing software (Final Cut Pro or other).

You have opinions and you’re not afraid to share them. You can express yourself perfectly in written English.

You’re not afraid to work within a very small team, in a fast-paced environment, roll-up your sleeves and take some responsibilities quickly. You also understand that due to the nature of the start-up work, objectives and priorities can evolve quickly.

I got into fitness and a healthy lifestyle about 2 years ago and have seen awesome results from it.  Went from about 180 lbs down to 158 which was way too skinny for me, so I started eating more and working out even harder which brought me to a solid 175-180 last summer that I was so happy looking at the mirror at.

This past winter, I tried putting on more weight and bumped up to 190 without putting on too much fat and was still happy about my strength, physique, and overall health.  Then came finals.  I stressed, and basically didn't have anytime to go to the gym for 2-3 weeks.  I lost a lot of that mass I put on in the winter, and I pretty much went to a pudgy 190-195.

Now that school is over, I've been doing a lot better with eating and working out.  I go to the gym either 5 or 6 times a week and even though it is kind of discouraging to lose the strength I once had, it feels good knowing that I get to shoot for the goals and lifts I once had.

This past week, I started an internship which has me sitting behind a desk for 8 hours, 5 times a week.  I recalculated my calories and macro needs for this, but I'm still kind of scared that things aren't going to work out as planned.  Right now, I'm attempting to lose 1 pound a week until I get back down to 185 (currently 193).  I calculated I should be eating 2087 kcal, 221g Protein, 88g Fat, and 101g Carbs.

I was just wondering if anyone has any tips at the gym or things they do daily to try and combat their desk jobs.  Before this, I worked at places that kept me on my feet and walking all day.  Any help would be appreciated!  Thanks /r/fitness."

As the title says, I'm looking for help developing a financial plan for the future. 

I'm a 20 year old computer science major with 2 years left to go in my college career. College is mainly the source of all my worries, because I'm taking out about $30k a year in loans. (Federal and Sallie Mae.) My parents have promised to pay off the interest payments of all my loans until I get through college, and my grandfather also helps out with loan payments in exchange for good grades. 

When I'm in school, I work part time in the campus store which is more than enough to provide for food/entertainment costs. Generally, I'm very frugal and don't spend money often. (With the exception of food, obviously.)

This Summer, I am participating in study abroad, which kills any chance I have at an internship/summer job. I plan on looking for and working an internship next Summer, that will most likely be paid. My school also has a lot of job placement services that I will plan on using to get this internship and a job once I graduate.

However, financially, I don't have much of a plan. I would consider myself fairly ambitious in my financial goals - I would love to move into a condo/apartment with my SO (or my own house if luck somehow works out) ASAP after getting a good job, while still being able to pay off my debt in a timely manner. Added to this, I want to take responsibility for my health insurance/cell phone bill/car insurance once I get a good job.

As for my current finances/financial history, there's not too much to say. I have both a checking and savings account, but I have not started an emergency fund or anything yet. (It's not needed currently. I may start doing this within the next semester.) I know that my credit score is &gt;700, as I am very diligent in paying off my credit card after using it for ""bigger"" purchases. (This number is from a student loan document I received a few weeks ago.) 

Basically, what I'm asking for is advice - what can I do NOW to adequately prepare/buffer myself from my student debt repayments? "

26vuoz,8,2014-05-30,I have 2 very diverse job offers...,HansMoleman55,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/26vuoz/i_have_2_very_diverse_job_offers/,"**(tldr at the bottom)**


Some background on me: I used to play professional online poker for 4 years and did very well in the industry. I left as a combination of burn out and the online poker shutdown in the US, so I went back to school in my mid-20s. I have a finance and math degree, a couple of finance related internships, and a 1 year job at a New York City day trading firm. I have been unemployed 9 months, getting very few interviews because of my somewhat polarizing (and generally misunderstood) past. Luckily, I'm financially secure for someone my age, have been able to afford living without income the last 4 years and can continue to do so for a few more if it came down to it (I don't say that to brag; that fact is relevant to this decision).


**Offer 1:** temp job with a major bank to work in their back office. No benefits but with time-and-a-half I should be making around $20/hour and should be on pace to make around 45-50k/year (way above what I was expecting in an entry level job). 12-hour days :( I took poker off my resume to interview with them, so they are not even aware of my past. I'm really not all that interested in what they do, but the money and stability are a nice change.


**Offer 2:** an internship(!!!) with a commercial real estate investment firm. It is unpaid, although they have promised to pay me commissions on any properties I help them find. The appeal here is that I am very interested in real estate investing (I interned for a REIT in college). I was introduced to the president of the company through a friend, and we instantly bonded because we both play poker and both were entrepreneurs. He is not someone who I have to hide my past (a la the bank) from and actually views it as an asset. 


He wants me to shadow him on a daily basis so that I can get a crash course on learning the business inside and out. While there's no firm structure for parlaying the internship into a paid position (they are a very small, tightly-knit team), I truly believe -- through my conversations with him and the endorsement of my friend who introduced me to him -- that this guy and his family (it's a family run business) has my best interests at heart and is not just exploiting free labor. They just don't have a full-time opening at this moment and also want me to ""prove"" myself first. 


The risk-taking, entrepreneurial side of me from my poker days is extremely intrigued by offer 2. It's obviously very risky, but offers the most upside and the most freedom (in that I would not have to ""sell my soul"" to corporate America). I can afford to continue living without income, although obviously that's not ideal.


On the other hand, after almost 1 year of uncertainty and depression over my lack of job prospects beyond poker, it's REALLY hard to turn down a salaried position for a known company. It may not be exactly where my interests lie, the upside may not be the same working in an office with 500 people as getting a daily first-hand crash course from the president of a successful real estate investment firm, and I would have to ""sell my soul"" a little because I have to devalue my past accomplishments in poker, but it's a paycheck and a career god damnit!


I'd love to hear if anybody has ever been in a similar situation and what you may think.

-------------------------------------------------------------
**tl;dr:**


**Safe, yet soul-crushing corporate job with salary at a bank.


**Unpaid internship in an interesting business with someone I get along with very well, where I'd get a rare opportunity to learn the business by shadowing the president of the company. 


**While a paycheck would be nice, I can continue to afford living comfortably without income. Not preferable, but I could do it if I wanted to take a chance."

Now, the trouble is that my grades aren't particularly great and to be honest I know very little about genetics. It's at a large hospital and I'm assuming these scientists are really going to be the best of the best.

I have skimmed some papers and a lot of it talks about GWAS. From what I understand people with the disease are going to have certain SNPs compared to a control group that do not have the disease. You collect a lot of data that indicates which SNPs could be common among people with Crohn's and run some statistical tests to determine significance. From here you decide which SNPs are relevant  . Is this correct? Where do you go from there, once you know which SNPs are relevant?

What sort of lab procedures are undertaken in this sort of genetics lab? Do they take people's blood and extract DNA? How do you go from having a sample from a patient to finding out which SNPs they have, etc? 

I would really desperately love some help

PS. I am also going to be alternating between this lab and a skin disease genetics lab so any info there would be great too, although I imagine it's fairly similar.

26w9ii,3,2014-05-30,Transition from plates to membranes? [Structural],BananApocalypse,civilengineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/civilengineering/comments/26w9ii/transition_from_plates_to_membranes_structural/,"I'm a civil engineering student in a structural internship position. I'm currently about half way through my undergraduate program and still have a lot to learn. My question regards plates and membranes, and the differences between the two. I am quite familiar with beam theory and the bending properties of materials, but not so much with thinner, more flexible membranes.

For example, I am currently looking at very thin sheets of steel under a uniform wind load. In my original analysis, I looked at the effects of bending, for which the component clearly did not meet requirements (as expected). I calculated ridiculous deflection values and very high moments.

Now I know this is the incorrect approach, but I'm struggling to find resources to help me better understand the true behaviour. Looking at it from a 2-D perspective, I understand that the difference is analogous to the plate/beam, membrane/cable comparison. Is it true that the allowable flexure of a membrane allows it to act as a tension member instead of one experiencing bending? If so, how can I find/check the capacity given all geometric, material, and loading conditions?

Also, if the thickness of a plate was gradually decreased, is there a point at which it would no longer behave as a plate but instead a membrane? Or perhaps it can experience properties of both at once.

Thanks in advance, any help is appreciated.

Which I know is a huge red flag for this field, but I was willing to take it anyway because I also know it's common for this field and fuck it, I like coding and want to learn everything I can. Cultural fit for me, open-source-focused, gorgeous office, relatively young company.

I gave my desired figure (the median for the title), just got the offer letter—60%. I just graduated last semester with a Bachelor's in CS, and I have a year of paid experience developing web applications from an internship at a major corporation. (Full web applications—I created/manage the databases, manage the server, wrote the backend and designed/wrote the frontend. My apps are used across the company and save them a fuck ton of money per year. Pay was just a little below entry level for a web developer, hourly, no benefits.) The pay they're offering me now is just slightly above what I was making in the internship, and from the sound of the interview I'd be working on low-level code in addition to web app stuff.

I was prepared to take 85% of what I asked for, but this seems really low. There's healthcare benefits, but I don't get any shares of the company. Not sure what to do at this point. I haven't interviewed anywhere else yet, but I've got a recruiter who thinks he can get me in at a couple other places that would fit me and he thinks I'm worth the figure I gave them.  I've got a good resume, I've been promised but am waiting on an official offer letter from my Corp as a contracted employee (that I'm hesitant to take, I don't like the corporate IT culture, but it's tentatively there), and I can stay at the student internship for another semester before they have to let me go (living with my dad right now, so I'm not at risk of ending up on the street). 

Not sure what to do. Part of me just wants to tell them politely to fuck off and just look elsewhere, another part wants to try and debate with them and bring the number up, but now I'm feeling like somehow I've got it confused and overestimated what I'm worth, like all the salary sites I looked at were wrong. Advice? I want the experience/pay ASAP and don't want any gaps on my resume, but I don't need the job to eat. It seemed like there was a ton I could learn there, but I'm feeling pretty damn insulted. Not sure if it's right for me to feel that way, but I do."

Company Description
**eBay** was born over Labor Day weekend in 1995, when Pierre Omidyar, a computer programmer, wrote the code for an auction website that he ran from his home computer.

Today, Omidyar's hobby is known as eBay, the world's largest online marketplace - where practically anyone can sell practically anything at any time. It's an idea that BusinessWeek once called ""nothing less than a virtual, self-regulating global economy.""

With a presence in 39 markets, including the U.S., and approximately 84 million active users worldwide, eBay has changed the face of Internet commerce. In 2007, the total value of sold items on eBay's trading platforms was nearly $60 billion. This means that eBay users worldwide trade more than $1,900 worth of goods on the site every second.

The benefit to consumers is clear: eBay provides an open trading platform where the market determines the value of items that are sold. Over the years, the site has become a cultural barometer of sorts, providing a view into what objects consumers want most at any time.

Since its initial public offering in 1998, the company has continued to innovate and connect people - and not just through its marketplaces. Two critical acquisitions have made eBay Inc. a global leader in online payments and communications as well.

PayPal enables any individual or business with an email address to securely, easily and quickly send and receive payments online. Acquired by eBay Inc. in October 2002, PayPal builds on the existing financial infrastructure of bank accounts and credit cards and uses the world's most advanced proprietary fraud prevention systems to create a safe payment solution. Today, PayPal is a global leader in online payment solutions: It has 149 million registered users and is accepted by millions of merchants worldwide - on and off eBay. PayPal's Q1 2008 global total payment volume of $14.4 billion accounted for nearly 9 percent of worldwide eCommerce.

Acquired by eBay Inc. in October 2005, Skype is the world's fastest-growing Internet communication company that has revolutionized the way people talk online. With more than 309 million registered users as of early 2008, Skype allows people everywhere to make unlimited voice and video calls online for free using its software. Skype is available in 28 languages and is used in almost every country on Earth. This business unit generates revenue through its premium offerings, such as calls (using its software) made to and from landline and mobile phones; voicemail; call forwarding; and personalization, including ringtones and avatars. In addition to its presence on eBay, Skype has relationships with a growing network of hardware and software providers.

Other key acquisitions have strengthened eBay Inc.'s portfolio of ecommerce companies, including shopping.com, a pioneer in online comparison shopping; Stubhub, a leading online marketplace for the resale of event tickets; rent.com, the most visited online apartment listing service in the U.S.; StumbleUpon, an online solution that helps people discover and share content on the web; and market-leading online classifieds sites including LoQUo.com, Intoko, and Netherlands-based Marktplaats.nl. The company has also grown its classifieds business through Kijiji, which launched in the U.S. in 2007."

My situation:  I am unskilled/unemployed (I do have a certain type of engineering degree, but I want to be an entrepreneur, not related to that field, so I say unskilled).  I am 32.  I have 1.2 million dollars in reserves from working for 11 years (also worked internships during college, and went to college on a big academic scholarship so most was payed for).  
  
I can fly for free (standby) anywhere that american airlines can fly (I am based in DFW).  
  
I am torn because most of all, I want to be an entrepreneur of some sort, and so I don't get excited about travel because I feel like I should be figuring out how to start a business and make money, since I am unemployed (I quit my job, I was not fired, I was actually highly esteemed and promoted within my company, it just wasn't what I wanted to do).  
  
I am wondering about maybe flying into Zurich or Madrid or London (they have a nonstop from dfw), but it seems like traveling around Europe can get pretty expensive.  I know places like Milan and Amsterdam are fun to see, but I don't even know how much fun I am going to have because I'm going to be worried about what I am doing with my life the whole time.  
  
Maybe I should forget about making a living for a couple months and just go travel and enjoy myself.  
  
I am wondering if maybe part of my drive has to do with my parent's expectations of me, and maybe that is not my expectation, and I need to find that out.  Maybe travel will help me get away from their reach, and help me figure things out on my own.  I am not sure.  
  
I feel so god damn confused right now, I have no one sane to talk to.  I don't know what to do for my next step, I don't know what is happening with my life.  I feel so overwhelmed, I am shaking while I am writing this.  
  
Which should be ridiculous because hey, I've got over a million dollars and I am only 32, I should feel good, right?  But I am scared that if I don't figure out a way to make more money that I'm just going to burn through this money, and then I will have to go back to my job, and quite honestly, I'm pretty sure I would rather be homeless.

I have decent grades and just got back from a study abroad from China. 

I went into engineering because that is what a career test told me I would be good at and at the time I didn't know what I wanted to do and it didn't seem like a bad option. I then went into  mechanical engineering because I was always told it was the broadest of engineering majors and thus could do almost anything upon graduation so to me it sounded like it was a good fit until I figured out what I wanted to do with my life.

A few things I have found out so far is I do not want to work in thermodynamics or fluid mechanics. Upon searching for internships I am getting a lot of jobs that seem to be in the above fields which is understandable but I am not seeing the broad spectrum that I thought mechanical engineering would offer me. When looking for jobs/internships I now feel like my skill set is inappropriate or useless and am at a loss of what to do. I still don't really know what I want to do with my life and I feel like I need a job/internship so that at the very least I can see other people's jobs to start the process in my mind of ""oh hey that looks like fun maybe I want to do what he/she does"" but don't know what to go into or apply for. 

I also feel like I haven't progressed much in what I want to do and rather just have ruled out things I don't want to do. When people ask me what my interests are and I think about it I don't really have a solid answer for the question. My thought process usually goes ""well I did enjoy doing that class, lets try doing it on my own"" which then leads me to trying it and for some reason the spark is gone or for whatever reason I lose interest. I am at a loss for what my actual (job possible) interests are.

As far back as I can remember, I've lived my life with the intention of making as little waves as possible. ""Go with the flow"" my steadfast mantra. ""Oh, don't worry about me"" my slogan, my brand name.

I was homeschooled until I was 12, and abruptly placed into the public school system. My Dad was never home, my Mom was always drunk. Drunk Mom wasn't a great teacher.

I never learned the fundamentals of arithmetic, nor the finer points of grammar (apologies), and quite a few other basic building blocks you're supposed to at least be exposed to by age 12. 

Naturally, I struggled quite a bit. To this day, basic arithmetic takes me about twice the time a normal person takes.. And don't even talk to me about fractions.. and to this day, my Mother will proclaim to the world, every chance she gets: ""I'm so proud that my children are doing so well as adults. I'm so glad I'm homeschooled them.""

And I'll nod and smile..


In High School, I wasn't the leanest kid on the block. And anyone who has been in High School knows that fat kid always gets it 20X worse than any nerd or freak out there (I use the word freak as a term of endearment. I'm quite freakish myself). Yes, I was feeling sorry for myself. Yes, I could have used their hate as motivation to better myself. Yes, I should have stood up for myself. But I never did. And I never do.

After High School, I thought my problems were over. My senior year was finished at a continuation school (I skipped over a bit, but I'll sum it up by saying I got into some trouble and had the hs credits of a freshman my senior year), where I met my fiancé. 

We (fiancé and I) moved out of state so I could attend a trade school in a field I was interested in. I came out of my shell there. I thrived there. I was a brand new person. I was going to school, working at possibly the coolest job an 18 year old could have, and the people I met at my school were all like-minded individuals who are, to this day, very close friends.


But then came time for me to finish up school and start my internship. I ended up going back home for practical reasons, but mostly I just missed my friends. I was struggling with finding a decent job, I bummed it with my current fiancé for a while.. but it ended up working out I went into business for myself and things were looking up financially, but my introversion became worse as I was now also working from home. I went full hermit, and have been for about 5 years. 

My fiancé cheated on me a 2 years ago. We'd been together 5 years at that point. She lied to me.. she got drunk with some guy, and there's no need to go into it from there, but it was messed up (didn't even make him wear a condom). She told me the next day, and apparently felt horrible.. of course, I was quick to forgive, and life went on. 

Then the panic attacks started. I guess all the years of built up frustration had to go somewhere.. And it reached capacity after that. 

A few months ago, a lady cut in front of me in line at a store. She didn't see me standing in line, because I was standing out of the way of the main aisle, as I didn't want to be in anyones way. Another woman in front of her said ""Excuse me, Ma'am. There's a gentleman right behind you who was here first."" the lady then whipped around at me and barked ""Well were you going to say anything?!"" I looked down and awkwardly murmured ""yeah, I just didn't notice you'd walked in front of me.""  bullshit. I saw her walk in front of me. I saw her carelessly waltz in the middle of the aisle without so much as a quick 180 to see if perhaps there were people who were avoiding cart collisions.. I wouldn't have said a damn thing and I would have hated HER for it. When it was MY cowardice that made HER feel like a jerk.  This sort of thing happens to me on a daily basis.


My Mom lives with me now. Moved in last year.. I have a 2 bedroom apt. This was meant to be a temporary situation, that turned into a permanent one. My office is now her bedroom. When I need to work, I sneak in quietly. She pays no rent. She's had and lost 6 jobs since she's been here. She has a lot of bills, and for the last year, I've been paying most of them. She was arrested for getting drunk and assaulting someone around new years. $1500 bail. No questions asked. Drove 3 hours to where she was and got her out. She never said thank you. She never said sorry for the trouble.
I just said ""I'm glad you're okay"" and left it alone.
 

The reason a 23 year old was able to handle all this crap, was because I'd finally reached a point in my career that was pure gold. My partner and I got a huge contract. I don't care to go into the details, but I was making a lot of money.. Waaay more than I needed, and so I was careless. My partner ended up renegotiating our contract when renewal was up. Turns out they were going over budget, and guess who was the odd man out? I did 90% of the work. He was DROPPED 3 months later because he was completely incompetent. He got what he had coming.. But I never told him off. I told him ""Well, maybe this is better. I was thinking about starting fresh anyway. And I thrive under stress afterall!""

So losing that contract actually was a harder blow than I thought it would be. You see, I'd become accustomed to a certain lifestyle that I could no longer afford suddenly.. I didn't save any money.. No safety net. The money I had was used up within a couple months.. And that brings us to about 3 months ago where I hit rock bottom and I'm basically back to minimum wage income status. 

And I'm still trying to take care of everyone. I'm still trying to make everyone happy. I'm still a mess inside and out.

I confess it. I'm a human doormat. "
26x25m,3,2014-05-30,"21 [M4F] Twin Cities, MN - Need a summer amigo!!",[deleted],r4r,https://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/26x25m/21_m4f_twin_cities_mn_need_a_summer_amigo/,"Hi, thanks for stopping in. I'm going absolutely nuts this summer with boredom. 80% of my friends did not return home for summer break, what with either graduation or internships. The ones who are home are more ""fair weather"" friends and I want to use this opportunity to get to know some more people. 

I'm sure you want to know a little about me. I am 6'2"", thin, and incredibly attractive (or so my grandmother likes to tell me). I like to joke around and sometimes I may cross the line, but I have a pretty big conscience so if I ever feel like I did, I feel really bad. So (not so) deep down, I'm a nice guy.

I get along with just about everyone. I adapt really easily and I hate that period in time where you don't really know someone so it is a little awkward while you get to know them, so I usually tell people an embarrassing thing about myself and they tend to open up a lot faster. 

I enjoy long walks (not necessarily on the beach), rubbing a dog's belly, rollerblading, watching Netflix, eating peanut butter, and exploring town. I've never been kayaking but I really would like to sometime! 

To be honest, I don't know what I really want here. I'd ideally like a friend. Someone who wants to get out and do something so that the summer isn't quite so boring. I'm not at all opposed to letting it become a relationship, if that's what you are looking for, but I don't want to put pressure on that it HAS to be a relationship. 

At this point, I either have you hooked or you aren't interested. I'd love to swap numbers, meet for a drink or some food, and see if we click. We can text for awhile before meeting up, just to make sure we get along. But I'm a nice guy and I generally use correct grammar, so I think I have a lot of stuff going for me. We can swap pictures if you'd like as well, just let me know!"

As of today, May 30th, I have $4814.18 in consumer credit card debt. A lot of this debt I've racked up from school-related expenses, and cost of living during periods I was unemployed while at school (TWO businesses closed while I worked there...). Right now, I am working roughly 25 hours per week at $8.25 an hour as well as 25 hours a week for free (internship).

Next month, June, my monthly credit card payments and rent are going to cost me $705.17 and I'm only going to net about $575.00 after taxes from my retail job.

I'm considering selling off my only substantial asset in order to just pay off all my CC debt and finally be debt free. In September my parents bought me a new car after my beater was on its last leg. They paid $15,000 cash for a 2012 Toyota Corolla that now has almost 24,000 miles on it. 

Reddit, I think I should talk to my parents about selling the car, paying off my debt and buying a cheaper car with the remaining cash. Is this a good idea? The title is in my name and if I decide to sell it I have no clue where to even start. 

I'll take any advice you guys have. Thank you so much."
26x6gh,2,2014-05-30,26 - Still absolutely no clue what I want to do. Help?,plipmaster,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/26x6gh/26_still_absolutely_no_clue_what_i_want_to_do_help/,"In a very deep rut now with what is currently a up and down and unstable career in professional audio.  It's been 4 years now, and I've been very miserable and lost on what to do.  

Backstory:  My biggest dream since childhood was to work in game development and go to one of the 4 year game design schools (like Digipen).  My family harassed me about this and made me feel like an idiot for wanting to do it so I (stupidly) went to a state college instead (Penn State).  I hated it, and I had a lot of issues with the system and professors.  I was always a high GPA student so I didn't have problems with flunking or what not, I just felt so much was wrong with the system in general and academia.  I spent three years at Penn State and felt like I wasn't learning anything, so I dropped out.  

After much consideration, I felt going to a vocational school was my best bet at this point.  I had already wasted 3 years so I wanted to make up for lost time.  Plus with so many college graduates not finding work and employers complaining they don't have any skills anyway, it seemed like the most well-informed decision at the time.  I went to a vocational school for audio recording and engineering.  

Well, I loved it.  Super hands on program that taught on the job and practical skills.  Very cutthroat and fast paced program, but it was excellent.  I even landed an internship in audio design while in school yet and thought I had done it, everything was going to work out.  

Welp, 4 years later and thousands of hours of effort put into the job search, my career has been nothing but up and down contract gigs.  My internship was extended for nearly 2 years but I never was able to get made full-time.  Gaps of horrible unemployment, layoffs, no benefits, contract work.  I am miserable.  I want stability so bad so I can finally settle down with my girlfriend and start a family, but it's hard to do when I've been draining my savings account every year to make it through this feast and famine career.  

So here I am now.  I've currently been unemployed 10 months and have only managed some part time freelance here and there.  I'm going back to school now for a Business Management degree, but to be honest, I really don't know what I want to do.  The thing that felt most right turned out to be a flop due to all the instability with it.  Other jobs that appeal to me are also generally considered unstable and feast or famine.  I've done career coaching, career assessments, and read several career books, and all point me back into the direction of audio and games, but I can't deal with the instability of it even if that's where my best skills and passion lay.  When looking at other careers based off assessments, I don't know if I can see myself doing any of them.  Some of the careers that appeal to me the most (engineering for example) I really think I lack the aptitude for.  Business management and project management is a top match on my career assessments, but you don't exactly just become a manager with a snap of the fingers...  

All and all, I am just extremely lost on what I should be doing with my time and energy.  I'm in my business management degree now, but I'm feeling like I should maybe swap into something more specialized like Accounting or Human Resources (but Accounting honestly doesn't seem like my thing... and I'm ONLY attracted to it because of the high availability).  I think I've thought of every job in the world, meditated and soul searched about them, heck even mock interviewed people about them, and still nothing seems to click except my audio and game development which I am so sick of.  More than anything though I want stability, but I just can't seem to settle on something to focus on.  

TL:DR No idea what I want to do for a career.  The jobs that felt most right have been too unstable and made me miserable.  I'm currently going back to school for a new degree and want to make sure I'm making the right choice. The smart choice that will allow me to finally settle down, buy a home, and have some financially security and a decent life.  

EDIT: Sorry this is a wordy post.  Even still I don't feel like I've even scratched the surface of my struggles just trying to get a career going and finding my path in life.  Sometimes I don't think even a million words can describe it... part of almost wants to write a biography on my soul tearing experiences the last 4 years.  All and all, I'm trying to make things better now by going back to school, but just nothing feels right, and things that do I don't really fit into.  You think I would have a clear answer from all the asssessments, tests, coaching, and soul searching I've done, but I'm just as confused as I've ever been.  "

So

1) Should I do independent project on my own?

If Yes then:

Should I document them on a website, and put that website on my resume along with a little something about the projects?

2) If No then is there anything else can do?

For the Project(s), I have 2 mechanical heavy projects on my resume already that I did in the university with Creo. Now during the summer I'm planning to go through the book Make: Electronics to expand my horizons in the electrical side of things. Once I go through the book I plan to either use one of the projects from the book or build something what I learn from it.

Dawson: Mikko!  This is a family show!

Mikko: Is correct, yes, I not sleep with Mary Elizabeth?

Mikko: [*dismissive*] As was saying. Regardless of... unfortunate interactions, I am actually happy our reformed nun friend is returned.

Dawson: Happy?

Mikko: She was always... stabilizing force, in life of James Harshaw. Something he can use now, yes?

Dawson: Stabilizing... I am not sure I follow...

Mikko: And, is not his fault!  The pressures, of being RWF champion, of multiple millions of dollars in movie contracts, his partial ownership of racist hometown Red-person NFL team... look, my friend James needs some help, and maybe Sister Mary Elizabeth is help he need?

Dawson: James Harshaw, the man who has tried to take you out multiple times, you're still calling him a friend?

Mikko: Is... is odd to say, yes?  How you say in English, love the sinner but hate the sin? [*Mikko shakes his head*] Look, Harshaw and I, have been in wars together, wars against each other... at end of day, our business makes strange relationships. I worry.  Is why, at Off The Rails, I take one worry off his mind. I defeat my friend James, I walk away as RWF Champion, James can get help he needs, without pressure of being champion!  Everyone happy.

Dawson: So you're saying you're going to beat James Harshaw... to save him?

Mikko: In a sense, yes.

Dawson: Well, that's one way to go.  Any final thoughts before we wrap this up?

Mikko: Off The Rails will be... well, let's just say, will be not like anything anyone has seen before.  Will be changer of the game.

Dawson: A game-changer.

26ybhc,1,2014-05-31,"1in6 Inc., Blog: Educating Our Inner Circle",1in6org,blogs,https://www.reddit.com/r/blogs/comments/26ybhc/1in6_inc_blog_educating_our_inner_circle/,"Originally Posted May 29, 2014

I recently had the opportunity to facilitate a training for the Florida Council Against Sexual Violence Biennial Summit on “Awareness and Engagement” practices. I was very excited to come back to my home state and share the work we’ve been engaging in to help the 1 in 6 male survivors of childhood sexual abuse. It was the time I spent teaching violence-prevention education in a correctional facility in Florida that encouraged my focus on men. My personal excitement for coming home to Florida was in seeing my parents. I had not seen them since I moved to California over two years ago. Although our separation was due to work and  life changes, it was and continues to be a most difficult adjustment. I thank video calls (and my parent’s willingness to use technology) for the  gift of seeing their faces from 3000 miles away. Mother’s day, their recent 48th year anniversary and their presence at our training made the trip extra special (and emotional).

I didn’t realize how much my family didn’t know about me, our work or the movement to be inclusive of men. It is true for many of us in the service-provider fields, that our families are clueless about our work. We can blame ourselves for not explaining it enough times in detail, or the fact that they cut us off when they don’t want to “hear” more about the realities of sexual abuse and the subsequent need for research, awareness, prevention, policy and response.  I THOUGHT they knew, but I realized even my friends can’t really explain our work. Sometimes I feel like Chandler Bing from FRIENDS or Barney Stinson from HIMYM, “what do you actually do?” was an ongoing mystery in both sitcoms and the prevailing punchline. 

Do we really apply our awareness to our inner circle of friends and family?

I recall a keynote address by Dr. Dorothy J. Edwards author of the Green Dot Violence Prevention Strategy. She stated the same dismay about her own inner circle and their lack of awareness (and intervention). Dr. Edwards said that awareness and prevention should start with our own group of friends, family and neighbors. Ok, so you may not be able to get your 76-year-old parents to attend your workshop, but her point still makes sense. The more involved we are with the people closest to us, the more effective we can be in preventing sexual abuse and violence as a whole. 

After the training (and the exuding pride of my Colombian parents) I overheard my mother and father discussing what they thought needed to happen to encourage the public to acknowledge men as survivors of sexual abuse. Mom thought we needed to change the public “mentality” (to dispel myths and misconceptions that perpetuated barriers to disclosure and healing). My father said (in Spanish), “No se puede cambiar la mente de la gente” or “You can’t change a person’s mind, but it’s true, men need help too”. I realized what was happening: my parents were talking about strategic ways to address sexual violence. Holy smokes! We are starting a journey towards awareness! It was my turn to beam with pride. Two elder, Roman Catholic, working-class immigrants, from the mountains of Colombia were openly engaging in a rich conversation about abuse, and offering views on how to prevent, intervene and heal.   

To all the service providers and volunteers in the movement to end childhood sexual abuse and improve resources for the 19 million (and more) men dealing with it’s effects: keep teaching, keep talking, those closest to you are listening.

26yc0z,43,2014-05-31,How do I handle not having any work to do at my internship?,intern_throwaway11,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/26yc0z/how_do_i_handle_not_having_any_work_to_do_at_my/,"Hello, I hope this is the right place to post this.

I'm a college student.  About three weeks ago I started an engineering internship at a fairly large company.  Unfortunately, they don't seem to have a lot of work for me to do, and a lot of people in my group seem fairly apathetic that I am there.

I tend to be a little shy, but I don't think I gave them any reason to see me as rude or incapable.  Whenever I am given a task, even if it is ""busywork"" such as copying stuff into Excel, I always happily accept it.  I'll make sure to finish it quickly, check for spelling mistakes, and format it nicely.  I'll then double check with them to make sure I did it correctly and ask if there's anything I should fix.  However, it seems like most of the time I ask for more work, they really don't have anything for me to do.  

Whenever I talk to my manager, he always seems like he's too busy for me, or I'm keeping him from something more important.  I know I'm just an intern, but I sort of expected them to have more projects for me to work on; otherwise, why did they hire me?  The other day he was talking on his phone in the hallway and I overheard him say he doesn't have any work for me to do.

I have friends who are interning at other companies this summer, and I can't help but feel a little bad when I hear them talking about all the cool projects they are contributing to and the things they are working on.  I am worried that if the rest of the summer is like this, then I won't develop many skills to make me useful for future internships/co-ops.

I was wondering if any of you have advice on how I should handle this situation?  If things don't improve, what should I tell future interviewers if they ask me what I learned from this internship?

I know am being a little vague here because I am afraid of being identified, and I certainly do not want to badmouth the company.  The company is great, but it seems like I do not fit in well with my group.  If you would like to talk about it in more detail, feel free to PM me.  Thanks!"

I have been seeing this guy since December, we met on an internship I was doing, he started texting me and we have been hanging out about once a week or so since then. Yes he is much older than me. Things have been good, we became exclusive last week or so, but due to the fact that my parents would probably kill me if they knew I was dating a guy of this age, I haven't told them or anyone really. we've pretty much just been enjoying each other, having great sex, hanging out, talking and getting to know each other. To my knowledge he hasn't really told anyone either for the same reason of the judgment. Maybe if we keep seeing each other I would tell people but in these early stages I haven't yet.

Anyway, fast forward to last night, we had a great night out, went to dinner, came back to his place and fell asleep--he was exhausted. So me, being drunk and not totally trusting him because I have my doubts why he would even hang out with a woman of my age, pick up his phone and start to look through the messages.

Please do not tell me I'm a horrible person, I know this is a huge huge huge privacy/trust issue, but I already didn't trust him to begin with, I just got that gut feeling. We have all done it at some point, I have had people go through my phone, honestly it doesn't bother me because I have nothing to hide.

So the last two people he texts are girls (WHILE he was on the date with me). I start reading through them and my jaw DROPS. I'm reading stuff the girls say like ""come cuddle, it's been too long"", ""I want to massage oil on your shoulders"", etc etc, I can't even remember some other stuff because my heart was beating so hard. He was calling them babe too (which he also calls me). This is way more than just friends. I'm not sure how recent or how often he texts these girls but it seems pretty often.

At this point I'm freaking out (and still pretty buzzed) so I wake him up and the idiot I am, I straight up ask him if he sexts other girls. He goes ""why are you asking this"" and I tell him that I don't trust him and I just have a gut feeling. (I put his phone back where it was). He says the only girl he is seeing is me (I'm pretty sure he just said ""seeing""). He asks if I went through his phone. I say no. He starts getting angry and long story short, tells me he was in a relationship with another girl before and she went through his phone and everything changed. I asked why everything changed, what does he have on his phone that he is hiding. He says he has pictures of naked girls... I'm like...why do you have pictures of naked girls... he says ""I don't know"". So then I ask him if I can go through his phone and hes like ""it'll change everything"" and he doesn't let me. I tell him I think he's ""sketchy as fuck."" At this point he gets up and starts getting dressed and tells me he's leaving (it's like 1am). I convince him not to leave but he tells me he doesn't trust me anymore since I don't trust him, and he goes on this spiel about how he doesn't really trust anyone, and I came in here and he told me stuff about his life, money, family, and I guess he trusted me a lot... or so he says.

I guess I don't know what these messages mean and I don't know what to even think or do now. Obviously I can't confront him about it because then it would be my fault for reading his texts. But I'm laying there thinking, ""how many other girls have you told the same exact shit to, how many other girls are you texting"". I'm pretty sure he's not SLEEPING with any others or even hanging out with them because I believe both of them live far away, but I'm assuming at one time this was happening. I guess I'm just ranting but I would really like to hear what you guys think. Sorry this was so long I'm just freaking out and I'm pretty heartbroken that I let myself get this close to him and now I find all this out. 





EDIT: so I asked him why he said It would change everything if I went through his phone and his response was ""it ruins trust that right now was apparently just starting with us, but when in a relationship for a long time, it puts trust to the test."" I don't even know what that means.

26ysan,9,2014-05-31,My [20F] asked for a break with me [20M] we've been dating for 18 months. Don't know how I should handle this.,advice_welcomed,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/26ysan/my_20f_asked_for_a_break_with_me_20m_weve_been/,"Long time lurker, throwaway for this. Sorry it's gonna be a long one

A little background - I've been dating my GF since January of 2013 and for the most part things were going good. I'm from a small town and lower middle class, She's from one of the biggest cities in the South and very well off, so while we didn't see eye to eye sometimes, we balanced each other out. This becomes important later.  

Here's where things get complicated. We both went home for the summer and I only got to see her maybe 2 or 3 times for that time. I also began having serious premature ejaculation issues out of nowhere. I went from lasting 15-20 minutes in bed, to maybe 2 at most. This starts making both of us angry since I didn't know how to deal with it and didn't want to accept that it was happening. 

So all of our sophomore year is either hit or miss, some great nights, a lot of average ones, and some where we go to bed together pissed but make up in the morning. All the while my PE continues, the bedroom becomes an issue and eventually sex dwindles to maybe once every two weeks, Causing more tension. 

So the past month we've been arguing a lot, neither of us are happy. This summer, I'm staying in my college town to take classes and work and she went back home to do an internship. About 4 hours from each other and she always has work on weekends so seeing her is complicated. This past weekend I went to see her for her birthday and stayed with her for a week. We got into a fight almost every other day. The night before I was suppose to leave, everything came to a head. 

I asked her what was the problem and what we need to do for it to work. She admitted that she was unhappy and that she didn't know if we would work. She said that the main issues were sex(she said she hadn't had an orgasm in months, something that still keeps me up at night) and that always fighting about our different financial upbringings and situations. She said that she's been thinking about a break for the summer and I asked not to do that and that just let us sleep on it for the night and talk about it in the morning since it was already 3 am. 

So in the morning we go at it again and she reiterates that she's hates the fact that she can't even enjoy sex anymore. And that she just needs time to figure herself out and find what makes her happy. I yielded and accepted but asked her if we could still talk. I know breaks don't usually work but I love this girl and I want to make it work. 

So here is my question. Do I ask for a set of rules for the break? Such as no hooking up/sex with anyone for both of us. And that we can occasionally talk. I don't want to shut her out of my life for 2 months and then think everything will work out. But I know that she's going to want to have sex with someone else to get her fill and I can't bear to think of that, I don't know if I can take her back after that (selfish I know). I just want to know what I should do to make it to where we can actually come out of this happy and together. 

I'm working on the issues from my end, getting back into shape, buying fleshlight stu after this paycheck comes in to fix my PE issues, and going onto anti-anxiety medication to fix my general anxiety issues (something I've struggled with for a while) And figuring out what I want in life. 

Tl:Dr - GF wants a break to figure herself out and I'm scared it won't work out later. Need advice on what to make of it.

26yx8y,0,2014-05-31,"Not sure if to contact or bother ever again... I'm 22/F, UK and need someone to read and advise me on my ex.",[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/26yx8y/not_sure_if_to_contact_or_bother_ever_again_im/,"Hi Ladies,

So I am just wondering if I should ever bother to contact my ex again? I shall refer to him as J throughout this...

We got together new years eve 2012 (be picked me up from work and we went back to mine and kissed etc...) he didn't want a relationship but wanted it to just be us... then after a few months of me moaning I wanted to make it official we did... he didn't like the idea of having me as his gf on fb, I never met any of his friends, I only got invited to family events if his brothers gf was confirmed to come first... So that's all a great basis for my insecurities. 

I didn't know if he still did weed after I asked him to stop because it turned him into a complete arse hole! His choice to stop but I did ask him if he could and he said he had... Which turned out to be a lie at the end of our relationship his friend told me he had been smoking for a few months... great. I wouldn't have minded but the fact he lied is a bit shit and I was pretty open about him telling me and said I just didn't like how he acted when he was stoned and plus he smelt bad haha.

Anyway... So yes, we hung out slept together (too much) and I just didn't feel emotionally satisfied by him but yet I had fallen head over heals in love with this guy. We saw each other way too much as we lived together at uni (which is how we met). and it just got intense... anyway, summer came round and I started to become mentally ill with depression and anxiety pretty badly. I went to see CBT psychiatrist for a few months and felt really alone and sad. I cut all my hair off often wrongly screamed at him, ran off at night and behaved really quite badly. Which I feel shit for now but at the time was really at the stage where I'd end up doing something silly and hurting myself (not on purpose just out of being so messed up). SO I got through that and then a year had gone by... I was really insecure and always asking him if he looked at that girl and why? This is because my named A had cheated on me and I ended up getting beaten to near death more or less... I have memory loss from that night and it just messed my head up and I jumped into this relationship WAY too soon after and didn't give myself time to heal. Which was majorly unfair for J and I accept that and have on a million occasions apologised and genuinely felt guilty. 

My best friend said he wasn't there enough for me and handled the situations badly but I KNOW he cared and I feel bad for the fact he found me hard to deal with even though he tried very hard.

Anway so now to recently, I hadn't met his friends still... he was getting distant, not spending time with me... ignoring me more not turning up to dinner because 'i was annoying' and only visiting me for a 10 second shag a few times a week then leaving! I felt so used and crap and had tried to talk to him a few times about it but he just said I was causing problems every-time I tried too. 

All my friends had moved away from uni as they were older or dropped out... seriously, they all went. over 20 people! It was so shit! 

I was in my last year and had SO much work to do. I made a few new friends and saw them a lot, one girl in particular she was lovely but had worse relationship problems than we did which made mine worse in a way as I started to behave how she was to her bf... not well and like a brat.

BUT here you will be reading this as it is all my fault... so I am going to just discuss why I was like that and how my ex J behaved towards me.

So, I have had depression and anxiety medically diagnosed as pretty bad. I also have a hormone imbalance in my body resulting in higher testosterone which sucks! I have pills to fix the latter and recently after the break up with J went onto anti-depressant/anxiety tablets that work a treat!!!! I am back to myself now. 

My ex J never wanted to listen to my problems or how I felt and I really (obviously) needed to speak to someone like my bf... about them. I felt really alone and just wanted some form of fun and comfort at the same time. 

I asked him loads of we could go to the pub / bars meet his friends and hang out so he could spend time with them and me and I would get to see him and he could see his friends.

He would see his friends about 4/5 days (whole days) a week and me probably one.. I once asked him if we could see each other more and plan it better as it was airy fairy and I spent WAY too much time sitting about waiting for him or hanging on texts which he ignored. He said he saw me plenty and to stop moaning. 

Whenever I tried to talk to him about how crap I felt in our relationship and how it was he told me I was intense causing problems and to stop behaving like a child or he would leave me. I often asked him the same questions over and over... because of my mental anxiety and he got SO angry at me. so much so he got up and left quite regularly. I was never mad or anything in the last year I asked like I would ask someone to pass me butter or milk at a table. 

He also cancelled on me a lot or turned up VERY late to things or just didn't at all.. I found myself running after him a lot bare foot when he left in a huff, I also walked to his flat (in a city 10 min walk) at night 1am.... because he was angry at me... we usually had sex and he walked me home.

He also wrote a list of all my negatives and positives and told me if I didn't change my negatives he would leave me. 

My positives were 'you are pretty, fun spontaneous' whereas the negatives were 'you are intense, question me, behave badly and your feelings are wrong'...

basically I just felt really used and I had it three weeks ago. it was 7am in the morning and his flat mate was playing music REALLY loudly. it woke me up. I let it go for an hour... and said to my bf it was bugging me. He just told me to shut up and sleep but I REALLY can't. I didn't have any clothes on me but my bf did so I asked him to go and ask his flat mate to turn it off for me (flat of dudes) he didn't for ages so I asked him again and he finally did and came back and told me to get out so I threw water at him because he was being so insensitive and rude to me. 

I instantly regretted doing that and probably look like a crazy ass bitch to you all reading this but I really HAD it I was so sick of him pushing me about and not letting me have an opinion or ask him to do something for me so I decided to ask him to sort the music out and he proved my point of he never likes to do things I ask him to do, yet I make him breakfast, clean his bathroom... I do a lot for him yet he near the end of the relationship did literally nothing. That night he had offered to cook me dinner, WOW GREAT I was happy... he was offering to do this because he had cancelled on me the night before... even though I came back to uni from home specifically to see him...! GREAT. He cooked me a roast... all out of a packet too and I put it all on the trays and basically did it all. I was NOT impressed. 

There was a time he used to properly cook for me... ok he did this twice but I genuinely felt like we were improving in our relationship. 

SO everything in the last few weeks was shit.... It started to get good the last week before we broke up as I met his friends and stuff... but nope he just went totally weird. 

As you can see I blame myself for a lot of this and my psychiatrist said that it is not my fault and he has manipulated my thought process to assume feelings and opinions I had were A LIE. . . which she said is impossible... a lie is something you do purposefully whereas if I feel neglected or upset he said they were lies? 

Anyway... when we were happy we were REALLY happy and I loved him with all my heart.

I just needed to get all this out and hopefully someone somewhere will read though it all!

I am MUCH better now, I have lost my temper, I am chilled out... active doing things, seeing loads of friends I hadn't seen in ages because they are guys and I felt awkward seeing them before! I even got an amazing summer internship that pays SOOO WELL! SO I am happy now.... 

I just have this little niggling feeling that I miss him a little... that I don't know what his problems were and why he couldn't get over whatever he needed to get over and accept that I was mentally ill for 11 months of the relationship but got better.... he still blamed me and brought up stuff when I was really not well and said I do it on purpose which I REALLY do not... none of my ex's or friends ever experienced that and my best friend said she was SO worried about me and probably posted on reddit loads about it as she uses it!

Anyway I am single now and have been for nearly a month. I haven't spoken to him in a whole week now and he hasn't contacted me.

He has been on Whatsapp a few times clearly to see if I had messaged him as he didn't use it for anyone else (yes I sadly checked) but I am not going to contact him again because I just feel like I would be entering another manipulative sad relationship which I feel could have been great if he had accepted help. 

just to add... he never spoke about anything emotional... the relationship, his family friends NOTHING. I knew NOTHING about anything to do with him. I did ask! He also blamed me for his anger issues.

Anyway, look forward to replies :). Sorry for the dissertation of text.

I've got a summer internship with a firm at The Tower at Cityplace. I start at 8:00 AM weekday mornings, and so far that's meant leaving home by 6:40 AM. I can't help but feel like that's way, way too long and that I'm doing something wrong.

I live near I-20 and Bowen in Arlington, and I've tried taking George Bush, 161 and 480 and Loop 12 north to I-30. 161 is probably the best of the three. My GPS then suggests I take exit 44 to Beckley, take the new bridge onto Woodrow Rogers and 75 and then exit onto Haskell.

I think it's the last bit there that trips me up - I can get to downtown Dallas reasonably quickly, but there's always traffic downtown and having to drive straight through it isn't ideal.

Is there a better way to navigate downtown or any way to skip it completely? Back roads, other exits? Any and all suggestions are appreciated. Thanks!"
26z00g,27,2014-05-31,"Going to start learning vim, pretty overwhelmed!",babyhands1,vim,https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/26z00g/going_to_start_learning_vim_pretty_overwhelmed/,"Hey guys! So I am going through the vimtutor right now and I am pretty overwhelmed. I am starting an internship writing in php (never written in php) and I have to as well learn the cakePHP framework, so learning vim on top of this is kinda overwhelming. I know as a computer science student, and as a programmer, there will never be a time where I am NOT learning about new things, so I know learning vim will never be super convenient. 

This being said, I know learning vim will make me a more efficient programmer in the long run, so I am willing to put in the time and effort to become proficient at it! I do, however, have a couple questions:

First: Coming from eclipse, sublime text, etc, I have grown fond of a couple things. First is that they automatically indent the code for me. I think this is installed by default in vim? Another is that whenever I type an open parenthesis, bracket, or brace, the editor will automatically close it and put my cursor in the middle. How do I get this up and running in vim? The next is color/code highlighting. I know vivify lets me set all that up, and I will just google how to install that. So I guess I am just wondering how I get the auto-paren/bracket/brace setup (and if auto-indent isn't installed how do I get it installed)? 

Second: There seems to be an infinite amount to learn, and it seems overwhelming! How do you guys manage a slow steady amount of learning while still being productive? 

Third: I am really going to miss not having a file manager+tabs at my finger tips. It makes opening up new files and working with multiple files so easily. I understand the terminal is a file manager, but it isn't quite the same as having a file opened and being able to click on multiple files and open them in new tabs. How do you guys deal with this?

Thanks for all of your future help! "
26z3yj,0,2014-05-31,High achieving engineering graduate with zero job offers. What gives?,[deleted],EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/26z3yj/high_achieving_engineering_graduate_with_zero_job/,"Hello r/engineeringstudents. I am a recent graduate in electrical engineering from a reasonably well-regarded Midwestern engineering school. Despite applying to literally dozens of companies throughout my senior year, I have only managed to receive two interviews (neither of which resulted in an offer). Despite this lack of success in my job search, I was an outstanding student in school: in addition to graduating with an overall GPA of 3.8+ (and an engineering GPA only ever so slightly lower), I also spent over three semesters gaining valuable experience in an engineering research lab on campus. I never received an internship but I feel that because of the nature of my work and how long I had this position, it was far more valuable than a brief summer internship would have been. Due to these accomplishments, I was granted what was essentially a free pass into the graduate program at my university. However, right now industry is where I want to go but it seems that all of my hard work and accomplishments mean absolutely nothing. Anyway, what gives? Does industry just hate high achievers?"

I am just finishing up my junior year of high school. Computer science is what I love, and what I intend to major in. I just don't know where to go next.

So, I have just completed MIT's OpenCourseWare Introduction to Computer Science (here, for those interested: http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00sc-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-spring-2011/)

The course is in taught in Python. I know I am still far from good, but I now feel much more confident in my abilities. I managed to get an internship this summer, where I will be working mostly in C, and with some Python. They are planning to teach me what I don't know, but will need for the job.

But on my own time, and for next year in school, I want to get started in Android development. I know I will need to know Java and how to use Eclipse, but I don't know much else. A lot of the resources I'm seeing are kind of overwhelming and I don't know where to begin.

So. Does anybody have any suggestions? I am trying to figure out what I need to learn, where I can learn it, and how to get started.



Thank you!"

Now, at 26, I am stuck in a dead end job and still live with my parents",justanotherfailure99,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/26z6ym/i_had_delusions_of_becoming_a_billionaire_when_i/,"I still remember like it was yesterday... I was 10 and got asked by one of my teachers what I wanted to be when I grew up. I naively said ""a billionaire"". True, I had no clue how to become a billionaire, but that was my dream. By 20, my goal was to become a millionaire, and by 30, a billionaire. I started reading a whole load of business, entrepreneurship and investing books from a young age. I wanted to invest in stocks early but I had no money. I couldn't get a loan from my parents because they said investing was too risky and it was all just ""luck and random chance""; the same as gambling. They said that I should have more realistic dreams like becoming a doctor, lawyer or an engineer. Because no one in my school had any interest in entrepreneurship or investing, I naturally obeyed my parents and started concentrating in getting into a good university. I still kept up my interest in business, entrepreneurship and investing, though it was more of a hobby now. Time went by and I got my bachelors in science. I couldn't secure any entry level jobs or even internships because the job market was so competitive. I was also still under the delusion that I could become a billionaire and beat the 9 - 5 rat race everyone was stuck in, so I applied for a Masters to buy more time. 

It took me a while to figure out that getting a job required networking with people, so I started to go to dozens of career fairs during my Masters. But even careers fairs didn't get me anywhere. All the employers at the stands ever did was tell me about their application process if I was interested once I got through the huge queues... Because careers fairs were so crowded, I couldn't connect with anyone because the employers had ""heard it all before""... I was no star candidate or prince charming that all these companies were looking for.

After I finished my Masters, I was back to square one. I tried to understand how I couldn't become a billionaire, let alone a millionaire at aged 22. Most of the people I hung around with hit it big with either their startups or securing 6 figure salaries in their FIRST TIME jobs. I was confused. I couldn't understand why I couldn't hit it big aswell. I couldn't understand why I couldn't get a graduate level job either after my Masters. Months went by and my parents started to get really annoyed with me wasting my time around the house so they told me to get any job.

I came across mainstream news articles on the web by people saying ""think you'll get a job with a Degree? Tough. You are no different to a high school dropout"", or ""be happy with any job you get, even if you hate it in this job market"". All this negativity by even the mainstream media started to get me really depressed and demotivated to do anything. It made me feel completely worthless. I felt betrayed. All those years of hard work at school, college and graduate school were for nothing.  All those years of reading several investing and business books were for nothing because they did fuck all to tell me ""if you follow steps 1 - 10, you'll get x results guarenteed"". Everything I ever did was pointless because I didn't gain any hard measurable skills or master anything at all. I had no competitive edge. I was not good at anything at all. I was just like everyone else... 

The only jobs I could get were low paying menial ones after I discarded my entire education history. So I started doing odd jobs and kept a low profile as i didn't want anyone to find out I had a frikkin Masters in Science. I did some volunteering but still they were of no help. I couldn't connect with anyone at work because they acted so happy all the time for no apparent reason. Volunteering actually gave me the creeps but I still forced myself to do it for a while to see where it would go. 

Eventually, I got myself a job in the big city, but it was one I hated to the core. The pay was just over minimum wage, so I normally work 12 hours a day to get shitty overtime. People kept telling me its better than nothing, so I stuck to it. I hate everyone here but I still work my ass off to not get myself fired. Even though I know I'm just a little bitch and data monkey with no hope of ever moving up the ladder, I am still doing this shitty job 4 years I graduated with my Masters.

Because my parents are still generous, they allow me to live with them because rent in the big city is just fucking criminal. I come back late at home in an overcrowed train with thoughts I want to kill everyone in there because I often have some other guy's armpit pressed on my face. During the weekends, I sometimes take bus or train trips to literally nowhere and come back home late at night, trying to figure out what would make me happy, because nothing does anymore. My dreams are pretty much shattered because I didn't know how to achieve them in the first place.

How pathetic...but what can I do. I would be too selfish to kill myself, so I have to keep living a pointless and unfulfilling life.

If I could go back in time to when I was 10, I would slap myself on the face for having such silly dreams. Dreams do NOTHING but bring delusions because reality is a fucking bitch, and then you die anyway.

Its too late to do anything now as I have no motivation to do anything at all. Even if I had any motivation, I still wouldn't know what to do with it...

So I'm an Irish guy moving over to Cambridge next week to start a year long internship and am trying to sort out my money situation. 

From looking around a bit I think I'm going to end up setting up a new bank account in the UK, probably something like a [FlexDirect from Nationwide](http://www.nationwide.co.uk/products/current-accounts/landing-page/flexdirect?cmpid=Aggregators_205#~).


I have a bank account over here in Ireland, with about €3,000 in it. I was wondering mainly about what some of the best options might be for bringing it across? 
Usually for small amounts I would probably be just using my debit card at cash points for getting money, but I would assume I'm getting hit with at least some bad conversion rates if not additional fees (I'm not really sure).  As it is a bit of a bigger amount I'm trying to make an effort to not get screwed.


Would something as simple as withdrawing cash at my bank, bringing it across and simply opening the account with that money(euros) be an option? I don't have any experience with bank transfers or anything, but I guess once I have the new account set up I could transfer it across to the new account? (I'm not sure how complicated this would be with myself out of the country).


Any ideas would be awesome as I'm fairly clueless at this point! =)"

26zh3y,0,2014-05-31,Roughly $1200 Gaming Pc,pcthrowaway35,buildapcforme,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/comments/26zh3y/roughly_1200_gaming_pc/,"* What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using. 

I've always console gamed and I'm making the switch. I'm hoping this will kind of be the ""last pc you buy for awhile"" kind of thing. I got a well paid summer internship so I'm going to sell my xbone and but the cash into this build. Since I'm used to console gaming I've never had to worry about whether or not I can run a game. So something that can run most games that would be on console would be perfect.

* What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes? 

I'm looking to spend about $1200. Its not exactly a very strict budget though.

* When do you plan on building/buying the PC? 

My goal is to complete it by the end of the summer. I'm starting so early so that I can keep an eye out for sales during the summer as my paychecks come in. 

* What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc) 

I've always been a mac guy so I need literally everything. I would enjoy a double monitor setup so I know this could push it more to about $1500. You can leave the keyboard and mouse out since that is highly opinionated.  

* Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location? 

US PA and yes, I can drive to a microcenter.

* If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated. 

N/a

* Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU? 

Probably not

* Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc) 

Not particularly. 

* Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components? 

Be creative! Try not to make it crazy gimmicky please. (Giant black tower with tons of red flashing lights or something like that) That's not what I'm looking for. Something simple.

* Do you need a copy of Windows 7 or 8.1 included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference for one or the other?  

No I do not

* Extra info if required:

Thank you in advance, I know you guys work very hard for complete strangers!"
26zjal,3,2014-05-31,"Being harassed by my school, even though I am in the right. However, there is a TINY detail that might possibly damage my case...",[deleted],legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/26zjal/being_harassed_by_my_school_even_though_i_am_in/,"the Dean of career services has decided he thinks I'm lying about a summer internship offer, when I am not. He wants to force me to let him contact the people who gave me the offer and ask them if I lied. Obviously that would make me look sketchy as hell. There is only one possible inconsistency I can think of in all the statements they will be relying on to fuck me over...

So basically it comes down to these 2 statements I made:

When detailing my summer internship situation recently to the Dean I said:
""At that point (after I learned my first Texas choice didn't give me an offer) I really only had 2 unpaid job offers in texas but could not make them work for personal and financial reasons""

A few weeks before that, I had emailed an alumni explaining my situation and asking for advice on finding a job, in which I said:
""Unfortunately I had to end up declining my Texas job offer for personal and financial reasons which is why I am sending you this email last minute""

The only possible question in this case that I can see them asking is ""well in the email to the alumni you said you had to decline your job offer, then later when you explained your situation in detail to me you said at one point you had 2 job offers left in Texas...so is it one or two?""

First - I never said my ONLY Texas job offer in the email to the alumni. I was literally just trying to be as concise as possible in explaining myself to the alumni.

Second - I technically did decline one offer before the other, so by the time I emailed the alumni I had just declined my last remaining offer in Texas

Is this something I should worry about?

I'm seeing an attorney on Monday and just want to know if this is something I should focus on. It seems WAY too trivial but still I'm worried.

Thanks

26zkng,0,2014-05-31,HELP!!! First interview as a Web Developer.,kwaxe,AskComputerScience,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskComputerScience/comments/26zkng/help_first_interview_as_a_web_developer/,"Hey guys, I'm 20yro and I've currently finished my first 2 years at a community college in CompSci but I'm planning on transferring to a 4 yr school to get my bachelors. I was planning on getting an internship this summer as a web developer but never got an interview. So I decided to apply for a full-time position as a Front-End Web Developer for a retail store just to test my luck and lucky me I got an interview this upcoming Monday! 

While I was going through the requirements for the position it listed some of these:

- 2+ years of professional experience
(**Other than participating in my schools hack-a-thon to create a mobile app**)

- Knowledge of cloud-based CDNs (RackSpace, Scene7, etc.) (**Never before used**)

- A great portfolio of professional work. (**Don't have one**)

I know that I'm a really good programmer/web developer, I was even a tutor at my school for intro to Web Dev. But I have horrible interview skills and get extremely nervous about it. Like what are some of the questions ill be asked? I really don't have a portfolio of professional work other than class assignments, badass UI Websites I've created and uniquely interesting Photoshop pictures. I'm a really fast learner when It comes to programming. But I'm not necessarily a school person I've gotten really bad grades in about almost all my classes except programming, math, and art classes. So that probably makes up for why I didn't get an internship even through I stand at a 2.80 GPA. I feel as if they wouldn't want an amateur web developer working along side them. 

So if you guys could please help with some advice about Web-Dev interviews or any type of personal experience of IT positions to better my chances at getting this position I would really appreciate it. 

THANKS :D

**TL;DR** I'm having my first interview in 2 days as Web Dev need advice **please**! "
