Basically I have a very severe case of emotional abuse going on at home that I can't even remember a day without it happening in at least 10 years.  I'm 21 years old living at home (not by choice) and just trying to make it from day to day.  This is not your average kid complaining about stupid rules.  This is real emotional abuse.  Every single day of my life I have tried to simply avoid contact with my parents but I can't escape them.  My mother being the real issue, where my father is simply not willing to argue with her.  Life is easier for him to just accept what she says.  That's just how she is.  It's really hard to describe but more or less it is actually killing me.  I've developed severe anxiety and I'm certain that they are the cause.  I wake up every single morning dreading my life.  I'm scared that if it wasn't for my girlfriend I would have killed myself already.  It's that bad.  I feel like I can't live here any more but due to financial issues I will be stuck here for at least a year most likely, but then again I have been saying that year after year.  I am working as much as I can but my boss can't hire me full time due to budget cuts.  I am per diem with no benefits at all. 

I have no friends so I can't move in with anyone to just get away until I can afford to save up to get the first apartment I can afford.  My parents also make me pay rent which is making things harder since it's just more time trapped at home.  I do think paying rent would be fair normally, but I can't get out since they are making it impossible for me to leave while at the same time giving me a daily reminder that ""They hate me and can't wait until I leave.""

I'm trying not to turn this into a sob story but I'm pretty depressed and after at least 7 years of therapy and trying various anti-anxiety and anti-depressant meds I am literally out of options.  I feel like my life has been wasted so far and I really want to just be okay for once.  

Does anyone have any advice based on similar life experience?  Does anyone living in the Middlesex/North Shore area of MASS need a roomate who is willing to pay rent and take up as little space as you want and is willing to share everything I own?  I need to keep my current job because it pays far more than any other options I will get without a degree.  I work in PC support and hope to use the skills I have gained on my own to make it a career.  Luckily I got the internship in high school which is the only reason I have a job.  It was impossible for me to have paid for college without anyone to co-sign a loan so I accepted that I will have to work my way up the ladder of the IT world.  Just anything at all.  I'm out of places to turn so I sucked it up ignored my shame and posted this online.  Hopefully you don't all think I'm just exaggerating or taking things out of proportion.  I just really need some help and no one has been able to provide any at all.  Please help me.  "

I completed my Associate of Science in Computer Programming at the local community college and starting on my Bachelor of Science in Applied Science (Concentration in IT) at University of South Florida.  I am looking around Tampa, FL for internships dealing with IT (specifically; Linux server administration for bushiness.)

I would love to get an internship somewhere locally to where I can hone my skills and get experience to someday be a Linux System Administrator.  I know a little bit of bash and python scripting, and use Linux on the desktop regularly, but I feel without experience I can't actually get a job somewhere or learn as much as I could.  I've tried chaining together a network of Linux VMs to try and teach myself, but it's just not the same as having real-world experience.

I made a resume, but I don't exactly know how to get started in looking around for companies that need interns, since Tampa is such a large area, I'm just lost on how to get my name out there.

I would love to get into a business with an IT structure and system admin in place to help out and learn from, but I'm just lost on how to get started in this process.  I'm specifically interested on how samba works and catering windows clients.  I've looked at books, but I feel like I could get so much more out of experience.

Attached is my resume, if someone could look it over for suggestions on how to improve it, or suggestions on how to get an internship that would be a huge help!  Thanks Reddit!

dabty,11,2010-09-06,Why not...? Part 2,ThrowawayAccount4324,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/dabty/why_not_part_2/,"Hi reddit,

i've [posted a few months ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/bzj1c/why_not/) and just wanted to give you an update. **There's no danger**, so please don't worry. I really tried to get a better more livable life, but it just won't work. I know it's only been 4 months, but you have to take the 10 years before that into consideration.

I still have brutal headaches every single day. In the last 3 weeks they have been even worse, because i started a 20 week internship that every college student here has to go through. Being very close to people every day for 9hours is horrible for me. The constant ""do they think i'm stupid?"", ""what did that strange look mean?"", etc. drives me insane. I just can't concentrate and pretty much stare at program code for 8 hours without being able to read/comprehend anything.

I tried pretty much everything you people told me to do. I went to three new medical doctors and got my whole body checked and all 3 results showed nothing an unusual. I'm way healthier than most people at my age. Now that's some fucked up irony, huh? They gave me a bunch of different useless pain medications and the names of some psychologists that i already visited and one that i don't want to visit, because he has a horrible reputation.

I exercise again. I still run/swim/cycle for more than 10-20km two or three times a week and it doesn't help much. It relieves my headaches a little, but it's barely noticable.

I even tried massages for 3 months, twice a week.  It helped to make my wallet a lot lighter, but other than that it didn't do much good ;).

Between all that good and healthy stuff i had some fun and did whatever the hell i wanted to. Parachuting, driving to the Italy because a buddy wanted to camp and drink at the beach, riding rollercoasters in an amusement park on ecstasy and acid (holy fuck that was an experience!)... Believe it or not, i actually had a threesome on camera, if that counts as starring in a porno. That was all fun while it lasted, but the second i was lying in bed, it all was gone again. The insomnia is/was, as always there (5 hours of sleep in the last 4 days), and the next day was/is as horrible as always. Now i'm completely broke and the thought of going to another country right now is pretty much on hold. I'm stuck here for a long time.

As i've mentioned i started my internship and damn it makes me hate life even more. No matter how hard i try, i won't be able to do any kind of job to have a decent kind of living. It doesn't matter if it's freelancing or a regular job. Just the thought of something forcing me to work drives me insane. I know how stupid this sounds, but that's just the way it is and hey, it's my life.

I went back to the only medication that seems to help: weed. I'm high right now, because i'm sure this day would have ended bad without it. It's the first time in 4 months and damn it feels good. Most of the things i wrote have been written down before i got high, so please don't think it has anything to do with that. But you know what? My lawyer called a few days ago and told me i have to be in court in a couple of weeks and he's guessing i have to do regular drug tests and pay a hefty fine! This is such a fucking joke. I will need to get a second job just so i can pay the huge fine for the unbelievable crime of smoking and owning a plant, that is harmless when compared to alcohol and cigarettes, in the comfort of my own home. No growing, no selling, just smoking and owning around 3gram of weed. Fuck that, seriously. There's no way i'm gonna pay and support that corrupt, idiotic system. But of course that's not all. They will bully me on a regular basis with their drug tests and if there's even a slight discrepancy i will lose my driver's license.

My ""friends"" are pretty much gone. We had some small adventures in the last 4 months, but after trying again and again i realized i couldn't have a serious conversation with them and pretty much stopped talking to them. It's better that way.

Last but not least, i talked to my sister. She had holidays for 4 weeks and it was a ""good"" timing. She was not as shocked as i suspected her to be. She knows i've been in pain every single day for such a long time. We talked for a long time and both cried, but at the end she understood it, at least to the point where i know she could handle it. She doesn't want me to see unhappy, in pain and struggle every single day. She said if it is the only way i can be ""happy"", she won't stand in my way.  It was so horrible to talk with her about all of that, but it looks like she knew how desperate i was and why i turned to her with such a horrible thing.

I know how i would do it. I already tried it on on some different materials and even metal burned away like it was paper. I'm guessing the only thing that will be left of me are some really small chunks of burned teeth... scattered across a huge area. There's no way anyone would stumble upon anything of my body. That takes care of the problem that somebody could find my body and be scarred for live. I'm almost a bit proud of my contraption. Wow, that's a morbid thing to say... :D

I still can't think of a reason why i should stay alive. There's really nothing keeping me alive anymore. Thanks for reading all that stuff. You people are awesome. I've said it at the beginning of this post and i'll say it again: there's no danger of me killing myself, so please don't worry. I just needed to get these things off my chest again.

Time to go to bed now. I'm not sure if i'll be able to answer tomorrow, because i have to work late."
dagkd,5,2010-09-07,Straight guys and Craigslist Sex,I_See_Nah_Nah,sex,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/dagkd/straight_guys_and_craigslist_sex/,"A quick note:  this has nothing to do with ""Adult Services"" being removed from Craigslist.  This relates to personals ads such as Casual Encounters and w4m

After moving to a certain major city and finishing an internship I found myself with quite a bit of downtime.  There was no longterm relationship looming over my head and all I had to worry about was paying the bills on my swanky new room.  The room itself had come from Craigslist fully furnished and left me wondering what else Craigslist was good for.  I’d already used CL to rideshare, sell textbooks, buy a computer and just make quick cash.

Honestly, who hasn’t noticed the personal ads and laughed about it?  We all know someone who has “checked the missed connections.”  What about actually getting dates or hooking up... this is the part where the conversations change direction.  Coincidentally, there was no one around for me to joke with as everyone I knew was almost 24 hours away by car.  I figure why not live dangerously.

Too timid the make my own posting at first, I began an CL RSS subscription that I would check before and after work.  It didn’t take long for me to realize that most of the female postings for the entire city were fake unless they’d been posted by overweight women, disgruntled wives or single mothers.  Also, the majority of fake posting are put up later in the evening.  One will find it a little easier to narrow down selection by grammar and a basic comprehension of the English language.  Desperate ads are commonly written by bots waiting to verify your identity through a credit card.

After about ten days of this I decided to create a fake e-mail to send some replies and post an ad.  Note:  Always use a fake e-mail address from a legit site.  Know that nothing gives away a BS ad like lghji53k4@g-mail.com so the sender should be the first thing you check.  If there is any interest in this post I can create a handy little cheat sheet or flow chart for identifying real Craigslist sex opportunities.  

On to pictures:  On the subject of pictures I have a few thoughts.  In my opinion one should never use a picture in their Craigslist ad that reveals their true identity.  This is a horrible idea that could easily backfire on you as anyone can see it.  The correct response is always to meet in a public space and verify who you are hooking up with.  imho Anyone who refuses to do this is not worth my time.  Also, general dating listings on Craigslist is just as, probably more, effective at hooking you up.  If you play things cool (with the few legit people who respond) you might end up getting them interested enough to make your dreams come true.  It paid off for me twice over a two week span and both women were quite fun.

CE works like an ongoing game of Yahoo Chess.  The difference is eventually the only way to truly meet others becomes posting an ad and filtering through the endless spam that will follow.  Maybe only 1 real woman will respond out of 50, but that is the whole point.  This is especially true for men.  One of the women I ended up with said she’d had over 57 men contact her in less than a couple hours a few weeks earlier after she stupidly included a phone number.  Most of the responses will not take the time to actually read your ad, which is your key to filtering responses.

In the end CL works far better for the queer community, which has tons of better online options, and a few brave, selective women who aren’t yet familiar with where they are.  This leaves us straight dudes with little to go on besides a general sense of disbelief.  Even after posting you should expect to wait days before getting anything resembling a real person, but it does happen.  Just remember to double bag it and get tested afterwards.

Best of luck!"

I'm nearing the end of third year Software Systems &amp; Aerospace engineering @ UQ and I think it might be about time to start looking for an internship. Having never applied for something like that before, can someone give me a quick list of good software houses or aerospace companies in Brisbane? At a recent conference someone urged me to leave Brisbane to find a job (esp in Aerospace), but I think that's a tad defeatist.

I can program in Python, C, C++, Java (though a refresher is necessary - I'm not a fan) and AVR C (though that isn't necessarily a language unto itself). I'm also learning Brisbane-designed Qt through PyQt for a uni project.

I guess what I'm really looking for is a vacation internship this Christmas holidays, so if anyone has any tips, please let me know."
dave6,11,2010-09-07,"Reddit, I'm becoming cynical, misanthropic, and alienated. I feel like I'm drifting away from everything and everyone else, and I don't know what to do.",Blankoogron,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/dave6/reddit_im_becoming_cynical_misanthropic_and/,"I recently graduated university, and have, since that date, found work as a cook, on the opposite side of the country. While I have no expectation of finding a job I love right out of university, the job I work is a unique kind of hell from which there seems to be no escape. My coworkers do drugs and drink every fucking night, more or less. This is something I (no longer) do with any sort of frequency. I feel completely disconnected from these people, and from people in general. I'm no longer personable, I don't feel like I can laugh or joke with other people, and I'm increasingly nervous in social situations. All of these things never used to apply to me.

On the upside of things I've been working out religiously, and am in the best shape of my life. This doesn't change the fact that I see no way out of the hell that my life increasingly is becoming. I have no idea how to find work that doesn't involve the 12 hour clusterfuck that comprises a job working with food, and while I'm applying for teaching positions overseas, it does nothing to help the fact that it's near impossible to have something even approaching a social life when you work 30 hours every weekend, and upwards of 55 hours a week. 

I'm finding it increasingly difficult to see the bright side of things in life, and spend most of my time looking at others with scorn and derision. I don't know when I became such a spiteful, hateful person, but other people see it in me and they want nothing to do with me. I don't know if it's a result of the pressures I face at work, or something else entirely, but I feel like something has to change, because I'm becoming increasingly anhedonic and angry.

I spend most of my spare time playing video games, or working out, and the few times I have gone out drinking with people from work I've woken up with powerful feelings of guilt and shame, as I feel that I should be finding better ways to spend my money, and time on. 

I've quit my current job, as months of working 55 hour work weeks, even at a shitty rate of pay, has allowed me to accumulate a fair amount of money. I've applied for an internship in south-east asia, and am going to start applying for teaching positions in Korea, (which would make good use of my degree in english), but months of rejections from every job I've applied to have left me disheartened at my ability to anything even remotely meaningful with my life. While intellectually I see that there has to be a light at the end of the tunnel, I feel as if I am getting dumber, angrier, and more and more hopeless that life will ever again be something I experience any joy in.

I feel lost, so hopelessly lost, and don't know how to do anything worthwhile with my life. I hate myself for my failures, others for their successes, and have, bit by bit, driven away everyone who has ever cared me, save for my parents, with my cynicism and my anger. I have no idea what to do. I feel like I've been twisted into some horrible mirror image of what I used to be, and there doesn't seem to be any escape, and it's fucked, reddit. It's fucked.

I don't know what I'm expecting, exactly, but I just needed to get this out in the open. I spend more time alone than is healthy, and just want to know, reddit, what do I do? Maybe you have similar stories, where you've overcome these sorts of feelings? I don't know.

This is a throwaway account, too.

I remember how it felt to go to sleep as a child, feeling warm, with everything around you seeming in perfect order, and you fell into sleep with a perfect trajectory, bypassing the nightmares and dreams and waking up in the morning right where it should be, and everything as it should be, and now there's only the mess of my sheets and the emptiness of my white room to greet me, and Jesus I just don't know.

TL;DR I bitch about my life. I'm angry.

In my last year of high school I got really passionate for my subject, but by the time I realized my goals, it was too late. My SATs were shit, I hadn't bothered to work towards making an impressive application and I had only applied to two schools. I got accepted into a state school, but instead of going there, I decided to take the community college route in California (for the opportunity to transfer into UCs).

At this point, I'm almost sure that I'm going to transfer into UCSD, and it just so happens that UCSD has a really strong computer science program (thank god). I also stand a good chance at getting into Berkeley, but I'm pretty sure my parents are in a shitty financial situation. Even if I got accepted, I don't know if I should go. 

My problem is this: I feel like I've dug myself a hole by taking this route (through community college). Lately I've been hearing that I need experience working/ interning/ researching and recommendations from professors to have any sort of chance to stand out in admissions for graduate programs. I haven't had the opportunity to do such things and when I transfer, I'll have even less time to attempt it. I can't take upper division classes and therefore I wouldn't be eligible for internships/ research positions. I don't know of any clubs or any serious local organizations to be involved in and I haven't the slightest clue where to look for internships (basically ANY sort of positions for learning and getting experience).

What the hell do I do?"

We have been exclusive since April or so and have definitely grown closer. I fell in love with her and she fell in love with me. 

There were tough times as well. We broke up for 5 days a few weeks ago over arguments we were having over petty things (IMO) but she convinced me that breaking up was irrational and that we could work through this hurtle so we got back together and it's been, honest to say, like those days when we first got together; quite amazing actually. 

At the same time, I knew she had an internship in a city a couple hours away. She knew it, I knew it that it was beginning to be the make or break of our relationship if we made it that far. She moved away on Sunday for the next 8 months and it's been shitty to say the least. I've done LDR's before (she hasn't) and I know how they work or actually, how they don't work. Despite all that, I love so many things about her and I feel special because I helped her through her recent diagnosis of Celiac. She has expressed to me how I mean so much to her and the thought of ending things pains me to think about...

I don't want to be single which is quite the opposite of how I would have felt a year ago. I thoroughly enjoy the companionship but now that she is gone and I can only expect to see her, at most, once a week (which is still unlikely) I feel like I am worse off than being single. I don't have a g/f i can see whenever I want to hug and hold her and there is absolutely no prospect of me doing that with someone else who lives where I am as long as my g/f and I are still together. 

Here's the worst part. I am having thoughts of throwing away what we have together because I have met a possible replacement. It was the day after my g/f left that this girl walked into my life. I actually think of it as a stupid thing to say because I hardly know this girl. I just met her on Monday night. It sounds even more fucked up as I reread what I just typed. Any yet, here I am. Still having these same thoughts. This isn't even the first time I've had girls throw themselves at me. WTF is it with girls being able to sniff out the non-single guys? This wouldn't happen if I didn't have a g/f! So far I've been able to brush off temptations like these before with little effort but this one...not so easy. 

Damn....what the hell should I do?

dbtht,25,2010-09-09,"[M/F] I was 18, and there was an intern at the Asperger commune I'm a member of ... (true story)",aspiering,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/dbtht/mf_i_was_18_and_there_was_an_intern_at_the/,"*First, let me emphasise that this story is completely true. I *have* Asperger's syndrome, and while I don't have many of the negative traits often associated with the disorder, I keep in touch with this commune, mostly to have a social network in case shit one day goes bad, and to harvest the (mostly economic) benefits.

Additionally, this is a longer story, so if you're looking for a nice buildup, this is for you. If not, you may as well go on your merry way and find a shorter piece. Or a porn flick.*

------------

I was told an intern had started her six-month internship. She wanted to be a caretaker, and naturally, an asperger commune seems like a logical place to be in that situation.

Let's just say her name was Anna. She was about 28, and absolutely gorgeous. Freckly skin, long dark hair, and deep, brown eyes. Not usually my type, but eh.

Naturally, I thought, this wouldn't ever work out. She was an *intern* at the place I went for ""help"", and she was 10 years older than me (by only a few days, I would later learn).

She took a couple of my appointments from the usual crew (some of the others in the commune need a *lot* of planning and organising), but I would never really take up the full time of the appointments. So, instead we'd talk about clubbing, drinking, smoking. I'm a smoker, and I casually offered her a cigarette, even though I had no idea if she did, or ever had, smoked. She took it, and with a wink asked me not to tell anyone. As it turns out, she had quit smoking a couple of months prior, and none of her current co-workers knew she had smoked.

We laughed, we talked, and time flew past quickly. My appointment was well overdrawn, and she quickly thanked me for the cigarette, hugged me, and ran out to her next appointment.

I promptly logged onto my PC and added her as a friend on Facebook.

------------

That same night, I noticed her online. I felt somewhat awkward, but I figured I'd message her and challenge her to have a drink with me at some point, knowing fully-well she'd be out of her mind if she accepted. She laughed, and then a one-line reply:

""sure ;)""

I was excited. In the conversation that followed, we agreed (half-heartedly on my behalf, though) not to do so until she'd finished her internship, making it at least somewhat more acceptable. It was about a month later, and I figured I could wait.

------------

Approximately one week later, I was bored out of my mind. School was out. All my friends were on holiday, and I was just craving going out drinking with some friends and have fun (this wasn't in the US, so drinking laws are much more lax here). I get on Facebook and immediately notice her online. *click*. ""An"". *click*. ""Hey, you want to go grab a drink or something? I'm bored out of my mind.""

Her reply was something along the lines of ""I really shouldn't,"" or ""Nah, not tonight"". I wasn't really paying attention. I was determined, and after a bit of heckling, I managed to convince her to go to a nearby gas station with me to pick up some wine. I met her in front of her dorm; she smiled nervously, and we went on my merry way. I broke the silence by taking out my whiskey-filled 20 oz hip flask, taking a swig and offering her a swig. The gas station was about half a mile away, and we picked up cigarettes and alcohol. On the way back, I noticed how buzzed I already was, checking my hip flask. Half-way back, it was already empty. 20 oz of whiskey in about 15 minutes, shared between two people. This was going to be a good night, I felt.

------------

After we got back, we hit the wine. It hit hard, and heavy. We were both pretty drunk after a short while, and ended up on drinking games. At some point during the night, we ended up talking about relationships. I was still in one at this point, but I knew it wasn't going to work out, and I stressed it heavily. She had come out of a pretty long relationship about six months prior, and was slowly picking up dating again.

Drinking games turned into more kinky ones, and we finally ended up playing strip poker. We started talking about sex, and I revealed to her that in all my years, I had not found anyone able to give me a good blowjob. She looked me straight in the eyes and said ""go sit on my bed.""

What happened next almost escapes me entirely. She comes over to the bed, sits on her knees, removes my pants and just starts sucking. We're talking vaccuum here, and I just lay back and enjoy the whole sensation; this truly was unlike anything I'd felt before that.

Blowjobs turned into pretty wild sex. For hours we just lay there, making out, trying out every position in the book.

For the past 6 months I've been working as an intern at a job where I sit across from a guy who spouts the word of Glenn Beck and Rand Paul as gospel. (According to him, Rand Paul's father, Ron Paul, is ""a little wacky"" though I always thought it was the other way around, even though I think)

* He claims to be a libertarian.
* He believes that we don't really need to pay taxes.
* He believes that we don't spend enough on the military.
* He believes that we should privatize fire fighters and the police.
* He believes that we don't need the FDA and the EPA.
* He believes that the ""free market"" doesn't need any regulation.
* He loves Ayn Rand and yet claims to have read Upton Sinclair's ""The Jungle""
* He believes that regulating industries so they can't dump toxic material, like formaldehyde, wherever they like, will drastically harm American industry
* He believes that all of illegal immigration can be solved by building a wall and placing soldiers on it with the order to kill on sight.
* He believes that the ""mosque"" a few blocks from Ground Zero shouldn't be built because ""they killed 3,000 American citizens"".
* He believes that whoever is caught on tape saying something ignorant or racist at a Tea Party rally is a ""Democratic plant""
* He believes that video evidence of racism at a Tea Party rally is ""obviously doctored""
* He claims that if I can find any ""authentic"" evidence of Tea Party racism/ignorance, Breitbart will pay me $10,000. (Not true)
* He believes that FOX News is the only source of news that tells the truth.
* He believes that all of the companies boycotting advertisements while Glenn Beck's on the air are ""afraid of what he has to say""
* When I told him that libertarianism would only work in a perfect world and that our own citizens shouldn't die on the streets because they can't afford over-priced medical care for preventable diseases, he gave me the nickname ""Mao Zedong"" (to be fair I did compare his corporatist views to fascism and his proposed actions to those of Hitler (oh, and I found out later he's Jewish oops))
* He believes that Israel deserves our unwavering support and that any news questioning their treatment of the Palestinians is merely terrorist propaganda
* Oh did I mention that he doesn't really consider the Palestinians as being people and that they have no right to be there?
* He believes that that Obama administration (which he's nicknamed ""Big Brother"") is trying to monitor all of us and is tracking us (though he thinks the Patriot Act is a-ok)
* He believes that it's not ok to monitor American citizens unless they fly to the Middle East and they look Arabic. (""Damn right it is!"" - his response when I told him that he's supporting racial profiling)
* He thinks that we should just nuke all of Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran, and maybe Pakistan


Now you probably wonder why I'm ranting about this guy. While I've been on reddit politics, I've noticed that many redditors have at least a few of the views listed above. (many =/= most) Now I must ask, why? 

Best case scenario: you're a Ron Paul libertarian - naive, idealistic, and stupid

Worst case scenario: you're a Glenn Beck libertarian - naive, angry, ignorant, racist, misinformed, and stupid

Can someone please *please* help me figure out the allure to becoming a stupid fuck?"

Here we go again*

Hey there Reddit ECE. Thanks for checking in. I could really use some insight, especially from those already out in the field (both industry and research).

Let's start with a little background. I'm in my senior year of Computer Engineering. At my school, CE is defined as a mix of EE and CS. It's mostly (say 80%) EE, but with the classes not related to computer technology (EM Theory, some advanced physics, etc) weeded out and replaced with a strong foundation in computer science.

I got into ECE because, like many of you out there, I've always been a computer guy. I was fascinated with them as a kid, and started doing website design, webhosting (read: pissing off Comcast), networking the computers in my house, etc around 12. I was the type of kid who had a lot of online friends from all over the world. And, while some might argue that I should have outside, I think this phase of my life was really good for me. I was exposed to people and ideas from all over, and I think that helped penetrate the bubble of apathy about the world outside myself that many of us (especially Americans, though that's a whole different debate) have.

So when I saw the dropdown box on my college application, I clicked ""computer engineering."" I figured I'd like to get into making computers even better. I had this vague idea in the back of my head for a while as I worked a few summer internships, etc

Lately my interests have solidified a little bit. I think the computer revolution has, overall, been a pretty awesome thing. Communication, education, buiness, every facet of our lives - revolutionized. But that's only the developed world. Whole regions of the earth have yet to experience the potential for growth and development that computers can bring. I want to get involved in fixing this, developing the next generation of low-cost, low-power computers that can extend the range of the computing revolution. Projects like OLPC and Intel's classmate PC fascinate me. But my attempts to contact them and figure out what kind of research is going into furthering these devices has been met (not surprisingly) with little to no response.

So the problem is: how to go about doing this? Should I be looking into grad programs in computer architecture and microprocessor development, and work on the next generation of devices like Intel's Atom processor (the micro-CPU powering most netbooks). Or perhaps System-on-a-chip and embedded computing is the future? Or maybe something else entirely.

Let me know what you think, reddit. I'm counting on you.

**TL,DR: I like computers and think everyone (not just the relatively wealthy in the developed world) should have one. What kind of research should I do?**"
debvr,1,2010-09-15,Is it best to notify your employer when you are looking for a new job?,runescaper,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/debvr/is_it_best_to_notify_your_employer_when_you_are/,"Warning: a bit of a rant is below, but it's needed for context.

The place I'm currently working at doesn't seem to particularly like me.  When I first started, I fixed something in a legacy system that seemed like a bug, because the testing procedures they gave me would just not work with this one flag turned on.  Of course, it turned out this flag was very necessary, and that the testing procedures they gave me did not match what happens in production at all.  So, they go through a big talk about not doing anything unless I'm instructed.

Several months ago, about two years after I started, I didn't do something that I thought would be good, because they didn't tell me to do it.  Then, they didn't like I wasn't ""communicating"" well, and have labeled me in many ways that simply aren't true.  One issue was from a different manager changing his mind several times in the course of a conversation, and I couldn't remember which option he finally decided on, so crap hit the fan when he said that he said one thing, and I said I remembered him saying something else.  The hypocrisy of the higher ups does not occur to them -- they recognize that anything they do without the approval of the big cheese could be wrong just because they didn't get approval first, but at the same time blame the peons for making any sort of decision without getting approval from them first.  This isn't just me, it's happened to several other people here.

If I were to tell my supervisor that I was looking for a new job, they may just fire me as soon as I'm done on my current project, even though I have a lot of knowledge of a legacy system that other people only know half as well.  On the other hand, I know that as I'm going to have a second interview with a new company soon, that they will be contacting my current employer to see what they think of me.  Additionally, I have to schedule flex time at my current employer to be able to leave early now and then for interviews, and they really want a reason; it sounds like, if you don't give a reason enough times, they pull you in to a meeting to talk about it.  I really don't want to lie, but at the same time don't want to lose my job before I have something else lined up.

TL:DR: Should I tell my employer I'm looking elsewhere or not?  This is my first ""real job"" out of college; before this I had internships or fast food jobs, so the management expected me to be looking elsewhere for work."
del29,7,2010-09-16,i can't do this anymore,jmontheedge,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/del29/i_cant_do_this_anymore/,"I'm 22 years old. I feel like I'm having a mid-life crisis.

I'm a father, I'm married, I'm overworked, I'm depressed, I'm lonely, and I just don't know how much longer I can take this.

I got married in June 2009 because I got my girlfriend pregnant. Our daughter is now 13 months old. She wanted a baby, and at the time had an uncanny ability to guilt me… I couldn't say no. So, we ""tried"" for 6 months until she finally got pregnant. Normally, I'm a very analytical person… but when we made that ""decision,"" there was no real discussion or actual planning. I just went along with it. I figured it would just be okay: I was helplessly in love with her; I was nearly done with college and had a well-paying Software Engineering internship.  I was already going to school full time while working full time. When she got pregnant, I purchased a 3-family home so we could live rent-free (until recently, the rent from the 2nd and 3rd floors covered our mortgage), using a small loan from my sister for the deposit. I graduated in March of this year and have been working as a Software Engineer ever since. My wife is a stay-at-home mother.

Our daughter was born in August 2009.  There were some complications with the labor and she had to be born quickly… luckily, she was fine, but my wife had to be cut on her vagina in order to get our daughter out in time. It took a while for that cut to heal. It got infected, but she is finally starting to feel better. She keeps going back to the Ob-gyn who has been giving her new medications. The infection is gone, but there is still some spotting… so we still cannot have sex. ""Just 2 more weeks"" Is a phrase I've heard all summer. I am so horny, so often, it hurts. 

Since early July, we have been going to see a marriage counselor: we have a lot of communication problems in addition to our intimacy problems. I understand why she doesn't want to have sex, but we could still be intimate in other ways - at the very least don't let me feel so desperate for attention! When I'm horny, she wants nothing to do with it; I'm on my own.

I love my Software Engineering job, but the commute is ridiculous 3 hours a day (luckily 2.5 hours of the daily commute is on a commuter rail; I mostly spend that time browsing reddit to avoid my thoughts of depression/suicide). I leave my house at 7:20AM and get home by 7:00PM. I'm away from home nearly 12 hours. Then I take care of the baby for an hour and a half before she goes to sleep, since my wife had to take care of her all day….

I feel so over-worked and under-appreciated. I have no fun at all. I work, take care of the baby, often fight with my wife and usually go to bed alone since she stays up late, but I can't fall asleep when she's not there.
Tonight was the 3 year anniversary of when we first started dating. My wife's friend watched our daughter for us. When we got home, another one of their friends came over and the 3 of them went out to a bar. I laid in bed, alone, for hours. We had a fight last Friday because I wanted to go out to the bar more often with her, but she said she ""out grew"" it. Tonight I realized that this was the 4th time she has been out to the bar with friends in the past 5 weeks. I asked her about it when she got home, and she said she felt it would be ""irresponsible"" of us to have a baby-sitter watch our daughter for a night just so we could go out to a bar.
So this is my life. I'm over-worked, very tired, very lonely and very depressed. I want more fun in my life. I have only 1 friend, but he and I rarely hang out since I'm often too busy/tired. I fear my wife and I may get a divorce, but I really don't want that to happen. I don't know how much longer I can keep living this life.


**TL;DR:** I just don't know how much longer I can take this, Reddit. I want to just give up and end it.

Any insight on my gf's WTF story from last week?,frustratedboyfriend,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dfpgv/anyone_work_in_hr_or_hiring_any_insight_on_my_gfs/,"I know certain business environments are friendlier than others, but what my girlfriend experienced in her first week at work, which would then be her last, is one of the rudest things I've ever heard of. I'll try to keep it brief:

She interviewed last Friday for a social media specialist position at a small company (45 ppl). This would be her first real job, tho she's had a few paid internships and keeps a blog with a dedicated audience, so she knows her shit. At the interview, she laid out all the variables of her situation: she lives in another state, has a dog, and plans to start looking for an apartment pending a job.

Wednesday of the next week, she got an letter and a plane ticket for Sunday so she could come up and train for a week. She made it seem like they were going to work with her to make the transition smooth. She'd stay with me in the meantime.

Monday was great. Lots of meetings, paperwork, introductions. She brought up figuring the whole next few weeks out. They were definitely going to plan a meeting soon.

Tuesday she went out to lunch w/ her supervisor. He was very reassuring that they want to make her happy so she could do a best work, and a hotel or other accommodations weren't out of the question. They talked family and the upcoming Jewish holidays and kicked things off well.

Wednesday she found an apartment at lunch. Threw down the deposit. Move in around Oct. 1. Gravy.

Wednesday right before EOD her supervisor, CEO, and her talked about the next few weeks, at which point they pulled a 180 on her and said that any sort of remote work was out of the question and they expected her to be there Monday. They went back on just about everything they promised, citing the contract she signed. She left work visibly upset. I interpreted as some sort of cruel test, but we'd make it work. She could stay w/ me longer til move-in.

Thursday was fine. Back to work as usual. Still meetings and the beginning stages of assignments, but no deliverables.

Friday morning, first thing, they let her go, saying that its not going to be a good fit. One week, zero chances of proving oneself and ""Sorry, you're fired."" What the hell?

They're paying her through the end of the month regardless, and she was able to get the housing deposit back, but now its back to square one. All I can think of is that they're an agency, and they tend to grow and shrink with accounts. Maybe some really bad news happened Wednesday morning? Maybe they were trying to get her to quit on Wednesday by being mean?

At least that was my original thought. The job is back up on craigslist.

I've personally left a job after a month because of the environment, but they were apparently nowhere near firing me. I'd say you'd need at least a few weeks of screwing up to be let go that quickly.

So reddit, if you work with HR or run a business and have any insight as to why a company would hire somebody only to fire them in less than a week's time for no apparent reason, I'd appreciate your thoughts!

**TL;DR** Girlfriend got hired, wanted to clarify working arrangements, got fired within a week having had no opportunity to actually *work*. What gives?"

Here’s a little background: I met my ex during senior year of high school and we decided to stay together even though I was leaving for college at the end of summer. We went through the typical ups and downs of a college LDR and seemed to make it through just fine.



We broke up at the beginning of the summer because she was graduating (from college) and had decided to travel for about 6 weeks. I understand I’ll probably get a decent amount of criticism for this next part. I told her that I found it unfair that I would come home every chance I could to spend time with her and during the only 3 months of the year that we could be together, she decides to take that time to travel and get her life in order. So I told her to choose between traveling or being with me. She obviously picked the former.



At that point, I took 2/3’s of RA’s advice: I cut contact and hit the gym (didn’t bother deleting from Facebook because neither of us really use it at all). She tried to contact me once during the summer about how much she missed me but I had self-control and was able to answer her back in somewhat of a cold fashion.



Fast forward to the end of summer, we start talking again (mainly a few short texts to see how each of us are doing). We decide to see each other and end up hooking up (as we both honestly expected). We had previously agreed to do this with no strings attached so it was somewhat alright.



Once again, at the end of summer I left for college (actually an internship near my school but I’m still a student). She has mentioned that she still has strong feelings for me and wants to get back together. I’ve told her that I don’t want that and that I think we should talk less.



Here’s the main issue: I find myself texting her and talking to her even though I know I shouldn’t. It’s not that I can’t help doing it, I honestly just have nothing to do and no one else to really talk to. My school has a very low population of girls and since I am working full-time, I have virtually zero opportunity to talk and connect with any of them. The ones I already know that I am interested in either already graduated/moved or are in relationships. There’s no one at my job I am interested in (especially since most of my workers are older and/or male).



I am seeking advice on whether I should totally cut contact with my ex and how I should do it, as well as how I can go out and meet girls my age (for dating). I know the bar/club scene exists but if anyone else has any ideas, I would appreciate them. Thanks in advance for your help and sorry for the long post.



TL;DR: ex wants to get back together after a post break-up hookup (with me). I went back to school for an internship and am trying to cut contact. I’m finding it hard to stop talking to her because I am not taking classes this semester and have no way of meeting girls my age. So I end up talking to her because I have no one else to talk to and nothing else to interest me. 



EDIT: I know I need to cut contact but I'm having a hard time doing it because there aren't many other girls that I talk to that aren't just friends. Also, I don't want to get back together with this girl. I think the right thing to do is to stay broken up, I'm just having a hard time cutting off communication and finding new people. That's why I'm asking for advice on HOW to cut contact and/or meet people."

This is going to sound like self loathing but I am sorry, I need to get this off my chest and I don't have many people to talk to. 

I was fairly successful in academics on high school which secured me a scholarship to a well known engineering school. I graduated and was offered a well funded position in graduate school studying fluid mechanics. I met my wife during the end of my undergraduate education and I have never been so close to someone in my life. I've never met someone who understood me so deeply and cared so much. 

After completing a masters, I secured a good job as an engineer with a large environmental consulting firm in Texas. I married my fiancee just before moving in a very large ceremony which she desired. My wife went to graduate school, I worked, we made a good living and everything was great. Unfortunately, in 2008 I was laid off and there weren't many prospects in Texas (and we did not particularly care for Texas, sorry Texas people). The fortunate thing is that I was laid off 3 weeks before my wife defended her masters and we did not own a house. We had mobility and we decided to get out.

I wanted to pursue a PhD and my wife wanted to work and we figured we would reverse our texas arrangement of me working and her going to school. I actively searched for PhD programs near her hometown on the west coast and my wife did the same with her job search.

She was abler to acquire a fantastic job in her field making great money and I was able to be accepted to a great engineering university in the same town. Last year we bought a house and a new car and were very much financially rooted in the area. everything was great until march of 2010.

Last March my wife tells me very casually she wanted to chat on the couch. I sit down, she tells me she is miserable, has been miserable for years, is leaving and there is nothing I can do to improve the situation or to get her back. This was the worst day of my life. 
Walked out of the house, left me with a mortgage, cats, and our whole life. I was shellshocked. There was no indication she was ever unhappy, no mention of seeing a counselor, no mention of anything to help the situation, just silence and many I don't care at all anymore. 

I went back to school instead of seeking a job with the plan that my wife and I are a team and she would support me while I was pursuing a PhD. 

I feel like I have lost my mind and failed as a person now. I don't have much family and friends live very far away. I feel trapped and I don't sleep at all at night. When I do sleep, I have nightmares like a kid. It's always some monster trying to eat me or something terrible. 

I have always been emotionally very stable and I can't even go through the day without an incredible rollercoaster of emotions. Let's say I'm on reddit, I see a kitten and get ultra warm fuzzies and see a post about an Iraq qar vet and I cry. I'm losing my mind in some fucked happy/miserable dichotomy world. I'm always one or the other. 


I'm scared to go about normal tasks for fear of failure and my education, though not suffering, isn;t really progressing the past few months. I have an internship in my field and a second job at a coffeeshop to pay the bills, school, etc. I work about 65 hours a week not including schoolwork I must complete at home and I can't do this anymore. I barely pay the bills and I'm almost going hungry as I don't have much left over for groceries and there are only so many campus events you can go to with free food before someone starts to notice. I've never struggled just to put food on my table and I can't believe that is the situation I'm in. I feel alien at school and work because how do I tell fellow students/friends/coworkers making money and living well that I didn't go get a beer with them or hang out not only because I couldn't afford it, I fucking barely ate at all that night.

I don't want to live this life but I can't commit suicide. I lost a friend to suicide and it is selfish and never a good answer. Honestly, before I fall asleep, my wish is to just not wake up.

I'm exhausted. I feel like a shell of a man. I feel worthless. I need someone or something at the end of the day to just share with and the silence at home fucking kills me. I live in 1700 square feet of a life that no longer has any chance at survival.  Call me crazy but sometimes at night I talk to my cat about my day. 

I'm beyond my breaking point and I don't know what to do.

Please, if you have been through anything like this, I need advice. What do I do?What did you do? I need help, support, guidance, etc. I don't want to feel like I don't want to live anymore. I don't know how to be proactive anymore.  






tl;dr   Wife left, cannot pay bills, going hungry, too much between school and work for any free time. I feel like a ghost and I need help because I don't think I can do this much longer."

It feels like everything I used to do for fun is just a little bit too hard to get back into--I cracked a rim on my bike last week, my car's been acting up so I can't get outside on the weekends to climb and hike, my knees hurt and pop and click all the time (never used to do that, went to the doc twice, they said ""live with it""), I discovered the hard way that I'm apparently now allergic to alcohol (beer, liquor, wine--same result, swollen throat and hives all over my body), broke up with my girlfriend a couple weeks ago (she was headed to grad school), etc.

I know I do a lot better with exercise but I haven't found a good replacement activity, and work has been extremely stressful because they want us to get even more done now that funding will run out in two weeks.

I feel like I'm stuck, and my brain keeps saying ""YOU'RE HEADED FOR TROUBLE, DO SOMETHING, YOU'RE HEADED FOR TROUBLE, DO SOMETHING"" but my heart isn't in it anymore.

I'm not suicidal or anything but I've definitely never felt this hopeless before.

EDIT: I guess my biggest worry was, whenever I used to get stressed out like this, I'd just tell myself ""OK, go to the gym for a night, forget about everything, tackle it in the morning"" or ""OK, go out with your friends etc"" and the next day, I'd feel refreshed and ready to get shit done. Now anything I do just makes me think about how shitty things still are, I can't seem to 'reset' my mood anymore

I'm a competent Computer Science major in school in the United States, and some day want to permanently reside in Canada. However, since I can't move quite yet, I want to take advantage of my summer by getting a paid job or internship in the greater Toronto area. I have a decent resume (for a young student), but I really feel like no potential employer would want to go through all the trouble and deal with all the paperwork of hiring a US citizen, especially considering that I'd only be available for a few months during the summer. 

I have posted an ad on Craigslist, but got no responses. I've been looking over Canadian immigration laws and such but haven't really figured out what exactly I should be doing; as soon as I *do* know what I'm doing, I'll start replying to job ads and posting my resume in more places.

So, /r/IWantOut, do you think I stand a chance of landing a job? Does anyone have any tips as to where to look for a job?

dhfw8,6,2010-09-22,What can I do about being unemployable?,justgetmeonhere,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/dhfw8/what_can_i_do_about_being_unemployable/,"tldr; I'm just a code monkey and I don't have enough experience for companies to take me seriously, but since I'm already graduated I don't think I qualify for internships. I need some advice and/or perspective.

I'm sure that Reddit is getting dozens of posts like this a day, but I'm really starting to feel like that I'm just not cut out to be hired by anyone. I feel that the little work experience I do have is not nearly enough for most companies to even care. Can anybody tell me if I'm overreacting, things I can do, etc?

I recently left my previous job (see below) and I've only been unemployed for about 3 months now, which is hardly any time compared to the majority of people. Still, in this entire time I've only ever gotten 1 interview, and I just found out the very next day after that interview that they're not interested. And even before this previous job I had a ton of difficulty with getting recruiters to acknowledge that I even applied.

I'm just not convinced that my experience is up to snuff. I can program in java pretty well (**I** think I can, anyway), although I don't have any experience with frameworks such as Hibernate and Spring, and it seems that most java developer positions require 2+ years experience with those kinds of things. I have less than a couple of months of experience with web technologies (I know what html, css, etc are, I just haven't worked with them), and that's another major thing that shoots me in the foot because 9 out of 10 jobs are web development positions. I have some experience with relational databases (mySQL, more specifically), but not enough to be able to do query optimizations or do truly complex schema design. I've worked in C++ and C# and feel pretty comfortable using them, but that experience only adds up to a few months, and once again I have no practical knowledge of any frameworks or third party software that typically gets paired with them.

I have various books on all of these subjects and I've been doing some learning on my own, but I just don't think companies will give a shit about self-taught candidates, especially ones who haven't done professional work for other companies or organizations. I'm sure somebody wants to chime in ""do an internship,"" but I've graduated over a year ago. Don't companies only want students for interns?

I'm just worried that I've ruined all of my chances for getting employed. I don't have nearly enough experience for most companies to consider me, but I'm overqualified just enough to not be able to do internships. Even the few ""entry-level"" positions that I do find require 2-3 years more experience than I currently have. What should I do, Reddit?

Some background on me: I graduated a year ago, I've got my BS in computer science. While in school I worked an internship at IBM, which I enjoyed, but when the recession began and IBM laid off a bunch of people I was among them. For half a year after graduation I had no success in finding work.

Then finally, at the beginning of this year, I did manage to get hired at a start-up company. The compensation was very crappy (think roughly 25K a year and no benefits to speak of), but I didn't care about the money, I was after some experience. I was also too elated at the prospect of being employed to care too much about anything else. Well I tried my best for roughly 6 months to make it work, but things didn't pan out too well. I'm not going to bore anyone with specifics unless asked, but basically I started to find the work environment and the company itself somewhat toxic and lost all motivation to stay, and so I left. I think leaving was the right decision, but I seriously regret leaving them at this current time. It was particularly unwise to quit without producing a two-weeks notice (in my defense, I was told up front that they didn't require them; if you didn't want to be there, get the hell out). I'm also pretty certain that the bridges I had built over there are fairly charred, so forget about a good reference."
dhrl1,169,2010-09-23,"There seem to be ALOT of misconceptions about CPR and the new Compression Only CPR, lets get some things straight.",SDAdam,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/dhrl1/there_seem_to_be_alot_of_misconceptions_about_cpr/,"This post is in response to the recent [front page post addressing compression-only CPR](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/dhecy/out_with_the_old_and_in_with_the_new_8_more/).

There are A LOT of misconceptions about CPR going around and I think it's important that we address them as it could make a big difference in someones life.

First off to qualify myself; I am a paramedic (NREMTP, and state licensed in my state), a paramedic instructor, a CPR instructor (AHA-BLSHCP), an Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support(ACLS) instructor, and a bunch of other things with acronyms of varying difficulty to remember.

So, CPR.

lets start with a note on the ethical and legal aspects.

**Ethics of CPR** - This one is easy, you don't have to do anything at all. Now, you should probably at LEAST call 911 (or whatever the emergency number in your area is) if you want people to think you are a decent human being, but you don't even HAVE to do that. So the first thing to do is think about things now, before you find yourself in an emergency and decide just what you want to do if you end up in one.

I have seen irate and irrational family members attack rescuers, I have seen people injured by entering emergency scenes with unforeseen dangers and I have known people who caught diseases from sick patients while trying to help them, these are all reasons why ethically you don't have to do anything (again maybe call 911 just for the heck of it though).

you have a family, friends, life, people who count on you, and in no way do you need to be exposed to the above dangers unless you are absolutely SURE you want to be. So decide now.

**Legal aspects of CPR** - The only answer I can give here is that the liability involved in providing CPR varies. It varies from country to country, state to state, and in some cases county to county. It is possible you could get sued, although unlikely to be successfully sued, it doesn't mean someone can't try. 

A good rule of thumb is this; if you would feel uncomfortable explaining what / why you were doing something in court you probably shouldn't be doing it (i.e.""well you see Mr. Judge, I once saw an episode of CHIPS and they brought the guy back to life by punching him in the chest, but I'm not very strong so I decided to jump on his chest"" - this example would seem a poor choice when held to the comfortable explaining yourself standard.)

A better rule of thumb is (and the one you would most likely be held to in court) what would another reasonable person in a similar situation who has the same amount or lack of training as I have do? (i.e. ""Ummm, you're telling me everybody in this courtroom wouldn't have used a swiss army knife to preform an emergent thoracotomy in order provide direct cardiac massage for that guys asthma attack?! pfffttt... whatever"" - this example would seem a poor choice when held to the reasonable person standard.)

**On To The Medicine**

I'm now going to address what seem to be the biggest misconceptions about CPR and Compression Only CPR;

**1. Compression only CPR is better than classic CPR.**
Compression Only CPR was never meant to replace CPR. It was meant to remove decision making from lay peoples hands.

You see medical decision making is difficult, and emergency medical decision making is even more difficult, and it's all compounded by the fact that nearly everything in medicine is a grey area. Let's look at an example;

When a person suffers sudden cardiac arrest (their heart stops beating) often for the first several minutes, and possibly for quite some time they may have something called agonal respirations, they are dead (clinically) but randomly every once and a while they take a gasping breath. Once you have seen this it is obvious. However to a lay person this could be considered breathing, so now the lay person has to make a decision; is the patient breathing or not? I mean they just gasped, but now they aren't, should I breath for them? Should I start CPR, shit, I don't know.

See how, to an untrained person there is a lot of grey area and decisions to make?

Well, research showed that when presented with grey area and decisions, bystanders decided that for fear of making the wrong decision they would make none at all and do nothing.

Thus Compression Only CPR was born, the idea being if we remove the grey area and decision making more people will do the one MOST important thing; chest compressions.

Another place Compression Only CPR is useful is if you don't want to do anything else. Let's take me for instance, I have a ton of medical experience and training, years and years. If I were walking down the street tomorrow and someone collapsed in front of me who needed CPR I would do Compression Only CPR. Why? Because I don't carry anything to protect myself if I were to try to breath for them. So I would do compressions until other paramedics arrived and that's it.

**2. Doing Compressions On Someone With A Pulse Is Bad.**
Now let's take you for example. Let's say that you are at the grocery store and you see someone collapse, so after watching that other threads video you run over and start pounding away on their chest. Then I come along, with my lights and sirens and bags of medical junk and I notice that the person you are doing CPR on is actually alive and asking you to stop.

Will I:

a) Yell at you for your ignorance and endangering of another person and mock you infront of all within earshot?

b)Thank you for your effort, quick thinking, and willingness to act calling you a hero in front of any cute girls/guys who happen to be within earshot.

c) Make fun of you when I get back to station.

The correct answer is b and c. (Hey if I tried to do whatever the hell it is you do for a living you would be the one laughing at me.)

There are really two points to make here.

First there are VERY few medical emergencies wich render a person so dead-like that they would actually be mistaken for being dead. Things which will NOT do this but have been mentioned in the thread I linked to at the top are: Fainting, low or high blood sugar, seizures, or strokes.

Second it is ALWAYS better to do CPR on someone who doesn't need it, than to fail to do CPR on someone who does. Lets look at a quick cost benefit model to illustrait my point:

&gt;You do CPR inappropriately:
*cost* - Sore chest, possibly minor rib fractures (actually relatively unlikely), embarrassment.
*benefit* - none.

&gt;You do CPR appropriately:
*cost* - none (possibly sore arms and back the next day for you).
*benefit* - you GREATLY increase a persons chance of surviving sudden cardiac arrest and returning to their loved ones.

The choice seems clear.

**3. What do you mean I don't check for a pules?!**
Let's get something straight, checking for a pulse is great. I always check for a pulse.

YOU have no idea how to check for a pulse in an emergency. I know you think you do, and the boy scouts taught you to 20 years ago, but you don't.

Here is what DOES happen. Bystanders (that's y'all) try to feel for a pulse, if one's there they mistake it for their own racing heart and start CPR anyway, if there is no pulse they mistake their own for the patients and don't start CPR. (It's that whole grey area / decision making thing again)

Even new Paramedic interns have trouble telling weather there is a pulse on cardiac arrests sometimes and these are people who have been Emergent Medical Technicians for quite a while prior to getting in to Paramedic school!

I hope this has cleared some things up about CPR and made some people more comfortable just jumping in and pumping on a persons chest as long as they are unresponsive and you think they are dead. 

Feel free to ask any other questions!"
dikni,52,2010-09-24,This is the story about the time I met Al Gore in a men's restroom.,kurtrussellisawesome,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/dikni/this_is_the_story_about_the_time_i_met_al_gore_in/,"I already wrote this as a comment on some Al Gore-related post a few days ago, but I thought I'd share it again. 

I have a story for you:

Last year, I got an internship at CurrentTV, Al Gore's indie cable network. My first day there, I was terrifically nervous, and had gotten about an hour of sleep the night before. I was running on Red Bull and first-day jitters, trying to remember everyone's names and not fuck up. About halfway through the day, my friend (who'd gotten me the gig) popped his head over my cubicle and said, ""Hey, Al Gore's in the hallway if you wanna see him.""

Apparently he's only at the office once in a while, so this was very exciting. My friend led me down the hallway and we walked past Al Gore, who's much taller than I expected him to be. I whispered ""HOLY SHIT, IT'S AL FUCKING GORE!"" and we kept walking. We got to the end of the hallway, which we'd walked down for the sole purpose of seeing Al Gore, and I went ""Is there a bathroom down here? I really need to pee, and I don't want Al Gore thinking I only walked by so I could gawk at him.""

I went into the bathroom, which was empty, and took one of the two urinals. About ten seconds later, Al Gore walked in and took the urinal on my left, and started going pee.

I'm standing there, running on way too little sleep and way too much Red Bull, trying to take a leak, and the former Vice-President of the USA is standing right next to me doing his business. I don't normally have a shy bladder, but under the circumstances, it was a bit of a challenge to do my thing.

Then Al Gore farted.

At this, I broke out into a cold sweat and probably burst a blood vessel in my eye trying not to laugh. If I had balls of steel, I would've turned to him and coolly said, ""You know, I hear that's bad for the ozone layer."" But instead I just finished peeing, went to wash my hands at the sink, and tried to retain motor skills because my brain had just exploded from the utter weirdness of the situation.

Al Gore followed suit. I got out of his way as quickly as possible. Aside from being a Nobel Prize winner, he was also my boss and it was my first day as an intern. While I was getting a paper towel, he casually asked me how I was doing, and I stammered something along the lines of ""Fine thank you, sir, and yourself?"" but while I was doing this, I wound up yanking out three paper towels instead of one. There was a moment of sheer panic, thinking I'd get yelled at for killing trees. I don't think he noticed, though I'm sure he's used to interns freaking the fuck out after he farts next to them and then accidentally wasting paper.

I went back to my desk and just sat there shaking, trying to comprehend what had just happened, because let's face it: that doesn't happen every day. My friend walked up, slapped me on the back, and said ""SO! How's your first day going?"" 

And that, my friends, is the inconvenient truth.

**TL;DR: I once took a piss next to Al Gore in a public bathroom. He farted and I took too many paper towels by accident. It was surreal.**"
dj98l,8,2010-09-26,Yet another one...,redditswaccount,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/dj98l/yet_another_one/,"I'm only 21 and you could say I have so much of my life ahead of me, but I just feel too discouraged with how my life has been up to this point to bother going on. I'm a senior engineering student at a top-ranked university. While others have been doing research or internships all their time here, I've been a complete failure and have done absolutely nothing to better myself for a career after I graduate. Like this past summer, where unlike everybody else I spent the summer going through therapy with no successful results. My major doesn't interest me anymore; I'm a senior now and I feel like I don't have a major. I've wasted 3 years of college and will graduate next semester with a degree in a field I don't care about. I have absolutely no idea what I want to do with my life, and I'm in the point of no return as far as switching majors is concerned. I know I'm not the only one that feels this way about their career and stuff, but these other people at least have other stuff going for them in life.

While others have been or are in relationships and seem happy, I sit here as a lonely 21-year old that has yet to even go on a date. I've never even been kissed or kissed a girl before. I didn't even hug a girl until my sophmore year here. Sounds like something a geeky teen might say, but this is coming from a 21-year old adult. I had virtually no friends in high school and never even went to a prom or anything like everybody else here. I can't help but feel like I missed out on a big chunk of life, and I'm surrounded by people who actually *lived* the first 21 years of their life. 

And I know I'm not the *only* one for which the last two apply for people here, but I feel like these other people at least have some sort of relationship with family to fall back on. My relationship with my parents is non-existent and will continue to be so because I can't forgive them for being so distant to me and my brother for all our lives (especially when my brother has been dealing with depression as well at home and attempted suicide, and my parents never noticed anything). I have no relationship with my mom because there's a huge language barrier, and there's nothing I have in common with my dad. My parents were just there to drive me to school, to sign important documents, and provide the essentials of food &amp; shelter. Outside of that there was literally no interaction. There was nothing for us to talk about as I didn't know them and they really didn't know me. I don't know old my parents are. I don't even know when their birthdays are.

So my career life, romantic life, and family life have been utterly pathetic and non-existent. What else is there? People usually say at least you have friends, right? But I have a hard time saying I genuinely have friends. I'm not actually *close* with anybody in my life. I'm just *there* sometimes. Nobody ever calls me specifically up to hang out or have lunch or anything. And it's senior year now; everybody has their close group of friends and stuff already, and I can't help but feel like the lonely freshman that is still eager to make friends.

And then I look at the bigger picture. There are millions of people out there that have it worse than me (I'm going to a top ranked university after all). People with REAL problems. People fighting diseases like cancer and AIDS (I still have my health...). People suffering in Haiti. People living in fear every day due to terrorists and the like (I still have my freedoms...). My problems are so trivial in comparison, yet here I am unable to stop dwelling on them. It's hard not to feel like a crybaby, you know?

I feel like I've done all the ""right"" steps. I've reached out to people, I've tried meds (Lexapro &amp; Pristiq), I've gone to therapy and even a support group, but I'm still here in this slump. I know if you look at all the statistics and read all the success stories online, odds are I will get better with time if I continue reaching out, taking meds, and going to therapy. But when I consider the days from this day to that arbitrary point in the future, and if every day is this shitty and if every night I think about this...that's when I start to consider if it is worth it. Am I insane for thinking this way?

Thanks a bunch if you clicked on this link and took the time to read my bitching. I know that there are so many people that post here and I know everybody has busy lives, so it means something to me that somebody bothered to take time out of their day and listen to the problems of an anonymous person on the internet."

Life Altering Choice.,airfocemanpowpow,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dl8vb/contemplating_joining_the_us_military_life/,"  First let me say that I would have never even considered joining the US Air Force. I am a college graduate. I have not yet sunk my teeth into the job market. I have had some very reputable internships. I graduated with a 3.0 GPA and always loved learning, any type of information that was out there.   
   
  My senior year my college roommate and longtime friend said he was looking into the Air Force, I knew he would not join, he didn't. But I wanted to make sure if he proved me wrong that he would be alright. So I looked into it and frankly I was impressed with what I found and honestly, it has been at the back of my mind for a good year now.  
  
  Now I am thinking of enlisting into the US Air Force, my loved ones are fine with it as long as I am safe.  
  
* I feel it would be a great life experience, might even make it my life long career.  
* I would be able to travel. I would welcome the structure.  
* I would welcome the new friends that I would make due to the bonds we would share.  
* I would welcome the new skills I would gain.   
  
  And within the last 5 years I have felt very patriotic, within reason of course. I happen to have the belief that if you stay where you were born you will never get to be your own person or know what kind of man you are. Not sure if anyone has seen the movie Cinema Paradiso (1988 Italian film) but the boy leaves his hometown, never returns until decades later, to only find out the man he became, that is sort of where I am coming from.  
   
Although having completed college, I feel on one hand I might be wasting what I learned (I studied Documentary Film). Not a big demand for educational filmmakers at the time, or do you get paid a hefty amount to live on, best to be a hobby. I have been working on and off at a IT help desk. Never was my field, but I have always loved computers. Also feel if I do decide to leave what might I be able to get out of it aside from putting “Veteran” on my resume?  
   
**TLDR:** Went to college and gradated, considering enlisting into the US Air Force, not the Officer route. Any suggestions from those who have done this?
