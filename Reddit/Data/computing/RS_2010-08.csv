I'm moving to Vancouver/Burnaby BC area in September for an internship for 4 months at a Video Game study (as a video game programmer).

Won't know anyone so I figured i'd see if I could meet people through reddit.

I've made friends before through POF so why not here as well :)"
cw7xk,7,2010-08-01,A recent development,[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/cw7xk/a_recent_development/,"I've been searching for some answers to cut to the core of my dysthymia.  I decided to start reading some of the entries from my journal, which I started writing when I was 18 (I'm 24 now). I realized that back then, I was wrestling with a lot of the same issues that I am now. I didn't know what to do with my life, I didn't know why I was sad and upset all the time (though I understand it more now), and I had an extremely low level of self-esteem/confidence. I started to put the pieces together and I realized that, for the better part of my life, I've been going through the motions, and I never really asked myself ""what do you want to be when you grow up?"". I simply never had an answer. I was asked that a few years ago when I was at a stupid orientation for the second time at Starbucks, the guy was asking everyone ""what did you want to be when you were growing up?"" and I was the only one that stopped and said ""I don't know... I never had an answer"" and he made some stupid quip about how it's ""always good to dream"". I never put much thought to that. When I graduated college almost 2 years ago I was so depressed, and now I realize it was because I hated my major, and I did it because everyone said I was ""good at it"" and ""I could make a lot of money"". I really tried hard to like it. I tried a few jobs and an internship related to my major, and I just got fired from the one I had because my boss said I didn't like my job enough. I look at all my friends who have jobs that they like, they work hard and party after, and all I can think about is how I wasted a whole day at work and now I have to catch up on the things I like to do, not get totally wasted and celebrate. 

What this triggers in me is really negative, suicidal thoughts. Thoughts that I will never figure out what I want in life, and that all of these ""interests"" (music, audio engineering, film, photography, art in general, skating, social issues, whatever) are just hobbies that I will never be that great at, and that I could never possibly be able to survive on. The major that I chose (Info Systems) completely destroyed my love for science, because it reduced it to a service industry, just like my job right now, delivering pizzas. I worked with computers my whole life, but don't think I ever thought to myself ""I want to be a Database Admin/System Admin/Project Manager/Programmer when I grow up""...and yet I wasted 4 1/2 years learning how to do that. I moped around for the last 18 months wondering what happened to my life.  I think a lot of it goes back to depression, because a lot of times, I can't tell what makes me happy anymore.. nothing does, not even the things I like doing, so how can I decide on one thing to do? I wonder what if I chose to do one of these things, and then I wake up in 5 years and wonder why I'm doing this all over again? What the fuck is the point? I don't even know where to begin now. I feel like I was robbed of the past 10 years of my life because of depression and now I have to start all over again, with no direction, no support, no one to relate to. Everyone is off reaping the benefits of a life of hard work, traveling, working jobs they love, getting married, and I feel like I'm 14 all over again. Has anyone else gone through this? Can anyone tell me what to do? I almost don't even care anymore. I feel like just dying at like 32 or something, so I can at least live out my 20's and give up when it's over. It's incredibly short sighted, but that's the story of my life I guess."

However, in a couple weeks, I'm going to be moving to a new state (from a college town to a big city), taking a new job (leaving my job of over 3 years), and moving in with my boyfriend (we've never lived in the same town).  I'm super excited about many of these changes, but I'm afraid I'm going to not handle it well.

Has anyone else had problems adapting to changes?  Any advice for how to get better at handling change gracefully?

I went to high school with this guy, never really talked to him then, then we ended up going to the same college. We have a lot of the same friends and soon we become friends. He's a pretty typical geek - into video games, building computers, and doing web start-ups. So he did have some experience with start-ups and he and a buddy of his started up a web design firm. I ""applied"" to be an ""intern"" at this company and I use this term loosely. So I talk to his buddy and he said he has a project for me. To essentially make a hot or not site. His partner (lets call him Chuck) offers to help me out and I being a proud person, decline and just start coding away in php. The deadline comes, and I'm not finished and I meet up with Chuck and give him what I have and apologize for not finishing. My friend (lets call him Alex) calls me a couple days later - bitches me out on the phone saying things like ""I knew we should have never hired you (btw I was never paid nor offered anything) and we lost a big contract because of you and you really disappointed us and don't ever bother talking to me again"" - I never said anything to him (nor saw him again) since then. A couple of weeks ago while I was back home with the parents, he apparently came over with his brother after hanging out with my roommate. My roommate allows him into my room and he starts to mess with my computer (thankfully I'm running OS X and have a bunch of extra security installed and he isn't as smart as he thinks and wasn't able to do much more then log into the guest account) but it still really pissed me off. You'd think my roommate would stand up for my privacy and not let other people into my room. 

Everytime I see something about him on facebook or someone mentions him - I feel guilty for letting a friend down (when really that much responsibility shouldn't have been put on an ""intern"") and angry that he is a douche for yelling at me w/o letting me respond and then messing with my computer later.

I'm thinking of going back to school to learn programming, any advice?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cx1xo/hi_reddit_im_thinking_of_going_back_to_school_to/,"I graduated with a BS in Marketing back in 2005 and since then I have jumped around a few companies and realized that I hate the marketing world.  The money does not align with the demands and I'm just over the advertising industry - it's not remotely what I thought it would be like when I was in college.  I probably would have benefited from doing an internship, oh well.  

That said, I have noticed a lot of demand for programmers of a wide range of languages and disciplines and some pretty phenomenal pay scales.  I wouldn't think of doing this strictly for the money, but it's an impressive increase over what I'm used to seeing for the typical advertising job.  So, my thought is to go back to school and learn programming.

My questions are,

Do you think the trend in more and more employers seeking programming professionals will continue?  I imagine it can only increase as people spend more and more time on their computers...

What would be a good approach to the educational aspect?  I was thinking something like a post-baccalaureate certificate, but I am thinking that wouldn't be taken seriously by employers?  This leads to a full-on masters in CompSci or something of the like, right?

Clearly I need a bit of direction, haha, and I'm hoping you programming wizards of Reddit can give me a bit of it.  Thanks!!"

I want to go to law school, what is the best path? (as in what should I major in, classes, extracurricular activities etc...). 

Now I am 20, should I be intimidated that I will be older than most of my classmates, having to take a lot of the freshman classes and all?

Should I graduate faster to make up for lost time or should I enjoy my 4 years of college?

Me 21, her 20. We haven't been as sexually active as we used to be (weird to say after dating only 9 months). It used to be daily, then weekly, now monthly+ thing. I have mentioned numerous times in non-argumentative ways how I have wanted this to change i.e. ""Hey it is really important for me that we have a strong sexual connection in our relationship."" Her: ""I know, I like sex with you, we will have sex tomorrow because I am too tired tonight."" Story repeats all the time. I asked if it was performance and she said no as she comes easily.

Now, one of the new interns at my work (CIO's niece O_o) started to really have a thing for me. We have hung out a few times (did nothing out of line) as a group with other co-workers. Another time, she asked me to come hang with her and her friend at her Uncle's(the CIO) house where she was staying. Went there, played video games, and again nothing happened. Nothing ever came up about dating or if either of us had a boyfriend/girlfriend (as I didn't get the impression she felt that way about me). However, she did know I had a girlfriend.

Now comes Saturday night. She was going to the club with some of her friends and a bunch of people from work. She invited me and I accepted. I met up with her there and danced a bit and I had a drink or two. Then when we were dancing, she grabbed me and we made out. I am in no way blaming the alcohol for me making out with her. I knew what I was doing but I did it anyway. My girlfriend is NEVER forward like this which is a huge turn on for me and I have mentioned that to my girlfriend as well but nothing changed.

I have decided to tell my girlfriend for two reasons. I want to own up to my mistakes, even though she will most likely dump me. The second, I know she will find out in one way or another and if I want any chance at a continued relationship with her, I know I have to own up to it. However, I am starting to like this new girl a lot.

In you experience Reddit, should I try to salvage my relationship or is it time to move on to new opportunities?

TL;DR I have a girlfriend, made out with CIO's niece, salvage relationship or move on?"

We shared a house together, have two dogs, and until a few days ago, I thought everything was fine...

I'm finishing my doctoral degree in engineering (should be done in about a year), and took a summer internship which had me about 1000 miles away for three months.  She is a few years older and works for the government, so she obviously stayed in our home, no big deal, it was only three months. During that time, she expressed that she was unhappy that we are still in the area near my university (major metropolitan area, it's not like we're in the middle of nowhere) because she grew up in the area and didn't imagine we'd be still be here when she moved in with me three years ago.  We never talked about any of this at the time, it was just something that happened.  I told her I understood, and began to make plans so we could move to wherever we needed to be for her to be happy, I could finish my dissertation wherever and didn't need to be on campus.  The summer progressed, she visitted several times, and I made several trips to visit her.  Every single one of them was absolutely amazing.  During one of the trips we talked about marriage, looked at rings, and joked about getting married at some point in the future.  We've been talking about the future for a while, and I was taking the steps to make everything we both wanted happen.

Flash forward to my homecoming.  She says she doesn't feel well (in all fairness she had a terrible week of travel for work), but otherwise, everything is absolutely fine.  We had a nice dinner, played with our dogs, and went to bed.  The next day, we hung out at a baseball game, went to dinner with friends, and spent Sunday night like we spend most Sundays, watching True Blood on the coutch.  We go to bed, I lean over to kiss her good night, and I notice she is just kind of there and very diengaged.  I ask her if everything is alright, and she says ""No... I'm not alright... I'm not happy...""

She proceeds to tell me that she has been ""dreading me coming home every single day,"" and that she ""just wants to be alone right now.""  She thinks I'm ""an amazing, absolutely brilliant person who [she] has an amazing time with..."" but that she ""has a lot of amazing people in her life, and she doesn't want to be in a relationship with them either right now.""  She doesn't understand what after five years, she still doesn't want to be married, and she doesn't want to keep ""forcing it.""  To top it off, she added that ""you're not supposed to marry someone you can live with, you're supposed to marry someone you can't live without.. and there's no one [she] can't live without...""

After several hours of back and forth, we get down to the fact that we work well together, we have the same goals in life, we have the same interests, she is essentially the female version of me.  But... she is incapable of being happy with another person, because that would mean that she wouldn't be in 100% control over her future and herself, and that somehow makes her a weak person.  She is unwilling to be responsible for another person's feelings regardless of how much she enjoys being with that person, or how much that person loves her in return.

If there was a reason why things didn't work out, I could understand.  If we weren't good for each other, didn't enjoy our time together, or we wanted different things in life, I could understand. I just don't understand her, and I don't understand this.  I feel like I'm losing the person I am supposed to be with, and I can't do anything about it.  I have never met another person who understands me the way she does, or to whom I would give anything to keep from pain or hurt or to provide for.  We challenged each other, we supported each other being our own people and having our own lives, we had an amazing life together.  I don't understand how she just walks away...

I was completely blindsided.  I have no idea what to do right now, I feel like every plan I had made for my future is out of the window, and I am completely lost.  It's cliche as hell, but I feel like my heart has been ripped out, and I am missing out on the chance to spend my life with my soul mate.  This absolutely sucks."

I also am shit-deep in finance work, which is a hobby at this point, but I may want to make something out of it in the future.  I invest in companies using a growth and value investing paradigm, and I am interested in long term growth with debt or equity, or special situation opportunities (bankrupcies, recapitalization, etc).  At this stage, I am reading much more than I am analyzing companies (I started at the beginning of the summer and have gotten through about 11 books).

In addition, I also have a nice amount of experience in UI design (focus is on websites, esp given my stated background above).  I do not have a lot of recent work available, but I do have some.

I have moderate experience in Python, and I would consider myself a seasoned beginner with C++ (I have a lot of experience with C-like syntax and behavior, so it was very easy for me to pick up the basics of the language very quickly).

I would like to secure an internship for next summer.  I learn quickly and I like to be challenged on an intellectual level.  Ideally, I would like to land an internship at somewhere like Google or Yahoo, maybe even Facebook (moreover, a Silicon Valley company).  My lack of experience in Python, C++ may hurt me, but in eight months I am confident I can become much better in those sectors.

The obvious most important first step to obtaining such an internship is to have a kick-ass resume.  Typography and presentation are important, and from what I can see, LaTex will help me better achieve such a goal much more effectively.  Further, the content is also important, what adjectives should I use?  Is my experience more important, or my educational information (e.g. which should be at the top, which should be at the bottom?)?  Should I include anything related to my new found hobbies with finance?  Should I include some of my freelance work?  How many pages should my resume be (one seems like it is the Euro-American standard for most sectors)?  Could I ever score an internship in the finance world being self educated (e.g. an Engineering Degree)?

d14wc,3,2010-08-14,"Reddit, why do IT workers have productivity issues",nukeleearr,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/d14wc/reddit_why_do_it_workers_have_productivity_issues/,"I used to work for a large bank and currently am an developer intern for a global service provider.  From my (somewhat limited) experience, I've noticed that the vast majority of my colleagues (myself included) have some kind of entitlement where they/we rationalize only 'working' for only 2-3 hours a day.

Sure, at the end of the day you're being paid to do a job and as long as you do that job and meet utilization, why would you or your manager care?  I can somewhat understand and agree with that, but why is this characteristic so dominant in IT?

When I worked at the bank, the ibanking analysts who just spent 50-100k on their MBA worked 14 hours a day 7 days a week. every. single. week.  And when I say 'worked', I mean actually working, probably rather menial tasks like making powerpoints or discount cash flows, but nonetheless, working.  People who work food/retail get 15 minute breaks every 4 hours.  Plumbers work 40 hours a week, not including travel time.  Yet, I can get away with working 3 hours a day and 'investigating' the other 5 hours.. in between foosball and 2 hour lunches of course.

It's not like there isn't other stuff available after my high-focus coding tasks are done and sure, sometimes shit can hit the fan and you have to spend a night in the server room, but every job has moments like that.  

Lets face it, the perks are incredible.. almost absolute freedom to work how and where you want, as long as things get 'done', laid back work environment... usually with an assortment of foosball, table tennis and other games and high compensation.  

Is there really any wonder why there's that whole lazy IT workers stigma and so much outsourcing?"

Advice greatly appreciated.",grad_school_blues,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d18xu/im_applying_for_phd_programs_and_my_boyfriend/,"Hi Reddit, I'm a 22 year old female, currently dating a 25 year old guy.  We've been together for a year and a couple months.  (We don't live together; we live in the same neighborhood.)  Everything's been going great--but there's one big problem.  It seems that, at this point, our respective career choices are totally incompatible.  I want my PhD, and eventually a research position at a University, and he wants to be very active in the startup community in the city we currently live in.

We're both already more than on our way to our respective (career) goals.  He's currently working for a local startup, and absolutely loves his job.  I'm just finishing a research internship on the other side of the country (we live in the USA), and will be applying this fall for programs starting in Fall 2011. 

This across-country internship made us realize that 6 years of a long distance relationship isn't possible for us--2.5 months was hellish enough.  (We talked about it, and came to that consensus.)

So, it seems like the only option for me to pursue my PhD and for us to stay together would be for me to go to a University in the city we currently live in.  However, there's only one school in our city that I'd consider going to for grad school--and it's consistently ranked #1-3 for grad schools in my field.  So, if I get in, problem (temporarily) solved.  However, I obviously can't count on getting in.

So, it seems like my options are:

* If I don't get into the school in my city, say the relationship was nice while it lasted, and leave it at that.

* If I don't get into the school in my city, try to defer for a year for the schools I did get into (I think this is possible?), apply to said school again, and then make a final decision.

* Get into the school in my city, and then pretend this problem doesn't exist for the next 6 years.  (I can't really control where I get accepted for post-docs or research positions, either.)

So, any advice?  I just can't see how any of my options don't eventually make me choose between the career I want and a relationship I want."

I recently graduated and moved out to a new city.

By coincidence we both ended up on the other side of the country. She landed a summer internship and I just landed a job.

Most of the interactions have been harmless and I would have no problem telling my old roommate.

This weekend we were at a club, Michelle was adamant about taking me back to her place.

Initially Michelle was going to share her bed with her friend Kelly who also spent the night out with us.  I got the twin bed in the other room. 

Next thing I know I find myself sharing the bed with Michelle who is trying to pull my pants off.  (most of you are probably facepalming at this point, but stay with me) 

Michelle knows I normally sleep in my boxers so I really can't tell if she was trying to make me comfortable or **comfortable**. I decline and decide to keep my clothes on.

There was some physical interaction not quite cuddling /spooning but she was lying on me. We ended up talking for a bit and then went to sleep.

Was it the alcohol making her extra friendly or did I miss an open invite?

Then there's the issue of man laws. Your roommate's girlfriend is off limits. Since I moved out I'm technically not roommates anymore and there's no ring on her finger. It still seems like a dick move though.

so reddit am I reading too much into the situation or do I have the opportunity to be the other guy?"
d1z9k,9,2010-08-16,Another whiny post. Sorry.,ffoffail,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/d1z9k/another_whiny_post_sorry/,"I hate doing this. I'm sorry, I'm sure you read posts like this all the time. I just would like some anonymous advice coming from an anonymous person. 

My family has a history of depression, alcoholism, and other serious mental disorders. I've accepted that I am very prone to receiving them, and more so accept that I have one. 

When I was 15 my depression started. I was accepting my sexual orientation (gay), getting a fresh new start in High School, and continuing a rocky relationship with my parents (we are very passionate people who refuse to admit when we are wrong). This made me feel very lonely and upset. I started drinking almost nightly to help deal with it. One night I was about to kill myself when one of my friends came to my house and forced me to stay alive. Ironically my parents never let me speak to this person again because they believe that she made me gay (they don't believe this anymore) and that she made me have depression. 

I started going to therapy after my parents found cut marks on my arm. My first therapist literally gave me an internet test and diagnosed me with bipolar disorder and wanted to prescribe me some sort of anti bipolar medication. We didn't take it because it was too early to say that I have depression. Later we found out that she was getting paid by the company that makes those medicines and she lost her license. None the less, this gave me a complete distrust towards psychiatrists.

I went to another therapist later on but did not enjoy it. I faked my way threw it because I didn't appreciate his attitude and the way he treated me and my religion/activities (running, I hated it, he loved it). I kept on going to him because my parents liked him and I figured I could give an hour of my week if it eases their mind. I convinced him, my parents, and I now think myself that I was okay and over my depression.

During the rest of high school I devoted myself to extracurricular activities, mostly Speech and Debate and our Green Club. I have never been the best student for some reason or another, but activities have been my forte. 

Fast forward to college/present day. I moved 4 hours away from home to go to college because I strongly disliked my hometown and felt that I needed a break from my parents. During college I decided to follow up on the same path that I left in High School. I devoted myself to extra curricular activities (College Democrats (which I'm the president of), Alliance (Activism and Communications chair), and I was part of my hall government before I moved out). My schoolwork hasn't been the best, but it hasn't been the worst. I changed my major from Computer Science to Politicial Science. 

I love politics so much that I applied for an internship working for the 2010 elections. This also gave me a chance to get a head start on our 2010 GOTV plan for our campus.

During college I've met some of the best people that I could imagine, including my best friend/boyfriend. I've been in two long relationships before (neither ended on bad terms, but just happened to end) and can honestly say that I have told him more about myself and opened up more to him than anyone else, and I know that he has done the same to me. My parents and my relationship has gotten much better. 

Despite everything going right for me I still feel like the biggest failure on the planet. I feel that I will never be able to move forward or make any sort of small difference in society. Despite me being in a relationship with an amazing guy who I trust more than anything I feel more alone than ever. For some reason I can't bare to tell him how depressed I have become because I fear that he will view me as whiny and spoiled (he comes from a much more difficult background than mine which is obviously a very lucky background with a few small kinks) and him leaving me. 

I have never felt more empty in my life. Despite finding the best friends, doing exactly what I want, having a great relationship, having a better relationship with my parents, an extremely fun internship where I've met a lot of great people and learned a lot about my interests. 

What am I doing wrong?"
d1zmv,6,2010-08-16,I'm losing a lot of weight.,Baseburn,Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/d1zmv/im_losing_a_lot_of_weight/,"A little background: I've just moved to Boston (one month ago) from Phoenix. In Phoenix, the last time I weighed myself (End of June), I tipped the scales at 250. I am now 230 pounds.

In Phoenix, you have to drive EVERYWHERE. Even down the street to a friend's house cause it's so goddamn hot. In Boston, you can walk EVERYWHERE. Twice a week I go out to Wellesley on the T, get off the subway car and walk to my internship. I end up walking around 5 miles each time I go out there.

I also do not have a paying job yet so the grocery bill is being cut. I am not getting as much protein as I used to. On the positive side, I'm not drinking soda or eating fast food. I have no funds to join a gym. I walk at least a mile every day (besides going out to my Internship) between going to the library or walking a friend to work.

I am afraid that most of what I'm losing is muscle. In fact, I'm almost certain of it.

What can I do now, with no liquid funds, to reverse this trend? I want to lose fat, not weight (fittit has taught me so). Should I try cutting the carbs in my diet and putting more protein back into it?

What can I do in the future, after I earn an income stream, to continue the reversed trend? I am slightly skeptical that as soon as I have money I'll be out buying cigarettes and soda again, so I guess this is more of a question of motivation than anything else. 

TL;DR: Losing muscle, not fat. Help me fittit."

Frequent Fittit lurker here, and first-time poster.  Been through the FAQ but it doesn't specifically address my issue.


Background: I'm 19 years old, 5'10"", 155lbs.  A bit on the scrawny side and my goal is to get stronger and whatever growth comes about naturally as a result of that.


For several reasons, I'm in a situation at the moment where I can't really be eating the amount of protein/calories that Fittit recommends.  I usually eat two boiled eggs and a banana for breakfast, then two more bananas before lunch, and then lunch (which isn't especially nutritious or voluminous due to it being a free meal at the staff canteen of my summer internship company) and dinner (also at staff canteen, unless I go pay up for a Subway sandwich).  


However, I'm currently on week 3 of [Stronglifts 5x5](http://stronglifts.com/stronglifts-5x5-beginner-strength-training-program/) and things seem to be going great.  I started with mostly empty bars (20kg) to get my form right, but each workout feels like palpable progress and I'm feeling great about the whole thing.


My question is, what can I expect from possibly not having my diet match up to workouts?  Is it alright, since I'm a beginner?  Are plateaus inevitable without sufficient intake?  Is it okay to start eating more *once I hit those plateaus*?  Right now I seem to be getting more toned and losing the slight belly flab I usually have, so I'm cautiously optimistic.


Thanks, and please let me know if there are more details I can provide."
d25ld,10,2010-08-17,I just don't know,quiet_night,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/d25ld/i_just_dont_know/,"She was my first girlfriend.  At the end of high school we found ourselves drawn to each other and through a month or more of intense flirtation we found ourselves falling in love.  At the end of the summer she had plans to be in Virginia and I in Germany.  We had planned to not be together- that our relationship was an end of high school experiment.  But it wasn't so.  We stayed together- the separation was painful and we deeply missed each other.

She was sexually harassed at school.  The aftermath tore my heart out but we lived through it.  Then through the next few years we lived through starry nights and early mornings.  We were different but we were the same.  She was my love, my best friend, and my alter ego.  Of course there were fights and differences.  But we always found a way through and around.

This summer she went to California.  An internship.  Partly because of Virginia I was worried.  But I was supportive.  A few hours ago she said that she needed to talk and that she didn't think we were going to make it.

There is no definite conclusion on where we are.  We may not be together anymore.  Everything may be fine and I may be blowing everything out of proportion.

The thing is my heart is in my throat.  If we break up I don't know if I'd make it.  I've never thought I'd be the kind of person to say that.  I've been there for friends during hard times and never really understood.  But it's irrational and crazy but I'm just not sure.

I'm just not sure...

I'm not this kind of guy.  I feel a bit silly posting through the tunnel of the internet but this is embarrassing.  I'm not the kind of guy to feel like this, I'm not the kind of guy that wonders if life is worth it.

If anyone has anything to keep me going, I'd appreciate it.

It looks like things might be decided Wednesday morning.  Then either I'll feel very silly or things will be even worse.

Literally, a SMALL company, it's just the owner (my boss) and myself. We also have an intern who comes in once a week (he's the son of one of our clients).

I'm getting to the point where I hate my job. Not because of the job itself, but because of my boss. He's a dick. He's pretentious and at times speaks to me like a child. 

For example, he'll start giving me instructions on what to do, so I start jotting them down. Whenever he's not clear on something and I ask him to explain, he'll respond, ""OK. GO....INTO...THE....SERVER...ROOM...GOT THAT?"" And I don't know how to respond when he talks to me like that.

Or sometimes he'll give me clear instructions, but assume I know something that I don't. For example, ""There's a new Dexis x-ray sensor that needs to be installed. Call Dexis support and ask for 'Imaging Support' for instructions."" Ok, I call them, they give me instructions. I follow them and install x-ray perfectly. Call him back to tell him I'm done, and then he says, ""They don't use Dexis software, they use Dentrix."" So I have to start all over again because he forgot to mention that small piece of information and he gets upset over it.

I'm getting fed up with him, but I can't tell if I'm just overreacting or he's really just an asshole. He recently told me he wants to get more business, so he told me to start a ""Marketing Campaign"". I was truly stumped with what I was supposed to do really. I understand that it's just us 2 and I occasionally have to do mundane things around the office (vacuuming and throwing out garbage) which is fine, but sometimes he'll ask me to call a big company and ask stupid questions because I feel like he doesn't want to call himself. Also, he says he only takes clients who are referred from our existing clients (which I've noticed have ties to his family).

He also doesn't understand why people hate Internet Explorer (he thinks we're just rebels who wanna hate collectively on Microsoft), and continues to recommend it to clients who are careless with their web browsing. He also makes me call him every hour to give him an update on what I'm doing, which is infuriating when I'm trying to work on something and I have to step aside and call him so he can ask me 100 questions on the process.

If anything, I just wanted to vent. "

She is perfectly fine when living alone with me, but she cannot stand to be around other cats or use the same litter box as them. I have tried everything I can think of, but it looks like I might have to get rid of her if I can't find a place for her to stay for 3 months. None of my friends can take her in, as they are either in college dorms or apartments that don't allow pets, and I am at a total loss. I really can't lose her just because of 3 months. 

So please, if you would not mind housing a small black kitty for 3 months, let me know. I would be happy to help with food and litter, and she has toys, a litter box, and a little bed she likes to sleep in already. 

Even if you can't house her, if you have any advice or know anyone who would, let me know. Thanks guys. "

After graduating I moved to NYC and have been crashing on my sister's couch while looking for a job.  I have had some luck with a few internship and volunteer positions.  It has only been a month and a half and I know that if I stay in the city a little while longer I'll get a real job and be able to start my life.

&gt; I am not a total expert in this area.  However, telecom companies are spending billions on their infrastructure.  Over-regulation will surely impede their investments to the detriment of all.  The balance is to allow providers the ability to manage content in such a way to maximize utilization and quality of service.  However, this intervention cannot be allowed to enable anti-competitive behavior, or stifle innovation.

&gt; Privacy regulation is inevitable.  There is already some regulation in the area of Medical records (HiPPAA), credit cards (PCI), and financial services.  I would expect us to add API’s to allow applications to manage security, privacy, and quality of service.  However, I do not see us in a position of making those decisions on behalf of our clients.

&gt; Google is a mix of inferred knowledge (derived from their search traffic) and voluntary knowledge like the on-line medical records.  Exploitation of either of these are unacceptable and any use of the former is intolerable.

He also mentioned that he meets with a group of CEO's each month (all in the Silicon Valley), and they share their views on the Economy/Government. The majority of them believe that we're quickly heading in to a double-dip recession, and that Government spending/taxation is killing the corporations of the United States.

I am a 21 year old, 3rd year Software Engineering student from Canada looking for a job/adventure during the Winter 2011 semester (January-April).


The engineering program I'm in features co-op study program so essentially I'm in class for 4 months, then off working for 4 months and it alternates until graduation. I would love to take one of my work co-ops internationally in the United Kingdom (preferably Scotland :) ).


Now I have browsed the University of Edinburgh's career center for student jobs but it seems that the general idea is that most student internships are unpaid, this would pose a problem. Here in Canada thats considered illegal-ish but it is common in the United States because it is more of a ""learning experience"". 


Now I don't want to give up on my search just yet so I wanted to ask all of you if you have heard of temporary paid student positions before? I also wanted to know if you have heard of any software development or related companies that are successful enough to warrant a junior developer, I have heard that there are some big game development companies, any big names?


Just to give you an idea, I have a decent background in web development but I am more interested in control systems and automation. Not that I would be picky of course because if I wanted another work-term in a field I was interested in I could just stay in Canada... but I would like a change of scenery to something new and exciting. I'm really looking for anything as long as its related enough to my field of study so that it can count toward my degree.

d468d,1,2010-08-22,Ideas on how to green computing and electronics?,[deleted],environment,https://www.reddit.com/r/environment/comments/d468d/ideas_on_how_to_green_computing_and_electronics/,"Hello all,

*So I've always wanted to make a comprehensive list of ways to make people's computer use as green as possible.  I understand this is a mammoth task, but here's the ideas I have so far:

*Conserve.  Don't leave your computer plugged in if it's at 100% battery or off.  Print double-sided when possible.  Use your computer as long as possible before buying a new one.  Try replacing hardware to keep up as long as you can.

*Conserve (sort of).  This one is more abstract: Use the appropriate service for your needs.  YouTube is not a music site; do not use it as one.  You get low quality audio (usually less than 128 cbr, which is very noticeable on good speakers) at high bit rate (the video stream, even if it's a static image, puts the bit rate over 300 cbr for most videos; it goes much higher for higher resolution videos).  This wastes a lot of data, which is moved about by electricity.  Use dedicated music services for streaming like Pandora or Grooveshark.  Better yet, if you plan to listen to a song a lot, just buy it.  Downloading a 4mb song that you listen to twenty times uses less resources than streaming that same song at 1mb per completion, twenty times.  (As for that, I don't know what to say about methods of data transfer . . . torrenting eliminates the need for server farms, but ratio needs at private trackers cause many to leave their computers on for extra periods of time in opes of seeding.)

*Volunteer your unused e-resources.  This is my fave: Let your computer use your extra CPU to perform calculations on a climate model through [BOINC](http://boinc.berkeley.edu/) (Berkeley Open Interface Network Computing).  I have mine limited to only running when my laptop is plugged in and to not use more than 60% CPU (to avoid overheating and slow down).  So if I'm writing a paper (and thus only using like 5% of my CPU), I donated half of my computer's power to improving UC Berkeley's climate models.

*Donate or recycle your computer and hardware.  If you want to donate it, but are afraid people will find a way to steal your personal info, either remove the hard drive or have it wiped by a licensed professional.  If you recycle, do it through a legitimate agency.  Unfortunately, I don't think there is a way to verify this in the US.

*Demand respect for the environment.  Many computer companies have only started recycling programs and environmentally-friendly design programs because the market has shown that those things are desired.  Make sure that you let companies know what you want by sending a message as a consumer.

Does anyone else have any ideas?  I hope to make a guide/presentation on this topic when I start my internship with my school's environmental office this fall."

I met this girl a couple years ago back when I was in a LTR.  We were friends, had the odd cup of coffee together, etc.  We stayed out of contact for the better part of a year (she was on an internship).  Shortly after she came back I was single.

It turns out she was unaware of my breakup the first couple times I saw her, but since she has found out I've been getting the impression that she's interested in me because she's gone from random coffee breaks, to dinners and drinks, etc.  In the latest case I had mentioned that I was going to a particular concert and within the week I got a message from her saying she had bought a ticket to it too.

I'm unsure how to proceed.  Mainly I'm trying to figure out how to get more kino in as I didn't touch her much before (remember, I was in a LTR) and it would seem kind of awkward to start doing that now.

Is there any easy way to tell if I've been LJBF'ed?  I don't ever hear from her about problems, ex-bfs, guys she's interested in, etc.

**EDIT**: Goddamn I'm dumb.  Everyone on the Internet is aware I'm not in the friendzone from a brief description of the situation.  I met her for coffee today and it suddenly turned into an hour and half long chit chat.  Meeting her at my place tomorrow morning and going for a run....not sure how to play that, but it's clear she's interested in me.  Time to get my touchy-touchy on."
d50u9,6,2010-08-24,"I need your advice, fellow engineers.  2 job offers and I need to pick one. ",jdv25,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/d50u9/i_need_your_advice_fellow_engineers_2_job_offers/,"I just graduated in May and was searching for full time jobs for several months.  I have had an internship in manufacturing for 4 years and my current internship is where I received the first job offer. 

The first job offer is in manufacturing.  It is with a fairly large (5,000-10,000 employee) company.  It would be a production engineer role.  The pay would be really good and job security great.  However, I want to get into design.  That is where the second job offer (probably) is from.  It is from a design firm that has been doing very well, has their hand in many different industries and needs a new Mechanical Engineer.  It is exactly what I think I want to do.  However, the pay would not be near as good and the job security working in the smaller firm would also not be as good. 

Any thoughts?  should I sell my dreams for a lot more money and job security or screw it and go with the job I want?

Edit:  Thank you everybody for your responses.  I am taking the night to think about it.  I have until Thursday morning to decide.  Every one of you has given me something to think about.  I am truly grateful for the internet strangers. :) I will continue to check this and send out responses to questions that you may have for me. 

Edit 2: I met with the smaller firm again today.  I got a really weird vibe from the entire experience.  Further, there were some dishonesty issues. They flipped my initial responsibilities from design engineering to a project management and manufacturing role, they were not clear on compensation reviews, not clear on vacation expectations, etc.  

I am going to tell the the first/larger employer that I will take their job.  This was based on my 5 and 10 year goals, the culture, the available resources, and a variety of other things.  If any of you have any questions regarding this, feel free to ask!

Thank you all very much for your thoughtful advice.  It was a tough couple of days for me and many of you gave me things to think about. "
d5fkj,2,2010-08-25,I'm a junior in computer engineering. What should I do with my life?,LtArson,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/d5fkj/im_a_junior_in_computer_engineering_what_should_i/,"Hey guys. I'm a junior in Computer Engineering at a top 10-ish private university in good-ol' US of A, and I don't know what I want to do after I graduate, but I need to figure it out pretty soon.

I'm taking a heavily software-oriented track in computer engineering, and I'm very good at it and I find it really interesting. The only problem is that I don't enjoy actually doing software development or computer engineering, I just love learning about it. I couldn't picture myself being a software developer at all, and judging from my summer internship I wouldn't enjoy it. Some of my friends were recently hired as software developers for Google and Microsft and Disney but that's not something I can picture myself doing.

There's two things I'm considering, at this point, that I think I WOULD like to do.

I'd like to be a lawyer, but I'm not really sure that's a good idea - I mean, there are a lot of lawyers in this country as-is, and even if I'd like being a lawyer I wouldn't like being an unemployed guy with a JD and a bunch of student loans. Do you guys think that's a bad idea?

I'd also like managing other software developers, I think. I don't know what a job title for something like this would be, though. Product manager? Project manager? Team lead? And I'm not sure what sort of classes I could take that would benefit from something like this, or even if companies will hire new graduates for these positions - I've already taken a software project management course, but I'm not sure if there are any other sorts of classes that would work out for this. I have a decent amount of management experience. I'm working on a web startup with some people I met through a class (planning to push out a beta release in a few weeks), and I have an administrative role in the university's student-run IT department (we employ 40-50 students during the year, and me and a few other people are responsible for hiring, firing, performance reviews, raises, pretty much everything in the day-to-day operations).

I guess what it comes down to is that I like the ""solving problems"" aspect of programming, in the sense that I like to look at a problem and say ""okay, we'd go about solving it this way"", and I tend to be pretty good at that, but I don't like actually solving it (that is to say, writing the code that implements a solution I've laid out). So is there any kind of job that would let me do that?"

d6yfw,26,2010-08-29,Depressed girlfriend making me depressed,fdsa1,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/d6yfw/depressed_girlfriend_making_me_depressed/,"1. Ages: Recent college graduates, she is a little younger than me.

2. Relationship type: Met in college and we've been together for nearly 1 year. Because of my housing situation, we actually lived together for about 4-5 months (we had been together for about 4-5 months beforehand). We have each since both finished college and moved back home to our parent's house, we now live about a  40min car ride away. We used to hang out together 24/7, but since moving back home we now only able to see each other a few times a week. While I do miss being with her daily, I am okay with this but she has not taken it so well. It has been about 3 months in this situation and my love for her has not changed due to the drop in time spent together.
3. I have talked to her about this, and she knows I am upset, but I don't think she truely understand how unhappy it makes me feel. I don't think I can ever tell her everything I'm feeling (not good with expressing my emotions in the first place), but more so I feel like she will not be able to handle how unhappy I am. For the last few months, I have not been able to sleep very well, which has led me to stay up very late at night because my mind is always 100mph before bed. She has been to a school counselor before our relationship, and also went to a few sessions while we were still in school. Also, she is currently working at a temporary internship, in a very bad environment where she feels overworked and under appreciated. I feel like this environment is 10x worse for her than it would be for anyone else in that situation.
She has talked to her mother, and is planning to speak with a professional soon.
4. Problem: She has occurances, about once a week, where she feels anxious and depressed but doesn't know why. I try to lift her mood by telling her I love her and that everything will be okay, but it does not ever seem to help much. She  also sometimes feels like I don't care or love her enough, and misses me so much even when we just recently hung out for the entire day. She gets very sad when I have to, whether it is off the phone or home.

5. Her past: she has been through a lot, especially with her parents, family, and past boyfriends. Talking to her, it seems that she has never lived up to her father's expectations. She has a better and good relationship with her mother. Despite this, I can tell that everyone in the family really does love her, even though their way of displaying affection is different or not the ""norm"" (i love you, hugs etc). A few years ago she found out her dad was cheating on her mom, a little after that time, she found out that her boyfriend was planning, or already (i'm not sure) cheating on her. I am definitely not planning or thinking about cheating on her, I love her too much. I don't think she is afraid I am going to cheat on her, but the thought still affects her because of her experiences.

6. I am not a psychologist nor do I think I am qualified to diagnose her, but I believe she possibly is codepedent, manic depressive, or bipolar. Not all these things, but I feel she displays many of these symtpoms.

tl;dr: I think my gf has mental illness; some sort of depression. I try my best to help her through it but I am now it has caused me to feel very depressed myself. I can't tell her how I truely feel because i think it will just exaccerbate her situation, and make her feel more depressed. I have told her that I really think that she needs to seek help, she has agreed and has taken a few steps to do this.

Please help me, I love her so much, but I don't know how much more this I can handle :( I know this is A LOT, but please let me know if I missed anything or if you need anymore additional information. thank you for taking the time to read all this."
d717r,0,2010-08-29,"Reddit, my love life is currently non-existent.  Can you possibly help me out?",TescoValueThrowaway,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/d717r/reddit_my_love_life_is_currently_nonexistent_can/,"Hey reddit, I've got a problem and you guys always seem so good at sorting things out so I'd like some advice.  Obvious throwaway account because I do not want to personally identify myself.  I'm going to offer a bit of backstory and some of the problems I seem to be faced with.  Apologies in advance for the length of this post and thanks for reading.

I'm a 22 year old guy and turning 23 in December, and I graduated from University in early June and am starting a Masters degree in October.  All summer, I have done nothing of note apart from a one week family holiday because there are very few jobs or internships available where I live (south West England).

Essentially, my love life is non-existent.  While I was at University I feel like I worked too hard and as a result I didn't socialize as much as I probably should have done which ruined the experience somewhat.  At the grand old age of 22 I have *never had a girlfriend*.  Sounds weird but it's true, and to be honest it's starting to wear me down and make me feel inadequate and feeble.

My first kiss was aged 19 towards the end of my second year at University and since then I have only pulled about six girls.  I have done lots of groping, spooning, kissing and heavy petting but never anything naked, and I have never had foreplay and am still a virgin.  All of my activity with girls has involved at least a small amount of alcohol as I am a bit shy and lacking in confidence, and there are a number of girls I grew pretty close to and them to me (some of them were definitely interested with some even texting me like girls do when they're interested).

This is hardly anything considering my friends are all screwing like rabbits on viagra whereas I have nothing, and I really feel like life has passed me by.  I can't turn the clock back and it feels like such a waste.  I've only been on three sort of half-dates which was nice although I didn't ask any of the girls out - I went to a show with a girl and her friend and I met up with the girl before the other guy turned up and we had a drink (I liked that girl) and the second one was with a girl I lived with at University as we were meant to be going out as a group, but the others decided they didn't want to so we went on our own.  It was also quite nice, we had a nice chat and a quiet cozy drink in a pub together but we fell out weeks later when it turned out she thought I was coming on to her, so she began to shun me which made me very angry and upset because I could see no clear reason for it.  In December 2008, I got hopelessly drunk and came within 10 minutes of having a one night stand and losign my virginity.  We got back to the girl's (not one of the aforementioned girls) flat but she suddenly changed her mind and asked me to leave despite she had been leading me on basically all night previous to this, and I still can't work out why.  I have several long term close female friends who have rated me as an 7.5 or 8 out of 10 on the looks scale (sorry, no pics) and they have tried very hard to encourage me and cheer me up.  I have had problems with unrequited love on a small number of occasions and I think I'm getting too hung up on looks as there was one girl who obviously really took to me and I liked her personality, but she just wasn't good looking enough somehow.  There was another girl who texted me for the whole of Summer 2009 because I met her in a club and kissed her, but again it was my fault that we never dated or made anything of it.

I was teased and picked on at school whenever I showed an interest in anything at all, including girls so I think this has damaged me because even now I'm conscious of what my old school peers might think if I were to ever enter a relationship.  My sense of humour isn't what it was (I used to really make people laugh but now I can barely crack a smile) and I think I subconscioulsy push people away when they try to get close which makes relationships difficult so I do wonder if I'm suffering from a form of depression.  I can't really relate to other peoples feelings beside my own (this is quite a recent change)

I basically have one more crack at University to get all this sorted out, but I'm worried that I'm going to be far too busy to socialize enough to make it happen.  At this rate I can honestly see myself hiring escorts and using online dating, sad and pathetic as it is, next October as I leave University for good and any opportunities I had will be gone forever.  Society says I'm screwed and destined to live alone and miserable forever because I didn't get my first girlfriend aged 12 or have sex at 14.  My lack of sexual experience at age 22 is embarrassing and it would be really obvious if I ever slept with a girl properly.

I realize most of what I have written here is self pity and I've probably brought some of it on myself, albeit involuntarily, but I do genuinely want to put it right and I need some help in doing so.

Thank you for reading.  I'll answer any questions as best as I can and all comments and suggestions are welcome."
