There was no limits on peoples exchange databases therefore people had mailbox sizes of 20+ GB which was pissing off outlook.

So recently I bought a barracuda mail archiver and set exchange up to auto delete emails older than 6 months. (side not people still have mail box sizes of 3-4GB). Now i have a ton of free space in the exchange databases. I need to run eseutil /d but it requires 110% times the space on the server as the database.  Once I do one of the databases i will be find for the rest. 

So here is my question is how do i do the first one.

My idea: I have Exchange Management Console/Shell on another server. This server has tons of free space. Therefore can I dismount the database, copy it to the other server, run eseutil /D on it then copy the database back the exchange server, and reattach it to exchange?  (Note: M$ does not recommend using the eseutil /t and putting the db on a network share). 

thanks in advance

p665q,8,2012-02-01,Starting home PC building/cleanup,Hirosakamoto,computertechs,https://www.reddit.com/r/computertechs/comments/p665q/starting_home_pc_buildingcleanup/,"Hey there everyone, I was wondering if this sounded alright to you guys. 
I am a recent graduate with a bach. in Software dev. At the moment I have an internship going (unpaid :(   ) so I figured a good way to get some money on the side (afternoons/weekend jobs) would be to start up a simple little home pc shop.

I have done small to medium repairs on my own and family computers for free over the years, but I do not know if I want to include any kind of larger repair service (do not have the $ to afford startup gear if its a hardware issue). What I did plan on including though is the following:

* Home network setup
* Virus/maleware removal
* Custom builds
* Data Transfer
* Software installation (eh...we have a large group of elderly people here)
* Recommend with what budget you have what desktop/laptop to buy

After I get some initial funds from doing a few jobs, maybe it would be a good idea to then invest in tools for repair jobs (PS testers etc). I have a usb-sata-ide already that I borrow from a friend, and I already have a generic toolkit of screwdrivers and zipties/cutters. 

I figured a flat rate for most jobs would work good, and with the custom builds I would get a budget, and then collect a percentage     (enough to cover the parts if I have no budget to work with) ahead of time, and then the rest after completion. If I did get into repair, Id probably charge 30-40 an hour to undercut the local (hugely overpriced) store that has 2-3 employees working there. I applied back there when I was 19 looking for a summer job, back then it was....nasty to say the least. 

Flyers will be put in the 2-3 grocery stores within the 2-3 towns around here. Will be ordering business cards and setting up with Google Voice. Anything else you guys can think of that I am missing that I could include/need to do? Hopefully this is in the correct subreddit. Thanks for your time!

Depression runs deep on both sides of my family and I used to go to therapy for it when I was a kid and thought I had been better from it but maybe not.  I try to smile and be happy but I just isn't working like it usually does.  I don't even know where it all began, it wasn't even a month ago I was home and with my family and everything was great.  I come back to college and I feel so upset that I cried myself to sleep most every night for the past week and I just don't know what to do with myself.  I'm in my last semester for a dual major in computer science and cognitive psychology and I can't get the nagging feeling that I'm not going to pass these two courses I""m in and I'll have to retake the classes and it's scaring the shit out of me.  I've been working hard and we get the assignment back and the professor says you'd have to be an idiot to do bad and this and that about how only thing he takes points off for are dumb questions so when everyone else does fine but I get a 50% on it for the rest of the class I had to sit there feeling like a complete dumbass when I already have enough anxiety about that stuff.  I don't know what it is but whenever I try programming now I get horrible anxiety, like my stomach starts to turn and I feel like getting sick after about 30 minutes of it.  I've never considered myself to be dumb just never really smart either just normal but lately I can't help but feel like an idiot about everything.  I'm starting to look for jobs after college and I""m not sure if this is what I want to do but I have debt that I need to pay off so I need a job.  I recently decided I'd try online dating site after my friend recommended it and thought why not. After a broken heart from my highschool sweetheart I decided going into college I'd take a break and be by myself for a while but that's changed and I've tried for the past three months to start dating again.  I've emailed multiple women online and I haven't even got a response from a single one,  I don't know if I'm doing it wrong, maybe I'm not really that attractive or whatever it is but I just can't seem to do anything right and I don't know what to do anymore.  My brother has an internship at a compnay I wanted to work at last year but I didn't get the internship and now that I'm graduating I thought I'd try it again since they are looking for employees but I get anxiety like you wouldn't believe from thinking about it.  I don't know what to do with myself anymore, I wake up an just want to go back to sleep and forget everything.  I haven't felt this hopeless in a while and I don't know what to do."

Several years of busting my ass (relatively) at a mediocre public high school, plus tons of luck, got me into my long-time dream college where I joined a baller engineering program.

I had arrived at my version of paradise. I got complacent; I partied, made friends, and expanded my horizons. I also relapsed into a habit of chafing against classes with teaching methods and material that I found irrelevant, and I often did the minimum amount of work to keep my GPA where I wanted it. I grazed over countless topics in my spare time and mastered none, unless you count clicking the Stumbleupon button or writing bad poetry.

Then, last winter quarter (a third of the way into my sophomore year), I took on a time-sucking leadership position in a rowdy extracurricular club and began to let substance habits get the better of me. That spring quarter I underachieved like there was no tomorrow. It was all okay though, because I had a job lined up, didn't I? I was quite the budding (pseudo)intellectual, wasn't I?

Hedonism was the theme of that summer. I turned down a research internship I felt woefully unprepared for and took on a higher-paying job with an education startup that I was woefully not cut out for. I told myself I was going to be a part of the changing education landscape, that I was going to spend my spare time learning web dev and studying the brain and whatnot. Instead I had barrels of fun but continued to let my mind, along with many interpersonal connections, fall into disrepair.

Fall was the very worst. I avoided probation by the skin of my teeth and knew of no professors I could ask for future recommendations. I grew depressed, socially anxious, and increasingly apathetic about my hygiene and health. I had everything I wanted and needed in front of me and still felt miserable, which made me feel even more worthless. 

I resolved to sack up for 2012, and I did. Upon finishing up my leadership post and renouncing substances about a month ago, my schedule opened up, and I started to get back on the horse. I was going to buckle down and get straight A's again, just to prove to myself I could do it.

And here we are.

I sit here, tearing my hair out, staring at three blank problem sets. I feel utterly fucked, as before. To my horror, I haven't been able wrap my head around the material in my classes at nearly the required pace, and it's only going to get plenty harder. The drop deadline has passed. My depression has not.

It's too late for me to change my major without going into serious debt to pay for extra quarters. I can take a year off but I would have to withdraw from my current courses, accept academic probation, and face the ridicule and contempt of my family and peers.

I have let everyone in my life down. I feel extreme shame and don't know where to turn. Reddit, do you have any similar stories with at least a bittersweet ending?

Thank you.

**TL;DR** - Kicked ass in high school, fucked up in college, currently convinced I don't have what it takes to make it the rest of the way through. Has anyone you know made it through something like this?"
p5s9r,1,2012-02-01,Jia you chao ren!,driven2rhythm,WritersGroup,https://www.reddit.com/r/WritersGroup/comments/p5s9r/jia_you_chao_ren/,"I'm an engineering student and I haven't had a writing class in three years. I moved to China eight months ago for an internship and I figured since I wouldn't be using a lot of spoken English I would need another way to keep up my English. My decision was to started a blog about my experiences in China. I'm trying to improve my writing and possibly start writing a longer story or fiction sometime in the near future.

Within weeks of my arrival in Shanghai, I was informed that there would be a half marathon occurring in early December and it would be nice if I attended. Feeling that I could totally run 13.2 miles to complete a half marathon, I began training. I managed to run two to three times a week averaging about two to three miles for each run. 

About two months into training, I went out for my usual nightly run. When I’m running, I do so rather absentmindedly, making each turn without thought. As I rounded corner after corner, I noticed that a man on a bike seemed to be keeping pace with me. To double check, I sped up and so did he, I slowed down and he again followed suit. A plan formed in my head to beat him. Obviously this was not an achievable goal but I decided to push myself to the limit anyway. I finished a mile run in the six to seven minute range which I’d never been close to achieving before. 

The next day I decided to time myself to see just exactly what my limit was. Off I went on my run. It was just a typical night with a little weaving between people and cars due to my increased speed. I kept watch on the time and was very pleased with my rate. As I came up to the last corner I pushed it into overdrive, determined to impress myself. I reached the corner, hit a rough patch of dirt, twisted my ankle, and fell into a pile on the ground. I got back up, limped home, and proceeded to be overly dramatic about my injury and ran once in the next four months. 

With the lack of exercise looming over my head, the registration date for the half marathon decided it was a good time to make itself known. With still a month and a half left for me to train, I decided to register. And so I ran a few times and then got on a plane for a three week vacation to America. Take a guess what I didn’t do a whole lot of in America. 

While at home one night my sister decided a run was in order for her half marathon in a few months. Against my lazier judgment, I decided to join her. What started as an easy two mile run turned into me pushing my limit again and running seven and a half miles. My longest run at that point in time was about three and a half miles. This made me confident that maybe I could in fact complete a half marathon. 

In a matter of moments I was on the plane again to China. I sent a text to my friend announcing my return and he inquired back if I was ready for the marathon this Sunday. This Sunday… ha ha ha. I’d managed to run about four times in the last three months and the marathon was this Sunday. I mustered up the willpower to run two more times to “prepare” for the half marathon. 

At first I decided to exclude this next portion but of course, there’s never a dull moment in China and this is without exception. Friday night was check-in and gear pickup. The rest of the people I came with had registered in person so it was off by myself to find online registration. I got my number and went to pick up my stuff. As I walked and looked at the numbers I came to the realization that I was registered for a full marathon. I clearly remember scoffing at the idea of me running a full marathon when registering so clearly this was a mistake, an easily fixable mistake. Wrong. With the general flexibility of China, I assumed a quick switch was in order. That day, for whatever reason, insurance said “no, this is not possible” and therefore no switch is allowed. After ten minutes of tense discussion in Chinese and walking from booth to booth, it was decided, not officially of course, that I would run as the guy in our group who had paid his fee but could not run. No complaining if I fall and break my leg or something along those lines. Whelp. 

If it wasn’t already shameful enough that I’d probably get about half way through and fall over from exhaustion, it was requested that I wear a costume. I mulled the idea over in my head, not quite excited at the prospect of looking like a complete and utter mess. Against my better judgment, and since my friend was going as Spiderman, I ventured out Saturday afternoon to a costume shop and found myself presented with a pretty limited selection. In the end I decided with Superman, cape and all. As a note, bargain always. I didn’t realize until later on like a stupid laowai(foreigner), that I got suckered into paying about $30 for something that a Chinese person would pay $5 for. 

Saturday night consisted of a rather uneventful pasta dinner along with booking my ticket to Cambodia for vacation (maybe I lied). Thanks to jetlag still hanging around, I was asleep by 9:30. This also made getting up at 5:30 that much easier. I got dressed, walked out into the living room and laughed that I was the first one awake. Then I checked the time, smacked my head, and went back to bed for another hour. 

After an hour nap, I returned to the living room to find the others getting ready. Spiderman would be concealing his identity until the start of the race, then donning a mask and staying anonymous for the duration of the race. This was somewhat frustrating as Superman just has a stupid hair curl that somehow hides his identity. I possessed no such curl and therefore was going to be known no matter what. Deciding that a good confidence boost was in order, I wore the costume with false pride from the apartment door to the end of the race. 

Typically as a foreign white person in China, I tend to stick out and get a few inquisitive stares on the regular. I’ve gotten comfortable with this and tend not to notice unless I’m actively trying to catch people staring, which I sometimes do when I’m bored. Today though, I felt the eyes of everyone on the subway. Upon arrival at our subway stop, we remained at the exit as this was easier to locate our friends instead of trying to walk through the massive crowd of runners. This involved watching group after group pass by as they were released from the train. It was almost like a safari where groups would pass by, stare at the wild creature, take a picture, and continue on. 

Maybe you think of my example as an exaggeration. You’re wrong. People did in fact take pictures. Some were secretive and I would catch them out of the corner of my eye. Others would try and catch me without looking and then run away once eye contact was made. This bothered me somewhat but I tried to be a good sport about it since it’s not everyday Superman stops to run a half marathon. 

We remained stationary for about fifteen or so minutes. During this time I started counting the amount of pictures being taken of me. At this point, the count was already up to ten. About this time, the first person asked to take a picture with me. This picture brought a genuine smile to my face and managed to destroy a large chunk of insecurity present within my head. Finally, our group had assembled and we emerged from the subway. 

I was greeted by 25,000 runners, their fans, security, event organizers, and anyone else who ended up in the wrong place at the wrong time. One cannot quite comprehend what such a large number of people looks like until you see it. With this large number came an equally large number of cameras and I gave up attempting to count the pictures being taken of me. 

Finally, Peter Parker decided to transform and Spiderman and Superman got to hang out together. We walked along to drop our bags off, stopping about every minute to pose for a photograph. As we made our way through the crowd, I realized I’d been tricked, or maybe I just didn’t know marathons very well. Nobody else was wearing any resemblance of a costume. However, contained within one opening of the crowd stood two Johnny Depp Characters, one from Pirates of the Caribbean and the other from Alice in Wonderland. Of course a picture was in order. 


As we stood counting down the minutes to the start of the race, it dawned on me just how stupid running a half marathon was with no training. However, I had invested about $60 in this race and I was already here, might as well suck it up and go for as long as I can. The race got underway with a walk for the first several minutes followed by a light jog as each runner got a chance to stretch out. I must say that I’m disappointed that I didn’t bring my camera, but that was probably for the better in the end. The first turn of the race saw the road corkscrew up one level and then straightening out into a massive bridge. The corkscrew itself was rather wide and you could see almost all the way around it and the entirety of it was covered in people. What an awesome sight to see. 

The next seven miles was filled with packets of people dressed in decorative outfits, shouting “jia you,” words of encouragement to keep running. Every so often I would hear a shout of “Superman!” and I’d throw up the peace sign, as is typical of China, at least I think that’s the proper response anyway. Some runners would run ahead of me, stop and take a picture, shout a quick thank you and continue on. Others would inquire as to why I was running to the finish line and not simply flying. This kept my spirits up and I chugged along.

Only problem is I don't know the languages they run ASP.NET and C#. 

Now I started playing around with ASP.NET and it seems relatively easy to pick up. C# is going to be interesting because I haven't quite wrapped my head around OOP yet, the classes thing still boggles my mind a bit (this is not the gist of my post, please don't link to stuff explaining classes)

Anyway I wanted to walk through a tutorial on microsoft's ASP.NET site so I downloaded Visual Studio 2010 Express and all the shit that comes with it. Installed and set to work. I went to build the template program in the MVC as the tut instructed but it didn't build at all. It gave a page not found error in the browser after directing to a really high port on localhost. 

I messed with it for awhile but couldn't figure anything out. I uninstalled all the stuff installed by MS when I installed Visual Studio. Personally I wouldn't even use Visual Studio if it were up to me, give me some NP++ and a browser, ill figure out the rest. As it is the company said i needed to learn how to develop with VS, so i am going to. 

tl;dr having issues with Visual Studio no being able to run in my local browser (FF), need helping fixing the issue."

LONG AND RAMBLING POST
ME(30M) HER(21F)
Ok I'll start from lastnight.
I've been doing Standup comedy for a while now(about 10months) and have been seeing this girl (21) around one particular spot that I perform at.
Well we talk for a bit as I know one of her mates as he compares a night there, I gave  her my number over Facebook and  told to give me a call or TxT sometime .
So a day and half after that she sends me a txt,end up txting each other about 3 or 4 times a day for about 2 weeks and had 2 two hour phonecalls that felt like they by in minutes ,til last night .

We met up for a coffee and talked for about an hour then headed to the spot where I perform ( we both know people there). Anyway I get talking to her and honestly I think she is amazing, she works at a expensive pub in central London,she goes to Uni (and is in the top 5 students in her subjects) and also she interns at a prestigious law firm.

she's extremely well read and funny and clever. Her family are liberal caring and funny (she is also very pretty ,I think most of her guy friends have a crush on her) ,so her upbringing is pretty different from mine.

Well as you can see now I'm totally smitten with her but she really busy only gets one night to herself, I asked her when I would get to see her again and she said probably in two weeks. 

Now let me tell you about my self
When I was 5 I witnessed my father kicking the shit out of my mum ,it's pretty much affected my attude to violence, my father was a scary drink an could turn at the drop of a hat (not on his kids but adults)(also taught me how to handle drunk people). 
When my parents got divorced I would stay with my dad and his gf(who also happened to be my mums sister).between the ages of 6-10 I was sexually abuse by my dad(him touching me when he was drunk) and by an older cousin ( who I had to share a bed with,he would touch me too). I've never had a girlfriend and never had sex ( the closest I've come to sex was making out).I have suffered from depression for most of my life but most people never get to see that,they  me see laughing and cracking jokes all the time.


I think that we are different people who could compliment each other but I'm worried that with all my shit I would fuck everything up.
I'm not sure she even likes me like that, could be just be being nice.

Also could I ever be normal ? 

I mean have a caring loving relationship with someone who I can tell everything too,someone who would love me?

I want to believe that the answer is yes I can be loved and normal but when I get depressed I know that I will never be normal and never find someone who loves.
I often think about suicide but won't do it till my mum dies, and I'm smart 
enough to make it look like an accident.


So reddit this is the question,
Does this girl like me?
Can I find love and happiness?
How do you get over witnessing domestic abuse and child abuse?
Is life worth living?
Here's a little story

When I was 5 I started school,after the first week I was moved to a different class,I was given a letter to give to my parents explaining why I had to move class (I had trouble with my abc).
So now I'm constantly told by my dad ( who could be very intimidating),that I'm dumb and need to learn my abcs.
So at the weekend my mum drops my dad to work,as he's getting out he tells her ""make sure jestersidiot learns his abc"".
Now in the car my brother and I convince my mum to take us to the park,end up playing football then go home and watch some tv.

My dad gets in after work VIA the pub and see me in the living room watching tv and calls me over to the kitchen.dad is sitting at the kitchen table with my abc book while my mother is doing the washing up. 
Dad starts by making  me read it but due to me being intimidate by him and him being a pretty terrible teacher I start guessing what I'm supposed to be reading rather then actual reading.

So now he gets in to an argument with my mum about her taking me to the park instead of making sure I studying ,mum says to him that jestersidiot is a kid should have some fun.well the argument escalates to yelling and then he gets up out of his chair and starts beating her .
punches to the face ,grabbing her by the throat and throwing her to the ground ,still punching and kicking her.then he gets down on her and starts punching her in the face like she's a man.while standing there my older brother(7 at the time) walks over to see whats happening with my baby sister(who was 3 at the time)
stand at the door of the kitchen watching all this shit happen. While he's hitting her ,my mother is screaming for her mother till the day I die I'll never forgot that sound.
he stops hitting her and moves me and my siblings to the living room where we watch tv,I make an excuses to go to the kitchen(to check on my mum) but she's not there ,instead I find her in the garden staring at the canal that runs past our house,that image still haunts me .

ABOUT ME
I am the darkest one in my family,so growing up I got all the dark/black jokes about my skin tone.
I was constantly bullied by people(some times white or black but mainly southeast asians).

It didn't stop when I got home because that's when my brother would bully me.I pretty much wished I was dead everyday when I was a kid.funny thing is if people were to describe me back then they would probably say I was a class clown.
I recently told my mum,brother and sister about the abuse (just about my dad not my cousin). 

I've had to be there for a friend who has been diagnosed with liver damage so I've had to be there for him,telling him to be positive and what he can do(keep getting doctors opinions till he is satisfied,speaking to liver disease groups and ARM himself info about what going on with his liver). Also arranged for a party for him so people could see him.

I'm still fighting depression and so times its hard to get out of bed.
I drink too much and smoke ,eat the wrong shit.
I've been unemployed for a longtime and my CV looks like shit.
But sometimes I have hope.

The thing with this girl I spent so much time alone that, i cant believe that someone could even like me that.
Well I guess it doesn't matter now,I txted her but she never got back to me.
I think I came on too strong Nevermind plenty more fish that don't want my bait. Or maybe she's busy ,or more likely she saw right through me.
Here's the thing It's not even about the girl It's about the fact in the firsttime in years someone like me and got to know me ,and now wants nothing too do with me because I'm a loser. I lose at life. Death would be better then knowing you on your own till your last breath never knowing love from a woman.

*As you can see I was feeling pretty shitty but I sent this to my closest friend and he convinced me to get help*"

I  have been involved during my college career in a lot of non-profit work, including being on the inside of a project that involved securing a large grant (I did not write the proposal, but was involved in proofreading/making suggestions, as well as implementing the project once we received funding). 

Other than that, I have zero experience in grant writing. 

I realize that most likely, the first thing to do is to secure a volunteer internship in grant writing. However, I'm wondering, how can I know that a particular ""grant writing internship"" is going to give me the skills I'll need to eventually secure a paid job doing it?

Also, can you recommend any books, online resources, or classes to take?

Thanks in advance for your help."

p7bt8,8,2012-02-02,Common 0L Questions,orangejulius,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/p7bt8/common_0l_questions/,"**COMMON 0L QUESTIONS**

**1) Should I go to law school?**

 No, but that's not going to stop you is it? Didn't think so. Nobody ever listens to the warnings about a Yeti until it's ripping their arms off, either.

2) What are job prospects like after graduation?

**3) I'm an undergrad, what should I study if I want to go to law school?**

Anything. You're going to find everyone from any background can and will go to law school. Here's my tip...study something you enjoy and can make a living doing, just in case you don't end up going to law school.

**4) What do the law school tiers mean?**


The tiers refer to the law school rankings that USNWR publishes yearly. The ranking system is a composite of many factors, including peer and professional ratings, student/teacher ratio, etc. Each year, schools report their data and the rankings come from that data. Thus, schools move around in the rankings year to year. Generally, however, schools don't rise or fall more than a few spots every year (especially in the Top-14). 

There are 4 tiers:

* Tier 1 (1-50)

* Tier 2 (51-100)

* Tier 3 (101 - ~150)

* Tier 4 (~151 on down)

Schools are always ranked in the top 2 Tiers. USNWR generally also ranks Tier 3, but the rankings matter less and less as you get into Tier 3 and 4 territory. The general *trend* is that the further down you go in the rankings, the lower the admission standards are, and the lower your employment prospects are. 

While rankings shouldn't be your only determining factor when choosing a law school, the ranking of a school should play a role. Employers (and to some extent the general public) pay attention to these rankings. 

**[5) What does it mean if I choose a lower tiered school?](http://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/p8r4v/what_does_it_mean_if_i_choose_a_lower_tiered/)**



**6) What is the LSAT and how do I study for it?**

**The Test**

The LSAT is the law school admissions test. It is administered 4 times a year under conditions very similar to the SAT or the ACT. Along with GPA, it is really the determining factor for law school admission. A low LSAT can destroy your chances even with a high GPA, and a high LSAT can make up for a lackluster academic record. 

There are 4 graded sections as part of the LSAT and 1 ungraded ""experimental"" section. On test day, you will not know which section is experimental. Each section is strictly timed and you are given 35 minutes to complete each section. You will be given between 24 and 28 questions or each sectionThe 4 sections are:

* Logical Reasoning (2 sections) - Somewhat like SAT questions. These questions will often ask you to find weaknesses in arguments, identify valid premises and conclusions, etc.

* Analytical Reasoning - Logic Games. This is by far the hardest section for unprepared test takers. This section tests your analytical skills by having you solve complex ""games"" involving multiple factors and rules for how those factors interact. These kind of games can be learned, and practice and preparation goes a long way here.

* Reading Comprehension - Again, somewhat similar to the SAT. You will be asked to read typically 3-4 passages consisting of between 2-6 paragraphs and answer questions about those passages.

The experimental section will be made up of questions from one of the aforementioned categories. This section is unscored.

Finally, there is an ungraded writing section where you are asked to argue for one of two equally desirable options. Law school administrators don't seem to ever use this section for anything, so don't worry about it. However, it is advisable that you write something and make sure to sound at least mildly intelligent. No admissions officer wants to see that you just doodled for 35 minutes.


**Studying**

There is no substitute for taking practice tests (old LSATs) under test conditions, and as many as possible. These are available relatively cheaply from a variety of sources, including LSAC.

If you find yourself struggling in one particular area, the PowerScore bibles are an invaluable resource. There are individual bibles for each section of the test, and they contain detailed walk-throughs and guides on how to approach each type of question, along with ample practice problems. 

Finally, there are intense courses (e.g., Kaplan, Princeton Review), but they are not cheap and their effectiveness when compared to self-study has not been shown to make them worth the huge cost.



**7) How important is undergraduate GPA compared to my LSAT score?**

Law School admission staff almost entirely base their decision on your LSAT and GPA (URM status being the big exception). The question here is how important your GPA really is, my quick reply is that your GPA is less important than your LSAT score but still hugely important.

[Lawschoolnumbers.com](http://lawschoolnumbers.com/) (LSN) is a self-reporting admissions site. Basically you create a profile, put your GPA/LSAT in and any other details you find important (while be relatively anonymous).

[Lawschoolpredictor.com](http://www.lawschoolpredictor.com/wp-content/uploads/Law-School-Predictor-Full-Time-Programs.htm) (LSP) is a site with a calculator that determines your chances at any school based on calculations of prior classes. Most of their information comes from lawschoolnumbers.com

Looking at schools bottom 25%, median, and top 75% GPA/LSAT and then comparing it to students who were admitted and denied, it is revealed that your LSAT is more important. Schools have more of a hard cutoff for lower LSAT scores than GPA. A low LSAT causes more denials than a low GPA, and a high LSAT with a low GPA puts you back in the running while not the other way around. LSP calculates GPA being about 20% to 30% of what the LSAT is worth (They do it school by school); this percentage range is consistent with [allegedly leaked school formulas.](http://www.uiowa.edu/~030116/prelaw/lawschools09.htm)

Keep in mind, while the LSAT is more important, your GPA is second- by a lot. Despite what admissions staff may tell you, your LSAT and GPA almost entirely will decide whether you get admitted or not. This is allegedly because of rankings like USNews weighing LSAT and GPA so much.

I would also like to take this moment to point out that your GPA and your LSDAS GPA (the one law schools see) may be very different. If you ever failed a class but then retook it to replace the grade, I’m sorry to say that both grades will count. [Here is a calculator for LSDAS GPA.](http://www.lawschoolpredictor.com/wp-content/uploads/Law-School-Predictor-LSDAS-GPA-Calculator.htm)



**8) What Does It Mean If I Pick A Top 14 School?**

I'm at a Northwestern, so my answer will be tainted with the understanding that 95% of my classmates have pre-law school full-time work experience, so pretty much everyone has the work experience employment ""bump.""

For the top 10%, almost everyone gets jobs at prestigious Vault 10 law firms. Some people will say that Northwestern cannot place into certain firms, but I will tell you that at least one person in my class got an offer at each of Vault 10, including Wachtell and Debevoise. (To clarify, I don't mean one person swept; some combination of people covered all of them though). Almost all the big, prestigious firms come to campus during the summer before 2L to interview people. However, it is true that they would rather take only top students. For people who are below the median (read: that's half of everyone), you will be looking outside of OCI, almost certainly, but for people in the top 1/3, not getting a big firm job is almost difficult.

What happens to people at the bottom of the class? Many people still get jobs. This depends on your ability to pitch yourself to large law firms with less prestige (for example, firms that pay $120k instead of $160) and firms in non-major cities (like Milwaukee, San Diego, New Jersey, Texas, etc). This is a lot easier for, say, Texans, than for a native Chicagoan. Still, T14s have national reach. Despite having bottom 1/3 grades, I will be summering at a firm that pays close to $160k in a non-major city. Some firms would rather have anyone from a T14 than someone at the top of their class from a worse school, as I learned through my recruiting process.

Still, for one reason or another, some people don't get firm jobs. I know two people in my circle of friends who tried and came up empty-handed, both below median. So it's true that it doesn't ""guarantee"" anything, though the odds are definitely in your favor if you're flexible, open-minded and ready to hustle, because at the end of the day, many firms want to hire you on the strength of your school name alone.

There are also lots of other opportunities: the doors fly open for judicial externships, internships with Federal agencies, etc. I get tons of access to attorneys: they want to recruit at school, so all year there are firm-sponsored events where you can go pick an attorney's brain. Just today I called someone I met at an event like that and chatted with them for an hour about what term-time externship made the most sense for my long-term career goals. I only knew this person because their big prestigious firm thought it was worthwhile to have them spend several hours a year meeting with students and talking with them throughout 1L.

**Transferring**

Do not pick a school with the intention of transferring. There is a 90-95% chance you will never get the opportunity to transfer, and even if you do get the opportunity, there is a small chance that transferring is actually worth it (T2-&gt;T14 is generally considered worth it, but if it's just 10-20 spots, it probably is not). I highly recommend checking out TLS for transfer advice."

My GF and I (I'm 27 shes 25) have been dating for the last 6 years. Honestly I was planning moving in with her as soon as she graduated and settled into her job and possibly proposing to her soon after. She just got a job as a middle school Spanish teacher.

We both still live at home for different reasons... I am currently working an internship that is part time and doesn't pay too great. 

Anyways...

She called me up out of the blue last week and told me - in so many words - that shes not sure if she wants to be with me forever. Now that shes done with her job search, her personal life is the next thing she needs to focus on, and it scares her to think about settling down (she is a very fickle girl, it takes her forever just to figure out what to eat for dinner).

She is very conflicted about this whole thing, and is going to talk to a therapist as to why she feels like this. But in the meantime, she wants both of us to see other people and figure out if this is what we both really want. I'm not sure how long she means, my interpretation was a few months, but she could mean years for all I know. 

Reddit, I really love this girl and I want to grow old with her. Should I wait around and hold out hope that she will come around? Or should I move on with my life and worry about myself? 

TL;DR - GF wants a break after 6 years because shes unsure if she wants to spend the rest of her life with me.

I am a third year student studying Computer Engineering.  I am currently doing a software co-op (paid internship) at a manufacturing company.  Since they are a manufacturing company and don't know much about software, they pretty much came up with some projects for me pretty much based on the fact that they have to do with computers.

Cutting to the chase, they want me to write a mobile version of their website (which was created by an outside web developer company).  What we're looking to create is something simple and tabular based.  For example, we like the layout of sites like [The Owl House](http://www.owlhouserochester.com) and [Rock Ventures](http://rockventures.net) (obviously you'll need to be on a mobile device to see the website layouts I am talking about).  

What I'm basically looking for is how to get started.  I have no problem teaching myself by Googling everything, but I've been trying to do that for a while with not much luck, and I feel that it might be because I'm not searching for the right terms.  Anyways, can you guys help me out with a couple quick questions?

* What search terms can I look up to learn how to write a tab-based mobile site like the ones above?
* What languages should I be looking to write this code in?
* When finished, how do I make it so that the mobile site is viewed when accessed from a mobile device (not the regular website)?

Patrick is rocking solo in the studio today, taking your calls and taking care of business. He talks about his current situation, shirt orders, Overdose, interns, donations and more. But don’t think that means there isn’t any funny. Patrick talks about getting a case of juice sent to him by a listener, and he single-handedly redesigns the NFL and professional football as we know it, including new team names and random team assignment. It’s going to be amazing. There’s also a rant on women and a story about a weirdo teacher in Los Angeles. The last part of the show is pretty much Patrick calling out delusional people, like the guys who does that Independent Podcast Awards shit.

p8swy,0,2012-02-02,Reddit I have been having various issues with a manager at work that seem to be getting worse and worse. Do I complain? Sit back and take it? HELP PLEASE!!,zomgitsagirl,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/p8swy/reddit_i_have_been_having_various_issues_with_a/,"First off, sorry this is so long, and kind of thrown together. I tend to rage write so it may not be the most organized train of thought.

So I currently work retail at a clothing store, and it's the only income I have. I just got an internship with another company so it's unpaid, but I'm still going to be keeping this job for weekends simply because, well, I need an income. Over the past 5 months, I've been noticing that one of the managers (the hiring/scheduling manager) has been doing a LOT of shady things.

The first instance was when this manager hired about 30 new employees, and then dramatically cut everyone's hours (including mine). This was only slightly irritating, until they started requesting us to stay late, until 12AM, for closing and cleaning the store. I understand closing is a part of every retail store, but we close at 6, and cleaning the walls and floors were most definitely NOT part of the job description. By the way my job title is cashier/sales, and my coworkers are all either the same as me, just sales, or backstock (the job descriptions are what you would expect from these titles.)
So to make matters worse, the manager went ahead and had a few of my coworkers repaint the entire store, which first of all seems fairly illegal, as I'm pretty sure there's a law about big businesses hiring from the painters Union and not exploiting your employees. The manager had them working from 12PM (a normal in-store shift) to 12AM, and did not pay them overtime or any extra for their work. Shitty, right?

Since this didn't directly involve me it was only upsetting in passing, but then the manager decided to paint in the morning, during store hours, and not have any fans running. They had the front door open (it is a LARGE open store with lots of little alcoves and corner rooms), but that hardly did anything. Co-workers and customers were all complaining about the smell, and for those of us who worked the whole day there, we began to get headaches and feel light headed. One of my co-workers has asthma, and had to excuse herself to go outside and breathe fresh air every 10 minutes or so because it was affecting her so much. There was NO sympathy from the manager that orchestrated this because since their office was in the back, they chose to ignore the death zone of fumes that was our entire store.

My final straw is that due to slow business my hours were cut to 3 days a week instead of the usual 5. Kinda sucky, but it also gave me more time to find a career based job and what not. So I requested 2 days off because I am going out of town on those days. I wrote that in my explanation of why I needed those days off, and sent it in timely. I figured it was easy enough to work around considering I was only working 3 days, but NOPE. I get my schedule for this week and it says I am only working only 2 days this week, not the usual 3. Those days are the VERY 2 days I requested off. Seems pretty intentional to me. 

The other part to this that makes me even more angry is that we recently had to sign this attendance policy, and it states in the first paragraph of the policy that the next weeks schedule MUST be available to each employee by noon on Thursdays... I received my schedule at 10PM tonight (Thursday February 2), which is earlier then I had been receiving it before this. Last week and the week before my schedule was made available to me Friday morning. This wouldn't be an issue if their work weeks didn't begin on Sunday, meaning you can't actually plan your weekend until it IS the weekend. 


Now, I've been looking around at other retail jobs around town because this has turned into a nightmare fast, but no one else seems to be hiring so I'm starting to feel like I'm stuck here. My question is, what do I do? I'm a pretty damn good employee, I'm top 3 in opening the most company credit cards, I always come in when they call and need me last minute, when they have me working shipment I always bring in coffee for everyone, and I do my job pretty damn well. But I've been sucking it up for 5 months now, watching all of these things happen, and now I'm starting to feel like I'm going to flip a table over in anger because it's clearly getting worse, and this manager NEEDS to be fired. Everything that has gone wrong has been at her hand. Do I complain? Or wait for someone else to complain ? AUGH help please !! &gt;.&lt;"

I'm a recent college grad who went to school for computer science (mostly programming C++, Java, Python).  I picked up some HTML in my free time, but I've never really ""Done"" web-design.  I have a couple years experience as a graphic design intern, mostly doing flyers and promotional stuff.  I created a website in iWeb, which turned out pretty good, but it was mostly drag and drop, coding optional for improvement (which I did little bit of).  My new boss dropped a bomb on me this evening by telling me that I'm going to be in charge of our website (our company is approximately 2,500 employees, and we're kind of a big deal).  We've got a vendor doing it right now, but they're failing miserably.  I know I can wade my way through it, and pick things up as I go, but it's a bit of a daunting task to replace an outsourced vending team whose job is strictly to create and moderate websites, and take the whole task on myself.  From what I know, I (even with my limited web-design knowledge) am by far the most appropriate candidate for the job without hiring in new people, which doesn't sound like an option.  Do you have any suggestions???"

They've found me a position to work in IT at a Hospital and a few others that weren't specifically specified but I'm trying to figure out what would be the optimum choice. I'm pretty sure a tech company would probably be the best, though they don't seem to be having any luck with that in my city.

A lot of people requested I give an update on this, so here it goes.

First of all **thank you** to everyone who gave advice. Especially to people who are themselves disabled or work with people with disabilities. I learned a lot I never knew about what everyday life is like for people in situations I could hardly imagine. I wish this stuff was common knowledge so everyone would understand more about the challenges people have to face.

Now for the update: It's been just over a month and it's going great! We set him up with self-paced learning materials about programming, and he's blowing through them at record pace. He's a very bright and motivated kid. It's been a pleasure having him around the office, and so far, it's not been very different from how I'd imagine any other 16 year old intern would be. While he's still a shy guy, he's coming out of his shell a bit more. I've checked in with him a few times to see how he's finding it, and he said he's really enjoying working with us. I've seen him smile a lot. We've managed to arrange it so he always has some people around if he needs help, but everyone involved has still been able to focus on their own work, so it's working out for our employees as well. I have high hopes that after a while longer we'll be able to have him start doing some paid work using the skills he's learning now. 

Thanks again to everyone who gave constructive comments last time. And to all the naysayers that said it would never work out and we shouldn't give him this chance, take that! :p "
pa2yz,5,2012-02-03,Why shouldn't I do it?,smibly,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pa2yz/why_shouldnt_i_do_it/,"24 year old guy here with one pathetic story to tell and wondering why a worthless, pathetic loser like me shouldn't just kill myself.

As far back as I can remember my life has been nothing but constant, neverending misery.  I've never enjoyed doing anything and actually hated doing everything except zoning out and numbing out.  I've taken up numerous hobbies only to give them up after the misery of forcing myself to do them over and over again got to be too much.**TL;DR** I don't enjoy anything in life

I'm also prone to alcoholism and drug addiction.  I used to use it as a way to escape and numb myself but stopped after it stopped working.  I actually don't know anyone who could get me anything harder than weed.  I usually could only get weed because I would let the person who hooked me up take a nug for themselves.  I can't even do that anymore because I don't have the money for it anymore**TL;DR** Used to escape my misery with drugs and drinking until it stopped working

I have no friends and no one likes me because my misery is like a contagious disease that spreads to everyone else like ebola.  I've also never had a girlfriend (though I'm not a virgin nothing ever came out of any of it) for the same reason.  I am the definition of a forever alone.  When I try to talk to people they just want to get away from me.  My calls and texts aren't responded to and I always get the ""I'll get back to you later"" treatment.  No one ever really gets back to me. **TL;DR** no social life

Actually I used to think I did have friends I hung out with.  It turns out that I was just the runt (lowest rung) of the group and they just put up with me when it was convenient.  They never did invite me to anything and always kept me out of the loop. **TL;DR** people who I thought were friends sucked.

Getting back to never having had a girlfriend.  Everything falls apart very fast when I try to get one.  Some can show some interest in me until I open my mouth and start talking to them.  The loneliness and confidence shattering rejection has turned me into a complete creep.  I'm the guy who will repeatedly, over months, stare at a girl from a distance with the desperate, intense, empty and miserable look of a stalker; then pretend like I'm not doing it by trying to look away when she notices.  I can't talk to them because I'm pretty sure they won't like me.  I've done this so many times with so many girls and they quite frankly think I'm a creep.  I realized that I am a creep when I felt the temptation to sometimes stalk and rape girls out of desperation; though I've never followed through on it for fear of having a restraining order put on me or being sent to prison.  **TL;DR** never had a girlfriend, desperation turns me into a creep

On another note I remember when I was 13 one of my 'friends' who lived in my neighborhood at the time got frustrated at me for being dense and not being able to pick up on subtle, implied cues when talking to other people, especially girls.  He said that he put up with it for years but it was getting really frustrating, especially with girls.  He's now really smooth with girls and also has a much better life than me overall.  Also, just to get an idea of how much of a social runt I am I'll say this. I'm a year older than him and at the time I was considerably bigger, stronger and more physically developed. He still had the leadership role over me and I couldn't get an edge on him when I tried to; he would always put me in my loser place. TL;DR friends ditch me for being worthless

I went to college and studied engineering at a top 10 school because I thought it would be something where even someone who sucks as much as me would be able to get a job and be independent.  I thought so much about changing but had no idea what to change to and knew that my prospects would be worse just about anywhere else except computer science.  Well, I graduated without ever being able to get an internship and can't get a job .  I also can't go to grad school because my grades weren't good enough.  That was because the material made me so miserable that I couldn't put a solid effort into it.  Now my grades aren't good enough and my professors thought I was just lazy (typified by one yelling at me and calling me lazy after I asked him a question in office hours). **TL;DR** Did bad in college

After High School things were supposed to get better.  They might have for others but they sure didn't for me.  Obviously I never had anything close to the experience show in in movies like Animal House or Old School.  I also hated school as far back as I can remember, even elementary school. **TL;DR** I hated my time in college and it was miserable

I still live with my parents and can't get a job and couldn't get an  internship in school because, during the job interview, they could always sense that something was wrong with me no matter how much I try to put on a positive face.  I can't just be myself because that obviously won't work.  btw. this also holds true for jobs like stocking shelves at walmart.  They want someone, just not me.  This was also true before all of the crashes back when the economy was good.  I've been unemployed and living with my parents for over a year now. **TL;DR** I can't get a job and live with parents

I've tried doing other things too.  Extracurriculars, volunteering, the occupy protests, etc.  The people there didn't want me around either.  I could tell because they always acted differently(awkward) when I joined a conversation and left me out of things.  They would keep me out of the loop and not invite me to anything either.  The thing that was the worst was when they gave me recommendations of other places to go, basically they were trying to make me someone else's problem. **TL;DR** more people didn't want me around

I even said I was going to do it once.  I posted a message on facebook asking if anyone had any last things to say to me that were important.  All I got was a bunch of crap saying 'don't do it' without a good reason not to before a bunch of cops stormed in and took my shotgun away.  These were the same people who treated me as I said above.  The same people who hurt me and let me be miserable and then they all the sudden pretended to give a shit.  No one contacted me after to even ask if I was ok.  I've also thought about doing it since I was 15, quite frankly I don't see any reason why I'm better off now not having done it then.  It's like when people treat their grandparents like shit, put them in a home and never visit them; then act all sad when they die. **TL;DR** thought about it for a long time, tried it, no one was genuine.

I've been to a slew of shrinks and have been on just about every antidepressant on the market.  None of that helps and the shrinks can't do anything for me.  It's bad because people have told me to get professional help even though they can't do anything for me.**TL;DR** Tried therapy multiple times, it didn't work

So I ask.  As a miserable bastard who hates everything he does, trapped in lethargy, has no friends, nothing but failure after failure, intense, crushing lonliness, just not being able to honestly feel like a man, and more.  Why shouldn't I just kill myself and end it all like a pathetic loser?

At this point the thread has [spiraled out of control](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/p9a1v/im_woody_harrelson_ama/) with Harrelson's comments being downvoted to oblivion. You can see the answers he DID give [here](http://www.reddit.com/user/iamwoodyharrelson) (and hit context to get the question).

There is also a circlejerk-type [request thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/p9u8t/ama_request_the_intern_who_suggested_woody_should/) looking for the intern who came up with the idea in the first place.

This has obviously not helped the movie at all. Many people are commenting that they will boycott the movie and Harrelson in general. My question is whether or not this will curb the influx of celebrity AMAs, for better or worst.

To be fair, these AMAs were giving a lot of attention to Reddit from other sites who linked to them. I would be very curious to see the traffic stats to these celebrity AMAs from outside links.

I personally think the celebrity AMAs are hit or miss, depending on whether or not the celebrity ""understands"" Reddit and the internet in general. Harrelson obviously did not. It is given that most celebrities that come to Reddit are promoting a movie or show. Does this mean that a celebrity cannot make an AMAAM (ask me anything about movie) without getting into possibly offensive questions? I ask this because the first question that Harrelson answers, and what possibly started the downturn, was a Redditor accusing him of taking a [friend's virginity without calling afterward.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/p9a1v/im_woody_harrelson_ama/c3nlalf?context=3). 

Anyways, very interesting stuff.

I'm active in a club called AIESEC and I just want you know about a pretty sick deal for students and recent graduates (within 2 years of graduation). AIESEC is the largest student-run organization in the world, with over 60,000 members in over 110 countries around the globe. We provide cultural exchange in the form of internships; varying from technology, business, volunteering, and teaching. These internships range anywhere from 6 weeks to 78 weeks, and there are practically infinite opportunities for exchange. In the case of volunteering and teaching internships, interning with AIESEC is a great alternative to studying abroad for students who do not have the time in their schedule to accommodate taking a semester off, as it is very easy to find summer internships in these categories. For technology and management, it is recommended that the applicant is willing to spend at least 20 weeks abroad (usually with a semester off or post-graduation), however, this is not always the case. We will be hosting information sessions on the U of I campus in Wohler's Hall, room 226, on February 21st-23rd from 7-8 pm for the opportunity to go abroad through AIESEC. It is not necessary to be a member of AIESEC to go abroad with us. 

If you could please share this information with your fellow classmates, we would greatly appreciate it!

Specifically, I'm a team leader in sending students into technological internships, so if any engineering or computer science students are interested, feel free to contact me here or in my inbox!

pbwus,10,2012-02-05,Go-To guide to breaking into the industry. ,DLDude,Themepark,https://www.reddit.com/r/Themepark/comments/pbwus/goto_guide_to_breaking_into_the_industry/,"Hey all! I realize some of you might be interested in working in the industry as you go to and work through college. The industry is a very small, but very tight knit group of people and it's surprising how quickly you can get to know some very important people. I wanted to share my experience in how I and my friends got in. 

In 2007 a good friend and I started a group called the Theme Park Engineering Group at Ohio State (http://themeparkeng.org.ohio-state.edu/). There had never been a group like this before. That November, 3 of us went down to IAAPA (the amusement park convention in Orlando) and gave out business cards. Not for ourselves, but for the group. I think it really turned heads that we were a group dedicated to theme park engineering. We began to work on our own design projects. We designed and built a working 10ft steel version of an S&amp;S power tower. The more we did, the more people seemed to notice. 

Our first big break was when CoasterDynamix (a toy roller coaster company) came to us to work on a new product they didn't have time to develop themselves. Of course, one of the owners of CoasterDynamix also is a partner in The Gravity Group. It wasn't long before we knew most of the people at the Gravity Group. Those guys also know most of the guys at Great Coasters International. Within 2 years we were on a first-name basis with all of them. 

Throughout all of this, we kept going to IAAPA. We made special Theme Park Engineering Group Polos so that we looked together and professional. We met many people in the industry. Roller Coaster engineers, themed attraction engineers, etc etc. We talked to everyone we could. 

The thing about the amusement industry is that a lot of 'geeks', or 'foamers' try to get jobs at the major companies. Companies don't want to hire someone who idolizes the people they would be working with. They want to hire people that are passionate, yet highly professional. Having the Theme Park Engineering Group name behind us gave us that legitimacy. Due to this, we've had quite a bit of success getting into the industry. 

Here is our track record (so far)

I work full time for CoasterDynamix now as a design engineer

The other founder now works full time at Universal Creative

One had an internship last summer with Universal Creative

We've had 2 people intern at Great Coasters International

One guy works full time at The Gravity Group

One guy just got a job at Disney Engineering

Another worked for a whole year (an internship of sorts, but NOT the college program) with Disney Engineering

A girl worked had a 2-year part-time internship with Roto Studio (they do themed designs)

The point is, if you have a level of professionalism, desire, and talent, the industry really isn't as hard to break into as you may think. Sure, you won't be designing coasters your first year out of school, but you can still land REALLY fun jobs. 

There have been a couple colleges that have created Theme Park Engineering Groups that mirror ours at Ohio State. I know Penn State has a fairly developed group. My suggestion if you are in college or are about to go, find one of these groups or start your own. You can contact the Ohio State group if you have any questions while setting it up. 

Just an FYI: If I had to say what the MOST important things to do if you want to get into the industry are, i would say:
#1. Go to IAAPA and be PROFESSIONAL. Have business cards, get business cards. I don't suggest bringing a resume. Contact them later to talk about job opportunities. 
#2. Join or start a theme-park related group. It puts you ahead of many of the people who just randomly send resumes to companies. 

If anyone has any questions, feel free to ask. I've got lots of fun stories over the past 5 years. "

I'm currently in my junior year in college and have accepted an offer with a big 4 firm to participate in their 8 week summer intern program this coming June. At first, I was ecstatic knowing that it's a pretty safe bet that I'll have a full time offer coming out of college and I get to go to freakin Folrida and get paid for it! As I started asking staff what the job was like, I got pretty standard responses ""It's great, I learn something new every day!"". The responses are totally different than what I have read on some accounting forums which sound more like they're being tortured every day. What really concerned me was when I talked to my friend's cousin, who is currently very successful in industry, and she had said that she was cussed out by her manager on the first day as full time staff and every day was a struggle. She left after 2 years.

So my question is, what is it really like working for the big 4? Am I going to be miserable for the rest of my public accounting career? (I'm going assurance in the bay area if this is relevant)

Also it would be great if I could get someone with a lot of experience with big 4 to PM me for an AMA.

I cannot be without her, having panic attacks that we grow apart, the fear is taking a big part of me. We can trust eachother, because we are no cheaters, but that’s not the point.

More and more I communicate in a way that is repulsive, pushing her away, while I don’t want that. I cry alot lately, because I miss her. The times that we are together, how rare even, are wonderful.

We have plans to live together, but it has tremendous financial consequences for the both of us. In this country, Belgium, they take away alot from you when you move in with eachother. Taxes go way up, childsupport (she has children) goes alot down and since I am at school, the state will cut down on my income too.

I started drinking again (but I quit already) up to a point where signs of depression came about. That was the moment I decided to quit. When I drink, I also get nasty in my words. I do not want that.

I wish I could overcome all that crap, move in with her an grow old with her. She is my true woman, never had any better, believe me. When I don’t see, hold, smell, hear and so her, it feels just the same as being lovesick. Like when it is just broken up.

I’m crying while typing this and just want some advice from people who are in the same situation. Maybe I can learn something from that. Please do not wreck my soul, my heart feels broken already."
pbiav,0,2012-02-04,At a loss... Graduate student woes.,Duplais,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/pbiav/at_a_loss_graduate_student_woes/,"Background:

I recently finished my BA degree in Computer Information Systems, but instead of feeling excited and giddy of my accomplishment (first in the family to even go beyond HS) I'm so discouraged and somewhat down.

Granted that my school wasn't so primarily focused on the tech side of the CIS program (more business) but it has a good reputation.  With an AAS and BBA under my belt, the past couple of weeks have been miserable.  

I'm currently an intern in a consulting company; granted my duties are not so tech focused but I'll help around when the SA is busy with *real* work (how I hate when my co-workers feel that he doesn't do shit).  I'll help senior management if let's say the printer ""broke"" or have issues with our CRM system, basically putting out the fires.  My previous position in my school was the same thing but more hectic and more users (300 computer lab). 

My issue right now I have been unable to land a simple help desk job and has been pretty frigging discouraging.  I don't have the experience that most employers are looking for (Active Directory, Exchange Server, Networking) but always received a compliment on what a great personality I have and always have a bright attitude when an end user gets uptight.  

Right now I'm just reading as much as I can from certification guides on Active Directory 2008 R2; Group Policy; CCNA (although very interested learning from the CCNA books I picked up than Microsoft) A+ even though it seems so basic. I've been fiddling around with Microsoft Server 2008 R2 with Virtual Box but seems like everyone is talking about Virtualization that I should switch over to VMware to get used to its features.

So this is the part when I ask this specific crowd with any tips, suggestions in your experience when you first started and when was the moment you achieved to kickstart your career.  I've been reading the SysAdmin thread for about 3 weeks now and it provided so much information that it gets me giddy to learn new topics I never came across with.  Maybe my enthusiasm will triumph my cruddy luck in landing a new position.  Thank you in advance if you managed to read this far.

**tl;dr** Kid just graduated from college but having a cruddy time landing a help desk position.  Tips or suggestions to work on i.e. home labs, certifications, etc...

I've always been a good student, I've got lots of AP credit, and scored very well on the math part of the SAT. But honestly, I majored in business because I didn't know what to do, and it seemed like a somewhat easier major. I'm not sure if I'm too enthused about the job options in the field and the cocky, macho culture that permeates these business types (in all honesty). I feel like many Kelley students run into feelings like these halfway through school, but have shunned traditional classes for too long to switch. I'm feeling crazy enough to ditch everything and go down a different path.

Well I've always loved computers, and I'm thinking about switching majors to CS. It would definitely add some time to my college career, but I've had a scholarship so far, and honestly don't mind being in school a little longer (even if I have to take on some debt). Finance is alright, and the job prospects are probably decent, but I'd rather do something I really like the rest of my life than something that's.. well... meh. This would be a big change in my life, that I've arrived at after a long heart to heart with my parents and girlfriend. So I figured I'd come to Reddit to get some practical advice. BA vs BS, job prospects, whether I'm full of shit, difficulty, different career paths, etc. And anything about the IU comp sci program specifically is appreciated. Feel free to drop a bomb on me and hit me with any practical advice about a CS major. Thanks in advance :)"

I am a long time lurker here on r/atheism, and thought you guys might find my story interesting. Its a personal account that supports my views on how the church preys on the young, poor, and less intelligent people in our society in order to increase their numbers, and thus, their wallets. As I re-read this vastly cut down story, I realized how much it relates to the definition of the word ""cult"" instead of the word ""christianity."" Before you read this, know that I still love every member of my family dearly despite their role in what happened to my brother. The Christian faith is what they believe in, and theres nothing I can say that will change their faith. 

I grew up with 2 younger brothers, and 2 very loving parents. We were brought up going to church every day, however, we all did what most kids did during church and drew stick figure battles on the bulletins the whole time. We'll call my 2 brothers Bobby and Danny. Bobby is 2 years younger, and Danny is 7 years younger. We had the greatest childhood any kid could ask for. Our father spoiled us with all the coolest nerf guns, our bedtime was much later than any other kid in the neighborhoods, and when N64 came out, we were the first on the block to have it. My father was a successful business owner, and my mother was the stay-at-home mom who gave all of his money to the church. As I got older, I realized what was happening and approached my dad about it, however, she had the ball and chain so tightly wound there was almost nothing I could say to fix the problem. 

I had been in college for 2 years at this point, and was having the time of my life. My mother (the religious fanatic) was upset with me for choosing a public university, however, I told her again and again I chose the school because it had one of the top 5 business schools in America. I was getting straight A's, got a fantastic internship in NYC, and things couldn't have gone any better. Bobby was looking into going to the same school as me, however, once the time to choose schools rolled around he was extremely nervous about getting in. 

Bobby was never the smartest kid in school, however, had the biggest heart in the world. He was the most free spirit of anyone I ever knew. His grades in high school limited his options for college, and my mother decided to practically force him to go to a Christian school in Florida. She used the state of Florida to lure him into schussing a Christian University, since he loved warm weather, the beach, golfing, and everything that state has to offer. He was there for a year, and called me every month to tell me how much he hated it. He told me the people were too religious, and tried to force him into doing things he didn't want to. I called my parents and told them to get him out of there, and that he wasn't happy. My father agreed with me, however, the influence my mother had on him made him useless in helping my aid my little brother. She thought that it wasn't Christianity that was the problem (obviously) but it was his attitude and that the Satan was trying to influence his life. Anytime any of us had a problem, my mother always said to pray about it and read the Bible to us. I told her repeatedly how ineffective this was, and after a number of years finally quit asking my mother for any help regarding emotional issues. Bobby told me he was going to tough it out the rest of the year, then look into transferring without the help of my mother. I encouraged him to do this, however, one day everything changed out of the blue.

It was now my senior year in college, and I had already been offered a position at a top financial firm in NYC. I was so concerned with my own life that I neglected to check up on Bobby a few times a day, but we still talked weekly, and he told me he liked it now at his school and wanted to stay. I asked him if he was sure about this and he assured me he was happy. I assumed that he found some friends that weren't crazy bible pushers, but couldn't have been more wrong. This is where it all gets weird…

I went home for Christmas break and Bobby was not the same person at all. Instead of playing Halo with me and Danny downstairs, he was upstairs reading the Bible. We tried to get him to hang with us, but all he wanted to do was to pray and read the Bible. He no longer was wild and funny like he used to be, all his friends noticed and thought he was brainwashed, and it seemed all his former goals of playing professional soccer and majoring in physical therapy went out the window. I went to my parents and said there was something wrong with Bobby, and he needed to leave that school immediately. My mother, infuriated with me, told me that I was the problem and Bobby was happy. She told me I was the one who had a problem and that it was because I didn't commit my life to God like Bobby has. 

I tried to talk to Bobby numerous times following Christmas break and convince him he was being brainwashed, and that he needed to leave that university immediately. I tried to show him how different he was, and prove to him that the church took advantage of him during a hard time in his life when he was unhappy. I told him that what he was feeling was a misguided euphoria brought on my mass influence, and that if he hadn't have been around so many religious people at once during that time in his life, he never would have gave in like he did. He didn't listen, and my mother did everything in her power to prove to Bobby how unhappy ""I"" was, and that ""I"" was the one who had all the issues. 

Bobby even tried to tell me how I needed to to give my life to God and that I was the one with the problems. I asked him about the youth group he was in down in Florida and how he originally joined it, and the details made me so angry I wanted to kill someone. The way he was recruited reminded me of hell week when I was pledging my college fraternity. He said he was practically abducted from his room, driven somewhere 15 minutes away, and basically told he needed to give his life to God in order for the fear to go away (Gods grace and mercy or something?). I told him that what he went through was similar to cult activity, and that what they were doing was not the same type of Christianity we grew up with. I made him give me the name of his youth group leader, and called him the next day. I threatened him, and told him to leave my little brother alone. He said he would, but apparently Bobby was still going to the church group, and lied to me and told me he wasn't. 

Fast forward to today (2 years later, since there are so many details and I don't want this thread to be much longer). I am currently working in NYC as an Actuary and love every detail of my life. I am happy, make good money, and have a wonderful girlfriend all against the will of my controlling mother. If you knew how awesome my relationship with Bobby was before he became brainwashed….erghhmm…. a Christian, you might tear up seeing how bad it is now. The only conversations we now have are him trying to convert me to his faith. He is constantly asking me and my parents for money to go on ""mission trips"" to exotic countries to tell people about Jesus. He gave up his dream of playing professional soccer, and now is working towards seminary school. He proposed to a girl he has only known a few months, and for whatever reason she said yes. His personality is dull and completely uncharacteristic of his former self, he refuses to do anything ""ungodly"", and he is the biggest financial leech I have ever seen, constantly giving the money my father sends him for food, books, etc. to his church. I can tell he's not happy, but I feel the grasp these people down in Florida have on him is so strong. It almost seems like a forced happiness, and I feel powerless to help being so many states away and him being so far gone. If I had the means to cut him off financially, I would, but sadly I am not in that position. I begged my father to stop paying for his college and to get him out of there, but my mother won't let it happen. I feel like we have nothing in common anymore, and hanging out with him now is like hanging out with a stranger.

Danny and I still play xbox live every Sunday night to stay in touch, and we have remained best friends throughout the whole ordeal (I refer to both my brothers as being my best friend). I still love every member of my family, but hate how my mother has encouraged Bobby's mind to be so badly manipulated. She knew he wasn't the smartest kid to begin with, and I think inadvertently used that to set one of her sons down the path she would be proud of as a Jesus freak. Everything that made Bobby my brother is gone. I understand that people change as they grow up, but this is different.  

Christianity stole my little brother, and my best friend.

pdsli,5,2012-02-06,hair drug test: shaving my ENTire body,throwawaydt444333444,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/pdsli/hair_drug_test_shaving_my_entire_body/,"hey everyone! I wanted to get r/trees input on my hair test strategy, and maybe clear up some of the facts about hair tests and how to beat these damn things. For some background, I've failed a hair test before. I tried using two bottles of the ""miracle shampoo"" from the local head shop, one the night before and one right before the test. When I complained the guy at the head shop said it was my fault because I used it twice and was only supposed to use it once. Whatever. Anyways, I don't smoke much anymore, but did do quite a bit during vacation the week before new years and again during a week in the middle of January. I was also in a room with a lot of smokers this last weekend and felt a bit of a contact high.

I'm beginning the process of applying for jobs, I will graduate with a masters degree in July and my current internship is set to end in June. I've begun sending out applications and already have one company flying me out of state for an interview next week. Question about the process:

*can I safely assume I won't have to submit to a hair test until I accept an offer? like the company that is flying me out next week, they understand I wouldn't be starting until July at the latest, so they wouldn't take me into a lab and test me right after an interview, would they? could they? And I would have every right to stall and say I'm still evaluating other offers, right?

Here is my strategy right now:

*Today, I shaved all of my body hair. I will do this again about a month from today.

*I shave my head on a weekly basis anyway, and will continue doing this until I have a test date set, when I might let it grow out the required 1.5 inches or whatever.

*I'm pretty skinny but have noticed a fair amount of 'winter weight' on my belly. I was going to try to break a sweat running or biking at least 3 times a week beginning now.....I know this is where the THC is stored, so i figured it would help me pass a test and, you know, get healthy and shit.

What do you guys think? The consensus seems to be that these things go back 3 months, but I've heard longer. I'm over the shampoo...any other ideas that would help me feel more confident?"
pds5c,23,2012-02-06,Am I the only one who is beginning to feel like college is a scam?,WreckweeM,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/pds5c/am_i_the_only_one_who_is_beginning_to_feel_like/,"I'm a junior at a well-ranked state school currently majoring in economics, and after five semesters of education, I feel like the only thing I have learned is that I'm wasting my time and my parent's money. I spent a large part of my childhood listening to people tell me that I am never going to use anything I learn in college in real life, and every time I heard this statement I would ask myself: ""why go, then?"". I always chalked it up to the adult either lying, or not understanding the importance of a college education. And yet, now that I am here, I cannot find the importance that I once was so sure existed.

I suppose the scenario is different for education majors (who need to learn how to properly teach) or for nursing/med majors (who need to learn how to properly save lives), or for law students, or basically any major that is designed for people who are absolutely going into that profession, but for someone like me, who is still completely unsure of which career I want to pursue, I'm not seeing the benefit of the degree.

I'm aware a degree is necessary to get a well-paying job once I'm out of school, but I find that idea laughable. I can honestly say that there is not a single job out there that I am currently more qualified for than I was graduating high school, and I am having severe difficulty in naming a single job that I will be more qualified for once I graduate than I am now. 

With learning being set to such a vigorous pace, how can anyone expect me to retain everything I have learned? I, like most college students I'm sure, have a tendency to forget everything I learned in a class before at the start of a new semester in order to focus entirely on all the new work that will need to get done.

Say I have a job offer lined up immediately following graduation: what would make me more qualified for that job? A college degree? Or four-years experience at said job, or any other job in the same career-market? 

Let's talk about the money. Oh yes, the money. Again, I'm sure I don't need to explain the reality that graduates are getting their degrees, have been completely unable to find any jobs at all, and yet this does not mitigate the insane mass of debt they have. Someone who worked their ass off for four years has more experience, and zero debt. This debt is even greater if they went to grad school. And let's not forget about those who didn't get it right on the first try: students who decided to change their majors. Extra classes, extra semesters, even more money, and if you didn't realize until after your sophomore year that you're in the wrong major, you're FUCKED. Your choices are now: Enjoy being a super, super, super senior with an insane amount of debt, or enjoy a degree that is now literally useless to you.

Then we have textbooks: books so overpriced that these publishers must have profit margins so massive they look like insurance companies. I was forced to pay one hundred and fifty dollars last year for a textbook that was A STACK OF FUCKING LOOSE-LEAF PAPERS. Of course they had no binding, so you can't sell it back. You have to go online, where no one is going to pay you even a fraction of that for something that you can literally obtain with a copy of the papers and a copy machine (you could even use the automatic feeder since there's no binding).

The only thing I actually feel like I am paying for is the professor's time, and even at that most professors follow the textbook. So why can't I just buy the textbook and forget about the professor (most will make you read it anyway). The only, and I mean only, time I feel like my money has not been wasted is when I have a good professor who can actually make me feel like I learned more with his guidance than I could on my own (this has been a very rare experience).

To be honest, I'm not really sure what the point I'm trying to make it. All I know is that I can't shake this feeling that everything I'm going through is just so, so wrong. I feel like I'm paying insane amounts of money just for a piece of paper that gives me the privilege of working a higher-paying job that someone with the same level of intelligence and no education could work just as well. 

Colleges do provide internship opportunities, I suppose, but this drops me right back to the point that you're paying money only for the privilege of working a higher-paying job. By selecting interns from a college pool, you are eliminating that opportunity from other non-college students, even if that person is more intelligent and more qualified for the job.

I suppose that having a degree proves that you are a hard worker, but so does working hard. A powerful job experience list is just as handy on a resume as a college degree is. 

My final question essentially is: Asides from everything that I named already, why is a college degree even worth getting? Right now it seems that in the choice between go to work and go to college, I made the wrong choice.

TL;DR - If you didn't read what I had say, why should I give a fuck about what you have to say?

EDIT - Spelling, Grammar....I'm no poet.

pdrbz,3,2012-02-06,hair test plan: shaving my ENTire body,throwawaydt22222,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/pdrbz/hair_test_plan_shaving_my_entire_body/,"hey everyone, I wanted to get some advice from r/trees on my plan for passing hair drug tests. I've actually failed a hair test before and was hoping my situation could help get some of the facts straight and get a solid plan heading into a test. I currently intern at a pretty big/ well known company and graduate with a masters degree in July. I'm not a big smoker anymore, but I smoked a fair amount during the week before new years and again during a week in the middle of January. I was also in a room this last weekend with a lot of people smoking and honestly felt a little bit of a contact high. I'm beginning the process of applying for jobs after I graduate, and already have one interview next week- 

*Granted that my current internship ends in June and my graduation won't occur until July, I'm wondering if I can safely assume I wouldn't be asked to take a test before June? 
*Also, since I'm applying for a few different jobs and will hopefully be able to evaluate several different offers, can I assume that I wouldn't be asked to take a test before I actually accepted an offer?

I had a bad experience with the 'miracle shampoo' stuff when I failed before.....I went crazy and bought two bottles, used one the night before and one the day of the test and still failed. When I complained to the head shop that I still failed the test, they said it was my fault because you're only supposed to use one of the bottles before the test (whatever). So my strategy now is this:

*shaved all of my body hair today and will do the same thing a month from today (not much arm/leg hair to begin with so doesn't look conspicuous)
*since I'm a guy and already shave my head once a week anyway, I will continue this, maybe until I get an actual test date then let it grow out a little. 

I've also noticed myself putting on some ""winter-weight"" (I've always been pretty skinny) around the belly and understand these fatty areas are where your body stores thc. I was also going to try to break a solid sweat at least 3 times a week on the stationary bike just to trim down on the fat (and...you know....be healthy and shit).

So what do you think? Consensus seems to be 3 months and your good but I've heard longer....any other tips going into this summer (besides not smoking) that would make me more confident against the evil testing labs?

I only need 5 classes to graduate, which i currently have setup for this semester. But the thing is they are all upper level compsci.  Part of me wants to graduate and move on, but at the same time, ive never taken more than 3 Compsci at a time.  I also dont want to mess up my gpa even more than i have. Its been slowly declining to around a 2.7

If i split, i could potentially do better and be more dedicated. On top of getting another internship in the summer/fall.

Of course part of me is lazy and scared of graduating. Which is why i need some unbiased input.

In case youre wondering, i would be taking these classes:

How do I get her out? ,jesuscamp22,atheism,https://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/pdhro/help_my_little_sister_22_is_locked_up_at_a/,"My younger sister has been enrolled in a faith-based psychological program for troubled girls and young women for about three years. She is 22 years old, was diagnosed as a teenager with bipolar disorder, and has type-1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes -- her extremely poor management of which initially compelled my parents to send her to this place, because the doctor/entrepeneuer who owns it also has a daughter with type-1 diabetes and promised specialized care and intervention. They were also compelled by the Christian framework that situates what the place calls its “bio-psycho-socio-spiritual model” of psychological intervention, since they believe that only the healing power of Christ can cure my sister of her penchant for making bad decisions. These decisions include her mistreatment of, or plain disregard for, the insulin therapy she needs to survive; her tendency to get involved in romantic relationships with deadbeat dickheads who treat her poorly and take advantage of her, financially, physically, and emotionally; and the numerous occasions on which she has stolen money from my parents, always in rather clumsy ways, that is, in ways that ensure she will be caught. The original plan, as I understand it, was for my sister to spend the estimated 120-180 days in treatment at this camp in rural Arkansas (at an truly outrageous cost), and then to enroll in a certificate program at a design institute. This was the deal: go through the program, get yourself right, and we (parents) will send you to L.A. to pursue your dreams etc. As I said, this was around three years ago. About nine months ago she finally “graduated” from the seven-step program, but moved on to a low-paying internship at the very same place (and under strict supervision and extremely restricted freedoms) which she held until a few weeks ago. At this point, she was discovered to have been once again skipping her insulin injections, and also she bought some CDs instead of paying for her car insurance, or something, and the psychiatrist in charge of the whole place, and a few other places like it, ordered that she be run through the whole program again, for a second time, complete with regular checks from my parents to the tune of about $6,000 per month. The details of the whole situation are really quite vague. This is the biggest problem. Even when she was on the payroll, she was only allowed to speak on the phone once a week, and even then only to my parents. She could receive letters from approved immediate family (like myself) until this new turn of events, so I am completely cut off from all communication with her. She wrote recently, just before her letter-writing privileges were suspended, and asked if she could come live with me for a while; the answer, of course, was yes, but she will not receive my reply. Technically, there is nothing “keeping” her at this place – in the strictly legal sense of unlawful detention – and supposedly she could sign herself out and walk away at any time. “Walking away” here means literally walking about 10 miles to the closest pay phone, but also walking away from my parents and their money, and from three years of religious indoctrination. My impulse is to drive to Arkansas and go pick her up, but there are major practical constraints here: most importantly, health care (which she will need to survive), and the fact that she has been on some serious head medications like Ziprazidone (an anti-psychotic, also used to treat bipolar disorder) that really need to be gradually suspended.

Now, I could enumerate the hundreds of reasons why I think this whole therapeutic model is terrible and violent and offensive, but the main reason is that it attempts to “treat” troubled people by teaching them how to internalize a repressive, odious religious narrative, all while exploiting gullible dogmatists like my parents who they know will raise no objections because to do so would be to compromise their faith in Jesus. Worst of all, I am fairly certain that, like my parents, these people truly believe that they mean well, and that they are doing a necessary good. So what do I do? What can I do?"

So please any input from people in the netsec field would be appreciated, I am debating going to this expensive private school or the cheaper ASU university. I understand college is what I put into it, I am however willing to pay the extra if the school gives more 1 on 1 time and provides more tools for my education. I understand the school advertises a lot for its gaming program, but the netsec program is apparently an amazing program.

pdal2,0,2012-02-06,Advice Needed!,[deleted],engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/pdal2/advice_needed/,"Hi r/engineering,
I am a 20yo college student in Seattle majoring in engineering who is having trouble with school and I need advice from ppl who know what they are talking about. I want to become a mechanical engineer and I have all the skills and knowledge to do it. My problem is that as a 3rd year college student, I am so bored with school. Not that the stuff isnt interesting, I just find myself thinking of real world applications and getting lost in making stuff work in my head. 
I remember my teacher was talking about having to make a water pump while in Africa without any electricity, and I came up with a better system in 2 second of thinking about it in my head than 3 mechanical engineers did in their two weeks in Africa. 

I am extremely smart and I know I can figure out anything. I get 100 percents on all my tests in math, science, and engineering courses, but I dont get good grades since I forget about the homework or just find it so stupid and excessively long that I dont do it. 

EDIT: I have extensive knowledge in most engineering related topics. I have all the needed math skills, physics skills, I am extremely good with circuits and electronics, and I spend all of my free time with computers, taking them apart, putting them back together, writing programs to do anything from optimize the order of my grocery list to semi-decent animation. 

My counselors are telling me to change majors since I will never make it as an engineer. I am just having a difficult time in school since it is so pointless and putting myself and my parents in excessive debt from loans and all. 

I really need some educated advice on if there are any options for people to succeed in the engineering world without an engineering degree? Are there internships (but no one really gives engineering internships to students with a 3.0 gpa) I can get in order to get a job anywhere?

Sorry about this drag of a post. If you made it this far thank you so much for reading. "

I am a sophomore student in the Game and Graphic Design Program at Northeastern University in Boston. Next year, I hopefully will be participating in the university's co-op internship program at some sort of game development or design company.

So I ask you:

*How can I get in contact with specific companies? Which specific companies have been known to do internships and what types of companies generally offer internships? It may not be realistic, but it would be awesome to work with Irrational or Sucker Punch because I love both of their games.

*What would you suggest for a first time professional experience?

*Anything particular that should be included in my portfolio or resume?

*Any sort of program knowledge or programming knowledge should I have?

*Is there anybody I should talk to about getting these types of jobs?

Thanks!

**EDIT:**

What I can/want to do:

*I'm really interested in doing anything I can with developers.

*I could do writing for the story or create characters

*I have some programming experience so I could also be of use there perhaps or at least be better communicating with a programming team

*I have some web development skills and know my way around the major Adobe Programs such as Illustrator, Photoshop, inDesign and DreamWeaver.

*I'm a graphic designer and have some sense of good visual design

*And any sort of conceptual game design I think I would do well at, just thinking about how things should work, systems and mechanics, etc.

pfdd0,0,2012-02-07,So I write a nasty email every two months to this guy.... ,[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/pfdd0/so_i_write_a_nasty_email_every_two_months_to_this/,"Once every two months, I send out a vile email to a person who used to teach a sophmore level english class at a major university in the South (US).  Sending that email is the highlight of that day for me, and at times of stress, of that week.

The guy wasn't a real professor, just a Teacher's Assistant.  I was doing great, but he failed me because I forgot to put a quote in my paper in quotations; without the """" signs it came across as blatant plagarism.  I begged him to reconsider my honest mistake but nothing came of it.  I was on academic probation already (i had a rare dyslexic condition which doesn't allow me to learn the same way most people do, but i wasn't diagnosed back then..hence the bad grades), and failing this class was the last straw.  The TA never admitted to any wrong doing, while knowing my situation.  I'll never forget the smirk on his face when the dean made his decision (he took his TA's side) and the university booted me out, stripped me of financial aid for a year.

I was holding down two jobs and an unpaid internship at the time, while taking care of my sick father and younger brother.  He passed away soon after I got kicked out and my world went spiralling down.  I became a recluse, alone and felt like a failure for a whole year before I got my act back together.  I went to a local community college.  Got my jobs back, and also started putting my little brother through college.

I am now a distinguished film maker, and had I been weaker in the mind, would have comitted suicide instead.  So I email this guy with the most vile things imaginable ever two months to remind him that his smallest action, due to his ego, could have had a major negative impact on the lives of my baby brother and other family.

Moral, don't be ego centric.  Don't take life too strictly.  If someone makes a small mistake by accident, don't go too hard on them.  But don't let anyone abuse you.  And if they do, make sure you TELL them that.

Questions that have text book definitions that I've memorized over the years but have little to do with my abilities as a programmer, my intelligence, or my work ethic as an employee. So my question is this, why do you ask these sorts of questions *as the only questions of the interview*?  I feel that if I miss a few out of maybe two dozen of these questions, you've learned nothing about me.  You've learned that I have canned answers that are shot off when asked."

peu6x,0,2012-02-07,"Girlfriend broke up with me, I feel like I don't have anyone to talk to now.",[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/peu6x/girlfriend_broke_up_with_me_i_feel_like_i_dont/,"Hey Reddit,

I’m mostly doing this because at the moment, I feel like I dont have any other people to talk to. My girlfriend broke up with me over the weekend and I’m still having a hard time with it (obviously). Prior to all of this everything was going pretty normal for our relationship. Granted we were doing the long distance thing but we’ve been together in a serious relationship for 3+ years. We basically lived together for a year till I moved back home to pursue audio engineering. We seen each other almost at least once a month since I’ve done that whether it be the weekend or over a week long visit. This girl was the girl that I really thought I would marry and spend the rest of my life with.

The week leading up to the Friday that this happened was very different than usual. I knew she had a busy schedule coming up so every time she would blow me off by saying she was “too busy” I didn’t think a lot of it. But it got to the point where I decided to tell her that we would just talk on Friday since it was the end of the week and we both weren’t busy then. Deep down I could feel we were going to have an argument about something.

Friday came along and we finally got to talking and right away I could hear it in her voice, something that was really going to tear me up was about to happen. When the words came out of her mouth of her telling me she wanted to break up and be single for a while, I don’t even know, it was one of the worst feelings I’ve ever felt. 

To turn the next 7 hours that we talked about it short. She basically is doing this because she feels we are going down separate paths. She has always been in honors classes through high school and is currently going to ASU doing a double major in Psychology and English and is doing a LGBT research study. Me on the other hand, I made mistakes in high school and ended up having to finish it in an independent studies program. I went to the Conservatory of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences, an audio engineering specific school in Arizona. Lived out there for a year and moved back to California to pursue and internship at a studio. Being 21, I’ve never had a “real” job which is something I regret, but plan on changing that in the coming weeks. Anyway, because of that, she explained that she had been thinking a lot these past few weeks that she has felt unsatisfied with this relationship in that, we're not on the same page with compatibility on motivation and working and goals in our life. She wants to be single for a while and do things independently and wants me to figure things out and do things for myself. She says she doesn't want to be with anyone else and doesn't plan on anything and that she still loves me and doesnt want to lose me. We've spent way too long building this relationship, to just throw it away over something that I honestly believe can be figured out. She doesn't want it figured out together. I've explained many times that we can do this independently and together at the same time. 

She’s tried to convince me that in addition to doing this for herself, she’s doing this BECAUSE of how much she cares about me. As of right now, I told her to take the rest of the month to let things sink in for the both of us and we’ll talk some time around then. She has non refundable tickets to fly out here in March, I really want her to come out here then to see if we can talk things out in person because all of this happened over the phone.
I have to at least try a little bit to save something I feel very confident would still work. I understand a lot of the concerns she has but I think she’s being overly logical about them and not feeling what overall makes her happy. She has been my closest friend for 5 years. I can’t just let go. "
pebio,5,2012-02-07,How does one go from hobbyist/amateur/student/babycoder to professional?,torvoraptor,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/pebio/how_does_one_go_from/,"So I've been programming on and off since high school (currently in 3rd year of college), I've become jaded with my major (Chemical Engineering) and have decided to pursue CS (my minor) from now on. Though I'm very comfortable with programming concepts and have experimented with a bunch of mini projects and am comfortable coding in C/C++/Java/Python.

But it's nothing... 'big'... nothing that shows me how I'd perform in the  real profession. 

I've applied for software development internships and they they are hesitant because of my lack of experience working on bigger projects. So basically I feel I've hit a wall, although I'm gaining more and more theoretical knowledge and confidence I can't seem to be able to break out of the 'beginner' mould.

Could you guys share your stories on how you broke out from being a beginner to actually coding on large projects?"
pe3ru,15,2012-02-06,"The Love of Ownership: Chapter 9, Work",notjustathowaway,BDSMerotica,https://www.reddit.com/r/BDSMerotica/comments/pe3ru/the_love_of_ownership_chapter_9_work/,"I woke up horny, not surprising as the toy in my pussy gave the feeling of there being something inside me, which I loved, but it wasn't stimulating, which was making me frustrated. The longer I wore it, the more I regretted complaining like that. I knew my punishment was deserved, but I hated it anyway. After getting ready I knelt next to the door, waiting for Master to finish the breakfast I had made for Him. He ate quickly and took my leash off the table, clipping it on me, then walking out the front door. He then turned to the left, forcing me to conceal a sigh of relief. Master usually took the bus to work, which was down the street to the right, but his truck was just to the left. I was happy that he had the decency to not parade me around on the bus. Most people didn't care, and some who rode the bus with master often knew about our relationship, but I didn't want to publicly share the fact that I was being paraded around on a leash while in a low cut blouse and pencil skirt.

Master drove quickly to work and pulled into His reserved spot at the company. He was the founder and CEO of His small software company, which allowed Him certain privileges, such as a reserved spot and twenty four hour access to the building. He used His access privileges to open the building and usher me in. The security guard at the desk smiled at Master and called out across the lobby. ""Hey, Boss, I didn't know it was bring your pet to work day, I would have brought mine!"" I recognized his voice immediately. It was Lee, a nice guy a little older than Master, whom We had met at one of the BDSM events we go to on occasion. His pet, Alex and I had hit it off, and we started hanging out in casual setting. When the electronics store that Lee worked at went under, Master had offered him a security desk job working for Master's company. Master had given him identical hours with better pay and benefits, so Lee was very grateful, and always acted professional when others were around, but when it was just the two of them, with or without me, they were much more relaxed.

""Nah, Lee, pet here got in trouble last night, so she's getting desk duty today."" 

""Alright, Boss, I'll give you the early light if someone comes in for you.""

""Thanks, Lee.""

""My pleasure, Sir."" I winced at Lee calling Master 'Sir,' That was my title for Him. I knew my jealousy was unfounded, as anyone could be called 'Sir' but when it was my Master, I wanted to be the only one to use it.

With Lee also being in the community, it allowed Master a little bit of extra piece of mind, as Lee would alert Master long before His secretary would, allowing Him to conceal me and refocus on business. There were only three people who worked for master that knew His secret, and all of them were salary, and I'm sure could get away with murder as long as Master was in charge.

We were in the elevator when Master spoke again. ""I just got a message from the man I had a Eleven o'clock with, apparently he's picked up a bug, and won't be able to make it today, which means that you will belong to me all day.""

I knew that meant he would be spending the day at his desk. Master normally worked in the trenches with the rest of his team, but on occasion would take a day to work on the more corporate side of his company, so him spending all day hidden in the office wouldn't arouse suspicion.

We walked in and he unlocked his office, leading me inside. His preference for modern style wasn't shown in this room, as he had decided to go with a steam punk theme. He ushered me under the strong oak desk, and attached my collar to a short chain hanging under the desk, he wound up my leash and stashed it in the hidden compartment under the desk. Master had a fondness for concealment, so it didn't surprise me that when he opened the drawer under his desk and fiddled with some unseen controls, I heard the hissing of steam and the hum of motors. I knew the steam was entirely for effect, but the hums came from the three monitors and a computer that were expertly hidden inside this desk. It had taken Master almost a year to complete the desk, but once completed, it was quite the work of art.

He then unzipped his pants and let his shaft flop out before beginning to work on his computer.

I knew what my job was, and out of fear of reprimand, I began to play with his pulsing meat. With my hands bound behind me I could only use my mouth, trying to slowly tease Master's shaft to hardness. The stiffer He got, the easier it was for me to slowly fellate Him. I could hear Him surfing the net above me, going through His daily websites, watching His Tuesday videos, then with a sigh I heard Him click over to actual work. Now He was typing away on some spreadsheet, probably a financial document. Either way, I could tell He was close, so I readied myself, brought my soft pallet up and took His full length into my throat. Swallowing softly I could feel Him grunt as I sucked the orgasm directly from His rod.

He came hard in my throat, His hot sperm coating my insides as it dripped into my stomach. I had to resist the gag reflex that appeared as His cock pulsed in my mouth. I slowly brought my head up, His tip now sitting on my tongue. I lapped at any cum that hadn't poured down my throat, and slowly cleaned my spittle and His cum off of His softening cock.

At this point, I wanted so badly to cum, my legs futilely rubbing together, hoping that somehow I could steal some pleasure from the evil device inside me.

He sighed with His orgasm, not seeming to take His attention off of the computer. I unintentionally whimpered lightly. I didn't like to be ignored, and hated even more when my hard work wasn't recognized. Seeming to hear me, even over the music He had been playing, He finished a line of text and reached under the table, stroking my cheek lightly before going back to work on His computer. I hummed happily, nuzzling into the side of His knee.

The rest of the day continued in such a fashion, Master occasionally pushing His meat against my cheek, me pleasuring him to orgasm, cleaning Him off and then laying back against His knee.

Suddenly I heard a knock on Master's office door. He called the person in. ""Here you go sir, an order of the general, a side order of fried rice, and two sides of pot stickers, plus a large mountain dew and a large sprite.""

It was one of the interns, he didn't seem to be questioning why Master got two drinks. They had been trained well to follow orders and only ask questions if it would make them smarter or more efficient.

He left quickly, probably to deliver food to the other employees. Master set the take out box full of pot stickers in front of me. He knew that the ten pot stickers would be more than enough for me, and he set one of the sodas next to it, leaving the straw in easy reach of my mouth.

This brought me to the assumption that I wasn't going to be eating with my hands so I thanked him quietly and picked up one of the pot stickers, finding it surprising easy to eat without my hands.

The rest of the day was uneventful until we headed home. Master used the back elevator this time, which meant no one saw us slip out, Master leading me out on the leash."
pdwa8,5,2012-02-06,My girlfriend has multiple voices/personalities that can randomly take control of her. How can the poor get treatment?,MultiPersonalityHelp,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/pdwa8/my_girlfriend_has_multiple_voicespersonalities/,"   When we first started dating, she mentioned that as a child, she heard voices. At first, the voices were nice, but still scared the hell out of her. She told her mother, and was essentially ignored. This led to a deep resentment to her mother. According to her mother, this was just a phase and it would go away. It really only got worse. Eventually, they told her to do things like kill her sister and kill herself (she didn't, but this really bothered her). After some time apparently they went away, and she doesn't really remember how it happened.


   As we were dating, I noticed she had odd memory problems. She was often so forgetful with basic things. Like forgetting to throw out paper plates, even after she walks by them on her way to the trash. Or forgetting to think about the consequences of her actions. When I asked her why she drank orange juice, even though we both know it upsets her stomach, she replies she didn't think about it, or she forgot. And yet she does this on a weekly basis.


   What really started to concern me was these bizarre episodes she had when she feel asleep. One night, I was in bed with her while playing xbox. She drifted off after a few minutes, and then woke up. While awake I could tell something was very different. She kept asking questions about things that had happened months ago. ""Why aren't you playing mass effect 2 anymore? Where is our old blanket?"" I hadn't played mass effect in 2 months, at this point I sold it. It was at this point I realized she was in some sort of state of mind from two months back. She also acted... ""funny"". Almost as if she was high. She laughed about everything like it was a joke. Finally I convinced her to go back asleep. After sleeping for no longer than a minute, she woke up and had no idea what happened. She looked at me as if I was crazy when I asked her what she did.


   Fast forward a few months later she had another episode. This time I got a call in the middle of the night, with her frantically crying saying she had no idea where she was at. I had just got off the phone with her an hour earlier. She was at home laying in her bed, we talked for a while, and then she went to sleep. So I calmed her down and told her to turn on her laptop. She asked how I knew that she had laptop in front of her. About a month prior to this, she bought a laptop, and switched rooms with her mother. I mentioned this and she said she had no idea what I was talking about. She told me the last thing she remembers was falling asleep while I was playing mass effect (Yeah just like that last episode, and later I find out this mass effect night was one of the most memorable and peaceful nights she had).


   About a year later, I start to see more episodes in a semi frequent pattern. The difference this time is they were... a bit disturbing. All of these ""disturbing"" episodes seemed to be her response to extreme stress. For example, we were talking about her stomach pains, and how we really need to get this checked out (we suspect ulcers, but we don't know. I am poor and in college, and she works for minimum wage with no health insurance). Talking about this REALLY bothered her and caused her to start crying hysterically, cover her ears, and then just pass out. When she woke up she asked me why her face was all wet and why there was snot all over her nose.


   The next episode was the most bothersome. Again it started with her getting stressed out about something, she passed out, but then something different happened. Instead of the normal passing out, it was a BLANK stare. And I mean like she was dead. I tried to get her attention, hugging her, told her I was here for her. I begged for an answer. When she ""awoke"" into her odd episodic state, she began crying like... well I could only image someone crying like this if they were getting raped or beaten. Then she passed out for about 5 seconds, did the blood curdling crying again, and then stopped. I tried telling her I was here for her. And she repeated this, ""no you will beat me up, you  are gonna hurt me."" Just to clarify, I have never hit or hurt her before And as far as I know, no one has every physically hit or hurt her. So I tried asking her who was going to hurt her, and I was here to help. She passed out again, and then woke up. After all of this was over, again she had no memory of the incident.


   From here I suspected she had been raped, or hurt at some point. So when she had another passive episode, I began talking to her in her episodic state. I find out that a neighbor would rest his hand on her vagina as a child, which really bothered and confused her, but nothing that caused that bizarre screaming and crying before. I asked her if anyone hurt or hit her, and she said no one did. After she woke up, she said she hadn't remembered that for years. It was only after I talked to her in this state that she remembered it.


  I find out for the past few months that my girlfriend has been ""confused"". She wasn't sure if she loved me less, or how she felt about me (we had been dating for over 4 years at this point and were pretty committed with each other. In fact as far as I knew, things couldn't have been any better). She tells me her confusion began a few months earlier (coincidentally when these bizarre episodes started happening). I ask her what problems does she have with our relationship and she couldn't name any. She said she just felt less for me, but that she still loved me. And even then she couldn't really explain it. Her most common description was ""confused"". I take her out to eat, to the mall, and buy her a new shirt to try and show her I care. That night, we have a long discussion about our relationship. I tell her I love her just as much as I always have, but if she wants to leave, she can. And that she needs to do whatever makes her happy. She said she was still confused, but that she loved me and she wanted to stay. She says she thought that cheating on me would bring some spark back but dismissed it as a horrible idea (she even called talked this idea through with her friends, her sister, and me. Everyone told her this was a terrible idea). 


  The next day, she cheated on me. She didn't just cheat. She had been planning this for about a week. With a guy I suspected she liked. We even talked about how I was getting jealous, but she promised she would never do anything and nothing was going to happen. That week, she made sure to delete all her texts, change her facebook password, and delete all her facebook conversations. I talk to her about it and she said she didn't know what happened. Even the guy she cheated with said she shouldn't do this and she had too much to lose. She thought this would somehow help us. But that the more she talked about it, the more it was getting buried. She couldn't even recall some common details of what happened.


  I was very hurt, but something didn't add up. I told her I was giving her a second chance. I still love her. So I didn't want to throw everything away. It just seemed so drastically out of character. We have been best friends for 6 years before we started dating and now have been dating for over 4 years. We have literally talked about everything. We are both very open with our problems, we made it clear that we both love and respect each other too much to cheat. And overall seemed too in love to ever do that. While in bed that night, what she did was wearing on me, and the guilt hit her. She again had an episode. But one like I have never seen before. This time it wasn't her, my girlfriend now described herself as betty. 


*Betty - As happy as a human can be. Very playful and fun, almost like a 4 year old little girl. Will do the commands of John under pressure. Even ""evil"" things like holding a knife over someone.

*Tabitha - The sad one. In a constant depression. Does show signs of being happy if I try and make her laugh and tell her I love her. She is the creative one. Writes poetry, paints, sings. But overall comes out when sad, and depressed.

*Tracy - The pure sexual being. When tracy is out, she goes straight for genitals. No matter what the conversation or mood is, if tracy has control of my girlfriend, she tries to have sex. In public, private, anywhere and everywhere. We could be both be crying letting out our feelings. Tracy might randomly take control and grab my penis.

*John - Originally described as the evil one. The one who hates everything and everyone. He changed into a ""bro"". Constantly refers to me as bro. Id a man personality, unlike the other personalities. Likes video games, sports and women (even says he is attracted to my girlfriend's friends). Complains about the other personalities all being women and is bothered by living with them.

*Ally - The terrified one. She comes out rarely. She RUNS from me or anyone else. There is no speaking to her, no reasoning with her. She cries and runs. Only comes out to show my girlfriend's terror.

*My girlfriend - Each personality seems to just be a part of her, but taken to the extreme. When my girlfriend is in control it's just like any other person. Able to show all emotions. Although, I have noticed other personalities ""bleed"" into each other. For example, if we talk about her cheating on me, Tabitha comes out and is very depressed. Randomly John might come out and say, ""Sorry for doing that bro, these women see what they wanted and just went for it. No one spoke up and stopped it.""


  I learned that John was the one causing my girlfriends pain and trouble. He is the one who was ""beating her up"" and was the one making her cry in those episodes. He, apparently, is also the one her makes her do bad things to hurt herself (she was in a bad relationship before me, her ex called her fat, ugly, but according to betty, John made her stay. Also is the one her makes her drink orange juice to hurt her). After a half an hour of talking, betty mentions John has been planning a party to get all the other personalities back. John was ""buried"" away inside my girlfriend. But somehow escaped through a hole. But he never left like the others. He also forces betty to do things. Betty said john forced her to ""kill"" my girlfriends conscience, so it wouldn't stop John from doing bad things.


  After learning this, John starts yelling at betty and takes control of my girlfriend. He says he hates me, and my girlfriend doesn't need me. I say, ""She said that she wants to stay with me,"" he replies, ""you don't know what she wants, I do."" After this, it goes back and forth between betty and john, but as this happens I try to befriend john. After a few hours it works. He transforms from this evil controlling person. To a ""bro"". We start bonding by complaining about women, talking about adult swim and video games. From here on he stops being controlling, and well evil. Betty tells me my girlfriend has been sleeping the whole time.

  Finally my girlfriend wakes up and takes control, again, has NO IDEA what happened. I explain all of this, and she realizes her ""voices"" from her childhood are back. What is different this time, is they don't terrify her. They are more like... siblings? As the night goes her I meet all the other personalities (I guess the party happened?). And so far, we get along. The only other information I can give about them is they are all in her head speaking at anytime. They can all for the most part hear what I say no matter who has control. They do randomly take control of her, so I fear how this will affect her interactions with other people and work (she works in retail).

**tl;dr. My girlfriend has episodes where she doesn't remember anything. Had voices in her head as a child. All of a sudden these voices can now take control of her. I also suspect them having to do with her cheating on me.**


Most importantly, how can we seek treatment or help if we have no financial support from our families? She works getting minimum wage, and I am jobless seeking an internship while in college. I literally have no idea what to do. Nothing in life has prepared me for a situation like this.

Any help on what's going on with my girlfriend is greatly appreciated.

Any help on how to deal with this is greatly appreciated.

And I have just been cheated on by the love of my life, and my best friend. Although I have gladly taken her back, any help coping with what happened will help."

My BIGGEST issue, I have a chronic hereditary disease, ankylosing spondilitis. I affected me all throughout university, It probably wasn't smart going to school when dealing with immense pain 24/7. With the health care system in Canada I was diagnosed overseas at 20 years old (now 22), the damage to my body was done though, it started when I was 15-16. Anywho, should I mention this? If I should in what context/situation.

I would like to know some standard things that I should not do, besides not asking what compensation/benefits the job comes with and such. 

I've prepared some written professional references, and all contact info of job experience mentioned on my CV. Compiled 4-5 questions on a blank page to ask at the interview, when given the chance of course. 

I've brushed up on different experiences from working in a team throughout labs/project management courses/other class projects. My knowledge without looking back into course materials is a little fuzzy, but before the interview I will review some main concepts about circuit design/physics/programming (java, C#/C++).

Thank you for any help you could offer, if I get the internship i shall bake you cookies!"
ph0q5,14,2012-02-08,Questions about programmer resumes,Satros,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/ph0q5/questions_about_programmer_resumes/,"I've read a lot of guides and tips on creating a good resume, including many specifically geared toward people in the programming/tech industry. Not matter what though, they all seem to fall short in a few areas because programmers usually have a large amount of technical skills to convey and may also have personal projects in addition to normal experience.

I was hoping someone with experience in this could answer some questions for me. **Note that this is for Entry level**


* How should I organize skills? As programmers we have lots of different technical skills. Some categories of types of things I would like to list include Languages, Frameworks/Libraries, Desktop Software/IDEs/Source Control Systems, Web Software/CMS, and Operating systems. Should I just break them up like I just listed?

* How familiar do you have to be with a technology to list it under skills? For example I have used Javascript for some basic things on websites I've created as well as for a few projects in school. I understand the basics of it although I would probably have to look up some specifics time to time. I haven't done any huge projects in Javascript though, and I'm not as familiar with it as I am with Java for instance. Another example is I took a class where we used Prolog and Haskell pretty much the entire semester. I understand how the languages work conceptually and could write code to do some very basic things if needed, but I would still consider myself a ""beginner"" to these languages although I have some experience working with them. Would it be a good idea or bad idea to list these?
* Should display any personal projects on my resume? Remember right now since it is entry level my experience is very limited, I do have some website work, a software development internship, and some experience working in IT already. But besides that, I also do some freelance webdesign work, but I have no idea how to display it. Also in my spare time I run a small team that develops some server plugins for the game Minecraft, we use git and some of our projects are pretty big in size/deal with things like security/etc, so there is a somewhat professional side to it, would it make sense to add this? I could make a category for Personal projects or something perhaps, any feedback is helpful.


Any feedback is appreciated!"

Firstly full disclosure, I work with Foodtree (well I am an intern here) and I am telling you about this because I'd like your help.

That said everything about this is free and should actually be of interest to the the food community!

We made an app that lets you tag pictures you take of food to the places you bought them or ate them (restaurant or store), as WELL as the places the food came from originally (if you know it) - the idea is to build a big map of where all the food we eat is coming from, and to be able to use some social networking to track down places to buy fresh seasonable and local things.

So all that said - I was hoping some of you guys would try it out for us? We are a super small company and literally every user is exciting to us! :D In particular we are trying a data experiment centered around Whole Foods Stores in North America... if you happen to live near by one, and could take the time to install our free app and go take some pictures of food - any food - there it would help us so much.

Thanks for taking the time to read.

here is a link the app: http://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/foodtree/id446647800?mt=8

pgjzi,0,2012-02-08,I recently broke up with a girl who had extremely overbearing parents. Reddit what is your worst/most interesting break up story?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/pgjzi/i_recently_broke_up_with_a_girl_who_had_extremely/,"Okay, so I just broke up with my girlfriend of about a year and 3 months a little under a month ago. Here is the story to that and then I will ask the questions.

I started dating this girl last year while she was on an internship in D.C. I fell in love with her over the next three months. She was everything I wanted beautiful, smart, funny, and we had similar interests. Things got serious pretty fast and I went to her house for Thanksgiving and she came to my home for Christmas. We spent the Christmas break together but then her internship ended and she went back to her college the next semester. The next 4 months were a living hell. We broke up once but I convinced her to get back together with me and we continued our shaky relationship. In the summer, she decided to come live in D.C. and study for the LSAT. It was a great summer but in the Fall she had to return to school. I begged her we do not repeat what happened the previous semester. Sure enough we repeated the same kind of terrible relationship. I broke up with her in October but then we did this on again off again thing for about 3 months. We were fighting a lot in that time but there was one thing that really bothered me over our entire relationship. Her parents were the most demanding, over bearing parents I have ever met. I went to her house for Christmas and they treated her like she was 12. I had known her parents were 'helicopter' parents but I realized it was worse than I imagined. I wont get into too many specifics but there were many little things that she was not allowed to do. Her and I are both in our early 20's and they drive her to everything (like her LSAT test day). They will drive 6 hours just to take her to drive her a site one hour away. This meant that during our long distance relationship she could not drive to see me and I had to travel to her destination. It bothered me quite a bit and made me feel unneeded/wanted. We ultimately broke up and I know its for the best. 
Also as a side note:
I am having a hard time getting over this relationship.

How can I move on faster and come to terms with being single? 

Are all woman this dependent on their parents?

We have been dating for 3 years, half of which has been long distance.

Since we both went off to college it has been a little rough on our relationship but we always pulled through.  Right before I went off to college this semester we had a really bad fight, she said it was her breaking point but like always we worked it out and we made up.  She then goes off to an internship that she received at a theme park near Orlando. We continued talking, not as often because she is busier but nonetheless still talking.  After about a month in she tells me we need to talk, I try not to think too much of it, but then she tells me that since she is there she doesn’t want to have any regrets and that we should go on a break/breakup.  I didn’t really take the news that well, I didn’t yell I just became very sad and we sort of talked it out to the point that I “accepted” it. Then we talked the next day, she says she still cares about me and that she loves me but she just wants to be friends. She also continued to say she was confused and that she has never had these feelings(I quote “more than attractive but I could see myself dating feelings”)  for other guys.  I’m trying to be as nice as possible towards the whole things but it is tearing me up inside, I don’t know how long I can keep it up.  I honestly don’t know what to do, I’m very lost. I know this might sound childish and I should just move on but I am not ready to lose her this easily but I also want her to experience whatever she is going through now just in case we do get back together she won’t want to go through this again. I keep reminding myself this is actually happening.  I’ve never felt this sad. I just feel I had something so great and now its gone.

Also before any of this happened I already bought tickets to go down for a week, I’m still planning on going down but what should I do? 

I guess my main question is, how should I go about keeping her in my life with a possibility of getting back together afterwards.  Should I try and go down next weekend?



**TL;DR**

GF went to internship for 8 months, month in she wants to go on break/breakup, sending very confusing signals. I still want to be with her, what should I do?

I'll try to answer questions the best I can, I do have class today, so I'll try my best. Thanks in advance."

pg3m3,2,2012-02-08,Aspiring digital designer advice?,CannibalCheesecake,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/pg3m3/aspiring_digital_designer_advice/,"I'm an undergraduate Computer Engineering major, which entails lots of computer science with some digital design and computer architecture thrown in. I've tried to keep my undergraduate curriculum as open as possible (courses listed below), but when I entered into an engineering internship, I was shocked at how little I was able to do. I was basically a technician, given a part and told to perform tests and verify functionality. I still have a year left of school (3 or 4 more quarters), but looking at the classes available to me, I'm afraid I'll be just as clueless when/if I go fulltime. My biggest complaint is that the professors periodically tell us 'this isn't exactly true, but it's been done this way for so long, and it works in this case'.

Some of my background, I've obviously been forced to take classes in chemistry, physics and calculus and linear algebra (managed to skip vector calculus, although I might take it later). In CS I've taken classes about OOP, Linux, pure mathematics, Data Structures and Algorithms in C++, Finite Automata, and GUI for Qt and Android. On the EE side, I've taken RLC circuit analysis, Signal Processing (Fourier/Laplace/Z Transforms, full of small 'lies'), elementary transistor analysis, and semiconductor physics (focused on Silicon, also full of small 'lies' and handwaving). Last but not least on the CE side, I've taken a class on combinatorial circuits, Verilog (sequential circuits), and am currently taking a class on Computer Architecture (with the design portion scheduled for next quarter). The architecture course is the most relevant course I've seen with discussion of good vs bad datapath design, but we're only focusing on MIPS, and we only cover fixed point arithmetic.

If my dream job is to eventually work in high speed VLSI digital design, what topics should I look to cover? Would graduate school be required? If so, should I attend graduate school immediately after my undergraduate and go into more debt, or wait to make some money and forget most of this material meanwhile? Thanks!"

I'm 23 year old student, majoring in civil engineering and im supposed to finish my BS this may. Slowly throughout the years i've been isolating myself from my friends and family for no reason in particular, i just had no motivation to interact with them. 

I've been on anti-depressants and sleeping pills for about 4 months now and i don't feel like they are having any effect on me. I've slept maybe 2 hours in the last 3 days and i dont feel sleepy, just exhausted... i just want to let go... It's 3:15am right now and i just feel nothing. just feel this primal void. Just emptiness.

Last Saturday i was pretty much forced to go to the ER because i've been having severe chest pains and my left arm regularly starts to feel numb or tingly... But the doctor couldn't come up with a diagnosis because a 23-year-old shouldnt be having these sort of symptoms. The only thing that showed up was that my blood pressure was a bit high... I also told him that i was diagnosed with clinical depression when he asked if i was diagnosed with anything. Probably thought that i was making shit up for the attention or something because after an IV to just lower my blood pressure, he just sent me on my way ant told me i was ok. He even said i shouldnt have to worry when i asked him if i should get checked out by a cardiologist or a specialist. While waiting for the doctor to give me this diagnosis, i was reflecting on all the things i would never get to do with my life. Have a career... Start a family... Fall in love... See the world... and oddly enough, i was ok with it... Right now i'm convinced that this is my body finally just letting go...

As i sat in the waiting room, i calmly jotted down on a paper pad that i had in my backpack my funeral arrangements. Decided to be cremated... half of the ashes spread in the ocean... the other half in the soil with a tree planted in it... Maybe i would finally make a mark on this world...

Ive been told thousands of times how smart i am, how much potential i have, how bright my future is... but i just dont care right now... the only thing that is keeping those pills out of my stomach is my mother... i wouldnt want her to go throught the pain of losing a child. and she lost her own mother almost 2 years ago... If it wasnt for her, i dont really think anyone would miss me. my friends' lives would go on, my family would continue to grow... i'm just here for the ride and i think im ready to get off the cart now.

And of course, no suicide story wouldnt be complete with the heartbreak story. I am really introverted with most people but when i finally trust someone, i am an open book. I wear my heart on my sleeve and so far its been trampled it's share. So far in the past 6 months ive been utterly rejected by 2 of the best people i could have ever met. I'll split them up into 2 stories to avoid confusion:

1. We've known each other for about 3 or 4 years but she had been in a long term relationship the whole time i knew her. I had found out that they had broken up just about a week before she was about to leave for an internship in Michigan for the summer, so i never really got to make any moves as soon as i found out. We met up when she came back in august and we really started hitting it off pretty great. hooked up, talked, all the good things. I told her upfront what i felt for her. little did i know, i was just another guy in a long line of rebound hook ups she was having because ""she had missed out on it so much"" in the last years. Flash forward to a couple of weeks ago. we where in an after party at her place and i was just chilling, trying to get over her so not showing much interest. halfway through the party she leans towards me and whispers ""you know that half of the people here think we're going to hook up tonight right?"" I was like ""Um...ok"". She replied with ""But youre not the one i want tonight"" Me, trying to be the nice guy told her ""if you want me to give you youre space, just say it"" And she just looked me dead in the eye and said ""...move"" This  made my heart hit the floor and i just went straight home without saying goodbye to anyone. i just wanted to be alone. Havent really spoken to her that much since.

2. This girl is a mutual friend that i met a couple of years ago but we kind of lost contact. We got back in touch i would say around September, pretty much after the girl #1 thing went down hill. The catch is that she lives about 1,800 miles away... and theres a huge body of water between us so the only way we could actually see each other was getting on a plane. either way, both knowing this, we kept talking. We talked every day at least an hour a day from mid-september until the end of december. We also skyped every chance we got. We also constantly texted. And by constantly texting im talking about 6,000 texts in this span of time. As you can see we got pretty close during that time. There was also a sort of magnetic attraction between us, but we never really acknowledged it. The thing is i started hinting that i might move a bit closer to her after i graduate, at least close enough where a real relationship could develop. This went on for most of january and she seemed pretty thrilled about it. This all sounds perfect so far, and i thought it was. Then she mentioned something about a guy friend of her's supposedly being jealous of me because we were always talking or texting and that i could always make her smile (her words, not mine)... i was like ""whatever, the guys in the friend zone, i got nothing to worry about"". Today, i had to find out through motherfucking facebook that they started a relationship ""as of today"" which means its probably been going on for a while... ive never felt so betrayed (and i have been cheated on before so it takes a lot for me to trust someone after that first time) we talked literally minutes before i found out and she didnt even mention it. not a word... it just felt like shit.

So thats whats been going on up until a couple of hours ago. I apologize if this seems a bit jumbled up or makes no sense whatsoever. Im a bit drunk and right now, those pills look more tempting than ever.... i know that if i took them, they would just lull me away to sleep and i would just not wake up again... and maybe then i can get rid of this loneliness... of this emptiness... of this nothingness... 

I'm really tempted to delete all of this to just not bother anyone but maybe it can be an outlet... i dont know... we'll see how today pans out... see if another day is really worth it...

UPDATE:Hello everyone, thank you so much for taking your time to read my wall of text and truly caring. It was a rough couple of days but thankfully made it through. Found out from doing some research that all my symptoms, including the increased depression, were severe side effects of my anti-depressants. I instantly stopped taking them as soon as i figured it out and i have an appointment with my psychiatrist tomorrow and i'm going to demand a change in my treatment (i never want to go through that again). Thank you all for the support, you guys made a world of difference. Much love."

pfwv3,8,2012-02-08,5 Weeks in and feelin' fine.,ChronicElectronic,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/pfwv3/5_weeks_in_and_feelin_fine/,"Hello Everyone,

I'm currently a little over 5 weeks into what I originally thought would be an extended break. I'm seriously considering quitting for good, but I haven't decided for sure. I took a 3 month break last year in order to be able to pass drug tests while getting an internship. I hope to go for at least 6 months, then decide where to go from there.

The catalyst for this break was failing two classes and going on academic probation. I've generally been able to get by in school (my GPA is just over 3.0). I decided I needed a break to make sure I don't go on AP again and risk some really bad consequences. After a few weeks when my head got clear I did some thinking. I realized that I can't remember the last time I really put my full effort into my studies. I used to blame this completely on weed, but I realize now that I was just using that as an excuse. Although, it sure is easier to motivate myself to focus on classes when I'm not smoking. This quarter I actually turned an assignment in early. Where as last quarter I was failing to turn in assignments altogether.

Besides improvements in my classes, I've restarted my meditation practice, finally got around to brewing my first batch of beer, and I'm even trying out vegetarianism. 

I'm surprised at my will power, seeing as that I live with 6 pot smokers, of which two deal and one grows.  I know I can stay strong through the end of the quarter, but once its over I may struggle to continue with my break. Hopefully the positive changes I'm making in my life are enough to motivate me to quit once and for all.

Peace and Love."

I'm looking at getting my first internship this summer in Computer Science after spending 3.5 years at another out of state school. I was pursuing a BA in Economics, (less math and modeling than a BS), but changed my mind and wanted to pursue a CS degree. The thing is, I haven't been able to get my official transcripts from the original school, as I owe some money that I've been paying back slowly, and should be finished within a few months. Up until now, I've been putting my major GPA (4.0) on my resume, but this is not my cumulative. If I had to guess, I would say it's around a 3.2 cumulative, but my original school uses a +- system state wide, while the new state system doesn't. I also am not sure which credits are going to transfer, as I had ~104 towards my Econ BA, and now ~45 towards my CS BS.

Is it acceptable to use my major GPA, even if it could be construed as intentionally misleading in the future? Or should I use my best guess of my cumulative? Thanks y'all."

One of my friends sent me [this blog post](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2008/11/26.html), which has some interesting ideas which basically seem kinda sleazy to me. 

Any other thoughts?"

I have a minor in computer science, and currently have a software development internship (which primarily involves C++ coding) - so I'm pretty comfortable programming.

I just need the answers to a few questions to get started:

* What language should I program in? (I know this is preferential, but is there a good language to start with when designing games?)

* What library do I use for graphics/sound? 

Any tips for a newbie are most certainly welcome."
pijlb,3,2012-02-09,Are there jobs that will give me enough experience to work in the IT industry?,adoltswimmer,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/pijlb/are_there_jobs_that_will_give_me_enough/,"So I'm a college student working on getting a computer science degree. I'm married and living in an apartment, so I need to bring some income home. I've been using sites like career builder and simply hired to find jobs, and as I try looking for jobs related to my degree, I find that I simply don't have the experience for an IT job right now. I've only made it to the basic math prerequisites of my degree, and while I've gotten a taste of several different programming languages and some toying with a few linux distros, I don't have the professional or personal experience with anything necessary to get a job having anything to do with computers-at least as far as I've found now.

So my question is: Are there entry level jobs that can help me build some kind of resume for after graduation? Could I learn a type of skill or language now and get a job with that? Everything I find seems to want a comp sci degree already or 4-5 years of experience in a given language or job type. I don't have the degree now and unless I got a job I won't have the experience when I graduate, either. I would apply for an internship somewhere, but my GPA is only 2.7-something, I think. The last one I looked at was looking for 3.2, and I suspect they're all looking for about that level or better. I can always raise my grades with time, but is there anywhere I could apply to now that could give me some of the skills and, more importantly, the resume I will need for when college is through? Any pointers would be helpful. Oh, and I'm in the central CT area, if that matters."
pigep,1,2012-02-09,Genders in engineering rant,[deleted],rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/pigep/genders_in_engineering_rant/,"So this afternoon I was sitting in the engineering communications studio working dynamics problems with my normal study group—me, two girlfriends, and a guy friend.  The career expo at my school is tomorrow and we were talking about it.  I made the offhand comment that I don’t want to go because I’m never going to get an internship with my GPA as low as it is, regardless of my work experience.  That’s when the token male of the groups says that me and my other girlfriend will get internships because we’re female.

That’s it.  I have a vagina, thus they are going to throw internships at me apparently. Not because I work harder or am more intelligent.  Because I have two X chromosomes.

And I’m not exaggerating.  He is the type of guy that would not get and internship and I would get one and then he’d but all, “Oh well, I didn’t try.” or “You are female and that’s the only reason they picked you over me.” 

I WILL END YOU.

I  might have overreacted a bit and crossed the line in my response to him, but I don’t regret verbally bitch slapping him.  And I’m pretty sure the entire studio outside the conference room could hear me.  They stared as a stormed out, but fuck tha police, I give no fucks.

And I’m not saying companies don’t have to even out their ratios.  I get that.  I think it’s stupid, but I get it.  Fine.  Whatever.  But it seems every guy here has the mentality that gender is the only reason that a woman would get an engineering internship.  

Ad it isn’t just him.  Many of the guys I take classes with feel the same or stronger.  It’s all about insecurities, and frankly, they need to be bitch slapped.  It is possible for me to be a better candidate than you, so get over yourself and stop being so insecure and accept the fact that you are not god’s gift to engineering.  nHe is being nothing but condescending.  I need the help of being a woman to get an internship?  Hey fuck you.

THEN.  I texted my other male engineering friend telling him what happened.  He texted me first about skipping a reception tonight, and I said I probably was too because I’m so irritated.  Then I explained what happened.  And he said that though the comment was harsh, male number one had a point and that it’s a lot harder as a male.  Okay fine I can live with that.  Still see it as an excuse but whatever.  But alas, ladies and gentlemen, he wasn’t done.  I then get this:

“Plus companies know that female engineers are team players and great at communication.”

Um.  Excuse me?  Is that supposed to help?  I’m hired because I’m motherly and warm hearted and some other bullshit only pisses me off. 

And mother fucking I just lost half my post so I don’t remember what I had.  Fuck.

But to continue, I don’t want special treatment.  I’m hate the whole WOMEN POWER bullshit.  Just treat me equal to everyone else, even if that means I don’t get the internship.  At least I know it was honest.

What sucks the most is that these are two of my best friends and they say that shit to me.  I’ve never pulled the whole, “Oh women have a harder time getting hired because it’s a men’s profession and they only want to hire other men and affirmative action must be taken” card because I truly don’t believe it.

Is it so wrong to think that the best candidate should be hired regardless of sex or race or appearance?  This goes to a deeper level.  Why do I have to pretend to be someone else in a job interview?  Why can’t I wear my normal jeans, top, converse, and what might be considered over the top jewelry?  I’m not a different person in trousers and heels and modest jewelry.  Honestly, I work better in my jeans because I’m more comfortable. 

So now I’m a mix of pissed off at the mentality of the males I go to school with, hurt that two of my best friends would act so condescendingly toward me, and frustrated with the job market in general.  Though pissed is the main emotion right now."

J.P. Morgan

Dear Sir or Madame:

I am an ambitious undergraduate at NYU triple majoring in Mathematics, Economics, and Computer Science. I am a punctual, personable, and shrewd individual, yet I have a quality which I pride myself on more than any of these.

I am unequivocally the most unflaggingly hard worker I know, and I love self-improvement. I have always felt that my time should be spent wisely, so I continuously challenge myself; I left Villanova because the work was too easy. Once I realized I could achieve a perfect GPA while holding a part-time job at NYU, I decided to redouble my effort by placing out of two classes, taking two honors classes, and holding two part-time jobs. That semester I achieved a 3.93, and in the same time I managed to bench double my bodyweight and do 35 pull-ups.

I say these things only because solid evidence is more convincing than unverifiable statements, and I want to demonstrate that I am a hard worker. J.P. Morgan is a firm with a reputation that precedes itself and employees who represent only the best and rightest in finance. I know that the employees in this firm will push me to excellence, especially within the Investment Banking division. In fact, one of the supporting reasons I chose Investment Banking over any other division was that I know it is difficult. I hope to augment my character by diligently working for the professionals at Morgan Stanley, and I feel I have much to offer in return.

I am proficient in several programming languages, and I can pick up a new one very quickly. For instance, I learned a years worth of Java from NYU in 27 days on my own; this is how I placed out of two including: Money and Banking, Analysis, Game Theory, Probability and Statistics. Even further, I am taking Machine Learning and Probabilistic Graphical Modeling currently, two programming courses offered by Stanford, so that I may truly offer the most if I am accepted. I am proficient with Bloomberg terminals, excellent with excel, and can perform basic office functions with terrifying efficiency. I have plenty of experience in the professional world through my internship at Merrill Lynch, and my research assistant position at NYU. In fact, my most recent employer has found me so useful that he promoted me to a Research Assistant and an official CTED intern. This role is usually reserved for Masters students, but my employer gave the title to me so that he could give me more work.

Please realize that I am not a braggart or conceited, I just want to outline my usefulness. Egos can be a huge liability, and I try not to have one.

Thank you so much for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you.

Best,

Mark"
pichc,20,2012-02-09,"Protip #18 - How To: My liberal arts / humanities degree doesn't qualify me to do anything in particular, so I need to compete with the rest of North Campus to get this entry-level office job. ",thehomie,ucla,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/pichc/protip_18_how_to_my_liberal_arts_humanities/,"*This was originally going to be a response to a different thread. Now it's here:



I graduated last June. I've got law school apps out and needed to find a job in the mean time. I was looking specifically to work at a law firm to bolster my apps and for that reason wasn't totally overwhelmed by that 'oh-shit... I-should-have-studied-science' existential moment. In 3 eternal weeks of searching, I managed to land 4 interviews and received job offers at the better 3 firms. I was ultimately even able to pseudoleverage one offer over another. I now work full-time for a top firm in a position with basic, but sometimes interesting responsibilities. I make a modest, but livable wage, and I get full benefits. This was accomplished with an unremarkable GPA (~3.5), generic softs, a degree in Philosophy (no double, no minor), a few months previous relevant part-time experience and - most importantly, I think - **the ability to interview well:**




- **DO YOUR RESEARCH** about the place to which you're applying: know as specifically as possible what they do and who does what.


- **SHOW UP EARLY..** my target is ~20 minutes..  If your interview is at 3:00pm and you show up at 2:50, you're late. 


- No, really.. **DO YOUR RESEARCH**.. Have questions lined up about specific people, what they've done / are currently doing, and express your interest. People love an audience, but be *cool*; don't brownnose. People want more than anything to be able to tolerate, ideally even enjoy the company of the people they're working with. In an interview, you're trying to get your interviewer(s) to 1) remember you, and 2) remember that they like you more than the other applicants. If you manage to break the wall, one candid conversation can go a very long way. Example: one of the managing partners of the firm I currently work for has a sports law blog. I came in with his last few entries fresh in my mind.. the two of us talked about the state of Bruin basketball for a full 15 minutes while the other two people in the room listened in and laughed... At my previous job, I googled one of the partners (who happened to interview me) and saw that he owns a bar in Hollywood offering a bunch of microbrews. I've worked in bars / restaurants and spent 4 years in college.. I casually brought up his bar.. We talked about beer and whiskey for 30 minutes of my 35 minute interview. I got the offer the next day. 


- Finding common ground with your interviewer is important, but don't force it. It's probably better to **BE ARTICULATE** in what you say (viz: only speak when you actually know what you're talking about) than to uncomfortably pick at the conversation, trying desperately to keep them talking. Still, as a general rule of thumb, try to get them to talk more about themselves and their business than you talk about yourself and your ""accomplishments"" (however counter-intuitive that may seem). You're 20-something.. Odds are you haven't done anything terribly remarkable, and that's perfectly understandable; even expected. In any event, they've already got your resume. They know what you're selling.. 


- **DRESS WELL** ... Really, this is so often overlooked, especially given what a powerful tool it can be. When it comes to being taken seriously, you wouldn't believe the general disparity between well and poorly-dressed people. In an interview, the way you're dressed accounts for one of the strongest, most lasting impressions you can make, and it's probably the only aspect of an interview that's totally under your control -- don't squander potentially free points. Dressing well means spending a little more on a pair of shoes / shirt / slacks / haircut than your normally would. And if you don't think you have good style (or if you know you don't...), find someone who does and get them to go shopping with you. It shouldn't be hard. Whether they'll admit it or not, the fashion-conscious love being asked to do fashion-related things. And just for the record, every man needs at least one *good* suit (stay away from polyester and H&amp;M). About women, I know less, but you should be aiming somewhere in between the church and the club. Also, when in doubt, overdress. That should never count against you. 


- Wait one day after the interview and then **FOLLOW UP**. Email or phone call. Up to you. Express your thanks, your continued interest and that the interview was a pleasure. That's it. You already put in the work during the interview. The follow up is just to remind them how cool you were. 


- Try not to be devastated by rejection(s). You go / went to UCL-motherfucking-A. We quite literally run this city (huge, established and heavily nostalgic alumni network). Keep at it and shit will work out. Remember: jobs are like women in college --&gt; a numbers game. Put yourself out there earnestly and often enough, and it's only a matter of time before one gives you the nod. That said, be selective if you can afford to be. Don't stop looking for the dime piece just because a ""6"" is willing to jerk you off in the bathroom for a while. Better jobs = better experience = better on your resume = a better next job / grad school app. 



Source: I've had a ton of interviews in my short time for a ton of different things - plenty of paid jobs in plenty of different fields.. schools, scholarships, clubs, internships, volunteer positions, etc. - and I've gotten offers after each of them; this most recent 3/4 being the only exception. The above is arbitrary advice based on what I think I did right and what I noticed I did differently from the often more-impressive-on-paper people I was competing with. I've also always asked (and have been told) what stuck out in my interviews. 


Good luck, Bruins!"
piasx,12,2012-02-09,"Gentlefolk, I could use some advice.",Esuka,MLPLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/MLPLounge/comments/piasx/gentlefolk_i_could_use_some_advice/,"[](/takealetter) A little background first. I'm a 3rd year a california uni, studio arts major. I am a game designer, I have a title up on XBLA, another completed project, and a title we are hoping to get on Steam within the next few months. Unfortunately, my school (the school of the arts, not the uni) does not lend much... any support to my field, but I managed with the Video Game Development Club, of which I act as an officer. I spent a quarter studying abroad, and the overall experience was incredible. I came back from a month of traveling, having survived on my own, feeling pretty confident. 

[](/cheerilee) Still with me? Awesome. So here's the problem. In a nutshell, there isn't enough time. I can divide my time into 3 basic categories: Entertainment, schoolwork, and career/resume work. Again, because my classes have very little overlap with my field, I have to build my resume largely on my own. And yes, drawing ponies counts as entertainment. I love it, I love sharing them, and I'm not about to stop, but I can't really use it. 

[](/lunagasp) And in one month, GDC, one of the largest gatherings of game and software developers in the world, is being held at its annual location in San Fransisco. If you want to be a developer, it's urged that you go. If you are one, your company will sometimes cover you going. It's important. But I look at what I have for my resume, and I don't feel like anyone will buy it. Yes, I've completed projects, which is a step above a lot of people in my position, but it's not enough of a step to compensate for the lack of expertise I have in sheer technical skill. Even though going to GDC with the singular intention of getting a job is likely to fail, the contacts you make there will often be considering new interns and employees. 

[](/derpwizard) Sorry folks, almost done. Now, I can go, focus purely on making contacts, and bolster my resume and my portfolio as hard as I can for next year, but there's a final issue. GDC takes place during the end of my school term. Being an art student, most of my finals are in the last week of class rather than the dedicated finals week. And even though the number of classes I'm taking is lighter, all of them have more out of class work. If I go to GDC, I have little doubt that my grades will suffer for it. So here's the question folks:

**tl;dr**: Do I accept a slump in my grades in favor of strengthening my resume and my job prospects, or do I finish out college knowing I'll have a harder time finding a job?
And for the record, obviously my entertainment time will take a hit, but I can't give all of it up or I'll go nuts. Thanks for your time, folks.

*edit 1* So I consulted schedules a bit, and I have to revise my previous statement. My grades wouldn't suffer, they'd be shot. I have an exam worth 30% of my grade in one class, and it's the final week to work on a project for another. I can't get a makeup on the exam.

*edit 2 because it seems edit 2 didn't get saved* Thanks all for writing in. Seeing so many people say ""go to GDC"" makes it hard to admit that, despite my desires, I don't think I will be able to attend. Between the dip in cash and the poor class results I know I would receive, I just don't see a way I can manage it this year. Frankly, looking at this in a bigger perspective, I'm thinking GDC is only the tip of my problem iceberg. I'm going to have to reorganize how I approach my future, mostly on timetables and finances. 

This whole thing has left me in rather poor spirits, so I'll stop here. Thank you again for your time, and I'm sorry I wasn't able to reply to more of you in a timely manner. Class permitted me only a quick glance every hour or so. [Have a good night.](http://chzbronies.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/my-little-pony-friendship-is-magic-brony-hugs-for-everypony.gif)

However, I do have a strong passion for web development, and will be sure to stress that point during the interview. They said they wanted a portfolio, but most of the work I have done was in collaboration with real developers/designers who did the heavy lifting.

I was able to land one at an engineering firm near where I was from with the help of a family friend.

It was a fairly large IT dept for a small company, including me there were four of us.  Since I was new and the intern, my domain user did not have admin privileges.

I was assigned a task to do maintenance on some lab PCs; profile clean up and the like.  This work required admin access to the PCs.  I asked for the domain admin password.

The tech I was with gave me an uneasy look and called our manager to see if he could give it to me.  He got the OK and he whispered me the password.  At first I didn't think I understood him, he had whispered ""password.""

Yup the domain admin password was just simply ""password.""  No complexity, no nothing.  I stood in shock for a few minutes.  When asked why they didn't change it, I was told ""its cached everywhere and we're afraid of not being able to sign into something.""

I left the company as soon as my internship was over.  Needless to say, there were other things going on there besides passwords.

Anyone have other admin password horror stories?"
phirm,7,2012-02-09,Graduating Without Having Enough Experience,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/phirm/graduating_without_having_enough_experience/,"Hey everyone,
I wanted to ask a couple of questions about not having enough experience after graduating from undergrad. I want to emphasize that I am *not* concerned with how to go about building more experience, though.

Instead, I want to know about some of the questions I've listed below. It would be extremely helpful if anyone who has experience in any of these things could chime in.

**About entry-level/junior positions:**

* What does it take to get a position at the bigger and competitive/reputable places (Microsoft, Google etc.)? In other words, what are the influences involved in their hiring decisions? Do they only care about the extent of your portfolio and your ability to code? I understand that if you have a lower GPA, but an impressive portfolio that it makes you an attractive candidate... What about the other way around? If you have a great academic record, but at the expense of a portfolio, are you considered to be just as valuable as the former candidate?

* How much do the aforementioned workplaces (or any other good job) care about the school you attended? Is it possible to compete with those graduating from Stanford, MIT, etc. when you are coming from a much smaller school?

**About internships:**

* Is it possible to get an internship with any of these companies after graduating? (I know it's typically a summer thing for sophomores/juniors)

* Once again, how competitive are these internships? 

What I really want to know is, did anyone else find themselves having this similar kind of problem? If you did, were you still able to find success?
... Or is the only way to get jobs/internships at these kinds of places to just wait until I've built up enough experience on my own?


Any advice would be helpful. Thank you."

- graduating BA in CS in May 2013 with ~2.1 GPA from a good university (top 10)
- work history: Java coop @ IBM, web dev (created Groupon clone), test engineer with some kernel work at a small startup, random IT/project management jobs
- personal projects: small open source CLI tools (only one is mildly popular)
- languages: Java, C++, Python, PHP (~1 yr working experience each)

I know I need to improve my GPA, but I've taken enough hours (120+) that it's not going to budge much at this point.

My interviewing / abstract problem solving is weak. I have a hard time coming up with elegant solutions during interviews. Some years I get past first round and get flown out for interviews, other years I don't do so well. I'm not quite sure how to improve myself in this area except interview more.

Due to travel, I don't have an internship this summer and am putting all my hopes into getting in Google Summer of Code.

My question going forward is what I should do to increase my hiring potential:

- BS over BA (delays graduation by 1-2 semesters)
- Study various online material (e.g Open Courseware) and write proof of concept programs (e.g. distributed file systems, computing, game engines, graphic engines)
- Personal projects: Android webview apps, Android game using existing libraries/frameworks, Add GUI to my CLI programs (PyGTK), specialized Reddit clone to learn RoR, Poker Bot (for this [competition](http://www.computerpokercompetition.org/)), a Bitcoin market bot that follows some rough trading strategies in C++

**Lexie** passive aggressively offers to babysit Zola on Valentine's Day (yet she couldn't babysit her for 20 minutes to let Mer &amp; Derek *have at it*).
Merek don't fall for her passive aggressive trap (and they probably don't have time to discuss Lexi's existential issues during breakfast). Although it's kinda cold to show absolutely no interest in her issues. She's conflicted because of Mark and has surely been giving out signals of distress for weeks.
Passive aggression continues with an uninvited lie towards Mark (who by the way should finally take a hint).

The woman who's boyfriend died and who complained that he didn't propose to her for 8 years was a hint to women to sometimes disregard tradition and initiate themselves. Yelling at your SO to propose to you is **r i d i c u l o u s**.    
Anyway, she was also the plot device to give Lexie courage to finally talk to Mark (the locket was the last drop).

She finally went over to Mark's but Avery is there. :D
Impossible situation for her but I think Mark finally got it and something should happen next episode (the writers have been yanking our chains for too long regarding Lexie+Mark).

Mer insensitively complains about her sexlife to **Christina** who's too proud to fight for her marriage. Kinda gives away how self absorbed she is.
Christina tries to get into a conversation with **Owen** by indirect topics (i.e. work); he doesn't want to deal with her as he's already given up on the relationship. (Rightfully so, as Christina has not shown any empathy towards him for a long time).   
Then Owen tackles Christina away from a car which would have hit her (*inside* the hospital; yeah, pretty contrived plot element). This is supposed to remind her of his selflessness (he was there for her after the hospital shooting and decided to put her not wanting to have kids over his desire for kids, so that they can continue the relationship.

Later on he tells her he's going to move out, at least temporarily, not even looking for her reaction (or maybe trying to hide his own).   
She's visibly shaken. I don't know what she expected from her approach (i.e. pretending not to care).

**Richard** plays the good guy again, watching out for the *little people*'s feelings (i.e. April and Lexie) yet showing disregard for Owen's crumbling marriage.

The ""stupid intern guy"" hilariously asked ""So anybody got any Valentine's plans?"" in an OR with Christina, Owen and **Teddy** xD

Owen asks Teddy to be his friend again since he really needs someone to talk to and she lashes out at him for putting the needs of the hospital above her own. Somewhat strange, considering that they both have been in the military and it's pretty clear that additional people would have died had he told her about her husband.
Stellar performance on Kim's part btw.

Teddy vented to **Christina** and that's when Christina started to feel empathy for Owen again. She realized that he even went to Teddy (of all people) in search for someone to talk to.
Maybe because he was there for her after the shootings and always made compromises and became the ChoR, she started seing him as this perfect godlike man who *has* to be perfect.   
Now he's back in his ventilation room and she remembers his fragility which is what brought them together in the first place.   
Mer's monologue in that scene: ""And sometimes all we need to do to ease the pain, is call a simple truce"".         
Now that Christina is feeling empathy for Owen again, they have a chance.   

You probably noticed this earlier but I have to write it down at least once:    
**Alex** is good with kids because his parents weren't present and he had two younger siblings.

**Miranda** performs another display of insecurity: she expected Ben would break up with her because she wasn't on time (what the hell?) and he was fantastic as always.

In case you're wondering where the review for S08E13 is: it was a filler episode.

pj4a3,7,2012-02-10,My life is just an illusion,soultransfer,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pj4a3/my_life_is_just_an_illusion/,"I'm not entirely sure how to go about this.. tears are welling up as I type this because I just never knew my life would come to this. Some back story I suppose is in order so I'll try my best.

If I had to describe my life in one word, it would have to be, illusory. The reason I say this is because I more or less cheated my way through life, habitually lying to others (and for the most part, believing them myself), hiding behind a veneer of happiness or earnestness, and often very cynical. I have gotten this far and have nothing to show for it - yet you may see me in public, may get to know me online, be a friend in real life, or even a family member and you will see otherwise. I think I've lied to the point where I don't know who I am anymore and this is now become me.

I'm 25, unemployed, and currently living with my parents. For me, before experiencing these feelings of self-doubt, depression, and overall bleak self-esteem, my life was on cruise control, at least that's how I think about it. I was smart, athletic, and just sped through my schooling years easily with no hassle. College was the inevitable next step and now that I think about it, probably the first instance where I felt inadequate. My mother is 100% of asian descent so her expectations for her only son to succeed and become a trophy to others was always something she showed on her sleeve. I did not get into an ivy league school, but I did get into a rather reputable private college pretty much on a whim. Even though I did not get into an ivy league, my parents, family, and friends were all happy for me. For the sake of brevity, I'll say my college experience was full of ups and downs (mostly downs) and even though I did end up graduating with honors, I left college with not much to show for it. In similar fashion to high school, I felt as though I got away without having to do much and not really taking the time to really learn anything. I'll be honest, I cheated often to get by, or let others do a lot of the work for things, not apply myself during internships so I guess I have no one to blame except myself.

Maybe this will shed more light about me and my situation as it's clear to me because it happened this week, 2 days ago actually. To appease everyone, I still attempt to get job interviews and was invited by a company for an on-site interview in another state and they fly me out. They send a taxi for me and I'm on my way to the hotel the set up me up in. Looking out the window, for some reason, extreme episode of depressive thoughts seeped into my mind. I began to think, ""Why are you even here?"", ""Just get out and go."", ""I don't want to live like this."", etc. The ONLY thing I wanted to do while in that cab was just stop and leave, forget the interview, go out and be alone without anyone knowing. More suicidal thoughts crept into me and although it's all been mental so far and never actually began to add the physicality of it all, I can feel myself slipping and it's becoming harder and harder to stay afloat. I get to the hotel and I've calmed down a bit and just sit my room. I begin to panic somewhat because it's a big interview and I feel somewhat unprepared, so I practice for that. However, I was tired from the trip and decided to just wake up earlier in the morning.

This is probably one of the worst nights I've ever had in my life. It didn't help the bed was by far the most uncomfortable thing I felt. But I woke up in sweat around 2-3 AM, neck cramped, and these vivid dreams just play in my head and I can't get it out. Just completely random things, but I can't shake them off and can't get back to bed and I just wanted it all to stop. I couldn't tell if it was from a half-waken lucid dream or hallucinations.

That's where I am now. I just got the e-mail saying I didn't get the job (I did think I did well though at the time). My parents don't know yet, they get excited every time they hear about me getting an interview, but I just play along. I'm scared to tell them that it's another failure and I just turned out to be a failure that they spent a fortune on to get me through school with. Not just my parents, friends (I don't have many anymore), other family members, all still think I'm the same ""smart kid who can do anything.""

That's me, that's what I've become. I feel wasted, mentally and physically. I just don't know anything anymore.

pj33b,4,2012-02-10,Help! I don't know what to do anymore.. :(,Honiahaka12,dogs,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/pj33b/help_i_dont_know_what_to_do_anymore/,"Le sigh. I've been dealing with my dog for about 9 months now, which isn't a LONG time but it's long enough to get some kind of training down with a dog.

Here's the sitch. Back in 2012 Summer I adopted a coonhound from out vet school. She was one of the dogs that the vet students get to poke/prod/experiment on to get good enough to be a pro. They don't mistreat them or anything, but it is a sad life IMO. So I went to meet all the dogs and picked her out because something just ""clicked"". 

When I adopted her, she came with all shots and even the paperwork of what had been done to her. Apparently before she was their vet dog, she worked at a prison. She was being trained to hunt down prisoners and attack them, but she failed the test because she was gun shy (she curls up in a yelping heap at the sound of one being fired).

So I take her in and in the first few months she's learned tricks such as ""sit"", ""paw"", ""stay"" (kinda), ""high five"".. and other cute dog tricks. Everything was going good until she learned how to get out of our fenced backyard for the first time (about 2 months after I've had her). I was angry at the time and chased her all throughout the neighborhood. I would call her and she would stop, look at me and then run away again. It pissed me off to no end, but I never called her with an angry tone and I never raised my voice in an angry manner because I wanted her to come to me.

When she FINALLY came to me, on her terms and not mine.. I praised her through gritted teeth. Even though I wanted to beat the shit out of her (which I would never do.. but it's still tempting).. she would wag her tail and we would go on our merry way. I'd patch the hole and everything would be fine. Then she would get out again and do the same thing, and again I would be totally ""happy"" that she came back to me.

This is what's happened the last 9 months or so. It's always been a problem.. but what am I supposed to do?

It's a bigger problem now.

I currently have an internship at a horse breeding farm and my dog has to come with me. Otherwise she's left at home in a kennel for 12 hours and I would feel terrible for that. She's great on a leash and listens to me, when on a leash. There have been two times that she's gotten out of the office that we stay in. Once it was my fault for not making sure the door latched, but tonight it was solely her. She pushed the door opened with her nose and took off into the night.

This pisses me off to no end because I went out after her and called her name, she stopped and looked at me. I called her over and said, ""Hey Rollie! Come here!"" with a big smile and a chipper voice. She took one look at me, stepped towards me.. and then turned tail and ran the other way into one of the pastures. It infuriates me when she does this.

This wouldn't a big deal (just a headache), except we have coyotes/hogs/deer/wild dogs/bobcats and other predators that come after smaller prey.. like a domestic dog. Eventually she comes back to me, which is amazing.. but I can't have her running around like that.
She also has a terrible habit of getting into the horse pastures and barking at them, she won't chase them or hurt them.. just barks. Anyone that knows anything about horses would know that this can send some of them into a frenzy and into a fence really quick. The horses that are being bred here are racing horses. These horses, on average, range between 100,000-400,000 dollars. Especially the pregnant mares that they have.

My internship boss has already warned me that if a horse gets hurt at my dogs expense, then I'm the one to blame and I'll be in a lot of trouble. Which is what I expect really. I wouldn't want some animal chasing down my prized horses.

I know I can leave her at home, but it breaks my heart. My roommates also don't like that she howls while she's in her kennel.

So here I am, on Reddit. Does anyone have any tricks or something that I can use to help her learn to come when called and to stay by my side without a leash on her?

The ones that I've tried are being really ""happy"" when they come over, give them a treat and tell them what a good dog they are. Another is the shock collar.. but I don't know how she'll react and they are a bit pricey. I don't want to make a purchase and have her not respond the right way. Another thing about shock collars that worries me is that some people say it causes a distrust between the dog and owner? She already hides and whimpers when I give her a swat on the bottom for doing things like digging in the trash.

The thought crossed my mind tonight, just to give her to a no kill shelter and get a good dog. I don't want to do that.. but what else can I do?

Help please? My dog is broken and I don't know what to do to fix her. :("

I had been doing a lot of third-floor support which is mostly product design and graphic design. One afternoon, the first-floor handler walks up to me and asks if I want to take care of one of his easier users. Being the eager intern of course I took on the task, no questions asked.

I get downstairs to the user's empty office and wait ~10 minutes for her to return. When she does, she explains that she has been unable to get any pictures off of a disk someone had sent her. I take the disk from her and reach for the tray eject button on the drive.

""Oh, the disk goes inside the computer?!""

Apparently, she had been holding the disk up to the monitor waiting for it to pull pictures down."

Anyways, the question is if I just don't extend my contract with them, but they were expecting me to, is there a downside to this I'm not seeing?

piuyj,0,2012-02-09,Torn between two internships. :&lt;,confused_coder,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/piuyj/torn_between_two_internships/,"Warning: wall of text!


I've been working at a defense company as an software developer intern since 2008 (I'll graduate university with a MS in CS in 2014 after my BS in 2013). Getting good experience at said company, and they let me work on whatever project I want. Lots of interesting work to be had, though I've worked on most of their major products by now. They also got me a very good level of security clearance -- I won't go into that but it's definitely worth something. I am working there this summer.


Today I got a call from a Microsoft recruiter who I had previously talked to. I'm ""at the top of his list"" and he wants me to intern at MS next summer (2013). He warned me against staying in the defense industry, saying that I'll be stuck doing only defense jobs unless I branch out. While I don't totally believe him seeing as I've done work in biology and web hosting, he is right in that it seems nearly all the defense jobs are in the DC area (where I am from). Also, I don't really like DC and want to move after I graduate.


Some pros and cons of going to Microsoft for me below.

Pros:

-Get experience with different technologies and programming languages.

-Get to work at a larger company and see if I like it -- company I work for now has ~300 employees

-Get to leave DC and live in my dream city (Seattle)

-Pay increased by a metric shit-ton. I made $19/hr last summer (likely getting a raise to $21 or $25 this summer). MS paid my buddy $35/hr.



Cons:

-In all honesty, I really am not excited about any MS products that are out there right now. I enjoy the Kinect, but that's about it. Hell, I'm not even sure I'd like to do development for it.

-As I understand it, my security clearance (job security in my eyes, though please correct me if I'm wrong) will be wiped out. It will be near impossible to get the same clearance again if I end up not coming back to defense industry jobs.

-Will have to rent own apartment and have living expenses. At my current internship I can save money, live at home, get (free) home-cooked food, and drive 5 mins to get to work.

-Will not have any freedom as to which project I work on. MS will assign me wherever they think I'm useful and there's a good chance they might want me to be a developer in test (I detest being a tester...see what I did there? ;] )


One question I have: how often does defense work pop up outside of the Virginia/MD/DC area? I think its a great line of work, but I don't want to get stuck like the recruiter mentions. Thanks in advance reddit!

pl4jy,3,2012-02-11,Long Distance Dump and I Feel Like a Chump,dumpedandthrownaway,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/pl4jy/long_distance_dump_and_i_feel_like_a_chump/,"Hey there r/breakups. I've been a bit reticent to speak my mind about what's been ailing me, as it pales in comparison to what so many of you are going through, but in some capacity I feel that much worse for feeling so terrible about this situation...So, I guess I'm really just here to vent/seek impartial advice regarding coping strategies.  

Anyway, I'm a 26 y/o male who is studying out of the country for two years.   Prior to leaving for my first semester I met a girl (also 26) who was a co-worker.  She and I got along swimmingly.  Any time we were hanging out, it was always a blast, and it was fairly obvious that we both had crushes on each other. We finally hooked up before I left, but it was obviously a day late and a dollar short.  So, we continued to communicate every now and again via facebook messages, and it always brightened my day a little bit (I think it's important to note at this point that I think she was kind of seeing someone, although I'm not sure. I didn't really ask). Fast forward four months, I come home and we start hanging out much more frequently, and things really start to develop into something more meaningful.  

So, August rolls around and I had to leave for school again; at this point I'm unbearably sad. I was leaving my friends and family for four months again and I really felt that our relationship (not in the 'official' sense, as we weren't technically together) was simply not strong enough to survive four months of such separation.  But, lo and behold, we continued talking every day on the phone and online.  It sounds really lame, but this really impressed me.  Neither one of us necessarily had to do it, but we wanted to, and it seemed that things might actually work out. So, I spent all of this time becoming emotionally devoted/attached to the girl.

Then around mid-October or so she calls out of the blue and says ""I don't know what you expect when you get home...Things may get messy."" I respond ""well, I don't want to be so presumptuous as to say I EXPECT anything (lying like a rug) but I hope for the best for us, and that we'll be fine."" The next day she implored me to forget that whole thing ever happened.  

So, I come home in mid-December. The past two weeks she had been kind of strange. and I felt that she was trying to distance herself from me. She also had backed out of a trip to come pick me up (one of her friends canceled), and so I had been kind of having weird feelings toward her for it. I get home and I see a message ""are you home?!?"" ""Is there a number where I can reach you?""  So I didn't want to totally give up on the situation...Maybe she's just nervous? I don't know. I hadn't liked a girl this consistently for a long time, and I didn't want to give up that easy. Anyway, I talk to her a day or two later and she's just weird. So I did the manly thing and texted her 'I'm really ambivalent about hanging out because I don't know how you're feeling. what's been going on the past few weeks?'  ""I've been ambivalent too. I started dating someone, so I thought it might be awkward.  I should have told u (sic) sooner.""

I told her I was hurt and I felt like a big dumbass and that's about all I have to say.  She sent me a message back and I didn't even read it. Deleted from facebook, hit the gym, and literally lawyered up (as I had gotten in an accident while I was all screwed up about it that day). Two weeks later it's the day after my birthday and she texts ""happy belated birthday."" and I say ""hey, thanks buddy. I am kind of glad you texted because I kind of wanted to eat crow for being so pissy the other day. Hope your internship goes well."" And I felt so good in that moment. Then she seemed to be intentionally cold to me: ""well, I just wanted to say happy birthday."" I didn't respond. She then asked when I was leaving and if I wanted to hang out before then. I declined. I feel like I handled things as I should have, and I guess part of what I need is affirmation of that from someone impartial.

Anyway, this all happened like a month and a half/two months ago, and I just feel that my response has been disproportionate to the scenario.  I've dealt with a breakup from a (much more meaningful) 3.5 year relationship where the breakup literally lasted 4 years (talk about messy) so I thought this would be a walk in the park. However, it hasn't been. I wake up early in the morning/middle of the night, sometimes thinking of her and just thinking 'how could she do me like that?' She was someone I really trusted to not do me wrong. Sometimes I just spend all day feeling alone and miserable even when I'm hanging out with friends. I have many of the typical signs of depression. I have found that it gets better and worse, but I thought I would certainly be over it by now; it seems that it is worse than it was when I first left home.

I haven't actually seen the girl in like 6 months, and I have no idea how anyone can have such an effect on me. I think that a lot of it had to do with the feeling of loss of control over the situation; she made this decision unilaterally without talking to me, and there was nothing I could do but get her out of my life. I still have this awful idea that I want to talk to her or something. I also feel incredibly selfish for not accepting the fact that her relationship now is probably making her happier than being with someone so far away.

tl;dr: Guy leaves country for four months, comes back to find his love interest is not so interested in him anymore, but more interested in another dude.  Guy is still incommensurately upset about the whole ordeal and would like to stop being depressed about it."

It involves writing your best/most memorable date in San Diego after liking the page.

I'll be honest and confess I work as the FB/Twitter intern there. However, we have a very low amount of 'likes' and I'm very fond of this subreddit (and reddit in general) and I want to open up the chance of winning to people who might actually be interested in the prizes. Our current 'fan base' is not extremely active on the page and I want at least a couple of people to legitimately participate to make the contest fun and interesting.

We have a bunch of coupons and vouchers similar to the one we'll be giving out on Valentine's Day so liking and keeping up with the page won't be too detrimental for ya'll because we'll keep giving out stuff on a decently regular basis. If nobody is too upset, I'll also gladly let everyone know here when those things are happening in case the prize is worth the 'like.' 

The Balboa Passports are valued at $125.00 each. Winner gets two passports. Contest rules will be explained on the page and all you need to participate is 'like' the page and then share with us a fun, memorable date in San Diego.

If you have any questions, let me know.

Thank you!

I've been thinking about death, and how once you are dead, you are dead. There is no magical land of happiness, there is nobody waiting for you on the other side. Nothing but darkness. No more playing, no more loving, no more being you. It makes me worried. It makes me almost want to cry. In fact, as I'm typing this, I'm blinking back tears. I love life, things may be shitty sometimes, but I know there is always tomorrow. Then I realized, at one point there will be no tomorrow, there will be no more me. Just all the silly accomplishments that will soon disappear into history. 100 years after my death, nobody will remember me. It'll be as though I never existed. I wish I were ignorant sometimes. I wish I had belief so that I could reassure myself that my family will be with me when I pass, I'll have someone to hold me when I'm scared, someone to help me continue on when I need it most. As I type right now, I'm crying. I can't help but to. I'm tired of being depressed about something that won't happen for a long time. But I can't get it out of my head. This is helping a bit, letting out what I have to say. Though I know ultimately, this will go overlooked, and the 5 minutes I've spent typing this has been 5 minutes less I have doing something that actually matters. I have terrible grades, right now I have a 2.4, in my junior year, and have no idea what I want to do. I keep getting pressured to make a decision, and yelled at that what I'm doing is wrong. I feel like after high school, life is over. I have to actually figure out what I'm going to do, how to live, and how to function in society. I'm just not ready for that though, I feel like I have so much more exploring to do, so many things I still have to try before I'm stuck with adulthood where my mess ups change from: OOPS, OH WELL! to: You're homeless. I'm having trouble finding a direction in life, mostly because the things I'm good at, aren't what I want to do when I grow up. I'm good at computers, I'm a fast learner, but my grades right now prevent me from going to a college to get a degree so I can actually turn my skill into a job. I want to be a mechanical engineer, mostly because of all the fun I've had at an internship, and every time I tell my parents that I don't want to go to college, I get yelled at. At this point, I feel like a complete mess up, I'm ruining my life day by day. My depression makes it harder to focus in school, which makes it near impossible to get good grades. I'm currently looking for a psychologist so I can maybe get some medication for my severe depression, but it's taking a while finding the right fit for me. At this point, it's just been me rambling, and not asking a real question. I'm looking for an alternative to college, something that will help me pursue a career in computer science, or mechanical engineering. Do you guys know of anything in Oregon that is like that? Also, any recommendations for my depression? Right now I feel completely alone, and am in need of some light to guide me down the path to a happier life. Please, I'm desperately in need of help.....
TLDR; I'm a depressed whiner who can't make up his mind about what he can do with his shitty life."

But it made me think of my ex because I had given her my copy of Tania's book to read and she absolutely loved it and she was a huge art person. I just thought about how much she would have enjoyed being there and seeing all of that amazing art and finally getting to meet Tania too.... I guess I'm just really not over it and it is still tender. So anyone up for a cheer up post?"

[X-Post]",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/pkezp/ive_made_great_strides_in_the_last_year_but_still/,"Pre TL;DR: Fucked up childhood spent entirely by myself, almost no free-time, no friends. What do/how fix?

I've personally made leaps and bounds over the last year or so with my social life and self-image. I've slimmed down and lost over 75 pounds, mostly cleared up my face with the help of r/wicked_edge, and started dressing nicer thanks to r/malefashionadvice. I also realized that being 6'6"" doesn't make me a freak, and that I can actually be attractive. I've started being a lot more outgoing, less shy, and generally don't avoid social settings any more. r/askseddit has been awesome for making me see that I was being a complete AFC/Nice Guy™, and I've pretty much stopped being Mr. Friend Zone Magnet.

What I've had a considerably harder time with is actually getting out and doing things, due to a large combination of factors:

* Going to a small, technical school/community college with almost no common-areas/school events. Each major is essentially the same people moving in one group from class to class, never getting larger. All 5 of my classes take place in 3 rooms, with the same 10 people every day/class. Like Majors are grouped together in Gen-Eds, so instead of being an opportunity for meeting women, it's a giant clusterfuck of CS/Engineers. To make matters worse, the building all my classes are in is off by itself, and houses all the sciencey/technical classes.
* I work ~30 hours a week: 24 at a (paid) internship, and ~8 during the week as a CNA at a Nursing Home. The CNA hours are all evening hours, generally two days a week from 5:30pm-9:30pm. Every other weekend, I work from 2:45pm-10:45pm Saturday and Sunday, so that's pretty much two entire weekends a month wasted.
* I still live at home. Although I live in a smallish rural town, I'm just ~35 mins away from Sioux Falls, SD, the biggest city in South Dakota(not saying much, when compared to Minneapolis/St. Paul). College/Internship is there, and Nursing Home is a 5-minute walk from my house. The town is almost stereotypical in that it's full of all the people that couldn't escape/got pregnant in junior-high/barely scraped by on their GED and never gave a thought to anything beyond that.

All of the above has pretty much ground me into a routine of: classes -&gt; work -&gt; homework -&gt; shower -&gt; reading/Reddit -&gt; bed at midnight/1am -&gt; get back up at 6:45am and repeat. Only having 4 days a month completely work-free and to myself has pretty much ruined any chance I have of having a normal social-life.

I really don't regret the above, because it's enabled me to maintain a 3.8+GPA, and just yesterday I paid my last tuition payment off in it's entirety, and am currently ~$2K in the black. My internship is going extremely well, and in about 11 months they're quite likely to give me a job-offer that I'll probably accept, while taking night-classes for my Bachelors in Programming.

I might add that I was born in Japan, my father being a missionary/pastor, and pretty much spent my whole life up until 18 there. Due to complicated shit involving, but not limited to:

* Never really staying in one place for much more than 3-4 years while in Japan, and being almost completely isolated while there due to never really learning fluent Japanese
* Mild ADD/ADHD that I've managed to get/work beyond.
* A mis-diagnosis of Tourette's syndrome that lead to some pretty serious over-medication that left me a zombie for most of my middle-school and high-school years.
* The ""Tourettes"" resulted in me being sent to a school for the mentally-handicapped for 3 grades around middle-school.
* Being sent to a ""youth-home""/boot-camp in the armpit of Montana for all of my high-school years. Run by a stereotypical christian fundamentalist husband/wife. Imagine the type of people who talk about Obama being a Muslim, and not even having an American birth certificate. Every aspect of their lives and personalities was in some way linked to God/church/the Bible.

All of this led to me being a loner my entire life, never having friends for much more than 2 years at a time, with parents who never really trusted me.

With the above wall-o-text said, I have no friends outside of class, almost no free-time, and no idea what to do with myself when I do have some. I really don't want to spend this weekend reading/puttering around on personal projects. I'm planning on bouncing around town tomorrow, but really have no idea of how to fill a day or what to actually do with myself beyond crashing in Barnes &amp; Noble all day. I have no idea where the college bars are, and no one to tell me. Any suggestions?

Only having 4 days a month completely work-free and to myself has pretty much ruined any chance I have of having a normal social-life.

I really don't regret the above, because it's enabled me to maintain a 3.8+GPA, and just yesterday I paid my last tuition payment off in it's entirety, and am currently ~$2K in the black. My internship is going extremely well, and in about 11 months they're quite likely to give me a job-offer that I'll probably accept, while taking night-classes for my Bachelors in Programming.

I might add that I was born in Japan, my father being a missionary/pastor, and pretty much spent my whole life up until 18 there. Due to complicated shit involving, but not limited to:

* Never really staying in one place for much more than 3-4 years while in Japan, and being almost completely isolated while there due to never really learning fluent Japanese
* Mild ADD/ADHD that I've managed to get/work beyond.
* A mis-diagnosis of Tourette's syndrome that lead to some pretty serious over-medication that left me a zombie for most of my middle-school and high-school years.
* The ""Tourettes"" resulted in me being sent to a school for the mentally-handicapped for 3 grades around middle-school.
* Being sent to a ""youth-home""/boot-camp in the armpit of Montana for all of my high-school years. Run by a stereotypical christian fundamentalist husband/wife. Imagine the type of people who talk about Obama being a Muslim, and not even having an American birth certificate. Every aspect of their lives and personalities was in some way linked to God/church/the Bible.

All of this led to me being a loner my entire life, never having friends for much more than 2 years at a time, with parents who never really trusted me.

With the above wall-o-text said, I have no friends outside of class, almost no free-time, and no idea what to do with myself when I do have some. I really don't want to spend this weekend reading/puttering around on personal projects. I'm planning on bouncing around town tomorrow, but really have no idea of how to fill a day or what to actually do with myself beyond crashing in Barnes &amp; Noble all day. I have no idea where the college bars are, and no one to tell me. Any suggestions?

TL;DR: Fucked up childhood spent entirely by myself, almost no free-time, no friends. What do/how fix?"
pkbmk,7,2012-02-10,Sexxit: Is Sex a legitimate reason to end a relationship?,[deleted],sex,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/pkbmk/sexxit_is_sex_a_legitimate_reason_to_end_a/,"I'll preface this by saying that sex isn't the only reason behind my doubts as to whether or not I want to continue dating my girlfriend, but it does weigh heavily.  We have a lot of disagreements over school and money and whatever else.  If fact we're currently staring down the barrel of a long distance relationship as I'm leaving for an internship over the summer and she's staying to do... whatever.  However, what I currently find most frustrating is our sex life, or lack thereof.

As a college student I feel surrounded by sex, so much so that I feel upset that I'm no longer having any.  My girlfriend and I used to have a very active sex life; everything seemed fine.  Then we both got very busy last semester and our sex life fell off a metaphorical cliff.  Every once and a while we'd make time for it, but while it seemed great to me apparently she just wasn't that into it.  I always felt a great deal more open to it than she.  It started to seem as if she was avoiding it.

I've brought it up many times that I'm frustrated about this.  I personally feel that it's an important part of an intimate relationship, and that once you've established that kind of relationship, it's unreasonable to renegotiate, so to speak.  Her typical response is to accuse me of being some sort of machismo pig, saying that I'm giving her an ultimatum to have sex or I'll leave her, an act that she says would basically be on par with rape.

I see do see her point.  I obviously don't want to have sex because that's what keeps us together.  And I was partly to blame for often having other things I needed to do rather than spend time with her.  But still, am I being unreasonable here?  What would you do if your partner didn't want a sexual relationship while you did?  

And sorry for the essay, I appreciate anyone who takes the time to read it."

This is a 2nd account because my fiancee knows my main account info and I don't want him to see this and get hurt. 

To start off with, I have been with my fiancee for 2 years and 4 months now. We love each other very much. We have been through terrible and wonderful things. For the most part we have had a great relationship. 

BUT recently things have changed. He recently developed an anxiety disorder from all the stress in his life. It started in Nov. of 2010. He went to basic training and hurt his back pretty bad. He was medically discharged from the National Guard. The National Guard was his life and he planned everything. But when he was discharged everything changed. He came back home to live with his grandparents. His grandparents moved while he was at training and they could never go live back at the house my fiancee grew up in. He became depressed about that. He had no idea what to do with himself. Then in Jan of 2011 I had a huge fight with my parents and went to go live with my fiancee and his grandparents. 

For about 6 months we did nothing. No school. No job. Nothing. His grandparents were very nice to have us live and eat there rent free. Then his mother came to live with us too. That is where a lot of family drama stated. And his two aunts added to the mixture, constantly screwing other members of the family for their own benefit. 

In the summer I got a job and started to pay off my car again to my dad. Saved quite a bit of money. He still didn't have a job though. Then my job ended (it was only a 90 day internship) in August and he got a job around that time. So things were ok.

Until his grandfather was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer in the neck. It devastated my fiancee. And I think it really began to depress him. Then in early October my fiancee had to quit his job. He was getting panic attacks everyday at work. The best part was he didn't have any insurance then either. So we were then back to neither one of us having a job, both of us being depressed and not doing anything. The panic attacks kept getting a lot worse. His grandparents had some Xanex to help him through it all but it didnt work that great. 

Finally in December he was able to insurance again and able to see a doctor. Also in December we finally moved and signed up for school. Things were looking better. The doctor prescribed him Lorazepam and we just had to wait and see if it would help his panic attacks. 

Well we started going to school last month and moved in but the meds the doctor gave him didn't work. So the doctor upped the dosage. And ever since then he has changed. He is a very sweet person in nature but lately...he has anger flashes, says the meanest things and can't control what he does or says. His panic attacks are decreasing but He turns into a gigantic asshole. And I can't stand it anymore. I love him so much. And I want the best for him. I just don't know how to deal with it. I do so much for him. And he doesn't give much back because of the side effects of the meds. 

Please 2X, give me any advice you have. I really need it. I don't know what to do besides get mad at him then feel like a jerk because its a side effect of the meds he is taking. Please help. 

**TL;DR:**My fiancee and I have been together 2 yrs and 4 months. The past year got him really depressed and he developed anxiety disorder. He finally saw the doctor and they prescribed him Lorazepam. The medicine is making the horrible panic attacks go away but turning him into a gigantic ass because it's one of the side effects. I don't know how to deal with it. I get angry at him all the time because of the things he says. Please help."

pmd0i,15,2012-02-12,Technical Internship Interview Ideas/Tips,Psyko_Koolaid,Theatre,https://www.reddit.com/r/Theatre/comments/pmd0i/technical_internship_interview_ideastips/,"I want to begin by saying that I am in no way the ultimate authority on this, and it is very likely that I’m not the first person to come up with these ideas. These are just my observations after sitting in a conference room all day doing 10 minute interviews with students/recent grads that were primarily looking for internships. I’m the ATD of a medium sized, professional summer theatre company.  I’ll be spending all of next Saturday interviewing people at another large audition/interview conference, and I wanted to post my current thoughts.

First things first, breathe. I understand you really want a job, and that there is a lot of stress that goes along with interviewing. The first thing I’m going to do when you come for an interview with me is shake your hand. Give me a nice firm handshake in return and calmly introduce yourself. I’m not going to bite, and I’m not going to brutally interrogate you.  I say this because I had many interactions this weekend where people were so nervous that their hands were shaking throughout the interview. I may not exactly look soft and cuddly, but I’m also not Santa Fe Opera. (Not that they are terrifying in any way either, just using a well known name to make a point.) The worst thing that could happen to you in the next 10 minutes is that you don’t impress me. While that isn’t desirable, it’s not a reason to torture yourself.


My next bit of advice may seem obvious but be aware of the time constraints. If this is an event where interviews are tightly scheduled do your best to stick to it. Be on time, and be aware of how long you’re spending on explanations/questions. If you bring your portfolio don’t expect to be able to cover it all in a 10 minute time slot. Ideally I’m going to want to look at and discuss your resume, and chat in general about your experience level and/or goals. In my mind I want to try and gauge how well you would fit a position in both personality and skill. I do want to see the portfolio, but I don’t want that to be the bulk of a first interview. Pick out a few key pages and explain the relevant parts until about 1 minute before your slot ends. I will always ask questions if I have them.


Do your research, and come with questions. Knowing a little something about the company you are interviewing for goes a long way. If I don’t have to take 1-2 minutes to explain the kind of work we produce that leaves us more time to talk about your skills and examine your work. Take 5 minutes of your own time to check out our season and look at some photos, and if you want more specific information ask me. One or two intelligent questions will make you stick out.
I saw a lot of freshman and sophomore students who had a resume full of any credit they could list. I understand the necessity of doing this in your first few years. I had to do it too. Several times when I asked these students what they specialized in or what they were looking for they would answer, “Everything,” or “Anything.” No. You can’t specialize in everything. I want you to have a well rounded knowledge of technical work, but I want you to have a passion for a more specific area within it. Pick an area that suits your strengths, or that you want to hone your skill in. *In my opinion* there is nothing wrong with saying something like, “I got my start as a carpenter, but I’ve developed an interest in electrics so I’ve also been taking as many electrician positions as I can in the past year.”


My last bit of advice is to be excited and engaged. I’m likely doing interviews all day. You’re likely to be doing the same thing. If you come to me with zero confidence or are so anxious that you can’t hold a conversation it doesn't give me much to go with in terms of approximating your abilities or personality. If you’re really tired, or really nervous, fake it. Sit up straight, look me in the eyes and smile. If I can’t get you engaged in the interview I’m likely to lump you in with the mob of people who I know I interviewed, but can’t remember a thing about. Don’t barrage me with fake pep, but be warm and honest. If my BS meter goes off that is the first thing I’m going to remember. I like to challenge people. If I’m asking a lot of questions it’s because I’m trying to get you to break out of the standard, ‘safe’ responses. I want you to sell yourself as a whole person, not just as your resume.
Again, I’m not the final word on any of this. There are other people who have other priorities. These are the things that matter to me when I talk with people looking for internships. Everyone interviews differently, and some of this becomes less crucial in longer interviews or on a 2nd or 3rd interview. Still, I feel that the some of the general ideas are useful in any interview.


**tl;dr**

* 1. Be calm. It’s an interview not an interrogation.
* 2. If you only have 10 minutes, use them well.
* 3. Know who you’re talking to.
* 4. Be well rounded, but have specific skills/goals.
* 5. Be confident and honest. I want to hire a person, not a resume.

plyro,36,2012-02-12,Highschool student with sysadmin aspirations. Where do I start?,aloha2436,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/plyro/highschool_student_with_sysadmin_aspirations/,"So the first thing I knew when I was younger was that when I grew up I wanted to do something with computers. They're just cool. I have a thing for systems and complexity, and have always enjoyed finding out how to do things myself and apply them to different problems.  
  
So my question is twofold:  
With how I've described myself, would I enjoy being a sysadmin?  
Secondly, what should I do if this is my aim?   
I'm currently doing an IT/Math/Management heavy courseload for my final years of high school, but my main concern is where to go after.  
Should I get a four year degree?  
Should I go straight for an internship?  
Should I focus on certs or similar things?  
As a side note, I run a home server with linux installed for fun, but I find that it's time consuming to self-learn it, and I haven't found anything particularly useful for learning linux. Is there anything you would reccomend?  
TL;DR What should an aspiring sysadmin in high school do? What did you do? Did it work well? Would you do anything different?

plvua,16,2012-02-12,Stories?,FearlessEyes,BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/plvua/stories/,"I've read all the stories underneath the 'birth stories' category on the sidebar. I was just wondering if anyone had some stories that weren't shared there, or, if you have a specific way you'd like your labor to go? I'll start~!

My BEST FRIEND (and sister in law) just had her baby at 4:57pm, July 11th (She was over due. We always joked how she would be overdue and I would be early and we'd have the babies on the same day. Well...) and we had just gotten back home from a day of visiting her in the hospital and spending time with family. My fiance had just went to bed since he had a long day ahead of him for work. Me being 36 weeks pregnant.. I didn't exactly like to sleep when he slept (I wanted the WHOLE bed.) and I cleaned while he was sleeping a lot. well, I had just sat down after some rigorous cleaning and I had coughed and felt some fluid leak out. I thought 'DAMN IT I peed again.' so I got up, emptied my bladded. Opted to leave my pants OFF and continue cleaning. I knelt down to pick something up and suddenly.. more leaking on the floor! Except a lot more than what just a trickle of pee would be. My first instinct was to get down even lower and smell it. Did NOT smell like urine at all. I jump up. Excited as all high hell because I was 99% sure my water broke. At this time it was 12am. I run into the room, tell my fiance my water broke and his response was 'WHAT!? Okay.' and went back to sleep. I shook my head and decided to pack. Realizing I have NO bags to put stuff in (except for my old highschool backpack that I refuse to part with) I call my mom's house. my 15 year old sister answered the phone.
Me: ASHLEY. is mom there?
Ashey: ... -suspicion in voice- ..She's sleeping.. what.. why....?
Me: My water broke.
Proceed to hear phone fly across the house and her scream 'MOM! MOM MOM MOM MOM' as she races down the hallway. 
Go to wake up fiance again. 'STEPHEN. I'M IN LABOR' 
'OKAY. -back to sleep-'
My sister and her friend who happened to be sleeping over come over and help me pack. I tell them to beware of wetspots. all I get is an 'EWH THAT'S WHAT I STEPPED IN!?' 

After 5 more attempts of waking up fiance and one FINALLY being successful (after punching him in the crotch lightly [I play dirty.]) we begin our 30 minute drive to the city. at the outskirts of the city awaits my other good friend who decided to come and help with anything for the first 4 hours of my labor.

I was MISDIAGNOSED with MRSA. it's contagious. SO I WAS ON QUARANTINE. Doctors treated me like shit until I got into the actual delivery room. When I arrived in the delivery room my contractions were steady and I was at 4cm. Here's the kicker. I don't remember 75% of my labor. There are video recordings of me SCREAMING my head off. I only remember crying. LADIES. if you ask for an epidural MAKE SURE YOU REQUEST that it is only the attending/head anesthesiologist doing it. I'm not afraid of needles but the thought of a needle going into my SPINE and not being allowed to move while they were doing it TERRIFIED ME. I got an intern. HE STUCK ME THREE TIMES before he got the actual attending. I was vomiting and crying because I was terrified. My anesthesiologist was great though. He tried to make me feel better with little jokes. like 'Is this your first time? MINE TOO!' I called him an ass a few times. He said I'd be back in 9 months ;) After the epidural I was in HEAVEN. Until.. It stopped working on the right half of my body. the screaming started again apparently. my sister told me she had called my mother (who was in the room with us) and she said that all she heard was screaming. She was convinced I was dying. Next thing I know I'm telling the doctors it feels like I have to crap. Literally. They checked me and I was at 8-9 centimeters! Almost time to push! We quickly rushed visitors (My other BFF and her boyfriend came to visit and wait for baby to be born.) out of the room as the nurses began to talk me through things (BIRTHING CLASSES ARE A WASTE OF TIME. I FORGOT EVERYTHING/DISREGARDED ALL ADVICE) Suddenly I was at 10cm and it was time to push. it was a strange sensation. On one half of my body I was completely numb. The other half I could feel EVERYTHING. The doctors told me she would be out by 5:30pm (July 12th. It was 4:15 at this point) There were my words. ""FXCK THAT I WANT HER OUT BY FIVE."" and I began to push. Nothing on one half. burning on the other. NOW LADIES. when a doctor tells you to stop pushing and pant like a dog.. FOR HEAVENS SAKE. LISTEN. That means that the chord is wrapped around the babies neck and they have to remove it. After that little ordeal it was time to push again. After some more pushing Evelyn came out. at 4:52pm. July 12th. 23 hours and 55 minutes after my BFFS baby was born. All the pain was gone. All I could do was cry tears of happiness. And that is my story."
plqdm,12,2012-02-12,I feel like I will be unsuccessful...:(,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/plqdm/i_feel_like_i_will_be_unsuccessful/,"So i'm currently going for a CS degree at my university.  I have 1 more semester to go, and i just feel like i'm the worst programmer ever.  I understand the concepts, and can chug out code if i have to, but i don't necessarily enjoy doing it.  I got into CS because i generally like computers, tech, and gaming, so i felt CS was related to that, plus it was more financially stable compared to the music education degree i wanted to do before.

Anyways, I will have a potential internship lined up for the summer, but i feel that i'm just ill equipped to be in the CS field.  I have never programmed anything outside of school assignments (open source, etc) i only know the basics of java, C, and Python, nothing too advanced.  Don't necessarily like coding.  I have thought about possibly picking up some books on game coding, and trying to create stuff and try to get it on the xbox live indy game section. In hopes of getting some personal projects on my resume.  however i don't know if i even have the drive to do that.

I guess i'm posting this to try to get some direction.  Maybe the CS direction wasn't for me?  I only have 1 more semester though.  I keep thinking how things would be if i went back in time and went for a music degree instead.  I probably know more about music than i know about programing and CS with the 3 and a half years combined.

I have the feeling i will be an unsuccessful CS graduate.  It's tough to admit.  Thing is that at this point i've lost all desire to properly do something about it.  Guess i got burned out."

I'm 18, and a freshman in college. I attend a very prestigious university where it's hard enough for most students to make it out with decent GPAs but I'm taking this on as a single mother (I gave birth about six weeks ago).

It's been extremely difficult since the new semester started because I don't have anyone to watch my daughter, so just making it to class is a blessing. My family lives about 5-6 hours away so they can't help me out. I do have friends, but they're so busy with their own schoolwork and kids that asking them for help would be unrealistic. Along with this, I'm extremely behind on my academic progress because I haven't been able to take a full course load (I am taking less classes than the normal student because I need time to tend to my newborn daughter). I'm already pretty much guaranteed to graduate a semester or even a year late.

My parents are trying to convince me to transfer to a school close to home so I can live with them and get help with the baby. I'm trying to get into med school so I need time to focus on my studies, internships, extracurricular activities, etc., time that my parents feel will be available to me if they help me with my daughter.

I'm hesitant about moving back in with them though. After having lived by myself, I realized how uncomfortable it is to have to live with others. I also definitely do not want to push my responsibilities as a parent to my own parents. I am my daughter's mother, and I want to play that role fully. I don't know how comfortable I would be with having my own mother ""mother"" her in a sense. I also have this feeling of crippling failure when I think of moving back in with them, as if I had to because I could not handle this on my own. I most certainly can handle this on my own, but moving in with my parents would, I admit, make things ten times easier and allow me to graduate sooner.

So what should I do? Should I just stick it out and try to do this on my own? Or should I let my parents help?"

I'm not sure how far that goes. I have had thoughts of suicide in the past but lately I just find my day to day life upsettingly alone.

I have always found it hard to fit in with other people. When I was 11 I was moved to the US because of my fathers job, my two older sisters already at uni. I was completely alone, 3500 miles from my family, and I was in a small American town where I was outcast by my peers and viciously bullied because of my location of birth. I would show up twice maybe three times a week in the principals office, covered in bruises, only to be suspended while my attackers parents were apologised to; my school administrators were bigots. But I am not here to cry about that. I just want you to know that at 11 I had to 'grow up' , alone, and since I have never fit in with other people.

I left my parents to move back to the UK 2 years ago to start uni. I have a good group of friends, mostly male but there are a couple of girls who we were living with last year. I hear a lot on Reddit about the friend-zone, I wouldn't say I have this problem because I don't feel that way about any of my friends. That's what they are, friends. But now that everyone is starting to settle down from our fresher-year antics they are all pairing up and finding people to go out with. 

And I am alone. On a computer science course with 4 girls and 80 odd guys. Everyone I know knows all the girls from their home towns, and from their courses, a couple of them are quite the 'players' for lack of a better term. I often wonder if that's why I gravitated to them as friends. Out of respect.. jealousy perhaps. Whereas I have no home town, and the three 'friends' I could claim from the US are guys, and too far away. Everyone here goes home for the weekends, to go to the pubs with their friends. And I sit here in my house. Alone.

I don't know anyone to ask out, let alone anyone I even want to get to know. I am English but I have been away from the UK for so long that outside this little group of people I don't know anyone. 

And lately I find myself pushing people away. I refuse to go out on group nights out because I drink too much, the stress of group events. I have (stupidly) confessed my depression to some people in the past, but it was pawned off as being the alcohol, and in the morning I have always been too embarrassed to bring it up. My friends just think I am an angry person because I expect a lot of the world. They don't know that I spend most of my time crying because I can't handle the responsibility of life, given the emptiness of my own.

The one 'relationship' I have had in my two years of uni, if you can even call it that, was with one of the girls on my course. A sweet girl, we started talking, it was clear there was something there. We kept trying to hook up but friends and house mates dramas always kept us on our feet. I had an intern-ship over the summer and we texted and talked constantly. She got me through the work day, she said good night. I lived alone over the summer by the way. All summer, with no friends in the city, they were all home with their friends from their home towns. I am not proud to admit it but I was dependent on those texts. And by the end of summer I thought we had such a shot together, and that love was twinkling in our eyes. Well... That didn't pan out. We tried, and I realised she wasn't the person I thought. Or at least it became clear we were 'too' different. And as sad as I was I wanted to be friends, but she took it as an insult; bridge well and truly burned.

I feel very self-conscious writing this. I don't want to give a 'life story' or to sound like I am whining. I just want someone to have heard this. Even just partially reading it. Because I don't know many people. And it would be nice to know that someone knows that this is how I feel. And that it's not alcohol talking, and it's not me being melodramatic.

Right now I have a goal for myself. And I hope it's not an unrealistic one. In the past it was to 'find a girlfriend', as if that would magically solve all my problems. No. My goal for the next month or so is to start consistently waking up without fresh tears on my face. I hope that if I can manage that that I can start to feel better about myself, and my life. Because I don't want to kill myself. From what I have seen there is so much to life. There is so much I haven't experienced, the joy, namely. And I want to. But I can't shake the feeling that for me it won't happen."

How much information should I include?

I graduated from a great university in June 2011 with a B.S. in computer science but I do not have a real working experience in the field. **How should I explain my lack of experience (if necessary)?**

The reason why I do not have an experience is because my parent brought me to the US illegally as a child. I could not work or intern anywhere. Every summer, in high school and college,(except senior year) I waited tables at restaurants to make money since I did not qualify for financial aids.

I tutored for free at my school and worked on some projects. I self-taught myself objective-c and iphone development. I released an app and currently working on a game. The was not successful but I did learn a great deal from it.

After college my bf asked me to marry him :D , I just acquired a work permit and now looking for a job. But I feel that I am wayyy behind of other candidates because of my lack of experience. I don't know how to explain lack of experience in the cover letter since I am embarrassed of my past."

So earlier today I posted an article from the Daily Texan that talks about Test PAC. What that article didn’t mention, is that we are looking for campus coordinators of the UT Austin campus. Basically, you would be pretty involved in Test PACs planning &amp; execution to defeat Lamar Smith. Your responsibilities would be primarily:

* You would be an admin on the “Vote Against SOPA Co-Sponsor Lamar Smith” Facebook page, and would be responsible for inviting people from UT Austin to that page.
* Weekly conference calls on Skype for 15-30 minutes
 *You would be responsible for helping us develop a “plan of attack” to get UT students to vote against Smith in the GOP primary. 

Also, if you’d like to try and get internship credit for this, then we’d be more than happy to fill out an necessary paperwork to make that happen. 
 
Anyone interested should email me at testpacinfo@gmail.com.

Lastly, just a note to the mods of this subreddit. If you don’t want me posting Test PAC related stuff here, please just let me know. This stuff is relevant to UT Austin, but still I understand if it’s not kosher.

Best,
Scott Bloomberg

pnbro,11,2012-02-13,"Bad mental health hospital experience. Not as abusive as others, I'm sure, but for me it became the symbol of my entire existence's dysfunction. (Pure venting, rambling, don't read it unless you really want to)",[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/pnbro/bad_mental_health_hospital_experience_not_as/,"I have very bad memories from when I walked to a hospital (medical) and asked for help about being suicidal. I was left half naked, fishbowled in the ER for over 24 hours, no one to talk to, just forms to fill out vicariously. A social worker treated me like I was a criminal for wanting to kill myself. Strange disdain from doctors as well. I took up room that could have been used for injured people. I did not know they would put me in the ER.

I was transported by police to a mental hospital. I was treated with active contempt by a medical doctor there, who got me out of my room late at night for tests.

I finally fell asleep, exhausted from crying. So loudly I knew I was keeping someone up in the other rooms. No one complained.

I woke up to three people walking into the room. A man introduced himself and the other two, who were women. Doctor, doctor, medical student. I was sitting in bed, without pants. I was dazed from the past two days.

I did horribly, filling out this vicarious form. The doctor looked at his wrist as I spoke, as if there was a watch on it, then rolled his eyes to look up at the valid existence beyond me that I was keeping him from with my presence in his perception. The medical student audibly called me an asshole on the way out of the room, speaking to the woman doctor who I believe was an intern. One of the questions was, ""do you hear people saying negative things when you walk away from them?"". I couldn't remember any specific time that had happened. But it happened then. I really have no idea what caused them to behave like this. It seems very unusual.

They wanted me out that day. I wasn't really suicidal apparently. The female doctor came back in to speak to me after I tried to express this new dimension of hopelessness I did not know existed until after trying to get help with my already overwhelming hopelessness to the nurses through their forms. She reluctantly decided that I could stay an extra night. She acted like I was a whining child getting a treat. ""I couldn't talk to anyone. I felt I was either going to buy a tank of helium and kill myself that night, or try to get help. I thought that I would have plenty of time to change my mind in the long walk to the hospital on the other side of town. I didn't change my mind. I need help."" I said this to a chant of condescending ""fair enough""s. Oh, and also, a ""that's a *very* long walk, [fat boy]"" thrown in. (To be fair, my weight may not have played into it. Still very condescending.)

I was a big boy and ate my dinner. Thanks for checking nurse. (not horrible in itself. But I had waited so long for *someone* to *talk* to.)

Just fill in the gaps with violent weeping into a rag, waiting for the next thing to happen. The rag became too wet to be of any use, used a towel.

A young male nurse came in and gave me a note with a number on it. ""Your dad called, you have to call him and give him this code in order for us to let him talk to you."" This code was to protect my privacy. . . Somehow my father found out I was at the mental hospital. Not supposed to be legal, but apparently the social worker at the first hospital thought it was okay to call him and let him know that I *might* be at a specific mental hospital. He's a psychiatrist, so surely he would know how to make the situation better. Just like he did the 22 years I lived with him. (i'm a fucking cliche) Female nurse came in to ~~make sure I wasn't planning on suing the hospital for breach of privacy~~ console me.

The next morning I was up early, sitting crosslegged, humbly in the ""authority chair"" of the room. The one the lead doctor sat in the morning before. They walk in with two quick knocks. ""You're up. [can't believe it, you lazy sack of shit]"". I'm asked questions. I answer them more directly than before, having given up on being respected as a human being capable of having meaningful feelings. After being told I changed my mind about killing myself at the hospital, I denied it. And so I was reluctantly told that he thought I could receive treatment at that hospital.

I didn't want to stay. I wanted to talk to my therapist. I regretted so much not just talking to her. The female doctor had spoken with her over the phone, and apparently was caused to have new empathy for me, (once given an alternative to the authoritative ""lets hate this guy"" of the lead doctor), and even had a sympathetic tone when she said ""yes"", after I said that I wanted to speak with my therapist.

I didn't trust my therapist because I felt she didn't respect me enough and was a little condescending. I told her this the day I left the hospital. She stopped being condescending, and listened to me with less assumptions. Or at least she acts like she does very well, which is enough I guess. I know the alternative now.

I cut my arm for the first time, (22 years old). I did it during one of my regular fits of remembering the experience. It gave me a fucking complex or something. I think about it every day. It makes me feel more suicidal than any other thoughts do now. It's come to represent so much! I was mistreated as a young child, this affected my behavior, which caused me to be mistreated as an older child, which affected my behavior, which caused me to be mistreated as an adolescent, and so on until we reach the now, where I'm treated with disdain and contempt by the last people who would ever help a person.

I will fight lethally before I am ever dragged into a mental hospital again. I will never allow people to cause me to feel that extreme of societal rejection again--that which does not have a word that I know of, a kind of seperateness that occurs in the mind, not lonely, very different, complete existential invalidation. I will kill and kill myself before I allow it to happen again. My story is just what I have now. The dead surface skin I can shed off into the internet. It's not what happened. I am not a story. No one is a story. They held me to their story. Their simple story. Less than human.

Although my therapist said condescending things much less than before, she never showed real sympathy for the hospital experience, which had come to represent all of the unhealth of my life. You see, she is an expert, and has much experience working in a hospital like the one I was in. She knows very well that they are bad. My experience, she had a story for. Because she has so much experience about the subject, there is no event concerning it that she can't predict and understand completely, without needing to hear about it. She is fairly old, and has this mentality of experts are authority, mistakes are so rare. Mistakes are not rare. There is no such thing as authority, except in the very practical. The authority of the lead doctor's disdain for me is what allowed the medical student to say a disparaging thing about me in earshot while I was in the most vulnerable state of my adult life. Authority of his expertise is what allowed him to not question his decision that I wasn't really suicidal. I have unusual ways of expressing things. Apparently I'm a fucking anomaly. One so obscure it's not worth exploring.

Just needed to type this into somewhere."

Me and my girlfriend had an awesome relationship we had been talking about marriage for the past year and she had already picked out where we were going to get married, how the wedding was going to be and so on. The day before the breakup everything was great, we were looking at wedding rings for the upteenth time, talking about whether we should get diamonds or gemstones and having a really great time. literally the next day she texted me saying ""im not feeling the same""

 she had been acting funny but i just shook it off and said I'll come over after you get off class so we can talk about it. she got out of class 2 hours early and texts me to come over i said okay, before I'm able to leave my house she sees me on facebook chat and messages me. she then begins to say that she doesn't love me anymore, that she didn't want to try to work it out and she just wouldn't be happy. I asked her to explain and she couldn't she just kept saying i dont know i dont know. and she ended it right then over facebook chat. I didn't flip out I contained my anger and merely said that i hoped she had a nice life. and I have been very respectful towards her parents and such. but it killed me emotionally. i was lost, the entirely of these three years were devoted to her and she just ripped it apart seemingly overnight and over facebook chat. her parents actually were extremely shocked as well and had no idea why it happened. this happened about a week and a half ago and I have not spoken to her. she has texted me saying she needed a shirt she left in my room, so i went to her apt and left it in her car along with her spare keys and she texted me thank you the next day and I said nothing.

I don't really know what to do anymore. She was the entire reason I was on this side of the country, i moved out here for an internship and met her and ended up staying, we spent almost all of our free time together, I go to school out here and have a job but i dont have any family out here. i have 5-6 friends who are cool but they aren't really close friends.

she texted my father two days ago saying she feels bad and wishes she could talk to me and tell me her reasons but she doesn't think I would want to see her.

so my question is should i let her have that conversation with me? is getting closure worth the pain its probably going to put me through to see her again. after what she did to me I'm just not sure. I feel so much anger and resentment towards her, but id be lieing if i said i wasn't still crazy in love with her. I don't want her back, at least that's what I keep telling myself, I'm not sure I could forgive her. 

anyways thanks for reading and im sorry its a wall of text. any advice or personal experience you can give would be awesome."

I've got about ten-twenty friends that I regularly talk to but only two are close to me.

I have a hard time approaching girls. I never know what to say to them. When I actually go on dates with them, I never initiate physical contact and they think that I'm not interested in them. My problem is that I don't know how to escalate things sexually. Relationships seem like a waste of time to me, I just want to go straight to the being comfortable around each other feeling. The feelings you get about two months into a relationship. This is my second semester in college and I've only gone on three dates with girls, and I haven't even kissed or held hands with a girl yet. It's so pathetic.

My friends go to parties and clubs every week but I dont feel comfortable at parties and I hate dancing and I hate looking like an idiot just sitting there bobbing my head to music.

I spend my days in my room by myself just browsing youtube videos. I occasionaly call up my friends to see what they're up to and they text me and stop by my door to see what I'm up to, but I just dont like to go out...ya know?

I tried to join clubs at school but none of the people seem interesting to me.

I am in great shape and I hit the gym 3 x a week. I am already an intern and Ive got a solid career waiting for me after college. 

I want to be social but I just hate being around people and its difficult for me to be as talkative as everyone around me. I am an introvert."
ppvh5,1,2012-02-14,What's my best strategy for getting my ex back?,Getherback12,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/ppvh5/whats_my_best_strategy_for_getting_my_ex_back/,"Ok complicated storying incoming:  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
   I (24) broke up with my gf (25) of 3.5 years in December of 2010. We kept living together for 7 more months until our lease was up and we continued to act like we were together (did everything together, kissed, had sex). I broke up with her foolishly because she was my first gf and I was naive. She was always super in love with me the whole relationship, so I naively thought that breaking up with her wasn't risky, because I could have her back whenever I wanted.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
   I broke up with her because we were having some issues (she was very jealous and insecure, I'd never been with another girl, and we were both getting on each other's nerves and running out of patience). What I really should have done was to initiate a ""break"" with the intention of definitely getting back together some day.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
   So anyway, around October I realized how much I really loved her and tried to get her back. To my surprise and horror, she didn't want me back. She's told me so many different reasons that I don't know which ones are true: she still loves me, but needs time to herself; she could see us getting married if we get back together and she's afraid of commitment, etc. So I decide to let her have her space.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
   Then around November, she starts dating an 18 year old guy. That's a 7 year age gap with the girl being the older partner. She's still dating him now and is apparently very enamored of him. Everyone is telling her (besides me, I haven't talked to her since new year's) that the age gap does not bode well for a long term relationship, but she disagrees with them all. She's possibly planning on moving far away for 6 months for an internship in the fall and her new BF wants to transfer universities and go with her.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
   My theory is that they are just in the ""honeymoon"" phase or ""puppy love"" phase and that they are both just flooded with hormones and can't think straight. Especially the BF, because she is probably his first love and is therefor crazy enough to consider moving across the country to be with someone he's known for 3 months.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
   Also, it seems that her new BF has some qualities that my GF thought were missing from our relationship. I was never big on watching football or playing soccer, two things her new BF loves to do. But I feel like these are trivial qualities and that me and my ex shared more meaningful qualities and made a better long term match. Her whole relationship with this new BF seems very un-thought out and hormone-driven.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
   So basically my question is what's my best strategy for getting her back? Should I just not contact her at all until she contacts me? Or should I avoid contact until sometime in the summer (before she possibly moves away) and then try to let her know how I feel one more time?  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
   I'm worried about so many things right now. I want her to miss me, but I feel like her current relationship is blocking that from happening. I'm worried that if I wait too long to contact her, her memories of how great our relationship was will start to fade and become less powerful and influential. But on the other hand, I feel like if I talk to her too soon, it could push her away. Also, I feel like even if she realizes that her new relationship isn't that great, that doesn't mean she's not going to stick around in it for years to come. Her BF before me was terrible and she stayed with him for 5 years. How can I know if she's in a mediocre relationship, so that I can move in and tell her that I still love her and that she should break up and come back to me? I guess at some point I could possibly call her sister or one of her friends and ask if they've noticed any conflict in the relationship.  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
   What do I do? (It's hard to convey in a short amount of words on reddit, but I do feel like her and I are really compatible and have a real shot at true love and a happy marriage. I really want to get her back!)  
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;  
**TL;DR  
Broke up with GF of 3.5 years, wanted her back, she said no, not now. Is now dating a new BF that is 7 years younger than her (25, 18). They've been dating for 3 months and are already talking about moving away and living together. How do I get her back if her new relationship is really just a hormone-driven bad decision?**"

I started out doing C/C++ when I was a teenager.  I love Javascript, HTML/CSS come pretty naturally to me, etc.  I'm 22 and fresh out of college last August.

But right now I feel like I am slaving away as a $10/hr intern with such high expectations, and a crazy boss who still uses tables for layout and refuses to upgrade from *Macromedia* Dreamweaver.  And endlessly chews me out for not getting stuff done fast enough, his way.  Which is think is thick-headed.  But maybe I'm naive.

Just please tell me I won't be a lowly intern living with my parents for the rest of my life.  I know I am a good coder, but don't have a lot of time to devote to projects on my own and still get sleep.  I bombed an interview with a Silicon Valley startup last night because I didn't know anything about Javascript closures (been lookin' them up today, pretty cool stuff).

Where does one find out about good job opportunities for *entry level* developers?  I know my Javascript hacks could skyrocket in the right scenario.  I already have been doing some cool stuff on my own, but rarely get to use these tricks at my current job.

I've only taken two programming classes so far (an intro course in C++ and i'm currently taking a course in OOP also in c++). I've always had some interest in programming, but I've never been able to teach myself any languages. My problem is that I can't think of any projects to work on besides examples from the textbook. Even with these classes, the professors haven't really been assigning much homework, and when they do it is from the textbook, so I've been trying to do more examples on my own time. But, like I said, I have no ideas.

Anyway, my question is this: With no experience, no side projects, and still just basic programming knowledge, are there companies willing to take in students like me for some sort of unpaid internship?

Also, I don't really have any idea what I want to do when I graduate. I don't know if I want to go into game development, web, etc I don't even really know what my options are. I DO like programming and figuring out solutions to problems, I just don't really know where to go from here. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks."

**Background:** Well about 2 months ago my girlfriend of 3 years went away to Europe for an internship during the southern hemisphere summer (shes still there as of posting). We are both 23, her being in the last year of uni while I graduated recently. Before she left I felt we had a fairly good relationship which in retrospect was kind of falling apart due to both of us taking each other for granted, yet I still thought I was a good boyfriend who tried to make her happy whenever I could e.g baking her cakes/surprise visits at work.

About a month into her trip she became really emotionally distant, never initiating contact or saying that she misses me. I became worried and asked her about it but she claimed that's how she was when she traveled abroad (this not being her first time). This continued for a week and finally due to the lack of answers I did something I shouldn't have done which was reading a conversation on facebook between her and a friend. In the conversation I discovered that she was planning to break up when she got back because she claimed she didn't miss me at all and I annoyed her when I called. After revealing this to her a shitstorm ensued where she got angry about me invading her privacy but showed deep regret for saying the things that she did and we both admitted we did things that were wrong and said we would try to work it out.

**Now:** Eventually after a few days she broke up with me as she felt it would be better if we be friends instead. Its been a month since all of this happened and in the original break up on the phone she used vague terms like ""its not you, its me"" and other things along those lines. It took a week of prompting through email to get her real reasons for breaking up which were that she had changed and gained more confidence/independence/fashion sense as a result of being away and didn't think she could return to her regular life back home which included not being able to stay emotionally committed to me. She still has a year of uni left though but she plans to move into the central city away from the suburb where we both live until she can move away next year to a different country.

Essentially from her given reasons, I feel like it was her polite way of saying ""I've become to good for you and feel I can do better"" and its really eating up my self-esteem. After discovering this I told her that we can't be friends as I felt those were fairly selfish reasons for breaking up. Shes kind of an insecure person and I feel the changes she is feeling is just based on a travel buzz rather than actual change though I could be wrong.

In retrospect I am kind of glad that the relationship is over as there were a lot of bad things amongst the good that I didn't see happening at the time such as her taking me for granted, yet despite this I'm feeling really ""left behind"" as she has a new and exciting lease on life while I'm stuck looking for work having just finished uni.

Besides the large hit my self-esteem has taken, I've been having a lot of distressing thoughts about her being with other guys/girls and her past romantic encounters that she told me about which are really eating me up on the inside. I know that the breakup was good for both of us, but I seem to be more sad and depressed about her being with other people both past and present rather than us not being together anymore.

So reddit can you please help me with some suggestions about how to stop thinking about her being with other people and maybe taking initiative to improve my own life so that I don't feel so left behind. I know this sounds like a big ask but any help would be seriously appreciated.

Thank you.

As barely paid part-time intern I worried I wouldn't be able to pay for my phone,internet,food (in the order lol). So I started an emergency fund by dumping my change each night in a bucket. 

I wasn't originally going to get a Mac but a series of events and research made me wish i had more money to buy one... when I realized DID have more money. I wasn't used to thinking about bucket-o-change as actual funds.

In the end i had $735.60 worth of change. WOW!! 

I'm more impressed with saving that much change then owning a Mac. But having something with good resale value and a mere 2.9lb is nice too ;)

I have about a year and half's worth of credits towards my degree. I am really into technical things and I've taken courses in programming and in systems troubleshooting (both in high school and in college). I'm a Mac user who switched from a PC about 4 years ago and never turned back. I am wondering how much it takes to become a Network Administrator or to become a Systems Administrator.

I'm a 21 year old male and it's complicated for me. I work at a minimum wage paying retail store job and my college career advisors aren't helpful at all. I have almost 2 years of retail experience. The college doesn't seem to offer any jobs or internships specifically in the IT or Computer Science fields. I really don't want to be in a retail store job that is heading nowhere in terms of my future career.

I am bilingual and natively speak, read, and write both English and Russian, with no accent in either language which could be a plus for a job seeker.

Do any of you have any advice for me? "

I generally wanted to get an idea of how they treat you/trust your knowledge.  As an intern, did you feel like you were of use to your company?  Or were you just there along for the ride?

The reason is because I did a web development internship at a startup company and that turned into a job after 3 months.  They gave me lots of responsibility and I like my job most of the time now since I am always involved in a project.

I really want to try something more along software engineering, and most of these internships for for big corporations.  But I don't want to end up regretting leaving my job where I was very involved to go to an internship where I am barely involved.

Thanks!"

I have decided as a celebration for getting my foot in the door, I would upgrade my computer. I would like to get a new processor if possible but I'm still pretty new to the guts of my computer. The only upgrades I've ever made in the 2 years since I got it is the addition of 3 (somehow) gigs of ram, the addition of a secondary hard drive, and a video card upgrade. I'm willing to spend about $300 to upgrade, maybe $350 if the extra is worth it. Feel free to suggest more than that, as I have a pretty consistent, yet low paycheck and have an extremely low cost of living, so I could afford much more given a couple months.

I finally got a decent paying job so I started buying some of my own equipment for some home network experimentation. 

I actually just bought a 2950 switch and a 2621XM router. I'm not really looking to make a certification home lab (I plan to do that during my next full time internship with Packet Tracer) just a place to experiment.

So i have a couple questions, I recently saw a Cisco Pix 525 firewall for sale and I was considering buying it. After a quick search I didn't find to much info about it, Cisco had a end of life statement. Would it be worth getting to know how to configure such devices? 

My next question has to do with other vendor's equipment, such as Juniper ( I really don't know too many other vendors). Should I invest in learning to configure a Cisco firewall? Or buy a Juniper router/switch and become familiar with that? 

Sorry if I spam questions on this subbreddit, I just realized how much knowledge is in this reddit and the classroom (so far at least) doesn't teach much beyond the technical skills."

I am twenty years old, I have worked for the same company building high voltage electrical components for two years, I have good job security here, my employer, and the owner of the company like me personally, and are satisfied with my work. It's somewhat of a dead-end however. The best paid technicians, which is what I am, only make $35-40k a year. I could stay there and be financially secure, and make enough to get by, and facilitate some lesser hobbies of mine, but I don't think i'd ever truly be happy working there, as my co-workers make it somewhat high-stress. 
   I've lived in mid michigan my entire life, A close friend of mine has been on a few different internships to Aspen Colorado over the past few years, and she asked if i'd like to move out there with her. She says i'd love it, and quite frankly, I think that I would. I would love a fresh start in a new place, with new people, I'm a generally well liked enough person, and would have little to no problem making friends anywhere new. Should I seek employment there, and move on out to colorado on a whim, or should I stay here and continue to work for the same company, and not experience any other areas?
     I would like advice on this from anyone who's ever made a big move, to a new place, with little or nothing to go on. I have about six thousand dollars in cash saved up, that I could use for the initial move and expenses, but is it worth it? Should I pick up and move half way across the country simply on a hunch? I know i'll never be truly happy at my current job, but for all I know this whole thing could go crashing down in flames, and I would be broke, jobless, and a hell of a long ways from home, and the little close family that I have. This plan has just started forming today, I apologize for the lengthy post.

My good friend is being called on to go on mission to Uganda and Kenya this summer, to do disciple work as well as service projects. Here is her letter she wrote to facebook: 

"" Dear Family and Friends,

The Lord has been doing much in my life and heart since the last time I went to Africa. I have been praying and seeking His face since and I am pleased to inform you that I will be going to Uganda for 6 weeks to work with beautiful orphans and study under missionaries as an intern. I will also be going to Kenya for 2 more weeks to learn under the Hovinghs, the missionaries I first learned under my first trip to Africa. This is a total of 8 weeks I will be in Africa! My Father has been teaching me so much since I stepped off that plane in Africa, and I cannot wait to return. He has called me on a mission there, and I want to help raise awareness of the good that is being done, and also raise awareness for the needs.

The total approximate cost of the internship is 5,100 and it is July 14th – September 9th in Kenya first, then Uganda.
I will be able to help disciple, have hands on service projects and activity planning, leading the children at the home, and they will be plugging some of us into our expertise! So yes, this means that you’ll be seeing many pictures of what’s going on! The ministry I’m going with is absolutely fantastic. It has heightened my love for missions, and sets forth an extremely loving and godly attitude in their work. I’d strongly encourage you to check them out for yourself just so you know what else you’re supporting www.heartofthebride.org. 

If you feel you are in a position to support me financially, know that the bulk of this amount ($2,800) is for my airfare and is due as soon as possible. The remainder of the support is due May 9, 2012. I would like your prayer support above all else as I prepare for the trip and while I am abroad. I will need it, even though I’m not easily homesick, 2 months is a very long time. Also make sure you check out the picture that I is on the event thing. You can buy this on my website http://aegoinsphotography.smugmug.com/ and help further support me and my mission by buying the picture! You can get this one and other Africa pictures all under the album Africa.

Here are some specific ways you can pray for the team and me:
•	That our hearts will be in the right place with God as we lead an example of His love
•	That the glory will never be led back to us, but our Father
•	That our families will be safe while we aren’t there, but equally leading people to the faith while we are gone
•	That others see the Hope of Christ through whatever He has us do
•	That satan won’t be allowed to get a foothold, discourage, or weaken our health
•	That greater than anything we will be lights unto this dark world here and when we return





If you would like to financially support this trip, you can mail a check to:

Heart of the Bride Ministries
P.O.Box 786
Niceville, Florida 32588


Checks should be made out to Heart of the Bride Ministries accompanied by a note designating the check to Anna Goins for Uganda Internship All financial donations are tax deductible and you will receive a donation statement at the end of the year.

Thank you for your love and support in Christ""

She isn't familiar with Reddit, nor the good things this community can do, so I took it upon myself to post this in the hopes anyone who reads this can pray for her, or even possibly donate something. Thank you guys so much!"

I'm a journalism major and I thoroughly enjoy what I do.  I love reporting and writing and I want to make a career out of it.  I'm not half bad at it either, not to sound arrogant.

I've been interning since the beginning of this semester (about 6 or 7 weeks ago) at my town's daily newspaper.  I was ecstatic to even get the internship, as it's such an ideal position and there was a lot of competition for it.  As you probably know, opportunities in traditional journalism are, by and large, shrinking.  Since I'm graduating soon, I'm considering my career prospects rather closely.

My situation is this:  I'm doing well at my internship and the editors seem to really like my work.  I've reported on over 20 articles so far in the short time I've been there -- some short dailies, some longer-term feature-y stuff.  I'd love to work here permanently, but I'm afraid that there won't be any positions open towards the end of my internship.  

In the weeks that I've worked here I've seen 3 different open reporter positions get advertised.  The first one happened right after I started, so I didn't even think about trying to apply.  The second and third literally got posted within the last week and I'm torn over whether or not to bring up the idea of applying for them.  On one hand it's still relatively early in my internship; on the other, April gets closer by the day and I *have* been relatively well-received here.

What does Reddit think?  Anyone else have any experiences of getting hired out of an internship (or before it was technically 'over')?  Should I take the chance and risk rejection and potentially looking too eager, or should I wait?  "

It is long, but worth the read. I promise.


To give a little background, one of my friends is big into conspiracy, black helicopter, NWO type stuff and is a huge Alex Jones fan. While I am out of town at another one of our corporate offices, I get a demo Blackberry Storm (shitty device) and it happens to have a 202 area code (Washington D.C.) number associated with it. So I decide to have a little fun...

I send my friend a text:

*DC Line: Go to meeting point 13
DC Line: Contact 9685-P when you arrive.
Him: ?? What are u talking about? I think you have the wrong number.*

To sell him on the prank, I wait a few minutes and to make it look like I just found out who I sent the ""wrong"" message to and since he is on his father's family plan I sent the following text:

*DC Line: Father's name, please remove the two previous messages from your mobile device and disregard.*

He called me a minute later and is freaked the hell out...I hung up on him a few times like we were disconnected as he spoke of ""the incident"".

I waited for a few minutes and I sent him this message;

*DC Line: Father's name, please be advised that you must comply with the previous request under USSID 18 or you can be prosecuted to the fullest extent of Federal Law.*

He called me (you can tell this has really fucked him up his as voice was trembling) and said:

*Him: PLEASE don't tell anyone, I got another message from that number stating that if I don't comply under USSID 18, they can prosecute me! Didn't I tell you about the civilian labor camps and the police falsely accusing people of 'terrorist acts and combatants'?!?! SHIT, wtf. What should I do?

Me: Dude, chill out. Just do what it says. If you implicate me because you told me, I am going to kill you. I don't want any part of this. If they have your cell, why the fuck would you tell me this shit now and not wait until we hang out. You of all people should know.

Him: I read some things online about USSID 18 and it's serious man. Fuck, I'll let you know if anything else comes through tomorrow. I am going to get more smokes. This shit has got me freaked the hell out.*

The next day I am in the office and I realize that our intern is Iranian and can speak Farsi fluently. I had the intern star 67 and call my friend. My friend screens his calls so he was left a message in Farsi with ""CDC"" dropped in plain English for him to understand. Now it is time to let his mind wander as I get back to work.

A few hours later, we exchange some texts (my personal line);

*Me: Do you think something big is going down?
Him: I don't know man. I am thinking about going to the FBI office today.
Me: Aren't they involved since the DC number said you could be prosecuted?
Me: Personally, I would leave it alone. I know I am going by what they see in the movies, but you don't want to get involved in whatever it is going on.
Him: Well, from what I can tell, the texts came from the NSA. But with the VM I just got, I seem to be caught in the middle of something I want nothing to do with. I just want to make that clear to them.
Me: Just play it cool. Honestly, I would leave it alone since they know they have a wrong number.
Me: Shit like that should not be messed with.
Me: Just keep copies of everything in case....off-site somewhere too.....screen prints, etc.
Him: Apparently not, When they called and heard my message before you leave a VM they would know I'm not who they wanted.
Him: I can't. I had to delete the texts. They knew that I didn't after they told me to and sent me a threatening text telling me I really need to delete them. So I did.
Me: How do you know it came from the NSA?
Him: They cited NSA documents in their threat to me and I did a little research online last night.
Me: Well if you decide to go to the FBI wait until I get back. I have to fly today and I don't want to end up on any lists.
Him: Aight*

So now he deleted the evidence and has nothing to take to the FBI. During the time that this has been going on, I know which internet forums and sites he frequents so I keep an eye on everything. All of a sudden, I see this pop up on Twitter;

*xxxxIf you were getting text messages from the NSA and wanted to report it to someone in the government to let them know, who would you call?*

Since my friend doesn’t know what Farsi sounds like and can’t distinguish the differences in middle eastern/central asian languages, I wanted to tie in some theories around Tajikstan and Rendtion.
Since I am heading back home that day and before I head to the airport, I sent him this message from the ""NSA"" number:

*DC Line: Friend's name (Since he posted on Twitter), cease and desist from divulging any further information, including online outlets. Your cooperation is essential.
DC Line: We have intercepted an incoming call and voicemail to your device from Tajikstan. Delete immediately. We guarantee you will in no way be implicated if you comply.*

On the way to the airport, I give him a call and the conversation goes something like this:

*Me: Hey man, what's up. I am going to try and get any earlier flight.
Him: Dude, something is going on, something HUGE. I really can't talk about it, let's just say I am being monitored online and via phone calls.
Me: Uhhh, are you serious? How do you know?
Him: I can't say much, just that I am being watched and I am in some shit. Think Eagle Eye.
Me: Are you still going to go to the FBI?
Him: No, this is bigger than that?
Me: How do you know?
Him: Trust me, in a message I received there was something that set off some flags to me. (In an obvious voice like someone is listening in) I am just going to comply and delete everything. I don't want any part of this. I am just going to leave it alone. I need a job and I can't be a dumbass. Hit me up when you are in town.
Me: Ok man, if anything happens let me know.*

About 15 min later I call him back...

*Me: Man, I think you are right, something is going on. There is a blacked out Tahoe on my tail.
Him: Fuck are you serious?!
Me: Yes, I might just be getting paranoid, but I noticed it leaving work and it is keeping pace with me like 5 cars back, but following me, ya know?
Him: Just be cool, we have nothing to hide, remember I told you about this last night and this morning.
Me: You motherfucker! You should know not to say any of this, couldn't you have just waited til I was home and told me in person?! I can't let this fuck up my job.
Him: Shit, if you can, let me know if anything happens.
Me: Alright.
Him: Peace*

At this point I make my way to the airport lounge and begin plotting my next moves. A friend in Europe has agreed to join in on the prank and while he is getting acclimated to what is going on, I have the intern call and leave another message, but this time mentioning “Rendition”. I immediately follow up the message with a text from the “NSA”;

*DC Line: You have just received another message from the same number in Tajikstan. Delete and disregard. This is a matter of national security.
DC Line: This matter will be resolved shortly. Your continued cooperation is appreciated.
Him: Done. Thank you.*

As I am talking to my friend in Europe I suggest that he go with an approach like this;

*Let's go with something along the lines of you are working along side the US Government. I am sorry that you (my friend) is involved, but this matter is of the utmost urgency. I want to say there is a leak in the Tajik gov't wanting to expose the US (don't say about what). Tell him you know he has already been contacted by the leak and that the US is working to silence this threat.

Let me know when you will call and everything is setup. I will give you the number and set him up by texting him from the NSA number to expect your call. Let's say you are with the UN???*

While I am planning my next move my friend in Europe calls as “Mr. York”.

I get notification once the call has completed and I called my friend to BS since my flight is delayed and it goes something like this:

*Me: What up man, flight is delayed til 8.
Him: Sorry man, I can't talk. Expecting an important call.
Me: Ok, later*

I wait a few minutes and send him a message from the NSA number;

*DC Line: Again, the United States thanks you for your cooperation. Mr. York and I will be your contacts. Your name is guaranteed clear and will face no implication.*

Again, I let some time pass and I send another message;

*DC Line: The leak has been contained and under USSID 18, all information is to be kept confidential.*

Unbeknownst to me, he ended up calling the FBI. I called him to chat while I wait for my plane and he filled me on his phone call with the authorities. He told me that the FBI said if this was real, numbers would be changed and you would have never been contacted again, blah blah blah, that you are possibly dealing with a scammer. He said the FBI was shady and the person he spoke with would not give him their name. My friend said that the shadiest thing was that as soon as he hung up with the he got a text from the “NSA” that said:

*DC Line: You will no longer receive any communications about this matter.*

My friend told me that he has been shaking all day thinking about this, like he woke up in something just like Eagle Eye. However, he did give the FBI my demo number…thankfully I was never contacted by them.

I finally get back in town and after all that has transpired I head directly to his house from the airport to find out more about what has “happened”.

He said he was getting these texts and it was freaking him out. He couldn't sleep at all the previous night because he was so paranoid. He showed me everything that he was looking at via his history on the browser. Oh my god, he Googled everything and then some. Since everything I had done tied together, this fucked him up even further.

The next day as the prank continued he kept getting more and more freaked out. The voicemails that were left in Farsi followed up by texts from the ""NSA"" couldn't have been timed more perfectly. He still believes he was under complete surveillance. The tweet I saw followed by the ""NSA"" text telling him to cease from divulging any further information, including online outlets really got him. Got him so bad that him and his dad went into the bathroom, turned on the water, and left their phones on the other side of the house (he believes the gov't can randomly turn on phones and listen to convos) to chat about what was going on.

Apparently, my friend (the target) had recorded the phone call with my friend in Europe. It couldn’t have been more perfect…accent, information, everything. 

However, my text after that call almost blew the prank and that is when he called the FBI with his father. Apparently, the FBI didn’t take it seriously and the guy on the phone actually laughed at them. He said it was like a Nigerian scam for money and to just disregard it. My friend pretty much quit caring about it until I sent the text saying ""You will receive no further communications"". Unknown to me, the timing couldn't have been better. He said he got it less than a minute from hanging up from the laughing FBI. This kicked his paranoia back in.

Throughout him telling me what has transpired, I keep a straight face and plant seeds of doubt to dispel what the FBI said. I asked him how can this be scam if they accurately monitored your activity. That's all I needed to say, he started freaking out again. I really might be driving him to a nervous breakdown.

Over the next few days I kept the seeds of doubt planted in his head while I plan my grand finale.

A few days later, I texted myself from the ""NSA"" number before I hopped on my motorcycle to meet him. I hauled ass over there and made it in 10 min rather than 15 so that the text would have ""arrived"" while I was on my bike and I wouldn't hear it.

At first we had a good laugh about the crazy “NSA” shit that has happened over the past few days, then things got real when I checked my phone and I got a shady text from the “NSA” number. The text said:

*DC Line: izmatron, we are aware of your knowledge in the matter at hand. Both yourself and friend's name must keep all matters confidential.
DC Line: We are aware that friend's name has called the FBI. Please note that they are aware of our activities through inter-agency cooperation. This is an international matter and out of their jurisdiction.*

So when my friend saw this on MY phone, he almost had a panic attack. His mind wandered and he just wants this to be over, it's a bad dream.

I finally decided to end it on a high note. My friend and I were hanging out at my house and I had my cousin come visit us in formal army attire since “they” have been monitoring my friend’s where-abouts and to bring closure to his black-ops paranoia (he has been having nightmares about this). I tried hiding my digi cam to capture the whole thing, but the lighting was terrible, the zoom was grainy, and audio could barely be heard. Sadly, all of the footage was worthless.

My cousin comes to my door and I pretend that I don't know him and he asks if my friend was there. I get my friend to come to the door and my cousin introduces himself as Lt. Colonel Jacobs. My cousin gives my friend a run down of everything that had occurred to recap. After he recapped everything, he had my friend and myself sit due to association and ""knowledge"" of the matter. My friend is sweating, face is red, you can tell he is quite uncomfortable. I had my cousin refer to this as ""Operation Greyfish"" in honor of other friends who helped generate ideas along the way. Finally, after my cousin finished the recap, he pulled a piece of paper that originally was going to be a non-disclosure agreement, but since I was lazy, it just said:

""izmatron has been fucking with you.""

It took a second for everything to register, but when it did he just busted out laughing. Called me a fucking asshole a few times, but that was the extent of it. He was happy that it wasn’t real, but more interested to know how I pulled everything off since I can’t normally keep a straight face. I told him how it was done and he was quite impressed. He said he is going to get me back, but we'll see…

pqxq3,2,2012-02-15,Current intern looking for advice re: tech related job + housing information,Hirosakamoto,Rochester,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rochester/comments/pqxq3/current_intern_looking_for_advice_re_tech_related/,"Hey there everyone! Just found this board and I thought maybe I could get some advice from some of you. I am currently an intern at Noyes Hospital in Dansville (Alfred State requires our last semester to be a internship) and I am currently going to start looking into sending out resumes/looking at apartments. I will graduate with a bach in software application development (focused more on systems A&amp;D)

1) What would be a good place to look at for apartments? I did browse for one while internship hunting but did not look to deep into it. I would be moving up from Wayland with my fiancee, and probably would enough for a decent lease payment to start off with.

2) Does anyone know of/have open positions in their IS staff they are looking to fill? I will be done in May and should have my degree (if ASC does not screw yet another graduate over, has happened to about 3-4 of my friends in the last year). 

For some REALLY quick and summarized info, I have led dev teams in large class projects, worked help desk related jobs (at Noyes and also at ASC). I have taken classes with c++, Java, VB, I am trying to currently learn python since it was suggested to me. I was apart of the networking team over the summers to install the dorms networks (mostly just construction work, not entirely related). 

No biggie if no one has any large leads regarding a job, just thought I would try my luck here as well as normal job hunting. Thank you very much in advance!

Edit: I have been searching via http://www.rochesterworks.org/ as was suggested in other posts. I have found only about 2-3 entry level IT related jobs that I would qualify for. One being [Associate IT Software Engineer - Entry Level](https://searchjobs.external.xerox.com/careersection/us/jobdetail.ftl?job=172843). Any thoughts/ideas?

Edit: I thought I'd share mine. I'm a DataCenter Intern which means I pretty much do anything physical in the DC. A server/SAN/chassis needs to be racked/unracked? I do it. I do a lot of the smaller SysAdmin tasks. I find new stuff to deploy to make the SA's lives easier. Our DC is ~300 VMs and ~100 physical servers. I make $18/hr and work ~20hrs/wk which means my actual salary is ~$20k, full time would be ~$40k."

got two surgeries to stop it, the second three years ago.  having absolutely no problems i dislocated it tonight.  i took a little slip on slippery wet wooden steps leaving a party.  the tumble was nothing, i barely fell at all and landed fine on my butt.  but however i reached w my arm as a reaction to falling did it.  fuck my life.


i am more bummed about this than ANY of the other times.  mostly because i am in grad school and have 2 internships that require me to be physical.  ive never been happier, on this career path and in this grad program.  i feel sidelined....i cant do what i came here to do.  i only have 2 years of school and im missing a crucial month minimum.  also was looking forward to the paper i had to write tomorrow.  writing this post one handed (ha) has sucked, i cant imagine churning ou a 6 page assignment.  this is a major blow to my happiness and positivity.

not to mention the physical pain/discomfort.

im so let down and so angry about school and at my body for being faulty.  

cheer me up people.

I'm finding college extremely frustrating and the stress is driving me nuts. This makes me wonder: Am I being weeded out? Is CS not for me? Should I drop out? Pick an easier major?

I don't want to give up on programming or CS, even though I'd love to give up on college. I believe I'm interested and motivated enough to become a self taught programmer. However, I'm concerned that employers will not take me seriously without a college degree.

Obviously, the first step is to learn how to program. I would plan on working through various textbooks, but also working on projects to build a portfolio. I'd like to code some Android apps and contribute to an open source project. 

Are employers going to give me a fair shot, assuming I am competent and have a good portfolio? I want to work as a developer, although I'm not sure what field specifically. Video games, embedded devices, accounting software, even web development; it all sounds interesting.

How do I get my foot in the door? Can I get internships if I don't attend college?"
pqeut,5,2012-02-15,Today has been one of the worst days in recent memory.,ihavehadenough,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/pqeut/today_has_been_one_of_the_worst_days_in_recent/,"First time I have been a long time lurker and I really did appreciate knowing that there are others like me out there. I just had to make an account and share my day just to get it out there and not have it eat away at me on the inside. So to start off I had long preparations for the 2 main events of today: a job interview for an internship I really wanted and a 30% midterm.  

Over the past week I put in nearly 4+ hours every evening learning and understanding everything  I needed to do well on the midterm. As for the interview I was making sure that I was able to answer all types of behavioral questions that were common in most interviews. So to cut the story short I woke up today morning knowing that I had done my preparations to my fullest. But the day started off on the wrong note, I went into the interview and suddenly froze up and couldn't focus on the questions being asked nor was I able to reply back without choking on my words. I was going through some major anxiety to the point where I had looks of concerns from my interviewers. I managed to get through the interview and walking out I knew that I had just lost out on the job cause of that horrible interview. Saddened I still had my hopes up since I hoped they would overlook my breakdown for my qualifications and carried on with the day cause I knew I had to be focused for my midterm. But the midterm only further pushed me into my current state of depression, since that was probably one of the worst tests I have ever written in my life. So I come home and find that I had received an email from the employer from the interview earlier and they informed what I had expected in that I was not going to be a good fit for the role. 

So to summarize today was as clear of an indication that no matter how hard I try and how hard I try to make things work I still end up screwing it all up. I have no one to talk to about the pain and suffering I go through just trying to be happy. For once I wish that things would go my way. These past 6 years of my life have been hell and everything I have touched has turned to shit.  I try harder than most of my colleges at school and yet I'm always the one with the shitter grades. As of right now I feel like i should just drift away with my useless life and just not care while I await my death with open arms. 

Sorry if this was a rant that went no where, but i wanted to put my anger out in words. For those who read this thank you.

Hello Reddit,


I'm a CS graduate working a full time job.  Recently I've started to flirt with the idea of starting my own business, if not for the money, then for the freedom that comes with it.  


To get the ball rolling a family friend who has his own IT related business has offered to send potential clients my way.  He called me today and told me that there is a guy who has his own small business and is currently using an Access application to run his business.  This person needs some work modifying and improving the application.


Now I'm here to ask you fine people for advice.  Any information really, as this would be my first time truly trying to start something, and I really want to do it right.


I have some questions that I'll list down at the end, but if I'm missing something as I'm sure I am, please feel free to comment and let me know.


Thanks a lot,


- What should be my primary focus when I meet this guy, or rather, what are the must-pay-attention-to's?

- Any initial encounter advice?  (I have common sense and can carry myself well, but are there any extras?)

- I've done some Access work when I was an intern, but are there things about Access that I should keep in mind?  (I'm definitely not and Access expert)

- How should I go about estimating the cost?  I've read a lot about per hour vs per project, but I'm not sure this project is at that level.  (This is very important for me because I'm not a good negotiator)

- Are there extra services I could provide? (Possibly could help with creating a small but constant montly revenue...)

I just got a computer engineering degree and I can't seem to be able to get any jobs to stick. Part of the problem is I don't have any relevant experience outside of school. I didn't get the chance to do an internship because the ones I found were unpaid and I needed something with a pay check. I also don't have the money to do side projects of my own so I don't have that to help me out either. Anyone have any tips that might get me around these problems that seem to be coming up or just any tips in general?
psk7q,17,2012-02-16,Any engineers willing to take a couple minutes to answer some questions and help out a HS student?,[deleted],engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/psk7q/any_engineers_willing_to_take_a_couple_minutes_to/,"**Thank you guys so much, I have more than enough responses for my project. When I first posted this up here I thought I would only get two or three responses, I wasn't expecting this much. Thank you!**



Hi, I am currently taking an engineering course at my high school and as part of one of the projects we have to interview a couple of engineers. I did have a couple of my dads friends lined up, but they decided at the last minute that they did not have time. I would really appreciate it if some of you could take the time and answer the questions below, it shouldn't take too long, there are only 12 questions and you don't have to write a lot for them (If you don't feel comfortable answering some of the questions in a reply, you can pm them to me).

Also, if you do take the time to answer the questions, please pm me your first name and email address (My teacher requires that we have contact info for the people that I interview).

Questions:

* What discipline did you choose and why did you choose it?

* Did you do an internship, where, how long?  If not did you any on the job training?  How did it prepare you for your future/current job?

* What was the average salary that companies were offering you when you got out of college?

* Where do you work now, and what types of projects do you work on?

* How long does a typical project last?  Can you provide me with an example?

* Most challenging project, why?

* Most fun/interesting project, why?

* What do you do in a typical day?

* What is the most challenging part of your day to day work?

* What is the most rewarding part of being an engineer?

* In your opinion, what is more valuable in engineering, creativity or math skills?

* What advice would you give to a student interested in pursuing engineering?"
psiwi,1,2012-02-16,Louis CK solves the piracy debate.  (No Really.),wyverndarkblood,politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/psiwi/louis_ck_solves_the_piracy_debate_no_really/,"My wife and I are fans of Louis CK and she recently bought and downloaded [his latest release](https://buy.louisck.net/) from Beacon Theater.  But his release is also an anti-piracy experiment.  Price it well ($5), and make it easy to get from him directly, and people won't pirate it.  The polls are in, and the experiment worked!  He even offers full financial transparency for how much the production cost, and how much it earned.  For the piracy part skip to the bottom half of the post.

TLDR ~ Louis CK is amazing.  And solved the Internetz.

A couple weeks after downloading the show (we've watched it at least 10 times), Louis sent us this email from the back of a cab:



**Hi.  This is LOuie.  It seriously is me. Im even going to leave
the O stuipdly capatalized because who would pay an intern to do
that?? Okay so you bought the thing with my fat face on it and
you clicked the button that said i could email you. And i know
that now you are thinking ""aw shit. Why'd i let this guy into my
life this way?"". Well dont worry. Because i really swear it that
i wont bug you. I will not abuse this privalage of having your
email. You wont hear from me again... Probably, unless i have
something new to offer you. The reason i'm writing now, in the
back of a car taking me to the Tonight Show set, is to let you
know that as of now there is some new and cool stuff on my site,
related to Live at the Beacon Theater. Theres a thing where you
can download and print a dvd box cover and label so you can burn
and make your own dvd of the video. And theres a new option where
you can gift the special to as many people as you want (for 5
bucks each) and they'll get a nice gifty email from you with a
link to the video.**

**Also, some of you may know, i recently made a statement (that
sounds so dumb. Like i'm the president or something) about how the
video has been doing online. Im pasting it in here below in case
you missed it.**

**Lastly I'm planning to put some more outtakes of the show on
youtube and i think i will put one on the site that is only
available for free to you folks on this list, who bought the
thing and opted in. But dont hold me to that because really i
just thought of it and typed it.**

**Okay well please have a happy rest of the year and more happy
years after that. And please even have been happy in your past.
What?**

**Thanks again for giving me 5 dollars. I bought 3 cokes with it.**

**Regards. Sincerely, Actually,**

**Louis**


===========================
People of Earth (minus the ones who don't give a shit about
this): it's been amazing to conduct this experiment with you. The
experiment was: if I put out a brand new standup special at a
drastically low price ($5) and make it as easy as possible to
buy, download and enjoy, free of any restrictions, will everyone
just go and steal it? Will they pay for it? And how much money
can be made by an individual in this manner?

It's been 4 days. A lot of people are asking me how it's going.
I've been hesitant to share the actual figures, because there's
power in exclusive ownership of information. What I didn't expect
when I started this was that people would not only take part in
this experiment, they would be invested in it and it would be
important to them. It's been amazing to see people in large
numbers advocating this idea. So I think it's only fair that you
get to know the results. Also, it's just really cool and fun and
I'm dying to tell everybody. I told my Mom, I told three friends,
and that wasn't nearly enough. So here it is.

First of all, this was a premium video production, shot with six
cameras over two performances at the Beacon Theater, which is a
high-priced elite Manhattan venue. I directed this video myself
and the production of the video cost around $170,000. (This was
largely paid for by the tickets bought by the audiences at both
shows). The material in the video was developed over months on
the road and has never been seen on my show (LOUIE) or on any
other special. The risks were thus: every new generation of
material I create is my income, it's like a farmer's annual crop.
The time and effort on my part was far more than if I'd done it
with a big company. If I'd done it with a big company, I would
have a guarantee of a sizable fee, as opposed to this way, where
I'm actually investing my own money.

The development of the website, which needed to be a very robust,
reliable and carefully constructed website, was around $32,000.
We worked for a number of weeks poring over the site to make sure
every detail would give buyers a simple, optimal and humane
experience for buying the video. I edited the video around the
clock for the weeks between the show and the launch.

The show went on sale at noon on Saturday, December 10th. 12
hours later, we had over 50,000 purchases and had earned
$250,000, breaking even on the cost of production and website. As
of Today, we've sold over 110,000 copies for a total of over
$500,000. Minus some money for PayPal charges etc, I have a
profit around $200,000 (after taxes $75.58). This is less than I
would have been paid by a large company to simply perform the
show and let them sell it to you, but they would have charged you
about $20 for the video. They would have given you an encrypted
and regionally restricted video of limited value, and they would
have owned your private information for their own use. They would
have withheld international availability indefinitely. This way,
you only paid $5, you can use the video any way you want, and you
can watch it in Dublin, whatever the city is in Belgium, or
Dubai. I got paid nice, and I still own the video (as do you).
You never have to join anything, and you never have to hear from
us again.

I really hope people keep buying it a lot, so I can have
shitloads of money, but at this point I think we can safely say
that the experiment really worked. If anybody stole it, it wasn't
many of you. Pretty much everybody bought it. And so now we all
get to know that about people and stuff. I'm really glad I put
this out here this way and I'll certainly do it again. If the
trend continues with sales on this video, my goal is that i can
reach the point where when I sell anything, be it videos, CDs or
tickets to my tours, I'll do it here and I'll continue to follow
the model of keeping my price as far down as possible, not
overmarketing to you, keeping as few people between you and me as
possible in the transaction. (Of course i reserve the right to go
back on all of this and sign a massive deal with a company that
pays me fat coin and charges you straight up the ass.). (This is
you: yes Louie. And we'll all enjoy torrenting that content. You
fat sweaty dolt).

I probably sound kind of crazy right now. It's been a really fun
and intense few days. This video was paid for by people who
bought tickets, and then bought by people who wanted to see that
same show. I got to do exactly the show I wanted, and exactly the
show you wanted.

I also got an education. And everything i learned are things i
was happy to learn. I learned that people are interested in what
happens and shit (i didn't go to college)

I learned that money can be a lot of things. It can be something
that is hoarded, fought over, protected, stolen and withheld. Or
it can be like an energy, fueled by the desire, will, creative
interest, need to laugh, of large groups of people. And it can be
shuffled and pushed around and pooled together to fuel a common
interest, jokes about garbage, penises and parenthood.

I want to thank Blair Breard who produced this video and produces
my series LOUIE, and I want to thank Caspar and Giles at Version
Industries, who created the website.

I hope with all of my heart that I stay funny. Otherwise this all
goes to hell. Please have a safe and happy holiday, and thank you
again for all this crazy shit.

Sincerely, Louis C.K.

psidv,0,2012-02-16,The value of teachers' unions...,I_hate_fountainhead,education,https://www.reddit.com/r/education/comments/psidv/the_value_of_teachers_unions/,"I came here just to air one of my primary grievances over the current education debate in our country and provide an anecdote for why I think teachers unions are still very valuable to us. 

I'll begin this by saying, I don't think teachers unions don't need reformed, or are educational system in general. Teachers should be like any employee, accountable to to the quality of their product. I believe in a higher accountability, higher benefit system for teachers. However, the problem with the way our educational debate runs in this day and age is exactly what's wrong, there's an overdone focus on the accountability of the teacher. This is only one facet of what's wrong with our education system and it wrongly overshadows other aspects of the system

Now, the anecdote:
I grew up in a poor rural community in Ohio, where like many places in the rust belt, the few manufacturing industries were in a steady decline. Besides being just poor there was still an outdated cultural attitude towards education. ""You don't need college,"" was the mantra among most peoples' parents. On top of that there was a serious youth flight problem, so the demographics swung older.

As could be expected the schools were equally miserable. Our elementary and middle school were built during the Civil War. Passing educational bond items was damn near impossible. Every election our already slim arts and music programs were on the edge of being cut. Big class sizes, low teacher pay, etc... etc...

Anyways, it was our local teacher union which kept things together. Like many small towns we had an overemphasis on the sports program. Our baseball and football programs were regular state contenders and going to a game was the only thing to do on a Friday night. Every election cycle there was a movement to kill the arts and music funding, every election cycle the teachers union gathered and the teachers who ran the sports programs threatened to close up shop, arguing that their programs were no more valuable to the kids than music. Bond item passed. The sum up for vote was always paltry, averaged $9 a person, was still a struggle.

The teachers took it on themselves to actively recruit hometown kids in education in college, so that they could make sure good teachers would come in to the school system and hopefully stay there. If you were in education in college you had members of the teachers union not only checked in to say hello, but would offer to help you with your studies, hook you up with internships, etc... As a result our teacher retention was high and our test scores were the best in the county despite lower teacher incomes.

Our bus drivers and cafeteria workers pay had been static since the 70s and their income was &lt;$5 an hour, which resulted in a strike and informational picket, which because of the unwillingness to pass a bond item meant that we went without cafeteria workers or bus services for more than a year. The teachers were forbidden to strike as well because they had a different union and because of their contracts. Our school superintendents reaction to the striking of the people who used to feed and drive the community's children wasn't exactly.....rational. He hired a security service to protect us from the middle aged ladies waving signs at us and bought 15 vending machines to 'compensate' for the lost lunch services.  As it turned out the low rate security service had a few ex-felons on staff, including one with a rape rap. The controversy gave the teachers union the leverage to force the community to once again pass the controversial bond item...a dread $4 a person.

My point here is teacher's union doesn't just exist to protect teachers jobs. At the local level they typically have a very real concern for the value of the education they provide and for the experience of the kids. On an individual level there are good and bad teachers but they are as a group, out of their own self interest and a care for the kids in their class, the only people acting in the defense of the quality of education.

tl;dr the national education debate attempts to cast teachers unions only as selfish organizations only protecting bad teachers jobs but thy have real potential for measurable good in their communities."

I have lived in Montreal for about a year, and I go back every now and then because my Fiancee Lives there. I took two semesters of school at Concordia, and my French is at an intermediate level. I am a US citizen living in California, and at the end of this year I will graduate with a Bachelors of Science degree in computer information systems.

I am planning to be in Montreal this summer for a couple months (June-August perhaps) and I want to know what I should be trying to do then while I am there, and what I can do to improve my chances of getting a job by the time I graduate. I have been looking into internships over the summer, but mostly all of them do it through the schools there. I hope to get a job under the NAFTA agreement (computer systems analyst) as I understand it will be quite easier to get a work visa (plus that is the kind of job I wanted anyway). Does anyone have any experience with this or any advice for me?

Thanks!"
pryii,30,2012-02-16,"So, these people came to my college class to get me into an internship and then things got weird, more info inside",MistressFey,WTF,https://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/pryii/so_these_people_came_to_my_college_class_to_get/,"Representatives of a company came to my **college class** to recruit for a summer internship. They had us fill at a survey/contact info, but never gave the company name. My teacher seemed a bit weird-ed out by it, but let them do their thing and I sort of forgot all about it until I actually got an internship offer. After meeting with them tonight and actually learning about the place, southwestern advantage, I came home and decided to do a bit of research before my second interview tomorrow. This is what I found:

[http://southwesterncompanytruth.com](http://southwesterncompanytruth.com)

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwestern_Company](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwestern_Company)

[http://somedayallthis.wordpress.com/2010/07/05/the-southwestern-company-door-to-door-deception/](http://somedayallthis.wordpress.com/2010/07/05/the-southwestern-company-door-to-door-deception/)


WTF? How are these people allowed on college campuses to recruit students? If I hadn't looked into it I would have probably considered the program as I'm only a sophomore and it's hard to get an engineering internship at that level of education and I thought they were legit since they were allowed to present **in my class** at a **major university**.
This is their website, 
[http://southwesternadvantageprogram.com/](http://southwesternadvantageprogram.com/)
I'm not asking you to go there and attack them, I just want to make sure no one falls into this trap by thinking this company is associated with any academic insinuation. I'd also be interested in hearing stories from people who have worked with them.

[Edit1: I've provided a step by step look at what you do with this company over the summer.](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/pryii/so_these_people_came_to_my_college_class_to_get/c3rvgam)

TL;DR A major scam company was allowed to come to **my college class with the teacher present,** take student contact information, and try to recruit me for an ""internship"" selling their products door to door for the summer with no wages other than commission, with no provided food or housing, in a random part of the US away from my home and anyone I know. &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;

UPDATE!
So I heard back from my professor and she said she had no idea who this group was. When I told her about them it turns out that she has dealt with this group before. They came to her house one summer and, when she didn't buy anything, kept coming back once a week and trying to sell to her. It drove her crazy! She won't be letting them in her class again. I also spoke to one of the head of my college and she said she'd look into making sure all of the teachers know about this.

As for the group, I had one final meeting with them to tell them no and was very alarmed by what the girl I spoke to told me. She was super excited about how she'd work from 8am to 10pm, 6 days a week, every summer, and acted like it was the best thing in the world. She also told me that the stories at the southwestern truth site listed above are all true, but that's just because those people didn't follow the companies ""plan"" for how to sell. I was also informed of the companies safety policy for females. If you go to a house and a man answers the door, ask for a female. If there is no adult female present, speak to the man outside or move on. If a woman is present, it is safe to enter the house... NO IT'S NOT! O.o Females can be rapists and murderers too, but this company tell college age girls that, as long as there is a girl there, you're safe.... &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232; 

Anyway, my ordeal is done and I hope this helps others avoid this program as it sounds really terrible! "

prsee,2,2012-02-15,I would appreciate a little advice regarding continuing grad. school.,ckallas2,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/prsee/i_would_appreciate_a_little_advice_regarding/,"Hello r/jobs,

I completed my undergraduate education from the U of I in 2010 and then I took a year off. In that year I worked in politics. I worked on a couple of different campaigns the largest of which was for a, now former, US House member. After that great experience I decided to jump back into academia. I applied and was accepted to a grad school of which I have just begun my second semester.

This semester started with me earning an unpaid marketing internship at a local NFP theatre. I have learned more about the work world in the last month with this internship than I have in the last 20 years of school. I really enjoy the work, it's challenging, I have a knack for it, and it is rewarding.

I'm thinking of withdrawing from this semester and pursuing the internship as full-time as I can (thinking maybe 20 hours a week).  
The pros of me withdrawing:  
I'm fatigued from 20 years of education  
I like the idea of having a job/career a year from now  
I'll be spending less money (school is expensive)  
I can concentrate on my theatre internship

Cons:  
My education will stop at a bachelors  
I will miss out on networking opportunities from my school  
???

I was hoping a fresh set of eyes would evaluate my position and give me an honest run-down.

TL;DR: I have education fatigue."

I'm just sure there are some stories/lessons that stick out that you all would like to share. 


Just some notes about myself that might help you pick a story

1. I was a wild kid growing up and a party animal high school.  Got in trouble a lot, had to get arrested to open my eyes and find a responsible path and mellow out after 18. 
2. I'm scheduled to graduate from college next December.
3. Wasn't involved at all besides soccer and tennis in High School, am now in college with complete/current internships and organizations. (Going from not all to probably too much the past year)
4. Had 2 serious g/fs in high school. Nothing more serious than casual dating and hook ups in college. Not good at relationships in my opinion. 
5. Have anxiety on a daily basis and over think just about any and all situations.

He was in a LDR before with a previous girlfriend which ended badly (girl was crazy though; told him she was pregnant to get him to stay). He knows I am completely different from her but I think this is the reason he seems hesitant about me leaving. He just gets really sad and doesn't want to talk about me leaving even though it is in a few months. I had told him it is going to be ok and even showed him some things we could do together even though we are going to be apart.

[I swear this is a true story. I went to a high school in LA and you crashed our prom after party (Universal Hilton). You ended up taking the virginity of a girl named Roseanna. You didn't call her afterwards. She cried a lot. Do you remember any of this and can confirm or have you been so knee deep in hollywood pooty for so long that this qualifies as a mere blip?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5swz?context=5)|I Am Woody Harrelson.
[How much of The Game is factually accurate vs. dramatization? I find it hard to believe you could capture all those quotes from all those people verbatim and then write about them later?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5o7i?context=5)|It is all accurate. What helped was: taking notes in the moment and immediately afterward. Also, at ProHo, once guys knew who I was, I started recording things. And I think in retrospect what really allowed me to put everything in there was the fact that when you were in the field, you were thinking, ""I can't wait to go home and write a field report about this."" So you were always immediately, while it was fresh, writing out a word by word, blow by blow, report for other guys.
[Everyone I talk to about Pick up has negative views towards it. They think it's bullshit. Why is Pick Up so detested and/or seen as something ineffective or without substance?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5ni3?context=5)|It makes sense: Here's a quick rushed explanation. Women have naturally evolved a way to filter men of higher status that they should be with from ones of low status that they shouldn't, and if guys have somehow figured out a ""hack"" for this, then it renders that system useless. And that's not a good thing for them.
[Cross posting this from the other thread since I think I got it in there too late.  Neil-  Some critics of you and the seduction community assert that there is an undercurrent of misogyny in the community. Do you think this criticism is warranted?  In your own experience with the community, do you think any of those practicing PUA had or have psychological issues?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5o3g?context=5)|Oh, absolutely, a lot of the guys have psychological issues. I think everyone has psychological issues, in the world, just about--no one was raised perfectly. But I think the psychological issues in the community are more about men's low self-esteem, and not about negative attitudes towards women. In fact, as I write it, I realize their negative attitude is only toward themselves. So if their experience in the community fixes this, then that's a good thing.
[How is your relationship with Tyler Durden, Mystery, Ross Jeffries, Steve P? How are they doing, if you know? What do you like about each of the schools now, espcially RSD? Pick up is now generally moving away from routines/indirect and towards just pure direct intent.  How do you feel about this? What did you take away from routines? How have your views on building and maintaining relationships changed from the end of The Game to now? Alternatively, what would you from right now say to yourself from 7 years ago? Are you still meeting people (like in clubs or wherever)? How were the PUAs back in the day, like realistically, how good were they and what stuff did they do right and differently. And have you gone out with newer puas?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5ntx?context=5)|I've seen all of them this year, and am on good terms with all. Feel like they were all part of my life and integral to the book. Trends in pickup are kind of idiotic. One does what works. I'm sure someone will ask me specifically about direct vs indirect, so if they don't ask that again so I can share my thoughts on it. Feel like you should read, considering your question.
[What are some of the most interesting and extreme positive and negative reviews/responses of The Game that you've seen?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5ntx?context=5)|Seems the responses to the book are either those who've read it (and are generally positive) and those who haven't (and are generally negative). Think a lot of people think the book is something it isn't.
[What age did you go bald? How did it effect you? If an easy cure came along, would you take it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5t9r?context=5)|Not growing a huge crazy 'fro while I had the chance.  Waiting so long to just shave it off, and going around for years trying to hide the bald spot and receding hairline. Hiding anything you're insecure about is generally not good. Like Mystery said in the book, if you can't fix it, feature it.
[Is there any way for a girl to go from a friends-with-benefits situation to something more serious?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5zgz?context=5)|What turns off a guy a girl is sleeping with is the same thing that turns off a girl a guy wants to sleep with: desperation and neediness. So eliminate those from your behavior in the friends-plus-ship.
[Your responses make it seem like you are a Redditor and probably have been for a while. True? (And if so, why wait so long to do an AMA??)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r6bh9?context=5)|I'm a lurker. But thank you. Was concerned about doing this. But I am addicted to the IAmAs. Especially the ones with unique life experiences. So was inspired by their candor, courage, and stories. And also by requests I kept seeing here.
[How do you feel the Pickup Artist show on Vh1 affected the seduction community? Also, did any of those people in the show go on to become teachers in the community?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5pv7?context=5)|I think it ended up getting a lot more people into it. And I thought it sympathetically portrayed the guys trying to learn it and, since the viewership was more women than men, actually helped in the end.  And I don't know if any of the guys teach it, but I know a lot of them are around and still practicing it. Great group of guys, and I see them as much as I can.  The toughest thing for them was they didn't get enough teaching on the show. The producers wouldn't let Mystery interact with them when the cameras weren't rolling, and the teaching time was really limited.  But thought the show was great and fun, both seasons.
[How do you feel about the monetizing of the pickup community?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5wra?context=5)|I feel like it's made it confusing for guys getting into it now. In the past, you'd go to the main forums and there was this free exchange of information. Now all the information comes with a price tag, and you don't know if it's from someone who's credibly using it with success or if it's just a good marketer with no social skills whatsoever trying to make money.   That's why communities like this are great: truth is (generally) sorted from bs pretty quickly.
[Why didn't you bang Courtney Love?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5lxt?context=5)|She wasn't in the most ""bangable"" condition at the time (mental condition).

Each time you see them, you can add a little piece and let the attraction grow more naturally (and also more subtly).
[Do you still keep in touch with Courtney Love?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5mt9?context=5)|Yes, talked to her for like two hours yesterday, and used to stay at her place in LA. If I can get it, will show you a photo of what was under the bed. Remind me later if I forget.
[How would you initiate contact with a women you screwed up with in the past? I.E. you were a complete tool,](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5tlt?context=5)|Either I'd have a ""party"" and invite them. Or call and say I just had a dream they were in. (Dream was always PG and fun, not anything romantic/sexual in any way.)
[Any advice for dating chicks who don't speak English?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5tlt?context=5)|Bring a pad of paper, and pencil. i remember meeting a couple Czech girls in Croatia who didn't speak English, and we drew a clock with hour/minute hands to communicate when to meet.

This is because people start to know who you are, and expect miracles and no failures. There is only one way to get over it: to approach. Right away. The longer you wait, the more the fear builds. Just accept it as a normal evolutionary response, but also a vestigial holdover fear from a tribal society that no longer really has a purpose.
[What's your opinion of *The Blueprint Decoded*?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5li2?context=5)|Actually, Tyler came to speak at a seminar I had a few months ago. Was great to see him and reconnect. He showed some incredible in-field videos that were evidence that the guy has balls of steel. Great escalation and cocky/funny/teasing/pebbles.
[Have your feelings about Tyler changed since releasing *The Game*? Should I feel bad giving into his teachings?   **THANKS!!**](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5li2?context=5)|And you shouldn't feel bad, if it's working for you. In the end, the problems were really a function of living together, more than anything else..
[You've met all kinds of people form all walks of life - who is the biggest out-and-out asshole?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5ybh?context=5)|Interesting question, and I've had people be rude, but generally it was just a wall, and once I got through it, they turned out to be a great person. I suppose assholes are like bitches: we think someone is like that, but that's only because they somehow threatened our sense of self and self-esteem--and if we see them with empathy, in most cases, we realize they're just as insecure as we are, if not more so.
[Hey Neil. I read **The Game** (good job, by the way, it inspired me to read Ulysses) and **Emergency** and took a trip with my friend out to California to try to find the cache you hid. I got to Big Basin and to the Lane camp site, but there were a couple clues we just couldn't figure out, and the others we did figure out seemed worthless without the rest. How close were we? Also, has anyone found it yet? And what's the reward for it?  The 25 paces east clue (or however many paces it was, I don't have the book in front of me) was especially frustrating, because 1) I couldn't figure out where to start pacing from, and 2) even if I could, I'm taller than you, so I could easily wind up a couple meters off mark. The other thing, how deep is it buried? Is that one of the clues I couldn't figure out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r660y?context=5)|No way, and how'd you like Ulysses? Hope you had some help when you read it. And hey, I can't say what are it may or may not be. But good for you, and no one has found it yet. And it's not buried more than 2 or so feet deep.
[But as it IS an AMA, I guess I'll pop a question as well :) So here it goes: Do you really think ANYONE can improve their AFC status? I always keep on thinking that it's a great means of self-improvement **for the better looking** part of the population, as opposed to less/or undesirable looking people(I kind of find myself swimming in this latter crowd, as I'm a 22 y.o who suffered 3rd and 4th degree burns on more than 30% of my body). What I'm trying to say is, people like me have to work ten-times fold to even get accepted in society, and it's something you can only WORK on, unless you sit on a shitload of money that can rebuild your traits through surgery. What's there in-store for us? How do we find appreciation, human-connection and why not even love? :)  **TL;DR: [appreciation and personal opinions on Neil Strauss work...]**  **Do you really think ANYONE can improve their AFC status?**  **What's there in-store for undesirable looking people? How do we find appreciation, human-connection and why not even love?**](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r6epi?context=5)|I like the way it was described, and very cool. Thank you for saying that: most people think of it as this crass how-to lad's manual, when, you're right it's really a memoir of a pivotal period in my life. As said below, what you can't fix, you feature. You don't need to rebuild your traits. You just need to build up your personality. And it just has to be a little more positive, funny, intelligent, and outgoing than the next guy's to compete---and I promise you, because I've seen it with many people with all types of handicaps, you will be able to compete with ANYONE.
[I'm impressed by your books, bust most importantly I read ""The Game"" over and over again.  And I'm still so interested by the chapters that include PROJECT HOLLYWOOD.   My question to you is; Was Project Hollywood as intense as you described it, or was it flared up some for sake of the book?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5ng9?context=5)|It was that intense and more. Had to leave a lot out of the book. Think about reality shows when a bunch of people are living together, then add Mystery and Courtney Love to the mix (lots of Courtney questions so far)--and you'll realize what would be abnormal is if there was no intensity!
[What is your stance on some PUA/seduction concepts like 'last minute resistance' (LMR), where a woman will resist advancing to sex. Many practitioners of PUA/seduction offer advice and 'tricks' on how to get a woman to stop resisting sex. How do you feel about that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5y8k?context=5)|You raise a good question, much more rational than your username would imply. And the answer is: Is it a technique designed to push someone to do something they DON'T want to do (in which case it's not only immoral but possibly illegal) or is it a technique designed to make someone comfortable with something they WANT to do but are just nervous about (in which it can end up being a great experience for both people)?
[On a separate but somewhat related note, how much do you feel the western world's increasingly 'isolationistic' mentality (i.e. walking around with headphones in, not wanting to be bothered or disturbed) works against the idea of actually meeting someone in your day-to-day life and asking them out, or even having a conversation? **Are future generations doomed to have to read The Game and similar instructional books in order to learn how to socialize and meet with people outside their immediate circles?**](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5y0l?context=5)|And, yeah, wouldn't it be easier if the roles were reversed. That was always my ambition with The Game, that it would even out that disparity a little. And ""doomed to read The Game,"" nice word usage. Answer is: I think there will always be guys who have it and guys who don't, so some will always be ""doomed"" to read it. But for sure, every hour i spend socially interacting staring at a screen here probably lowers my comfort with socially interacting IRL. So the burden again is on the individual to make sure their life is in balance. And that becomes more challenging the more great tools people create online.

My sincere guess is that this is mostly your ego state. And as soon as you have her back and are confident that the relationship is 100 percent on again, you will start not appreciating her again.  So first you have to examine your true intentions and motivations here. Because if you do get her back, and then change your mind again or have doubts again, that's not fair to her.
[What do you do for fun (outside of writing/interviews)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ppb72/iam_a_seventime_new_york_times_bestselling_author/c3r5ybl?context=5)|Surfing and, my favorite, putting together groups of about 12 people (old friends and new friends and even people I've never met) and having a night of fun adventures.

And it was an internship during college that got me started. Hey, if you're willing to work for free, there's no end to the amount of people who will be willing to exploit you.  Seriously, best way to get experience. And once I was writing for that small magazine (called Ear, R.I.P.), then I started writing for a slightly bigger one, then slightly bigger, until eventually Rolling Stone.  So advice for you is: internships, and be willing to pay your dues and do the hard work and put in the Gladwellian 10,000 hours.

pu4sn,5,2012-02-17,How competitive am I for an entry level recent graduate job?,TheTaoOfBill,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/pu4sn/how_competitive_am_i_for_an_entry_level_recent/,"About to graduate in April. I'm starting to apply to positions far out of state. So I don't have too much as far as networking to rely on out there.

But I feel like I may have more experience than the average fresh graduate.

I worked 2 software development jobs simultaneously for 9 months. Both in ASP.NET and both for 16 hours each A total of 32 hours a week developing in ASP.NET. Recently I quit one of them because my last semester in college is a bit more intense and I didn't have time for both. I intend on keeping the job I am still working at 16 hours a week until I graduate and find my entry level job. Both of these jobs involved experience with SQL, JQuery, CSS, and anything else you'd expect a typical web app intern to work with.

During my time in school I wasn't an impressive student GPA wise and my school itself is probably a tier 2 or 3 school. However I was a member of a student organization focused on creating video games through programming and design elements. I attended the club for 2 years and I was eventually elected president of the club in my final year. As president I generally helped people understand game development concepts through the XNA as well as unofficially tutored members in their CS homework.

That's my story so far. How competitive am I for an entry level position?

pvngt,3,2012-02-18,Summer Research - Better/Worse/Same compared to an internship?,okiyama,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/pvngt/summer_research_betterworsesame_compared_to_an/,"Hey there, I am a first year CS student hoping to plan out my future summers to maximize job potential. I already have my plans for this summer laid out which leaves me basically 2 more in which I can do stuff before graduating.

I feel I would not have a problem getting either a summer research position at my college or an internship. Summer research here entails working with a professor for either 4 or 8 weeks on a related field of study doing research and getting paid. I would probably prefer to do this because for one it is not terribly competitive to get and it also gives good pay. I would make $3,000 for 2 months of work.

An internship however may look better on a resume and I know that building a resume ends up paying off quite a bit more over my career.

I am certain that I will do an internship at least one summer, most likely my junior year summer. Is it a good idea to try to get a second internship my sophomore year summer or would I be alright going with the research opportunities?"
pvh8g,1,2012-02-18,Too many interests: I don't know what I want in life anymore or who I want to be,ThoreauIsCool,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/pvh8g/too_many_interests_i_dont_know_what_i_want_in/,"As a child, I have always enjoyed fiction, fantasy and history - whether within the quiet and reserved context of History Channel documentaries or Disney movies (Hunchback of Notre Dame is easily my favorite stylistically and thematically). I've always loved the worlds portrayed and used to wish I could live in those times. Indeed, my strongest academic subjects are the humanities: history and English I have consistently enjoyed all my life, both as hobbies and as classes. I love the hands-on, speculative nature of these subjects, how they give you so much creative and analytical freedom.

I've been told time and time again that I'd make a good archaeologist, anthropologist, curator, something of the sort. I could definitely fancy a nice job in a museum, helping to date and sort pieces. Everything about the past fascinates me, to the point it's almost a childishly nostalgic, Holden Caulfield-esque obsession. Some of the more trivial examples? I love the handpainted backgrounds of old cartoons, old boxy-framed cars, EGA 16-color computer games, what have you. Even the old Windows 9x icons, I felt, had more character and descriptiveness about them than the increasingly glossy, gradient-filled icons that have been plaguing the Windows OS since XP and now well into 7.
What's wrong with history, then? I don't know - I'm not a big academics person and I don't think I could ever commit myself to a job in history. One typically requires a master's or Ph.D in order to attain safe employment, but I don't want to teach either. I like to be my own boss and keep my options open, something I really don't think I'd be able to maintain if I had to fall back to becoming a professor.

I also have an interest in graphic design and website design, the former of which I've done a lot for my school over the years. I was assistant and later chief editor of our high school newspaper's layout in the last two years, and I really enjoy designing things like posters, logos, what have you. I really enjoyed working on the school's paper, just hanging out, throwing ideas around with one another and improvising with everything. A productive and creative atmosphere to work in, one I truly reveled in. I don't consider myself very good though, and whilst I do want to do some intern stuff whilst in college in this field, I don't know if it's right for me as a longtime career. I can only work on things that truly compel me, and I feel as though expanding this into a full-blown profession would sap me of my motivation and creativity.
 
My dad is a photo retoucher and graphic designer, and as much as I share his passion, I have the problem of questioning myself and my abilities all the time.

This is where things get particularly confusing. I've also had a huge passion for game design since I was a child. I've done a lot of game modding, particularly level design and texture artwork. Unfortunately, I seldom get anything done - admittedly suffering from a bit of an inferiority complex, it won't be long before I decide to completely scrap a map for whatever reason. I'll often imagine a modification fully complete, or imagine one totally cool room in a custom map, but then anywhere from an hour to weeks into development I'll realize I just have nothing else to work with to create the rest of the project. And then I scrap it.

Here's an analogy that only some gaming veterans who've really been in tune with the developers over the years will get. I think of myself a lot like Ken Rolston or John Romero - a visionary, who likes to do a bit of anything and everything and thinks about the final product, but often gets in over his head. I've had so many ambitious ideas for games, but I never get far with them. And I don't know what part of game design I'm best at - I can do everything but program, which kind of sucks because it means I can't really entertain any of my ideas.

As stated, I definitely am more of a theory sort of person when it comes to design, not a technical ""this is how it has to be"" sort. I think I'd be really good at writing or world design - focusing on the big picture, how the story or factions play out, how a city is designed and the history behind its architecture. There's one story in particular I've been gradually fomenting in the back of my head, that I definitely want to make into an adventure game someday. You know who I'd like to be like, sometimes? Yahtzee Croshaw. Someone who just kind of gets to do a bit of everything in designing games. Adventure and role-playing games are certainly my favorite genres, I'll tell you that.

I've kind of bounced around between level design, art, what have you. Texture design is the only area in which I feel moderately up to par with the skills of, say, a student of my age specializing in such a field. Jack of all trades, master of none. It's also the only website I've ever technically ""finished"", even though it's lacking some images and full of placeholders at that. I know the ins and outs of HTML/CSS/PHP, but I have virtually no incentive to use them unfortunately. I'm redesigning a non profit organization's website for a friend this month, but I don't know how well that'll go. I need to work on aesthetics for sure.

But I don't know where to go from here - I've considered simply keeping all the design stuff as a hobby, of course - most game developers start out that way. However, I don't know what to do for college. I was thinking of becoming an English major possibly, since I'd have a lot of freedom in what to work in. Too bad they get such a bad rep. I was thinking it'd be cool, somewhere down the line, to start my own printing/publishing business or something of the sort. Something on a local level, that's both involved and fulfilling to my want to play around with different aspects of design. I definitely want to play it safe though, to a degree. The fact my parents are baby boomers doesn't help much as my dad is pushing into his mid 60's. I want to be well-established, for my parents to be proud of me. Not go the way of some Bohemian hipster designer who's living in between social security checks. It's far too late for that.

I've had innumerable hobbies, interests and projects over the years, and yet I can never bring myself to stick to one of them. I can't commit myself to being a particular person - I simply feel it would be contrary to my (our) nature to live one's entire life as, say, ""that guy who makes the &lt;video games/artwork/short stories&gt;."" I have no real goals to aspire to in life, other than having the time and money necessary for me to sustain myself and my hobbies.

But familiarity is extremely important to me - if not in interactions with others than in personal rituals and routines. I'm a pretty conservative person (both politically and socially) and there's very much a sense that I can only do something if I understand it. I'd sooner fail a project than do some impersonal, ingenuine half-baked job that doesn't speak my true colors. I've abandoned lots of projects over the years (video game mods, stories) because I feel as though I'm not doing them proper justice. People will tell me that they thought my work was brilliant, and I'm simply too much of a perfectionist, but I simply lack the fortitude with which to tell myself that's the truth. I feel as though the notion of work, the thrill of starting a new project, is far more gratifying to me than actually completing it - perhaps it's because I'm more interested in distracting myself than attempting to evoke some particular response or criticism from others.

As a child, I was always lauded as brilliant in school - and looking back retrospectively, so many friends and family members wonder where I went wrong. People tell me of how much they would strive to achieve were they in my position, and why is it that I don't put my creative and intellectual energies to some great endeavor? I simply feel no reason to - it's pitiful, because I feel a strong sense of obligation and duty to my family and society at large.

I had a leg up on other kids in school, and yet my constant indecisiveness and self-doubt have led me astray. In in my hobbies and schoolwork, I'm constantly working frenetically, stretching myself thin if you will, to strive to be a jack of all trades because I don't know what I truly want to do - writing, artwork, video game design, etc. I had the potential and the opportunities with which to do virtually anything I wanted, to change the world, and yet I didn't act on them. Because I didn't specialize, and simply continued to try and remain on top of everything - for instance, I had wanted to do graphic design when I was a kid, and whilst in the beginning I would say I had a greater inherent talent for it than others, I would get stuck in a depressive rut, whislt other kids who had less ability but were more passionate about the field would take classes and do work.

And now everybody else has grown up and found their place in the world, and in spite of everything I had when I was younger, it's all been utterly wasted. The only thing I still feel even remotely confident about is my ability in writing, but nothing else. And there are some days, in my darker moments, where even that I completely shirk in favor of being an unproductive slob. I feel cursed for how my mind can wander so freely, and have such hunger to explore so many different fields whilst I have left my own social person and interaction with others blank and unrevealing."

I am working on an emergency fund atm. But what else should I be doing? I plan on buying a home soon-ish. 

1. How much should my emergency fund be?
2. I am currently using my TFSA to save my emergency fund. What are my other options to keep money accessible and get better rate than 1.5%?
3. For down payment, should I be investing in RRSP (HBP) or saving in TFSA?

edit:
    TFSA: Tax-free savings account (type of account where you don't pay capital gains tax, dividends tax, etc.)
    RRSP: Registered Retirement Savings Plan (tax-sheltered account, no income tax until you withdraw when retired)

pxvia,6,2012-02-20,First Resume. Could really use some advice.,Bendetta327,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/pxvia/first_resume_could_really_use_some_advice/,"I've been a web developer for about 3.5 years now. I got an internship from my brother's friend my freshman year of college, and I failed out of school after my sophomore year. I've been working full time for the same company since then, and now I'm getting married and have a kid so I need to go some place where they'll pay me more - I asked for a raise and was essentially denied.

I never really needed a resume before, and I'm trying to update the one I did have during school, but never needed to use. Now that I'm going to be putting it out everywhere, I feel like this is very lacking despite having a good amount of experience now. I'm the only web developer here, and I do some IT stuff with the only other actual IT guy in the building.

I don't think I should mention my school experience. I also haven't had time with the newborn to get an actual online portfolio going. Is this considered a must and should be included on the resume?

This is what I have going so far.

##Concerning reddit:

&gt;What is the origin or meaning of your user name?

&gt;&gt;I needed an AOL screen name and had just visited Ireland. I thought it flowed off the tongue well.

&gt;Total number of reddit identities you’ve had?

&gt;&gt;Just the one. I haven't caused any problems that warranted abandoning this account.

&gt;What is your favorite part of reddit?

&gt;&gt;The incredibly broad range of topics and stories that you can read and discuss. I don't know anywhere else that offers such a broad supply of content and commentary.

&gt;What do you do when you’re not on reddit?

&gt;&gt;Study, read, take a walk, listen to music, travel

&gt;Do you think reddit has changed in the last year or so?

&gt;&gt;I think a significant amount of the growth has come from memes and macros, like the kind found in F7U12 and AdviceAnimals. More people are coming to reddit for specific niches of content, like memes and MMOs like SC2, TF2 and LoL, not joining the site as a whole and discovering subreddits they find interesting.

&gt;If so, do you think it’s been for the better?

&gt;&gt;Reddit has always been what you make of it. The default front page was never a pinnacle of rationality as some old-timers (and more recent redditors) contend. Sensational and misleading headlines have been earning the top spots from the beginning.
At this point, I'm not subscribed to any default reddits, and haven't been for some time. The largest communities I'm subscribed to are /r/sex and /r/Android with just over 100k members. I don't envy the job of the moderators running the larger ones, since they have a nearly impossible task to enforce their rules (if they want to).

##Final Question:

&gt;Is there anything you'd like to plug/promote/advocate?

&gt;&gt;I'm a moderator of a few communities in the RepublicOfReddit network. If you're looking for replacements for many of the default reddits that maintain a higher signal:noise ratio and have transparent moderation, come visit us in /r/RepublicOfPolitics, /r/RepublicOfAtheism, and /r/RepublicOfReddit. If you've ever complained about reddit or think you can do better, come see how much of a difference you can make."

[Why not?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3sszbf?context=5)|I mean if its something your really wanna do go for it. Skilled welders are not paid or respected like they used to be. Theres been a pay freeze for the past 10 years, when I got in, jobs were paying $20-$25 an hour for someone who knew what they were doing. Now they want to pay $17-$18 starting off. Yet they will higher an idiot engy straight out of school for $50-$60 a year and you are cleaning up their mess all the time.
[Is this because most manufacturing has been outsourced overseas in the past few decades?  Or something else?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3stdt3?context=5)|Mostly yes.
[Wow good for you! I'm 20 and I've been welding for a couple years now, I'm up in Alberta welding on pressure pipe. Recently I'm thinking about setting up my own truck but I'm not sure how exactly you go about getting clients, do you know? An also how did you end up landing those cool jobs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3sska0?context=5)|I never stopped looking for a job, Ive always known what I was capable of and was never happy doing production work. Push yourself to do better, be better, know more. Know what your worth monetarily and to the company.  As in terms of getting clients, I dont know much, I have a friend that has started his own business, the jist of what I have gotten is there are web pages out there that companies post bids on for work they need done. You go on and bid on the job after you have run your numbers and decided what you want to charge.   My recommendation and what I have seen work well is.  1) get your truck and everything you might need, little by little. 2) Keep a full time job, use your side work as means to pay off or buy tools needed. 3) Word of mouth, craigslist etc, just start building up your experience and client base.
[Miller or Lincoln?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3sske2?context=5)|Miller, or Fronius. Fronius is much nicer technology and they are starting to get into the US pretty strong. But miller because of the support in the northeast, Lincoln is more popular down south.  Every Lincoln ive used, just doesn't feel right. I have a harder time weldin I feel. I mean it doesnt really affect me using one or the other but how the arc starts, pedal sensitivity etc.   Lincolns a very storng company and are really pushing the welding simulators.   Funny Story I was actually at a demo for an American Welding Society meeting near me. The rep held a competition of Flux core mig. It uses a scoring system to rate your by how stable you were, consistency in rate of travel, angle etc. Now I'm in a room with 30 people, all have been welding longer then Ive been alive.  I actually won lol, by like two points. I was shocked as hell, got a nice hood out of it.  tl;dr Did a welding game with a bunch of older welders and won. Barely.
[Ever work with aliens on Area 51?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3st96d?context=5)|Once, but it was a long time ago and I dont wanna talk about it.
[What do you tell girls you do for a living when you chat to them in a bar?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3st5av?context=5)|Hello, my names ---- Im a Metallurgical Bonding Specialist.
[How many of your friends died when the rebels blew up the 2nd death star?  Do personal politics come into consideration when you take a job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3stcgj?context=5)|Lolwut.
[Is the work physically demanding? Howso? Does it keep you in shape?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3stj5e?context=5)|The work can be excruciating hard, like when I was doing confined space ont he condensers, or it can be laid back and easy as hell. It can certainly keep you in shape, climbing, crawling holding a 30 lb lead above your head for 10 mins at a time for 8-10 hours.
[How many hours a week do you work?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3stj5e?context=5)|Depends on how well you pick it up. Ive known guys who have welded for years that cant do code, its how much you want to learn and want to do quality.
[How long does it take to become qualified for welding work, starting from scratch?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3stj5e?context=5)|Yes a lot of welders develop eye problems later on from arc flash or just the eye strain, lung issues and skin cancer can crop up without proper PPE.
[Do you enjoy what you do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3stj5e?context=5)|For the most, most days lol.
[Did you go to school for welding?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3ssvs5?context=5)|Yes i did, I went to a Technical High school where I learned the basics. Didnt really prepare me for the workforce, luckily I had people willing to teach me more once I got out of school. I got certified for my basic AWS cert while I was there. All other training I have gotten on the job.
[Wouldn't working with stainless technically be considered ""brazing""?  Or is it just all welding?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3stscj?context=5)|Uhhhh. not as far as I know. Brazing is more of a Mechanical bond, between two plates and the filler. Welding more making two pieces one, using the material it is made of. Unless your doing dissimilar metals, then thats more complicated.
[I have to agree with that.  My dad was an underwater welder most of my childhood and then a foreman. Life was good when he had a rare union job.  But I spent most of my childhood moving from coast to coast while he changed jobs.  Out of curiosity, are you unionized?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3stlgi?context=5)|I used to, when I was building for the Navy.
[What is the single scariest piece of military equipment you've worked on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3ssi4y?context=5)|I honestly havnt worked on anything really scary. The coolest/most pain in the ass that I have worked on was the condensers for the Virginia class subs and the new super carriers. Defense contractors are spread out all over the place. I did have a friend in texas that said he was working on chemical weapon components. Thats something I really wanted to work on. As morbid as it is.
[Any artistic ambitions that you'd care to pursue in your welding career?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3st5mn?context=5)|God Id love to, I am aiming for when I get a house and a garage making a blacksmith, sheetmetal shop and working on my projects in my head.   Make a real Katana is my dream.
[Best weld...stick or fluxcore? tell me about mixing shielding gasses. Personal Protection? respirators? have you noticed damage to your eyes? what color are they? (optional)what is your ethnicity/background? TIG tips?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3stdxn?context=5)|Depends on the job and where your at. What do you want to know about mixing shielding gases? I have only ever used bottle mixes 75/25 90/10 60/40 60/38/2. PPE depends on the job at hand, I recommend respirators at all times if your grinding or mig welding. a p100 should be good enough. 3m's 7501 witht he pancake p100 is nice and comfy, if you dont have tor wear safety classes all the time. I have had arc flash but no permanent damage. green/blue to hazel. Im white, msotly western europe mutt.   Tig tips, Rest the cup on the piece if you can and get as comfy as you can. 45 degrees doesnt always work sometimes a 30/15 works great. Set your amperage to the piece your working on, the pedal is a percentage of that usually.
[What has been your greatest accomplishment as a welder?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3st5r3?context=5)|I did all of the new procedure qualifications for dissimilar metals, which included re-qualifying old procedures and developing new ones with my welding engineer for the new super carrier condensers. They were all ultimatley used. I passed 51/52, screwed up a 1/16 Inconel test. We didn't use it anyways. These all got X-rayed, cut up, bent( destructive), and macro'd (being able to see the individual pass, Heat affected zones and grain.).
[Any advice for a new student? I'm in my first semester, and I'm doing really good so far. Anything to look out for when I enter the work force?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3stbjk?context=5)|First off, Thank you so much for your service to our country.  Youll need to feel out any new place, but trust no one. Sometimes welders dont like new guys.  Take your time, think everything out from start to finish. Double and triple check your math and measurements. Its better to take longer to make it right the first time then to have to make two.
[My question is, what type of process(es) and what type of material did you use for the majority of the spent fuel rod lockers? Could you walk me through your guys' quality procedures (ie x-ray tested? Destruct tested?)? Were you required to be AWS or some other type of certification to work with such dangerous material? What was the worst part of the welding (crazy out of position? Extensive pre-heating before laying a bead? Huge time-consuming multi-pass welds?)? And do they allow you to weave your hardwire welds or must you lay stringers only?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3sto6i?context=5)|&gt; What was the worst part of the welding (crazy out of position? Extensive pre-heating before laying a bead? Huge time-consuming multi-pass welds?)? &lt;
[What is your favorite TV show?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3st5ku?context=5)|Oh, tough one.. Right now I have five. Dexter, Walking Dead, Hell on wheels, Alphas dirty jobs.
[How often do your friends ask you to make things for them? Can you 'feel' if it's a good weld? If so, how? Do you get sick of what you do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3stbmi?context=5)|-Every once in awhile. I cant know, my boss doesn't allow personal work. -When you know what your doing, I can't stress that enough, everything went smoothly, good penetration and your weld looks good. BUT welds can look gorgeous and fail miserably. A good experienced welder trained in inspection cans pot the fakes.
[What's the hardest metal to weld with? The easiest?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3stbmi?context=5)|- Depends, all metal sucks to weld wihtout the proper prep. Thats the key. Aluminum can be the trickiest I will say, with thin gauge Stainless being a very close second. Theres a lot of details and procedures to follow with both.
[What's the hardest weld/job you worked on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3sstau?context=5)|The condensers for the submarines. They are so ridiculously tight in there.  A lot of areas I couldn't fit into so I have to improvise by welding with an extension on the mig gun, or hang upside. Sometimes I had to take my boots off just to get in there. It was hot as hell in there during the summer.
[Is there a different technique used in welding pieces going into a nuclear reactor? I'm taking a course in the radiation effects on materials and was just curious.  Also, do you have any experience/ knowledge of using acoustic emissions to find any cracks, whether on welding surfaces or not?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3stva4?context=5)|Yes im familiar with ultrasonic work. No diffrent technique, just better welding.
[When I was working at Subbase Bangor in WA, one of the cryo techs in my shop filled an argon vessel with LIN before sending it back to the welders. An inquiry went down, and being the new guy I got the blame. Not mad about it; hated the navy by that time anyway. My question was, how much of a hassle would it have been to redo all those welds? What sort of testing would have to be done to determine the composition of the welds to see if they were done with N2 instead of argon?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3ste9v?context=5)|I dont know what a cryo tech is, and I assume LIN is liquid nitrogen. Keep in mind not all acronyms are universally used. It is up to the weld engy to determine based on the purpose of the vessel is the n2 is gonna affect the  weld substantially. The AWS book on Elements of Metallurgy has tables and exceprts about the effects of n2 vs argon. Sometime they are neglible. Sometime they can cause cracking it all depends on material being welding. I dont know how much of a hassle it would be to redo the welds because you didnt say what you were working on. Typically argon adds some strength to SS and steel. But n2 can be used. If you are going to purging only.  tl;dr Welding engineers call on if they need to fix it or not.
[I want to get a cheap setup for basic car stuff: sheet metal and possibly welding heavier suspension components to the frame.  What type of set up would you recommend?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3st9bh?context=5)|Http://store.cyberweld.com/mil175witecc.html  This should work as long as your not going over 5/16"". If you are need to go next step.  Be careful welding on frames, do your homework.
[How many times have you forgotten to turn the gas on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3su8w3?context=5)|Lol at least once a week,.
[I really want to get into welding because its a trade skill that I figured will get me a job wherever I go, in the us and in the world. Im also an artist and want to use it as an art medium. Any thoughts?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3stczr?context=5)|Go for it!
[How often do you have diarrhea on the job? Is the welder ever clogged?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3suoow?context=5)|About once a month, but only on sundays at noon.   sometimes, but i just say a chant and the smurfs come out.
[I'm currently working at H.I.I. as a structural welder @ the Newport News shipyard, I assume this is where you were working as well for the Virginia Class stuff?  Or were you up at Electric Boat Company?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3stdym?context=5)|Sub contractor in NJ, for electric boat. The carriers went straight to newport.
[Nice to see an AMA by a welder. I'm nearly finished my C level (year one in BC) and am going for my metal fabricator's ticket straight away afterward. Apologies if this has been answered, but what sort of gear have you got? What's your favourite/least favourite process? Ever had any close calls on the job, e.g. shit idiots have done that's nearly gotten you killed? Lastly, if you could be doing any kind of welding, anywhere, what would it be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3stnmc?context=5)|I dont own much of my own gear anymore, I have a miller elite hood though. Tig welding is my fav. Ive had a couple ""I almost got fucked up"" Ive always been real careful with others around, ive messed myself up more by being a klutz then anything else lol.  Nuclear welding or weapons manufacturing. I love what im doing now though with custom sheet metal fab.
[Ever do a little oxy-acetylene welding on the side for old times sake?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3ssoed?context=5)|Lol, you know what, I never really got into it. Ironically I wasnt required by the AWS to pass that in school and no one does it anymore really. Ive done it a couple times, but I love tig welding more.
[Off topic question. How much different is Carbon based steel welding for a MIG welder running straight argon gas as opposed to a 75 25 mix?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3swq8y?context=5)|Runs much colder, the c02 acts as a de oxidizer, increase the heat and Helps with penetration.
[When I was in shipyard (on the navy side) I heard of a midget welder that they lowered into places no one else could reach. Do you have one of those in your shop?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3stnf7?context=5)|Apprently a long time ago in the 70's the palce i worked at that built the condensers did have a midget who worked there lol.
[When my grandfather came home from the war, he settled down with the woman he's met at a USO dance and became a welder. It would be the only job he held until the day he retired forty-five years later (with the same company). He was a machinist, an engineer, and a true tinkerer. Because of that, I've always harbored this sort of romantic idea about the welding profession.  How typical was his experience? Is the profession still as stable as it was in his time? I worked in programming and IT for a while because I wanted to sort of follow in his footsteps, and I was disgusted by how transitory most of the jobs in that field were. Is it still possible to find a good company and stick with them for a career?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3sv39c?context=5)|Its not unhearxdof. Depends on person and company. Yes it is still possible. But rare  there is no company or employer loyalty really around anymore.
[How hard was certification tests?  And what equipment do you typically weld with (modified MIG, TIG, something Industrial etc)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3stfnn?context=5)|Mig-pulse and tig. Some pulse tig. Depends on the type of tests, full pen on thin gauge with purge overhead is a bitch.  The place i work at now its a syncrowave 200. Small company/start up.

What are a few things that I can do to make your life easier?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3swe6f?context=5)|The biggest problem I have is engy's making things to hard when it doesnt have to be, I.e. you have the software to pull measurements off anything. Every chance you can try  putting in extra dimensions, and other dimensions so we can check to make sure everything is correct. Otherwise I have to sit here and do half an hour of math ahead of time laying everything out.
[Are you worried (at all) more about breathing in welding fume, or x-ray exposure from radiographic inspection?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pwi7n/iama_xray_certified_welder_that_has_worked_on/c3stpey?context=5)|Very much so, i used to go through 2-3 p100 masks a day, clogged to where I couldnt breathe through them.  No worries about xray, no one should be around. Not like it stays hot.

But there needs to be procedures established by whoever does the r&amp;d or inspection.
[I did a internship at a company that tested welders in the construction industry by pulling apart 2 wires (which they use in prefabricated concrete constructions) that where welded (? idk is this correct?

pxsxk,0,2012-02-20,A perspective on yellow fever and interracial dating,whitedudesproblems,asiantwoX,https://www.reddit.com/r/asiantwoX/comments/pxsxk/a_perspective_on_yellow_fever_and_interracial/,"This is sort of a response to the Lena Chen article that is on the top of this subreddit right now.

About *my* supposed ""yellow fever"": I was in China for an internship and have to do a complimentary language course in university . I was accused of yellow fever the second I started studying in University.

I'm a white dude and have been together with my pinay girlfriend for 3 years now. I am quite used to the looks we get on the street. (There are not many asian-white couples where I live) One thing I will never get used to though is the jokes I get on a regular basis from friends, family, or just random people at parties etc. I was accused of ""yellow fever"" so many times its not even funny. Its hard enough for SEA-white couples to get over all this ""does she love you long time?"" thing that still far too many people have in the back of their mind. Wearing a suit to work hasn't been much helpful with the ""your girlfriend is a mail order bride"" for me either. Being accused of yellow fever is additionally hurtful. What most people dont realize is that its extremely devaluing for a relationship to get called names like that.. As if the relationship is based on some kind of sexual fetish.

As asian girls are the most recent culprits of accusing me the most of my ""yellow fever"" I'd like to get a perspective on how you think about this. I have felt that some asian girls tend to abuse the word to poison existing and new relationships from the getgo. I also feel like the word is hurtful to any cross cultural relationships while being nationalistic and or sometimes flat out racist on its own. I have never heard the word mentioned in a positive way. So why keep asian girls using it so frequently? 

WARNING CONTROVERSIAL 

I feel that some girls feel entitled that they are the center of a ""fetish"" and abuse it to be condescending and get a sense of superiority.

And how is yellow fever different from the the ""gay-gene"" ? As in: you are born to like certain traits. And how is it treated so differently. Its as if gays were accusing gays of homosexuality. Why is it deemed to be pathological anyways? Most guys like blonde hair. Now liking black hair is sick?

END CONTROVERSIAL

I'd also like to know what you think ""yellow fever"" exactly is and why its so ""creepy"" to some girls. For me -- I am not into anime, I dont watch hentai. I dont watch korean dramas. I am mostly interested in asia business-wise. My girlfriend and I met by pure luck. My ex and I aswell. She was - interestingly - half asian. Which got me comments like ""you slowly get hooked on asian"". So asian girls are drugs aswell. 

So for me there might be a pattern here even though I might not be typical. But is my interest in asia now off putting? I've always felt like similar interest rarely hurt a relationship.

I also dislike the idea that one can get ""identified"" with yellow fever. As if my love for her is some kind of unnatural disease. 

I hope my rant is somewhat comprehendable. I am typing this on the train right now. I'd love to get a view on things so please leave comments aplenty.

I met her three years ago and she is the kind of person you only meet once in a lifetime. And, of course, I screwed it all up.

We were good friends for 8 months (I waited too long to clear my true intentions, I guess), dated for almost a year and a half and it's been 10 months since we broke up. Our relationship had many problems, but I think the main reason of its ending was my inability to handle them the right way. I was too jealous, controlling and impulsive. I blamed the society and her friends for influencing her to do things I disapproved, when it wasn't really up to me to decide all that. I judge people a lot (maybe I'll be a judge someday, maybe not).

After we broke up, I lost it. She was too important in my life, and that's never good. I lacked of other things to keep me interested and occupied when I wasn't with her, and once I figured I wouldn't be with her again, everything went down. Things got out of control and she filed a restraining order against me (and it gets better: I'm a law student). Her family was scared and who can blame them? I would've done the same thing or worse If I had a daughter and some guy wouldn't stop annoying her and going after her against her will. Long story short, I spent my 21st birthday afternoon in a police station explaining myself. I talked to a professor of mine and lawyered up. He solved the hole thing without getting me involved.

The fact is, after all that, I still miss her and don't know what do with myself. I've tried lots of things, good and bad. I searched for psychological and psychiatric help and started taking anti depressives; I used cocaine, which I regret; I spent a month in Europe (I could easily be living in London, but I can't just drop off college now); I started to practice Boxing and returned to play football, but injured my knee; I got in touch with old friends; I dedicated myself into a 4 months internship at the Federal Courts of Justice in Brazil (in case I didn't mention, that's where I'm from).

I'm much more mature now and I'm certain that I could do things differently, but I'm also certain that she will never be with me again. The thing is, at the end of the day, I can't help thinking about her and feel sad for everything. And I'm sure she doesn't waist any second of her life thinking about me anymore and is probably having fun with her friends - it's Carnival weekend over here. So I wanted to ask for some real advice, something huge. It could be anything, like growing a beard (even tho I'm incapable of doing that), buy an old Jeep and live in northern Norway. I don't care, I just want some ideas and advices to help me get thru this. 

And I know this is probably a cliche question, but believe me, this wasn't just a normal relationship break up for me. It's much harder, much deeper. The ""you'll find someone else"" is useless. I have strong issues regarding social relationships (you can probably tell by now) and I connected with her like I only do with one other person in the world, my brother who has Down Syndrome and is a very special person.

Don't know If anyone is going to read this, but writing and talking always helps me put my thoughts in order. And If you did read, thank you for your time.

Cheers and thanks for all the learning and laughter you promote here everyday.

I would like to stay here longer, so I am thinking of doing internship over the summer. I have already applied to couple of places, but haven't heard back. Can anyone suggest me where I should look for one? I tried standard google search, but there a lot of 'scam internships'. 

My Info:
I am studying computer engineering, have worked in IT for over a year in past as student assistant. I know Java, C and LC3 assembly quite well. I am also familiar with python, HTML, CSS3 and Javascript. Not to forget Microsoft office. 

I don't have permit to work here, but I have heard obtaining one is not difficult. Accommodation should not be a problem since I know a friend who I can stay with. 
I would appreciate any advise people can give me! Thanks in advance. 

EDIT: I won't mind staying here for extra 6 months either, if there is a co-op or something similar. "
pxala,1,2012-02-19,IAmA young band manager AMA about your band making it!,[deleted],musicians,https://www.reddit.com/r/musicians/comments/pxala/iama_young_band_manager_ama_about_your_band/,"I have been infatuated with music for quite some time, and have always been very social and outgoing. I play guitar and sing relatively well, but decided that the music business was a good path to go on. In 2007 I enrolled as an Entertainment and Arts Management major at Drexel University in Philadelphia, PA. Classes included ""Arts Writing for Non-Profits"" to ""Touring and Promotions""... that being said, you really learn the real shit through the real world.
After interning with Umphrey's McGee, a midsize rock group based in Chicago, I was able to take in a variety of skills and tips to make it as a grassroots band/organization. Through UM I was also able to work two major festivals, including Lollapalooza which I will be doing again this August for my fourth year.
For my second internship, I took my skill set and decided to go big and apply it to a group that I figured had MGMT and a label, but really only had good buzz. Cheers Elephant ( www.cheerselephant.com ), a psych-rock group out of PHL, decided to take me on as their manager in March 2010. I was 20-years-old, managing four 24-28 year-olds who had already established a local buzz. My mission was to continue to build them in a variety of ways: structure Cheers as a business, polish their online presence, stay engaged with connections, tour, acquire new fans, etc. allowing them to focus on the creative side of things.
So, it's been about two years, and I'd like to think I've made a great impression in Philadelphia and beyond. We're about to release our third record that is truly going to put us on another level... which is all you can ask for. Constantly going for the next level. However, I've stacked the deck to have it all lean in our favor. Great album production, multiple music videos, new website, full blown PR campaign, and a tour to support the new record.
I've promoted a sold out show, I've taken a meeting in an NYC high-rise with fancy A&amp;R dudes, I've been a roadie, I made a tour poster, I've been a stage manager, I've sold merch, I've restrung a guitar, I drove the van... That's the key: you must be able to wear all the hats. Not too bad for a 22 year-old.
There's another key thing to mention, which I feel can apply to all aspects of life. Love what you're doing, love what you sell. People can see the bullshit in your teeth. I will never represent a band that I wouldn't listen to on my way to work, or recommend to a friend. First and foremost I am music fan, and you can't lose sight of that. Being a legitimate fan of your product, you have the ability to intellegently talk about it for hours on end because you are honestly into it. Common sense? You'd be surprised.
Some parting comments: 1. You hear it all the time, but networking is truly key. To make it in a scene, you must be immersed in it inside and out.
You should be spending most of your personal money on attending other bands shows. Introduce yourself, mention your band, and they'll likely return the favor.
Engage with fans, often.
Release new content, often. The whole world has ADHD now.
Things don't happen to you, you make things happen. Get used to it.
If you're a starting band, play as many shows that makes sense. If you're an established band, don't over saturate and keep your audience wanting more.
RESPOND TO EVERY EMAIL. Even if some lame band looking to open for you. Kindly point them in the right direction- you'll never know if you'll be opening for them one day.
Embrace change. It is absolutely possible to make money in the music industry, you just need to be smart.
Reach high. Fake it 'till you make it.
There is no fucking formula! Talent and skill evolves into a variety of lucky encounters which in turn breaks your band. It's a numbers game.
Any who, if you are a starting band/manager/arts presenter that is interested in my insight, please feel free to ask!
BTW, here's Cheers Elephant's brand new video. Let me know what you think! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgMChsTx7GQ"

The thing is, at the end of the day, I can't help thinking about her and feel sad for everything. And I'm sure she doesn't waist any second of her life thinking about me anymore and is probably having fun with her friends - it's Carnival weekend over here. So I wanted to ask (finally) for some real advice, something huge. It could be anything, like growing a beard (even tho I'm incapable of doing that), rent a Jeep and live in northern Norway. I don't care, I just want some ideas and advices to help me get thru this. 

And I know this is probably a cliche question, but believe me, this wasn't just a normal relationship break up for me. It's much harder, much deeper. The ""you'll find someone else"" is useless. I have issues regarding social relationships (you can probably tell by now) and I connected with her like I only do with one other person in the world, my brother who has Down Syndrome and is a very special person.

Don't know If anyone is going to read this, but writing and talking always helps me put my thoughts in order. And If you did read, thank you for your time.

Cheers and thanks for all the learning and laughter you promote here everyday."

q00i6,226,2012-02-21,This is my confession.,mprunner85,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/q00i6/this_is_my_confession/,"*DISCLAIMER*

First of all, I just want to say- what you're about to read is true. However, it is up to you to arrive at your own conclusions. I just need to get this off my chest because I have never told anyone in real life thinking they won't believe me. Not even my parents, my friends or my GF. Being anonymous here affords me an audience that I would not get otherwise. It's kind of long so please, bare with me. 

I like to run. I ran a lot and I've been running since sophomore year in highschool. I graduated in 2003, which means I have been running either competitively or recreationally for over 10 years now. I don't plan on stopping anytime soon, and to me, running is the best stress reliever for any amount of terrible things going on in my life. Over the years, girlfriends and loved ones have left and faded away, but the road has always been there. Gravel, cement, sand, snow, flat, curved, undulating- as long as I have two feet, and two shoes I can run and just, forget.
Sorry, I am getting a bit nostalgic, so let us move on. I ran through highschool, made state a few times for cross country, but never won it, and walked on in college for the X-country team (Div III nothing major). After college, decided to stop running competitively since my life was moving faster now- much faster than my legs could keep up. I moved, got an internship to another city and said good bye to my weeping mom, packed up my things and flew across the country. This new city of mine, had some of the highest costs of living in the country and so I moved out of the city, but kept my job. My commute to work everyday was not so bad, and the low cost of rent allowed me to afford some luxuries as a semi-decent car, decent clothes and decent food. I even started dating a girl that I knew from high school that happened to live nearby.


Anyways, this new place that I got myself was kind of in an older city. In fact, it was one of the oldest small communities in the East Coast. I decided to look up trails around my house and found an old park about 10 minutes drive; I looked it up and found that it had a circumference of about 10kms which would be ideal for a few laps. I made a mental note to drive down and run it the next day.
The next day, I got off work late due to some project I had to do and would be starting my run about an hour after I normally do- around 5:30pm. Since this was the fall, the sun would pretty much set around 6, and of because that, I was a bit apprehensive about running a trail I had never traversed before. I decided to do it in the end because I was a grown up, and there were probably going to be other people on the trail, and there has to be signs and some sort of lighting.
I arrived at the park and noticed immediately how old it looked and the thick the trees were. I got there around 5:45 and already the sky was turning dark. Right away I noticed how creepy some of these trees looked with their vacant branches clawing at the sky- as if they were trying to escape the soil that anchored them. The park was connected to the road by an over-pass, and I decided to make one lap around for today, a trial run, and see how it was. I quickly glanced at the trail map, laced up and ran over the bridge.
The trail was covered by trees and every time I looked forward, I noticed that there was just more and more of them overlapping. To me, their branches looked like interlocking fingers belonging to a series of giant hands that were enclosing upon me. It was around 6:15 when I was half way into my run, and the sun had set completely. All I could see were silhouettes of trees infront of me which seemed to go on forever. The sky came in cracks where the branches allowed it, and I could see no stars or clouds in the night above me. I could also hear no car noises nor did I see any other joggers on the path. The only sound were the sound of my Asics moving along the pavement. I made a mental note to speed up and finish as quickly as possible. I am an atheist, and I certainly don't believe in anything paranormal, but I also didn't want to get mugged or lost in the darkness. I checked my GPS at 6:27 which told me I had ran about 8kms in the last 40 minutes. I was making good progress, and had only 2kms to go. A sign that I pssed showing the direction of the park exit confirmed this notion. It was around this time when I felt a bit of relief that weird things started happening. Like I said, this is all true and while it may seem kind of weird, I swear that it happened exactly as I am about to describe.
Around 2 minutes after I had checked my GPS, I heard something- the sound of footsteps about 500 meters behind me. 

Great, I thought. Another jogger- at least I'll have company. The footsteps were a rhythmic pace with even intervals slightly slower than the pace that I was at, but also not at a slow jog. Pat-pat-pat-pat they went behind me in the distant darkness. I continued forward with my speed, honestly, a bit relieved that there was some else sharing the trail with me at the time and looked forward to leaving.

""Mark."" I heard a male's voice call my name from the background. No it can't be, must be the wind or the trees. I kept going forward...""Marrkk"". OK there was no mistaking it now that was definitely my name. I slowed down to a jog, but didn't stop, and turned around. Behind me all I could see were silhouettes of trees- nothing. A calm breeze rustled the leaves lying on the ground around me, but that was the only movement I could see. Or hear. The pat-pat-pat of my running companion had faded. I shrugged and kept going forward again. 
""Mark P____"" my full name was called. It stopped me dead in my tracks and a cold chill went down my spine. How could there possibly me someone that knew my FULL name in the middle of this park. Could it be a highschool or college buddy who recognized me and was fucking with me?
""Ya? Who's there?"" I called back into the darkness. One of my hands went into my pockets around my car keys in case there was a confrontation. No one replied. I turned around and began to start up again.
""What's the hurry you little shit?"" I jumped out and turned to the direction of my voice, seeing only an old hollowed out tree.

""Look man, I have to finish this. I'll see you at the entrance."" I answered back to no one in particular. I was trying hard not to show fear in my voice and was using the excuse of finishing my run to get the hell out of there. I started up again and really stepped on it.
""Race ya, Mark"" said the voice in my ear. I looked back, but again saw nothing in the woods behind me. I started running faster- a really fast jogging pace.
This is when shit got REALLY weird.
I heard the pat-pat-pat-pat of the runner behind me. Unmistakable footsteps, but the cadence seemed off. His steps were faster now, but they weren't well spaced apart- as if he was speeding up and slowing down: pat-pat-----pat----pat---------pat--------pat--pat--pat--clonk
Wait what was that?
CLONK--CLONK--CLONK---CLONK---CLONK
Were those? Hooves? Ok I have totally lost my mind. Paranoia and adrenaline was starting to make me hear stuff that was not there. But it was unmistakable. It was the sound of hooves running. Fast. Not a horse's hooves where you can hear four , but the clonking was a lot shorter and faster tempo- as if there were just two feet. I glanced back and again saw nothing but twisted branches reaching up to the sky.
I started sprinting towards the overpass that I came across. It was about 600 meters ahead of me and I knew for whatever reason that if I made it there I was safe.

clonkclonkclonkclonk
My pursuer had also started sprinting. At this point my heart was going a million beats per minute and I knew I could not let him catch me. Whatever he was, I HAD to get to that overpass before him. Every race I had ran: from state in highschool to NCAA races in college were just races. In the end, win or lose you were going home. All that was on the line was pride. Like I said, I am a non-believer, but I knew in the back of my mind and with every tendon that was screaming for me to stop, and every sinew of being in my body that was racing at that very moment, that I had to make that overpass before he did, and if I lost this race, something absolutely terrible would happen.
I sprinted. I sprinted like it was the 2003 state championships, like the 2007 NCAA championships. I knew that out of every race I had ever ran- from small relays when I was a kid, to races in front of thousands, out of all those races, this race of the last 400 or so meters between me and whatever the fuck was chasing me, and making those sounds...this race I was in, was by far the most important race I have and will ever run.
I ran as fast as I could. I ran until I felt my lungs would burst- I ran at a sub 4:30 mile pace. I ran for my life. And he was gaining on me. Clonkclonkclonkclonk. Each step I took it seemed he got closer- the hooves got louder, and each step I took the overpass seemed to be even further away.

I gritted through my teeth and with every ounce of strength in my body pressed hard for the last 50 meters and ran right to the overpass. I turned and got off the trail and planted both feet on the reassuring wood planks. No sooner had I turned into the overpass, I knew that he was right behind me by no more than an inch. And at that moment I felt him. And I smelt him. I smelt decay, and embers, and funeral pyres and incenses. I also felt the coldest chill went down my spine throughout every neuron and fiber in my body and I felt completely paralyzed as he passed me. The whole world around me stopped at that moment and time itself seemed to slow down. My heartbeat grinded almost to a halt, and my breath came out in a long slow sigh- in a long slow funnel of mist infront of my face. I saw and felt everything, even thought this happened in mere seconds. And for those mere seconds, that I felt him pass behind, I knew I had experienced death.
""See you around"" he whispered, so close into my ear with this terrible, sickly breath.

Clonk-Clonk-Clonk--pat---pat-----pat------pat-----pat
His stpes faded away down the trail as I looked back from the overpass. Of course the path was empty and only a slight breeze passed through the tree branches. I walked over the bridge, my heart rate going back down and didn't say a word. I got in my car and that night, after I showered and changed at home, I collapsed in my bed due to exhaustion that I had never faced in my entire life, and fell asleep for 12 hours.


It's been over a year now, and I still wonder about the events that transpired that day. Did I imagine it all? Was someone playing tricks on me? Then how did they know my name? Yet, I each time I think of it, I get right back to that day- I remember every detail so vividly and it all felt so real. I still feel that sense of dread every time I am around a fire or see images of a funeral. Then again, it could all have been my mind having a hallucination due to my paranoia and adrenaline from the run. I am a skeptical, educated person, and it takes a lot to unnerve me, but what happened that day, I still cannot understand no matter how much I try. Regardless, I am still not a firm believer, but I am an agnostic now. Thanks for reading. "

My name is Andrew Frink, I am an intern at the Louisville Nature Center. A truly unique community resource, the Louisville Nature Center offers wonderful opportunities for nature study and recreation--right in the heart of the city! Part of the Nature Center’s goal is the give a well rounded nature education to the community and to local schools. The Nature Center is often the destination of school trips and family outings.

Currently, the Nature Center has many displays and live animals that are kept on exhibit to help educate and inform visitors about the level of biodiversity in the state of Kentucky. While the Nature Center has snakes, snails, frogs and even a salamander, the Nature Center does not have a display highlighting the vast series of streams and rivers in Kentucky. The commonwealth contains over 90,000 miles of streams containing over 250 different Native Species of fish. We have the largest amount of navigable 
water in any state (except for Alaska).
  
The Green River System is ranked in the top 5 river systems for diversity in the United States, this precious resource deserves to be protected and appreciated. Everyday, the rivers of Kentucky are continually polluted by everything from mining to urbanization. The first step to protecting this resource is to understand and appreciate its natural beauty.

As a intern at the Nature Center, I would like to set-up an educational display highlighting the natural beauty of the Kentucky Rivers. The display will include a river aquarium containing native plants and several species of wild caught native fish as well as an educational poster. In order for the display to be possible, I will need donations from wherever I can get them. I would LOVE to recognize Reddit and/or Redditors for helping with my project!

I think it would be awesome to put the Reddit logo on the display to let people know that my project was made a success in part by this community. Obviously, I’d follow up with pictures and videos of the completed display.

In the rare event of excess donation, all extra donations will go directly to the Louisville Nature Center. In fact, all money will go to them first and then they will allow me a budget for the project.

I guess PM me if you have anything to offer or comment/upvote for support.

Thank You,

Andrew

pz0v5,5,2012-02-21,"""We raised you better than this.""",anxietyistheworst,familysupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/familysupport/comments/pz0v5/we_raised_you_better_than_this/,"tl;dr version- I'm 26, I started working in NYC about six months ago and have been saving up money to move out of my house in NJ since.  I found an awesome place to live with two guys that I know and trust.  I told my family (my grandma and aunt whom I live with and my mom) and they told me I was not allowed to move in with guys / to Elmhurst, NYC / with roommates at all.  What the fuck do I do.

long version aka backstory &gt;

I've always butted heads with my family.  They are very strict and set in their ways whereas I have always felt the need to explore the world and get out there and see things for myself.  They like to watch a lot of television and never leave the house, but I never wanted that kind of life.  I found school to be my niche early on, when my family members were fighting, I was always safe with books and my own world.  I was given a computer at 13 and made a lot of internet friends and found punk rock.  I loved going to shows and had to fight with my mom and grandma to let me go for years.  The first time I wanted to go to a club show with my friends (to see Dashboard Confessional play acoustic!), I made a powerpoint to show my mom I wasn't going to get hurt.  She let me go.

When I wanted to go to college, I had to fight to go away to school. I got a BA in English in 2008 and came home and couldn't find a job.  I had planned on going to grad school right away but I broke my leg that fall. I had to cancel my honors thesis and live at home while I spent the semester in a wheelchair.  My mom worked from home at the time and I kept going to two classes so I could graduate on time.  That summer, my mom told me that I wasted all of her money because I got a useless degree, despite it being something I was really passionate in.  She said if I didn't go to grad school by fall of 2009, she would kick me out of the house.  I got in, worked full or part time for most of the semesters, spent summer 2010 taking an online class, interning in NYC twice a week, and working retail in NJ to afford my unpaid internship so I could graduate in October.  A job landed in my lap near the end of the summer.  The pay wasn't great but it was my dream job and an opportunity I couldn't pass up.  My family didn't want me to take it because of the money.  I did anyway.  I have never been happier in this respect, I am totally in love with my job and it is exactly what I want to be doing with my life. 

Last month, a friend on a music message board I've been posting on for two years told me they were looking for a new roommate.  This, again, was an opportunity that fell into my lap and wouldn't happen again.  It was in my budget, in a really nice neighborhood, would cut my commute in half, and I could take my pet with me.  I checked out the place and loved it.

The next day, I told my grandma and aunt I found a place and was really excited to move out. They immediately said no.  I explained that it was in my budget, I had researched the area and it was safe, I loved the place, and I was ready to move.  I didn't want to discuss moving with them at all previous because I felt like if I did, they would have shut it down.  If I had everything all set to go, how could they say no?  They started asking questions about the people I'd be living with.  When I said they were both 30 year old dudes, I was asked ""what kind of 30 year old men would lure a 26 year old girl to live with them"" and ""what kind of man would want to date you when they find out you have two male roommates. you will never find a boyfriend.""  My grandma was livid and told me that she raised me better than this.  I asked her what it meant, what is better than completing two higher ed degrees, starting a career in a recession, and finding a safe affordable place to live on my own?  She scoffed and never gave me an answer.  They argued that I was not street smart enough to live in the city, despite the fact that I've been working there for half a year now.  That these men, no matter how often I run into them at concerts, will just steal my things and rape me in my sleep.  I offered to invite them over but they refused. I asked why they didn't trust me or my judgement in this and they said that it wasn't me they didn't trust, just everyone else in the world.  They said they didn't want me moving until I could afford a place on my own and when I said that I did not want to live alone, I wanted roommates, they said that there's three people they know that they would let me live with.  None of them want to live in NYC. 

I went to my mom's after this and she had a little bit of a cooler head but was offended I didn't discuss anything, she said that wasn't adult of me.  I told her my reasoning (if its in place, how could anyone say no) and she still said it was childish and proof I shouldn't survive on my own. I explained to her that I am not afraid of the world, and I don't want to be.  I see how fear cripples her, my grandma, and my aunt and I don't want that to be my life.  I want to experience things for myself and live my own life now.  I need to fuck up and learn things for myself, I can't just go by hearsay anymore.  She again said that roommates cannot be trusted (if you left your world there and went to work, would they take everything you own?) and gave me a list of things she hated that I did that prove I am not an adult (stay up too late, don't eat breakfast before I go to work, go to shows) and would rather I waited until I had my job for a year before I started looking for a place.  I understand that, but with the hours I work, it's really hard to make the NJ trains home.  If I lived somewhere subway accessible, I wouldn't have to stress out so much, trains would run more than once an hour.

However, my mom did say that she would think about it if she looked at the apartment with me.  Which is hopeful I guess?  But still incredibly, incredibly frustrating.  All my friends and coworkers think this whole situation is completely absurd.  I don't know what to do now.  I hate airing this shit on the internet but I really am at a loss for how to proceed.  My move in date is April first, so I have some time to figure this shit out, but not much.  What should I do, Reddit?

Sorry for the tl;dr. I just felt like the backstory was necessary."

I am an MIS major and know a good bit about cloud computing conceptually, but have never really had any hands on experience with their products. I don't know that I want to do sales forever, but I figure while I am young it will be good and help my interpersonal skills grow. 

I have done some research and started looking at their white papers as well as history and some financial articles, but I can't really find much on the culture at VMware. I know that until recently it has been under a female CEO which probably means they're big on gender equality, but that doesn't really help me for the interview.

I've been lurking around this subreddit and have learned more from it than anything else I can find. I figure that technical knowledge doesn't get me too far with a recruiter, but a broader knowledge of the company would. I hope this doesn't come across as laziness on my part. I am just really excited about this interview and don't want to waste my one opportunity with VMware.

Any advice for the interview, links to good articles, general knowledge of VMware, you could share would be greatly appreciated. Also if anyone knows anywhere to point me for salesforce.com information that would be great. They use it and it wouldn't hurt to know a little about it as well.

Thanks!"
pyma5,1,2012-02-20,I don't want to lie to her about me dating other girls. Is it even necessary to tell her that I am?,LA_ultimate_crush,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/pyma5/i_dont_want_to_lie_to_her_about_me_dating_other/,"The girl and I have be dating each other for almost 2 months now and we decided that we were ""seeing each other""... but not in a relationship. The reason why is because she might be leaving to Japan to teach english or for some internship.. I forget.. and she still needs to find her individuality. 

Anyways.. I'm guessing we're not exclusive? I'm so confused with terminologies in ""dating"" ""seeing each other"" ""exclusive"" etc.

So I was wondering, if I'm going to go out with other girls.. should I give her a heads up or talk to her about them? She told me she's not trying to see anyone else, just me. But at the same time, I don't know if that makes us in a relationship or am I able to date other girls? 

I mentioned to her I recently got a girls number at the bar, she got upset for a hot second but cool down because she knew we weren't together. And I asked her so where do we stand with dating other people? She said something along the lines of ""If we do start seeing someone and start getting serious with them, then we should tell each other"" I told her she was the only one I'm seeing right now. But we're still not in a relationship I think.. I still want to play the game.. she said I can go get girls numbers.. Should I tell her, when it does happen, the day when I go out with someone else.. I don't want to lie to her.. I want her to tell me if she was going out with someone.. I just want to keep my options open because we might not even be a sure thing.

Any advice?"

[How much did fear/excitement play a role in your ability to aim?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t2dne?context=5)|I didn't aim per se, I just reacted the way my dad taught me and like we always practiced.
[Where you aware of how many rounds you were firing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t2dne?context=5)|Oh, and I didn't need to keep track of the rounds, because the second shot misfired, and by when I reacted and did the TRB procedure, I could see they were fleeing already. And I was scared that my gun was jammed or something and they'd notice it.
[How was the recoil.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t5rpx?context=5)|Barely noticeable. It's a good balanced gun, and so is the MiniThunder 45.
[Edit: As for an actual question, do you feel guilty or any regret, or do you just shrug it off?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t57gt?context=5)|Edit: Neither. I don't have reasons to feel guilty because I'll never now how badly injured was the guy. But even if I'd learn for some reason that he died, I don't believe I'd feel guilty. Sad? Maybe, but not for him.
[How long did the attack go on for before you realised it was serious enough to need you to shoot.. did you hesitate at all?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t2e1a?context=5)|You can keep the islands, they look dry and boring.
[Why do you want the Falkland Islands back?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t2e1a?context=5)|I was holding my gun inside my purse. When I saw them more closely and noticed they were a treath, I took the safety off. When they jumped (one of them reached for his waist, the other one jumped towards us grunting something that would translate as *""staystillstaystill""*, I just told my sister to run, took my gun and shot him.
[&gt;would translate as ""staystillstaystill""  No te muevas?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t627v?context=5)|Literalmente dijo algo como *""Quietaquietaquieta""*.
[Karma works though...he was clearly a much worse person than you and you ruined his evening for sure. I would guess you have to be in such a life or death situation to make a call on shooting someone. Odd that you're angry and that you even sound disappointed the gun misfired.  You achieved the main aim which was to make them run away..did you want to empty the whole clip into him or something?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t2o7v?context=5)|In that particular moment, I thought that only out of fear; my dad has been a cop for 37 years and is still on active duty, and I saw many of his friends being killed by wounded perps that had the time and strenght to shoot even after being badly injured. You just want to live *so* much, that you really can't stand the thought of having any chances to die there. But now, that years have passed, I'm glad that everything worked out that way. Like I said, it's the best possible outcome for us, because we didn't get in trouble. But... again, you should have seen them. Their looks and their body language. They *hated* us, and we never harmed anyone.
[Did the assailants steal your clothes during this altercation?  If so, why did you not purchase more in the years since the incident?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t7abs?context=5)|Because I decided to stay naked from that moment onwards, for the rest of my life.
[So what happened to the other assailant who saw his buddy get shot? Run after you? Run away screaming in terror? Help his buddy out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t2dzk?context=5)|I would have shot the whole cartridge, though, if the second shot wouldn't have misfired.
[Did you call the police to report the crime or did you just go home and hope nothing came of it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t2fn1?context=5)|I ran like hell —I even lost my sandals on the way— back to my friends' house, and called my dad. I never reported it to the police, for the obvious reasons.
[You are being VERY polite to certain commenters. Kudos. Do you think you killed him? If so, do you feel secretly excited that you've done what few do?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t8d12?context=5)|I... don't know. It could have gone either way. I've seen so many people die from much lesser wounds, and at the same time, I've seen people survive absolutely *terrible* injuries.  I stopped wondering about it a long time ago. I'm content with the fact that I *ruined his fucking day*, that's for sure.  If I did in fact kill him, I don't think I'd feel different about it in any meaningful way.
[Why do you feel the need to only show pics of your tits? is that the only way to get attention?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t5r5k?context=5)|Oh, hai _oogle. Are you some teen girl angry because some guys go off topic about cleavage? Don't worry, that's how the Internet goes; they'll be right back to your [/r/gonewild](http://www.reddit.com/r/gonewild) post as soon as we finish talking here. No need to be so upset. :)
[What is your occupation?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t2m3g?context=5)|I'm a licensed Surgeon's Assistant, but worked most of my life as a commercial model, dancer and some other stuff in the same venue. [I'm a mom now](http://imgur.com/a/FAWG7#0), so I'm working only a couple of hours on weekends for the time being.
[Also, what were you and your sister doing that night before the attack happened?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t2m3g?context=5)|It was December 30th, and we were at a party in a mutual friend's house. It was just five blocks away and we couldn't get a cab. She insisted she had to be there, so I accompanied her, thinking what the hell, it's close and I have a gun. It was a stupid mistake that I never, ever repeated.
[Do you usually carry a gun?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t3gq3?context=5)|I don't usually carry a gun anymore because I just don't go where I might need to. I learned my lesson and try to avoid those situations if possible. I also work much less now that I had a daughter.
[You never reported it to the police, but i assume there was some newspaper article about it? What did it say/what happended/where there no witnesses?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t4gvd?context=5)|No witnesses, except a poor [cartonero](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartonero) that *maybe* heard the shot. He was around the corner and saw us running back to our friend's house.  Besides, Buenos Aires is a *huge* city. I hardly think that any newspaper would be interested in such a trivial shooting, where nobody died —at least on the scene— and nothing of value was lost.
[I assume when shot u fall down and scream on top of your lungs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t4qoq?context=5)|I'm afraid that's not like you see it in the movies. You can just google for videos of people being shot if you want, but you'll end up in dark corners of the Internet watching horrible stuff. Or 4chan. I had to do internship in clinics and hospitals for three years to get my Surgeon's Assistant degree. I've seen many, *many* cases of injured criminals going to the hospital with ludicrous stories about how they got shot. Some of them waited for too long and couldn't be saved, and it was amazing how they managed to even get to the hospital in the first place. You'd be surprised of how much the human body can whitstand, and I'd suggest you don't bait for the gore lovers to explain it to you with links.
[Any guilty feelings about shooting the guy? any idea where you hit him?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t2ie7?context=5)|He had a baggy... er, what's the name... like a T-Shirt, but with a hood. I could see the impact somewhere in his torso, as his clothes flapped noticeably.  I don't feel guilty. You should have seen his eyes. He really meant us harm, because he hated us, and whatever we stood for in his mind.
[How did the police respond to your self defense shooting?  Did they treat it like a crime and indict you on charges, or did they act differently?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t2g23?context=5)|I never reported it, because I didn't own the gun, and the HP bullets aren't permitted here. Which is stupid.
[What are gun laws like in Argentina? In the US, it's generally pretty simple to legally own and carry a gun. Is that the case?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t4w77?context=5)|Quite the contrary. It's very, very hard to be a legal owner here, and even if you are, the laws are very strict —and stupid— about concealed carry and permitted ammunition.
[~~Would you get in trouble for killing someone in self defence?~~   ~~Why did they attack you? Robbery? Rape?~~   Did you shoot to kill or injure?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3tcsuc?context=5)|I shot to neutralize, didn't really care about my target's health.
[What did you dislike about the Bersa Thunder 380?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t37cz?context=5)|I didn't dislike the Thunder 380, it just wasn't mine.
[Can civilians buy handguns easily?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t8ms8?context=5)|No, not at all. It's not impossible but they surely make it really hard.
[Where did this happen? Is this common?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t69jg?context=5)|It happened in [San Martín](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Mart%C3%ADn,_Buenos_Aires). It's not uncommon if you're stupid like I was and walk alone at night thinking that nobody will be in the streets, but it's not a particular unsafe place to live.
[How did you cope with the stress after the event? how long it took you to get completely recovered from the shock?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3tb7pm?context=5)|That's a good question. It took about four or five months until my life was practically the same as before the attack.  Before that, I had periods of sheer bliss for every trivial little thing that I could enjoy in my life (like being with friends, watching a movie at home, having a nice dinner, playing a new game), and serious worries about my safety (triple checking my doors many times a day, avoiding going outside, buying firearms, etc.). All in all, I think my life was improved and I ended up being much wiser after that incident.  **Edit:** Oh, it was *you*, and I just noticed! (n.n) Why didn't you tell me on Skype you were posting in my IAMA? /hug You sexy macfag! &lt;3.
[What a pervert that guy was….](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t4uyd?context=5)|To be completely honest, if I would be in the mood for sex, I wouldn't be answering questions in a IAMA.
[So, did you want to have sex?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t4uyd?context=5)|I know, total party-pooper of me to say that.
[You party pooper!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t52vu?context=5)|:(
[ where would you be in that case?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t7r0t?context=5)|Out there *poppin' a cap on some mofo's ass*, of course!
[Damn girl, what do you do with that ass?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t8n4k?context=5)|I make money.
[Do you think you would react the same way if put in the same situation again, especially knowing the .45 is no joke compared to .380?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t5xk0?context=5)|My dad's Colt 1911 is the best example. Such a big gun, and such a smooth shot.
[Was it a racial thing? Strikes me as odd that these randoms would stop you out of hate? Unless it is somehow racial.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3tos0h?context=5)|It's not about race, no. It's more about our socioeconomic differences. Some people hate you just because you have things that they never will.  Don't get me wrong, I believe their intentions were probably mundane: robbery, rape, who knows. I was talking about their *motivation* when I mentioned the hate.
[How many years ago was this? i've been to buenos aires recently, it's a lovely city, but many places seemed abandoned and scary. many weird people walking around and asking strange questions. do you think violence in buenos aires has grown recently?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t2jlx?context=5)|Yes, but it's not really different from the US if you [check the statistics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate). You just have to take care of who you trust and where you go, like in every part of the world where you are a tourist.  Oh, and it was about 3 or 4 years ago.
[Do you feel that a 380 is an adequate defense round?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t86wv?context=5)|It was the ammo, because it was somewhat old. Winchester is widely regarded as a good manufacturer, so in this case it was just the user's fault.  I do not carry the Thunder 380 anymore, and I never knew what happened to the attacker I shot.  Personally, I'm all for stopping power, but of course, you have to be able to put the bullets in your targets. I would recommend acquiring the biggest caliber *that you can comfortably control*, and no more.
[Why do you post pictures of your tits? attention whore much?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t94gj?context=5)|You're so original, [jane408](http://www.quickmeme.com/First-Day-on-the-Internet-Kid/?upcoming)! Thanks for sharing your insights, have fun on reddit!
[Haha.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t9lym?context=5)|I'm glad you're having so much fun with your own comments! So, let me see if I understand: your suggestion would be that, if I have to share pictures of myself that millions of people will see, I should *purposefully take unflattering pictures* in order to... make a better impression on the Internet? That's actually a great suggestion! You must be really fun at parties, thanks for sharing your fashion advices!
[Your breastseses.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3tlg8d?context=5)|My *what*? :S.
[You're boring.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3tlg8d?context=5)|And yet, you keep reading my comments and take the time to respond in anger.
[Your argument is invalid.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3tmhng?context=5)|It's not. You said you were ""done with me"" about two hours ago. And yet, you keep coming back.
[Can you please tell me where in my comments that i seem the least bit angry?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3tmhng?context=5)|Really? Okey: you are aggressive and did nothing but post grammatically challenged *ad hominem* attacks; you clearly seem to have a fixation on my looks and didn't contribute anything to the discussion. I can only conclude that you're just a sad, spiteful and envious teenage girl, making a poor attempt at trolling, and [your post history](http://www.reddit.com/user/jane408) does nothing but confirm it, so I'm gonna ignore you from now on. Feel free to have the last word and post whatever childish insult you had prepared. Bye!
[Has this incident made your sister consider carrying a gun with her?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t5438?context=5)|No, she hates guns. Or more precisely, she is afraid of guns.
[She's so cute :)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t3jon?context=5)|I'm not gonna be an hypocrite about it and say that I don't enjoy the compliments. Every girl does, regardless of her age and line of work.
[When you say that you took advantage of some propositions, can you get more into that? Was it casting couch?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t469j?context=5)|The option to do some stuff for a considerable material gain —whether that's money, gifts, job opportunities, etc.— is always present. Depending on your working environment, it's almost *mandatory*. The article is a recent case in which a somewhat known manager was arrested by the Interpol because he pimped his models. And nobody was surprised.
[Where did you shoot him, like in the head, tummy, etc?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t7cfi?context=5)|In the torso. I couldn't see the exact spot because he was wearing a baggy hoodie and it suddenly flapped with the impact.
[Are you from Argentina or were you just living there at the time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t2zgy?context=5)|I was born in Argentina.  But my family came from Europe; my grandparents, from my mom's side, are German and Russian. From my dad's side, both grandparents are Italian.
[German, huh?   When did they come over from Germany?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t84ww?context=5)|Like so many Germans, during WWII.
[Ah ok. Well I'm glad you made it out of that encounter okay. In a crisis you revert to the lowest level of training you have mastered, not the highest level of training you ever practiced. Is it legal to have a duel with someone in Argentina if both people are registered blood donors or is that just an urban legend?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t3211?context=5)|And that's the first time I heard that urban legend about duels. Of course it's not legal!  Or am I being trolled?
[What's it like, knowing that your ancestors were war criminals?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t4605?context=5)|I don't know about my German grandfather and Russian grandmother because they kinda abandoned my mom when she was a little girl.  My italian granfather fought in WWII, though; he got captured in Africa by the British Army and was their prisoner until the war was over.
[The men you shot, were they Indigenous and/or black? In Brazil and Colombia, social cleansing is not uncommon. Have you ever thought about shooting African and Central Asian refugees in Bs. As. for giggles and laughs?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3tj9v4?context=5)|[Wat](http://i.imgur.com/Mw4Gg.jpg).
[Well now I'm just confused.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t6qj2?context=5)|&gt; On one hand it was in self defense but on the other what the fuck, woman?  I assumed you were mystified about the fact that I shot somenone to defend myself, and I explained my somewhat unusual choice of self defense, providing some insight about my past.  What's to be confused about? :P.
[What would the punishment be if the police found out about it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t689e?context=5)|Depending on the harm done on the assailant, it could be anything from a slap on the wrist, to actual jail time.  Not to mention the possible civil action that the injured attacker could pursue.
[There is no self-defense in Argentina?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t7hlv?context=5)|It's frowned upon.
[Did this event effect ur home life permanently or at all?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t7d0n?context=5)|In many ways, but all in all, I think that it was for the better.
[Do you feel guilty?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t77cr?context=5)|Why would I?
[If you white knight hard enough, she's bound to sleep with you, right?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t6yt7?context=5)|Yes.
[Why were  you not happy with the 9mm?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t64ws?context=5)|I never had a 9mm. I wasn't happy with my .45 ACP because I didn't feel that it was on par with some other better —but more expensive, of course— alternatives.  I ended up buying a pump-action shotgun. Go figure.
[What's your favorite Stevie Wonder song?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t68m5?context=5)|[Part-Time Lover](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ll6LLGePYwM) of course!
[Do you like tacos?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t56j2?context=5)|I never tried one. They seem tasty.
[Do you like tophats?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t589e?context=5)|WHO DOESN'T?

[Marry me.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t7zv4?context=5)|Yes. Oh yes.
[Somehow I thought so from your pictures. Did you shoot your baby's daddy too?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/pxq7w/im_a_woman_who_shot_somebody_in_self_defense/c3t6flv?context=5)|So you basically think I'm like Homer when [he got his first gun](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIpLd0WQKCY)?

pykzr,0,2012-02-20,What should I focus on next?,[deleted],learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/pykzr/what_should_i_focus_on_next/,"I'm currently in my first year of a two year computer systems program, its pretty intensive, but I'm familiar with a lot of the stuff as I have taught myself quite a bit about programming concepts in the past few years.

I am doing well, but I would like to do other programming related stuff on the side to broaden my knowledge. I know a bit of Java so I am wondering whether I should focus on learning data structures and algorithms using the language (there'll be a course on that next quarter), another option I was thinking of was doing programming problems on websites like project euler and programming praxis, or I could just take one of the online courses at udacity.

I know that learning is an ongoing process, but I am wondering what will improve my programming skills while also being useful in the real world. I will be doing an internship this summer as well.

Any advice is appreciated. Thanks!"
q1lo9,140,2012-02-22,It's the little things (differences between living in the US and Germany),leechnerd,germany,https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/q1lo9/its_the_little_things_differences_between_living/,"I'm an American and I've been living in Germany for nearly a year and a half now. Life here in Germany isn't really that much different for me from life in the US. Most of the differences really are just tiny or little things that I've gotten used to and/or take for granted.

Here are some of them, maybe some Americans/Germans would find it interesting, especially cause I see some posts asking about what it's like over here. These aren't meant to be taken too seriously or as a definitive guide or anything, just my take on them.

**Home**

Windows. They open in two ways; tilt it back from the top to let in air, or swing it open from the side to open the whole thing. In the US, they slide to the side.

I'm not sure if closets physically built into the room are common here; people just have wardrobes. In the US, every room I can think of has a closet built into some section of the wall with sliding or deal doors.

**Groceries**

Shopping carts are locked and require a deposit to unlock it. Shopping carts in the US are free to take. The ones here can also be pushed in all directions (i.e., left and right too), while in the US you can only push them forward and backward. This was the strangest thing to get used to IMO.

Eggs come in cartons of 6, or cartons of 10. Why not 12? Who knows. Eggs are also not washed here, so don't be surprised if you see dried feathers stuck to the side of the egg. In the US they come in cartons of 6 (I think), 12, or more, and are washed.

Bags cost money, so people generally bring their own bags or backpacks. In the US, bags are free and plentiful, and are way thinner.

Americans are used to looking for milk in the refridgerator. You can find such milk in the fridge here too, but I'd say most people buy this ""utra-pasteurized"" milk which come in cardboard cartons and is unrefridgerated. Unopened, it can last ages, but once opened, of course you put it in the fridge. I find this milk tastes much better. Milk also comes in 1.5% and 3.5%.

I've seen refrigerator packages of food such as ""American Hotdogs"" which is like a hotdog in a bun with onions and ketchup prepackaged. (Side note, our ""American"" hotdogs are more like the sausages that come in the glass jars over here).

**Restaurants**

You're expected to seat yourself. You really do just walk in the door and find a table to sit down at and do it. In the US, you just stand by the entrance and just wait until a specific employee, usually a hostess, seats you.

At McDonalds (for example), you order your hamburgers and then you stand there in front of the cashier and wait. In the US, they'll take your name and call you when your food is ready, so you can go sit down or stand out of the way of people ordering.

Drinks do not come with free refills here. Most places in the US will happily refill your drink until you burst. In popular restaurants in the US they typically won't even ask if you want a refill and just bring you another cup when they see you're like 2/3 done with your current one. This applies to tea, soda, water, but not alcohol of course.

Here the waiters typically won't ever ""bother"" you. They'll just take your order, bring you your food, and when it looks like you're done eating they come and ask if you're finished. In the US, they're more personal and come by every so often to ask how it tastes, if they could bring you anything (e.g., more sauce), if you want to try anything else, deserts, etc.

**Entertainment**

You can order, pick and reserve your seats at the movie theater online, so it's pointless to show up to the theater earlier than the starting time. In the US, most theaters have first-come first-serve seating, so for popular movies people will typically show up hour(s) early to wait in line to get a good seat.

**New** Something I find hilarious is [Tanzverbot](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanzverbot#Stille_Tage). There are some days in Germany where dancing is actually forbidden (actually what they mean is that clubs can not be open for dancing). On Good Friday in every state dancing is expressly forbidden. I guess you should instead go to church or something.

**Cultural**

One thing I find strange is that at a job, when *you're* leaving (on good terms), *you* bring a cake to work and share with everybody. When I left my internship back in the US, my coworkers brought *me* a cake to work.

**Other**

What Americans know of as the ""first floor,"" the Germans know of as the ""ground floor."" What Germans know of as the ""first floor,"" the Americans know of as the ""second floor."" I am never going to *not* instinctively press 1 whenever I get in an elevator to go down :(.

German (and really, the rest of the world) paper is size ""A4."" US paper is size ""letter"" aka ""8.5 x 11."" A4 paper is a bit taller and skinner than US letter paper.

These are just the things I can think of at the moment. I can post more or answer some questions too if anyone has some."
q1d8z,2,2012-02-22,CAS authentication for Gerrit/git?,avart10,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/q1d8z/cas_authentication_for_gerritgit/,"Hey, r/sysadmin! I'm into my second week as an intern at an IT consulting firm, and they are having me do some changes to their in-house IT infrastructure. I've been helping them migrate from Perforce to Gerrit/git as a versioning and review system, and I think that I've got almost everything planned out the way I want it to, and have found resources for most of the things I want to do.

Gerrit needs to integrate with Jenkins, Jira and Fisheye, and all of those things have plugins ready. And most of the integration with git is done through SSH with RSA keys. 

However, the company infrastructure uses CAS and ProxyPass to enable single-sign-on sessions, and I haven't been able to find any good material on how to get gerrit to authenticate with a CAS cookie or anything like that. 

I've found anecdotal evidence that mod_auth_cas for Apache should work (through there being bug reports on it, heh), but no real HOWTO. Does anybody here have any pointers? 

Should I just go at it from the other way around, and read up on how both CAS and gerrit integrates with Apache, and then build a custom solution?


Thanks."

*(I heard this subreddit relies on a certain suspension of disbelief, but this is an actual true story that I first submitted to reddit a while ago, and now in the comment linked above.)*

================

(...) Warning: explicit. The following story is 100% true. (...)

I was 23 years old with the same condition -  phimosis. Not as severe as some of the pictures you see online, but there was also this pinching feeling when I had sex, so I decided to get circumcised.

The doctor had told me to relax, it would be a relatively painless procedure and I could walk home from the hospital after less than an hour of surgery. So I walked into the OR optimistically.

Turns out, the procedure hurts quite a bit. For anesthesia, they stuck a huge syringe into my penis 4 times. Each time felt like... well, a big needle being stuck into your penis. When they started cutting, I still had a lot of feeling down there. The feeling when they cut off the foreskin was... how can I describe it? The pain itself wasn't as bad as the knowledge that what you felt was a part of your body slowly being severed. Horrible. Then they started sewing me together and kind of folding and fusing together the skin-- how exactly it works, I couldn't see. It hurt a lot. It hurt a lot in my *penis*, and the awareness of that made the time ten times worse.

When they were done, the bleeding wouldn't stop. The doctor mentioned that I took unusually long to stop bleeding and asked me whether I had taken any aspirin or something earlier. I didn't. Well, they put my penis into a tight bandage and sent me home saying the pain would stop soon.

It didn't. 

Soon, it started to hurt really, really badly. They hadn't even given me a painkiller. It was terrible. At the that time, I actually did an AMA ""I am a 23 yo male who just got circumcised"" or something. It never made the front page though. And I had no idea the worst was yet to come.

At the time, I had just met a girl that would become my new girlfriend. Despite the mess in my pants, I met her a few evenings in a row. And we would make out. And I would get an erection.

I had never known this kind of pain. Every time I got turned on, it was torture. My penis would also start bleeding into the bandages, which I would have to change several times a day. Sometimes they would bleed through my pants and I didn't notice in time, then looking down in public to discover I had red spots between my legs. And yet, the worst was still to come. 

I pulled through the make-out session with my girlfriend-to-be like a champ. The pain got a bit better over the course of a few days. The bleeding would become less frequent. I later learned I was never supposed to bleed at all. To conquer the bleeding, I always wrapped my penis in toilet paper as well as putting bandage-pads into my shorts. Keep this in mind.

At first I had evaded sex with my new girlfriend, but as time progressed it was hard to make up excuses, and I told her the embarrassing truth a week after surgery. She was okay with not being able to have sex for another 3 weeks. But we still made out a lot, and in the heat of the moment she would sometimes dry-hump me a bit.

One night when she was dry-humping me, I felt a sudden sharp pain in my penis. Keep in mind that that happened all the time when I moved the wrong way or accidentally brushed against something with my crotch, so it wasn't unusual. Still I told my girlfriend to stop and we went to sleep.

The next morning when I woke up, I felt extremely weak, and my crotch was aching heavily.

When I pulled back the sheets, my entire sheets and shorts were SOAKED with blood. Blood everywhere. The bed was full of it.

I let out a loud ""AAAAAAAH!"" and jumped up, running to the bathroom. As I was running down the hallway, blood was dripping from my shorts to the floor, leaving red spots on the carpet. 

In the bathroom, I frantically tore down my shorts. The bandage pads fell off, and I was looking at my penis, completely wet and red from blood, and what looked like chunks of torn skin hanging down all over it.

Those were the worst few seconds of my life. My heart thumped and I felt sick. My girlfriend, who had woken up from the screams and followed me to the bathroom burst in, looked at my penis and screamed.

Then, thankfully, I realized that I wasn't looking at chunks of torn skin. I had forgotten the toilet paper wrapped around my penis. It had soaked up the blood and hung down thick and heavy, looking like flaps of skin. I yelled ""it's only paper, it's only paper"" to calm down my girlfriend, and pulled it off. Still, underneath it my penis was torn and bleeding. Turns out, the seams from my circumcision had ripped when my girlfriend dry humped me. I had went to sleep without noticing. The tightly stuffed paper and pads had held back much of the bleeding, but still I had woken up to the bloodbath in my sheets. As I stood in the bathroom, the shorts and pads removed, blood dripped down from my penis at a steady rate, going *drip drap drip drop* and leaving a puddle of blood on the floor between my legs.

I yelled at my girlfriend to go home and let me take care of it, and went to get dressed to go to the hospital. Since I was in a hurry, I only threw on old pants and a shirt and some sandals.

I'm a European student in a big city, so it's not out of the ordinary for me not to have a car. I got on the next metro train en route to the hospital. Halfway through the ride, I catch a little girl staring at me and whispering something to her mom. The mom is looking at me, and quickly pulls her daughter away.

I look down and see that there's blood running out of the legs of my pants, all over my feet and into the sandals. 

I only had to drive for two stations. Then I got off and had to walk the last 300 meters to the hospital. As I walked, more blood ran down my leg and made squishy sounds in my sandals. Some blood dropped onto the pavement. I left a trail of blood behind me on the sidewalk. 

When I reached the ER, the nurse on duty was quite unphased. They let me wait a few anxious minutes. Then I was called into surgery.  The doctor asked me whether there was anything unusual she should know. I told her that the last doctor had noted that my bleeding stopped unusually slow. She dismissed that tidbit and went on.

I had to go through the same horrible procedure that I was so glad about never having to go through again, again. They stuck a big needle into my penis, five times this time. They started to sew the torn skin under the head of my penis back together.

That's when the young doctor noticed what I had already told her: The bleeding was strong, and it wouldn't stop. She went on. Bleeding went on strong as ever. Blood flowing out of my penis all over it,  and over her fingers.

Now she freaked out. She was like a junior doctor or something, an intern? resident? I don't know. She refused to go on with the surgery and used a phone to call for the chief of medicine to take over. The chief of medicine was occupied with a heart surgery. Only after a while, she reluctantly went on with the procedure. 

They finished up the sewing part and wrapped a bandage *way* too tight around my penis. (I was slightly incontinent for the next few days that I had to wear it). 

They sent me home, again without painkillers, and again telling me not to have sex for another month. For the next week, the pain was worse this time around.

And when I had sex for the first time after the month was over, I was terrified that a seam would rip again every second through.

So there you go, that's my story. The moral of it: Treat your dick like porcelain, OP. Don't dry hump. Don't have sex earlier than advised. It could go horribly wrong."

q17c0,8,2012-02-22,I felt a bit down today; GF shot down my feelings,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/q17c0/i_felt_a_bit_down_today_gf_shot_down_my_feelings/,"Me - 22/m
Her - 20/f

Been dating for little over a year.

Today I had a little of a breakdown about my weight. I was getting dressed and looking at myself in the mirror, I just did not like the way I looked in a dress shirt. I went to the internship fair yesterday in the same getup and I had no problem with how I looked; I felt confident. Today was different. I'm usually not sensitive about my weight (I've been doing something about it, I'm pretty active, lost 60lbs already) but it just hit me for no reason. 

I texted my girlfriend how disgusting I felt and looked and I just wanna crawl back into bed. She responds with ""I didn't know I was dating a 12 year old girl."" This really hurt me, because the person I trust a lot just shot down my feelings. I felt crushed. I told her I was sensitive about it today and that I felt hurt. She says while she knows the feeling, it's still childish of me, and that it's all her fault that I'm feeling this way. When I asked for a little support, she said all I'm doing is whining, and she'll talk to me later.

This isn't the first time. When I feel down and go to her for support or someone to talk to, I get told I'm a child or immature for having these feelings, and she won't talk to me for hours. After ignoring me for hours, she'll come around and actually talk, but will not be apologetic. It's starting to take a toll on me because I feel I'm losing a support pillar, and I can't trust anyone with how I feel. When I tell her that it's not right she does this, she gets very defensive and says it's all her fault. 

Am I overreacting about this, or is she just being insensitive? Any and all input will be appreciated. 

**Edit:** I should add that I rarely get upset about my weight. In fact this is the first time I felt weird about it in at least 4 years. I am a very confident guy who knows what he is. I get the fat jokes from my roommates everyday, and I deal with it because I know I'm chubby and they're teasing. Also to add on the support thing: I'm usually the one who emotionally supports my SO when she's down. The past month or so she's gotten really upset over silly things, but I did not tell her they were silly or stupid, but rather I comforted her and told her silly jokes and played with her hair, or sent her cute pictures. It kinda sucks when I have a bad day (which is very rarely), she's nowhere to be found emotionally, and shuts me out. "

q13qu,0,2012-02-22,My SO's father treats him like shit and it's pissing me off. Afraid it's gonna affect our relationship now. Help!,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/q13qu/my_sos_father_treats_him_like_shit_and_its/,"27/F here, he's 24/M. Together 3 years.

Little back story, I have worked my hands to the bone since I was 15 years old. I have no college education, I have supported myself all these years and lived on my own a lot longer than him. I come from an extremely poor family and I am the only child who has moved out of the over crowded house. My other siblings live at home and help pay bills. I've been on my own since 17, lived a rather traumatic young adulthood.

My boyfriend comes from a wealthy family, has some college education and during the 3 years we've been together he was going to school. He's lived a really good life, except his dad has always put him on the back burner and has generally ignored him. He's never held a job while we have been together cause his mom just gave him money, basically. He's done 2 unpaid internships for like...2 months. In fact, I lived with him and his parents for a year and finally had enough of it and moved out 2 months ago, took him with me.

His dad is the money maker. Man has millions of dollars. I have no relationship with him, we don't really speak. I think he treats his son like shit, loves his son in law more than him and his daughter gets whatever she wants. His parents have just a fucked up, bizarre marriage (one sleeps on the couch, the other in the bed). Recently my SO got his associates in science...and then told his dad he didn't want to be a doctor. His dad wanted him to be a doctor and thats not what he wanted to do. He wants to be a chef. His dad says ok, cool. Tells him to find a culinary school, he'll pay for it.

His dad owns several businesses and my SO has a sister who is my age with 2 kids and she's married. The sister's husband works for his dad and his dad loves this dude way more than his own kid. He buys his daughter and son in law everything. He helped purchase their first home, paid for both of them to go to school (they both dropped out after a year), pays for the grand kids ""school"" (it's fucking daycare...school for kids under 2 my ass), bought them a huge TV, grill, furniture...whatever they want. My SO is luckier than most people, though...thanks to his mom. His mom slips him cash when he visits and runs errands for her. She makes sure that he's got a car, his cell phone is paid for and his insurance. 

A few weeks ago I got on my SO's ass about school (I'm paying our rent, bills, etc the money his mom gives him is used for gas in his truck and whatever he wants to spend it on like helping out with groceries). Eventually in my eyes, his dad is gonna find out mom is slipping him money and cut it off real quick. So he asks his dad if he can start school. His dad tells him ""Sure, but you're paying for your own school."" My SO said ""but...dad...you said you would pay for it so I'm not drowning in debt from loans."" His father said: ""I never agreed to pay for culinary school. No."" I hit the fucking roof. He told my SO, his mom, his uncle...and said in front of me that he would pay for it and he totally welched on his offer. My SO tried to tell him he did and his father is one of those guys where his word is law, it doesnt matter how many people heard him say it...he's right and everyone else is wrong. You can't argue with him or change his mind because he does not cave in.

It's gotten to the point where I hate the guy. I can't stand him, I don't want to be around him and I resent him. I don't understand why he treats his son like shit. He has made fun of him in front of the whole family during the holidays, he has no interest in meeting my family (my parents invited him to a birthday dinner for me they scraped and saved for and he turned them down), he purposely will pick a fight with you about anything if you disagree with him (I watched my SO's cousin fly at my SO's father in a rage over a debate about science and the guy is working on his masters, my SO's father has no college education), he has a just complete asshole personality to anyone who doesnt agree with him. I absolutely love my SO's mom and I want to continue seeing her when I can...but not with his dad around.

I just don't know what to do. I want my guy to go to school NOW but he refuses to get loans. He wants to save up for school...but he's been supposedly job hunting and nothing has come of it. I'm paying all our bills plus my car note, full coverage insurance and my cell phone on barely $10 an hour. His dad has the money and won't help his kid. I feel like he resents his son and I don't know why. We moved out because I was sick of living there, the drive was much longer for me to and from work and being around the bizarre marriage was putting stress on us. His mom hides things and tells us about it and his dad is never home. His mom got real sick around the holidays and we wanted to take care of her but his dad kept pushing our help aside like we're bumbling idiots so I said fuck this, I gotta get out of this crazy house.

TL;DR: My SO's father is a rich asshole who refuses to help his kid, but favors the other one. He agreed to pay for his school and then backed out of the deal. I'm broke and want my guy to start his future ASAP. Don't want to be in another relationship again where I'm the financial support. What do I do? "
q0ukp,6,2012-02-22," Having a rough time job hunting, here is my story -- any ideas?",danceswithknives,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/q0ukp/having_a_rough_time_job_hunting_here_is_my_story/,"I have a very diverse job history, and while it would be great in a post-apocalyptic world, I am finding it hard (impossible) to get a job. I have had people tell me I am a liar about this history, that I did not do any of this. Do you have any ideas on how I should present this or what I should do?

I grew up in a machine shop/garage working with my father on engine repair for cars and trucks. (I can repair anything.)

In the 90s I was a body piercer and manufactured titanium, niobium, and stainless steel body jewelry. I used medical implant standards according to ASTM standards at the time, and implemented CDC standards for universal precautions into my practice. I was one of the founders of the Association of Professional Piercers and consulted with National medical boards and organisations including the CDC and the AMA. 

I have a passion for computers and in the mid nineties I had my first experience with Linux. I began installing Linux on everything. The server side of Linux, what happened behind the scenes for web pages fascinated me, so I began setting up servers and firewalls for companies. I attended Devry and worked for a company doing video monitoring of day care centers to ease the minds of parents that had to abandon their kids all day while living in the cubical. 

I had to move back to my hometown to help with a family member that was ill, so I changed course and adapted to working conditions in that area. I took a job in the kitchen of an Italian restaurant. I had no idea how much I had picked up from my Grandmother in the kitchen, as she was a chef for 40 years running some pretty big kitchens, and I swiftly shot through the ranks. Within 6 months I was the second chef and kitchen manager. I proceeded to work in this kitchen and a few others for most of the 2000s. Except for a year in which I wrote, distributed, and published a monthly tabloid magazine. 

The economy was getting pretty bad so I went back to school, doing what I loved when I was in High school but never had the chance to be properly trained. I have finished a Bachelors of Fine Arts for painting and sculpture. I took an intern-ship in Italy doing art restoration for the Fall of 2011. I learned some Italian, and discovered many little facts about art from the Etruscans down to Baroque artists and their techniques that I am incorporating into my work. 

Oh yeah, I drove cab, ran a cab company for a while in 1992-1993 when my grandfather-inlaw was sick, and again in 2000 after moving back to help that family member. I drove school bus for a year and a half, but I don't have the CDL on my licence any more -- the medical exams were too expensive once I was no longer with the district.

I think that is everything, thanks for reading.

Through several internships and academic projects, I have developed a strong set of engineering skills. During my internship at NASA Ames Research Center, I developed a set of MATLAB and Simulink models to facilitate real-time analysis of disturbance forces and torques during orbit. I was also tasked with integrating these models into the main Simulink model for the orbiter, providing more accurate data for exact position and attitude during simulation. My supervisor commended me for my ability to take charge of the project and my problem-solving skills, as well as my ability to work with many different people within our team to accomplish my goals on time.

I developed leadership and teamwork skills through my involvement in academic projects such as this previous semester, where I participated on Carnegie Mellon’s Google Lunar X-Prize team.  My team of four undergraduate students was tasked with developing a trajectory controller for the descent sequence of the lander. Throughout the semester this project required a large amount of personnel organization and interfacing between our group, the course teaching assistants, and the professor. In order to maintain high levels of productivity I constantly identified future objectives and subdividing tasks in order to ensure the project was completed.

I am looking for any full-time positions available around the Bay Area. If you have any questions or wish to see a resume, please PM me. Thank you for your consideration.

So here's the story, I graduated from a top tier engineering school, but I can't find a job.  Warranted, I graduated with a Bachelor's of Science in Liberal Arts/Digital Media essentially.  I've been stuck in a rut for the better part of 7 months, and I have exhausted damn near every viable career option.  There have been phone screenings, Skype interviews, and there was even an offer for an internship, but I couldn't make the deadline for work because I was in the middle of moving.  Funny side note, for one Skype interview, I pointed out a flaw in the preliminary test they issued, and the recruiter/CEO became so embarrassed/frustrated once he realized the stupidity of the question that he shut his laptop (He arrived at my explanation when he tried to walk me through the question).  Anyhow, I don't have the tools to further my portfolio because they were provided by my school, and I can't afford them since I don't have a job.  

My folks want me to go back to school, but I don't know if I'll get into grad school because my school raped my GPA because the ridiculous standards, which no one seems to comprehend...My last two years were where I did best too, but no one cares about that for some reason.  Basically, it looks like I'll end up going to a community college for some course work.  Don't get me wrong, that is fine, but this transition is just eating away at my soul because I reviewed some of the course curriculum and I already understand everything that they are trying to explain...Are there some other options that I've just neglected?  Btw, I can't get a part-time job either because the employers expect that I'll be gone within a week or two of hiring me even though I tell them otherwise.  So now I'm stuck doing odd jobs &amp; freelance work as it comes down the shoot.  Sorry if this story came off pretentious..., it's been a weird couple of months.

The following is a list of things we, the young, graduated, and unemployed wish you knew.

We are not lazy.  We have done what all the articles say, and we have treated looking for a job like a job.  We have applied for more than 100 positions at this time.  We have had interviews, phone interviews, follow ups, you name it. None of them have panned out.  

Please do not look at the gap of employment in my résumé as a reason not to hire us.  If anything, it is a reason to hire us.  We appreciate the value of a job, and certainly more than we did after we’d been searching for a month.  We are not just working hard to find a job, but are willing to work just as diligently to keep a job.  We are the people that will go above and beyond and will never give up.  Otherwise we would have by now.

Offering only entry level positions that are internships and not extending internships to non-students hurts.  We will prove our willingness to work while working for free.  But you have to let us.  75% of positions we come across that are not internships or part-time expect 3-5 years of experience.  To bring you that, we need your help, and we are willing to be molded.

For those businesses that take the time to reply to applications, thank you.  We’ve spent hours writing, rewriting and redesigning our résumés and cover letters, and not to mention we have likely spent significant time filling out your online application.  There are businesses that take the time to respond to every applicant. You can too.  At least let us know the position is closed so we can move on to the next thing.  It endears us to your company even more, and even if you don’t hire us, you may get our business in the future. 

As always, we thank you for your time and consideration,

Sincerely,

Advice/Perspective Request.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/q2mm3/my_gf_of_2ish_months_her_exof_3_years_and_me/,"So I did some searching concerning my  problem/feelings and how I feel to see if there have been any relevant posts. Compared to what some other people have posted with their SO's ex in their relationship, perhaps my feelings are unnecessary and petty. I am really new to relationships and figured I would give posting a shot. I really appreciate anyone who takes the time to impart me with their logic and reasoning.... here it goes. 


I am 23, my gf (I'll call A) is 22. I met her about a year and a half ago when she was dating J, an acquaintance of mine. Sometimes I would hang out or go to the bars with J and his roommates, but we were never super close. I talked to A online and at school when I saw her and generally thought she was a great person. We would ride bikes together as we are both into road biking but I never thought anything more of it than just riding with a friend.


A and J had been dating for almost three years before they broke up last september. As we are all finishing our undergrads this year, A essentially broke up with J because (as she told me) she thought they didn't have a future together. [I have never heard of another reason but assume that there were other causes.] Anyways, A and I continued to talk a lot and I started to think something more could be there. I was very reluctant to push anything so I took my time trying to remain simply friends. She would always ask me to go out to the bars with her, go to parties with her, etc. I rarely obliged as I thought I would certainly lose control of myself if I was drunk around her and make a move. As time continued, we were hanging out more, but never in situations that could lead to hooking up. She seemed to be doing fine from her breakup with J and I had developed stronger feelings for her so one night I decided to go out with her and her roommates. We hooked up that night (as it was obvious we both wanted to) in mid November and have essentially slept together every night since then. We decided to make things official on new years. She is my first girlfriend I have loved, who has said she loves me, and who I genuinely want to spend all my time with. 


A told J that she had been hooking up with me in December (because she felt compelled to do so out of respect for him... I was in favor of the 'why does he need to know' option) which brought up a lot of hard feelings from J. J and I don't talk anymore as I know he resents me for being together with A. That doesn't concern me. Nonetheless, A and J remain friends in pretty close contact. When we go out at night, there is a good chance we run into J and his roommates. This happened once and was extremely uncomfortable for A and I. She can have a great time with him alone, but when I am involved, I hate the fact she feels we still have to hide being together in fear of running into J and his group of friends. 


I don't wish to insist that she stops talking to J, that seems irrational. I know she wants to remain friends as she isn't the burn bridges type but they text almost everyday and see each other outside of school perhaps once a week whether at a party or at a coffeeshop together. I guess it is weird for me that they remain in SUCH close contact, is this normal? I recently saw on her phone saying to him ""I keep on going back and forth about breaking up with you but think it is for the best."" It was very causally said in conversation but it really took me by surprise as she had told me she *was* over him and didn't love him anymore. I would never bring it up to her and say that I saw it on her phone, but feel very distraught and backseat because of it. (I brought up something I saw on her phone once along the lines of them hanging out. She wasn't pissed off I had read it, but asked that I respect the privacy of her conversations between her and friends, including J. I know I shouldn't have been looking at those messages, but whenever I see something like that, I can't help but think that my looking is ~~justified~~ probably causing more grief than if I just left it alone)


My own insecurities have taken a toll on me in the past when J and A would talk. I would tell her I feel left out of the picture and she would help talk me through it. I used to get really anxious if he texted her, but have since been able to more rationally cope with my feelings that doesn't imply increased heart rate. Though because she still talks to him so much and says things that she misses him (said to him back in Dec.) or is back and forth between breaking up but hinks its for the best (said last week) I still feel concerned about...something. ( I don't know what I'm concerned about myself, She tells me she loves me and I believe her, but don't know what my concern is ABOUT).  

Situational context: We have tickets to travel to europe for 3 weeks together after graduation and then she is moving away for a summer internship. After that she is going to grad school. I am also going to grad school(hopefully), but the closest locations to potential universities are 200 miles apart. I would love more than anything to stay together, but the most we have talked about is, ""if it is meant to happen, then it will"". I'm not sure how much I subscribe to that thought, I mean maybe, but it is hard to think about have an expiration date on the relationship with the first girl I have loved. It really is a discussion for after we hear back from grad schools. For now, we have tickets to europe together and I just hope she isn't texting J the entire time we are training through Switzerland. 

Sorry, I guess I don't have a solid question. More so I have used this as a platform to vent my concerns in hopes that someone can provide some sound advice (female and male) for a relationship newbie. 


TLDR: GF and her ex's history greatly overshadow our time together. Her talking to him gets me down because I feel left out and wish she would just forget about him, move on, and enjoy our time together.

I am 21 and she is almost 22!

To start with this, I had a relationship of 4 years with a girl who I thought I'm going to marry and to this day, I still want that. But, in those 4 years together she has lived abroad for atleast a year, maybe even longer. During that time we would only see eachother during summers, during the time that she needed to be here and for family related things.

But in those 4 years, she cheated on me, when she was in China. I believe cheating is a horrible thing to do, but, being me I forgave here. That being said, she lied to me saying that she didn't cheat for 9 months! In all that time I knew and asked her many times if she cheated on me, she profoundly kept saying no. After she did tell me she was surprised by my reaction, I didn't get mad, I didn't get anything, only thing I felt was utter disgust. She cheated on me because she missed my embrace, my touch and just male attention.

But fast forward to now, and why I am making this post is this: I want to be with her, I want to live with her and I want to have kids with her. She wants this as well but our situation is dire. She still lives abroad and works there for an important company. But her contract will run out in a month, meaning that she has to find a new job. And, she insist on getting a job in the country she is in now even though she wants to spent her entire life with me. I could go to her country and study there after this semester, but that being said I have to give up my fantastic social life, my wonderful friends, my job, my internship and my honors college. Just for her. The fact she doesn't want to go back to my country is that she really fucking hates it. She hates it here and I don't want her to feel that, just for me. 

But, now I have met this wonderful girl, who is also quite a lot older than I am (almost 25) and overall is a great assest to my life. But, as soon as she starts talking about a relationship I get scared, I get really, really fucking scared. This happend twice with others girls before I met her. It's just this endless loop of wanting to be with my ex, then being with a different girl and then crawl back to my ex about how much I miss her. It's just, my mind is full of fuck, I can't just comprehend what to do and it's destroying me. This might be because I'm HSP as well, so most emotions do tend to look bigger then they are. It's just that I want to be with my ex, but I can't right now, but I can't have a girl being with me knowning that I want to be with my ex, I don't want to put her through any misery or false hope. I feel so caged in and I have spoken to my ex about this and we see no clear  answer. Help?

tl;dr: i want my ex, ex wants me, another girl in my life who I really like, no future with ex for now and no future possible from my side with new girl (mind full of fuck)"

&gt;What was the best thing about the last year?

&gt;&gt;The best part of last year actually blossomed from my worst part of last year. I had to go to the hospital a few weeks before graduation which sucked. It made me stay in college for the summer to catch up on the work I missed over my 2 week hospital stay. But that summer one of the best summers I had filled with old friends, new friends, and a lot of alcohol

&gt;What are you looking forward to in the year ahead?

&gt;If you were granted one do-over, what would it be?

&gt;&gt;Better decisions as an undergrad

&gt;A butterfly flaps its wings... what small thing have you done or said that lead to something disproportionately larger?

&gt;&gt;I was once at my aunts house. She has 3 kids. One of the kids was bothering me so, offhandedly, I told him to go see what his sister was doing. Turns out his sister was playing Mario Kart on Wii under his account. They ended up fighting which caused my aunt to go see what was wrong. She started yelling which caused my grandma to yell at her which caused my uncle to step in. It caused a big family fight. I quietly left the house.

&gt;All things considered what is the most important thing in the world to you?

&gt;&gt;Happiness. It's often overlooked.

##Concerning reddit:

&gt;What is the origin or meaning of your user name?

&gt;&gt;It's random. But I have learned recently that it's Latin for 'my plunder'. So there's that.

&gt;Total number of reddit identities you’ve had?

&gt;&gt;3 or 4

&gt;What is your favorite part of reddit?

&gt;&gt;All the small gems I find while writing for /r/subredditoftheday. It also gives me a smug sense of superiority when my non reddit friends show me something hours after I've seen it

&gt;What do you do when you’re not on reddit?

&gt;&gt;I watch a lot of TV and try to discover new music every day. And of course, 9gag

&gt;Do you think reddit has changed in the last year or so?

&gt;&gt;Can't really say. I've only been redditing for a year.

&gt;If so, do you think it’s been for the better?

&gt;&gt;Sure

I don't have a lot of time cause she's driving right now but I'll just say I'm an intern at a medium sized business downtown and she's a receptionist, we talk everyday, and by my scale she's about an 8.5.  Here are the texts after she spent some time at a happy hour with me and some of our mutual bosses:

* Her: That was fun, your sense of humor is not so dry when your tipsy
* Me: You're more fun to hang out with outside the office :)
* Her: I'm fun in and out of the office, you just don't see it... It's ok, I understand you don't find me adorable lol
* Me: Yea well you're still pretty cute
* Her: Ok!  Did my drunk friend make it home?  or are you guys spending the night together
* Her: Wait, don't answer the last part lol just answer the first one
* Me: Lol he got home, and no I'm not spending the night with your 'friend' lol
* Me: You don't have to pretend, I know you and ***** are madly in love ;)
* Her: I told you not to answer the last part lol... But at least I know ***** didn't get further than me lol
* Her: Is it that obvious?  Can't help it, I am a lover, I declared my platonic love to ********* today!
* Me: Haha
* Me: Yeah well I think you're pretty hott but I don't wanna mess it up in the office, trying to be a professional and all
* Her: I know I am a loud mouth but I know what to keep quiet... Do you know how ***** would react, it would be bad!
* Me: Haha what you mean?
* Me: you should drive out to [my city] :P
* Her: You know what I mean
* Me: Nuh uh I don't!
* Her: Damn!  [my city], can it be any further lol
* Me: Drive girl! Lol
* Me: Seriously you should come hang out in [my city]!
* Her: Ok, I will...
* Her: Let me know
* Me: Well my address is ______________ if you wanna hang out now :P
* Her: Just my luck, the day you decide to let go a lil, I can't hang out =(...
* Me: Haha what you talking abt!
* Her: That a few weeks ago you ""couldn't hang out"" and today that your able to hang out, I can't....
* Me: That's cool I understand, I do like you I just really wanna work there n don't wanna mess it up, but I totally get why you dont wanna hang out
* Her: No you really don't know why, I have to be up really early... I'm actually not going to work tomorrow... And I know you want to work there and I understand that, but I can keep things quiet;)
* Me: Ok we come hang out!  I promise I'm a DAMN good alarm clock! Haha
* Me:*well
* Her: Is that right? Your good at convincing, you should be an atty

* Me: Hahaha ok
* Her: So what does that laugh mean? **[At this point I wanted to point out the OBVIOUS...]**
* Me: You're just dodging me and I'm just trying to get you to come watch a movie, I don't get it! lol
* Her: I'm not dodging you and a movie really?  What kind of movie are we talking about? Lol... I do wanna hang out but I think you purposely pick tonight **[At this point I want to correct her with ""Purposefully""]**
* Me: What you mean purposely?  And I have a lot of comedy/scary/etc movies to choose from once you get here

q1wlj,1,2012-02-22,[College] What foreign language should I learn?,JDBAZ,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/q1wlj/college_what_foreign_language_should_i_learn/,"So I am currently a Freshman at my college, Northern Arizona University, and they recently introduced a program called GSEP. You can read more about it here: http://international.nau.edu/GSEP/Info/GSEP-overview.html

Basically, the just is this: While enrolled in your normal Computer Science classes, you also take foreign language classes. This is either in German, French, or Spanish. In what would be your senior year of school, you travel to a foreign country for a year. Obviously this is a country that speaks that language you are learning. 
For 6 months you attend a university there, taking a very light course load, mostly consisting of liberal arts classes and only 1-2 actual Computer Science related classes, which will transfer, and thus count towards my degree at NAU. You then have a 6 month internship at a company, obviously somehow relating to Computer Science. You then come back, and finish your degree in your 5th year. At the end of all of this, you end up graduating with the following:

* B.S. in Computer Science
* B.A. in a foreign language
* 6 Months at a foreign university
* 6 Months at a foreign company

Now, my question is this: What language should I learn? I took very basic High School Spanish, and have forgotten it all since then, so I feel as if I am basically at the same level in all three languages. I am leaning towards French, only for the reason of my sister and brother in law traveled in France and loved it. Is one language better, in the sense of there are more Computer Science jobs in a country that speaks that language? Even if I don't end up working at a job overseas, I feel that it would be an amazing experience to have, and I don't think it can ever really hurt having a foreign language degree."
q1qn6,0,2012-02-22,Non-technical IT internship--is this helping me at all?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/q1qn6/nontechnical_it_internshipis_this_helping_me_at/,"I'm a junior computer science major aiming for IT (I suppose my ultimate dream is sysadmin). I just started an internship which is in the IT department of a great company. I took the offer because, well, there were no other positions in my area, and it was my first opportunity to work in my field. I know that internships have the stereotype of being coffee-fetching jobs, but my duties are basically glorified proofreading of benefit information before it's packaged and sent to clients. I don't mind doing this, but should I look for an internship that will give me hands-on experience in programming, infrastructure, or...anything? Should I work hard and ask for a transfer later? Or just accept that an IT internship is an IT internship?"
q4m69,1,2012-02-24,"Help. I'm good at what I do, but I hate it.",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/q4m69/help_im_good_at_what_i_do_but_i_hate_it/,"I don't know if this is the appropriate subreddit for this, but here goes anyway.

I started programming when I was 14 and started making mods for quake and stuff. I just started getting hooked. I was at the top of my class for math and I took every single possible AP math class I could take (Statistics, Computer Science, Physics, etc) but I always had this lingering thought in the back of my head that I didn't really like it.

Anyway I eventually got so good that I basically had an internship for $15/hr land in my lap as a Junior in high school, I was the kid at my school making the most money. Sure, it was really hard work but I made a shitload of money.

However, I saw the other jobs that other kids had, like McDonalds, Baskin Robbins and Target and stuff like that and I saw all the fun they were having and all the friends they were making and I kinda got jealous. I basically just sat on a computer and programmed while these other people got to interact with people.

Now, it's my first year at Uni and I'm majoring in computer science (obviously), but I *really* don't think it's for me. Sure, I'm at the top of my class right now but I am seriously not enjoying my life. Like, **none of my friends like computers**. I think that says a lot about me.,I have nothing in common with my comp-sci classmates so I made friends elsewhere. 

I'm really fucking scared, I'm so good at this shit it's unreal but I fucking hate it now. In a perfect world, I would just change majors. But I'm so good at programming, it just feels like so much wasted time, effort and potential. I honestly have no idea what I would do for a living other than computer science but I think I'm about to break. I can't take it anymore. I want a life. I want friends. I want to party. I can't relate to anyone else in my class. it sucks.


Does anyone get me?

q4d4x,2,2012-02-24,Big4 - Industry Preference Question,redhotassets,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/q4d4x/big4_industry_preference_question/,"I'm about to finish an audit internship at a Big4 firm, and we were told that if we get hired FT, we'll be able to rank the top 3 industries we'd prefer to work in to determine our industry placement. The catch is, 2 of our choices have to be industries that we worked in during our internship. I've worked on 3 year-end audits, 2 were consumer &amp; industrial markets and the other was financial services. I was okay with the 2 manufacturing companies, and although I liked my engagement team for the third, I did not like the work I did, so that's definitely at the bottom of my list.

The industry I'd truly prefer working in is public sector (governmental, universities, NFP). My previous internship was 2 summers at a smaller CPA firm, where I worked on audits at school districts, townships, etc. and compilations for small NFP companies. I loved the work, especially compared to the experience I've gained working in other industries, and I know that's what I want to do.

I don't know if this is true for the other Big4 firms, but the public sector group at my firm is pretty small compared to the other industries we work in. I'm guessing it's a small group either because nobody really wants to go into it or it doesn't require as many people and is therefore more difficult to go into. Given my background, I wondered why I didn't get placed into that group for my internship, and I think it's because it's such a small group because there are no interns assigned to any public sector clients. It seems that the more popular industries that everyone tries to get into are financial services and real estate, because a lot of those companies are right in the city, so I'm hopeful that the fact that I even want to be placed in the public sector will help me get there.

**My question is, would it be likely for me to be placed in the public sector industry if I rank that as my top preference and let them know I have experience in that area?**"
q4bv5,1,2012-02-24,Automating/simulating javascript actions [http headers / C#],fosizzle,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/q4bv5/automatingsimulating_javascript_actions_http/,"Hey all,

I'm an intern programmer and my knowledge is limited.  Most of my experience is with C# and secondly java.  

The task I'm trying to complete seems like it should be easy but my inexperience with scripting or javascript aswell as http methods is next to none.

To the problem:  I'm looking to simulate and automate two button clicks, with the browser already open.  And perhaps automate population of a form field (textbox), but that would be icing on top.

This is obviously a simple task done manually, but I'm not really sure how to attack the problem through code.  How do I invoke a method or trigger an action on javascript?  

My guess is I might be able to spoof the http request headers (get/post/etcetra), but my knowledge on that is very limited.  I downloaded a program which records the get/post headers.  Assuming this is the solution, how do I send these to the website (using preferably C#)?  I don't even need to receive the returned content, I just need to trigger the event.

*Thanks*"

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[What's the difference between an angel investor and a VC?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u6pju?context=5)|Broadly speaking an angel investor invests their own money and may not do it full time.  A VC is a professional who invests other peoples' money in a fund.  Also angels tend to invest earlier in less developed companies (sometimes called seed stage).
[Are there generally legal or structural differences between angel and series A funding?  I know that angel rounds are usually smaller but it seems like there is more to it.  What constitutes ""closing"" a round, does that mean that all the equity that you're going to sell for that round has been sold?  Is it generally the case that no equity changes hands until a whole round closes?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3ue3o8?context=5)|While most angels are coming in at a seed round (pre-series A), that's not always true.  I've participated in Series A funding before as an angel.  Seed rounds can be done as convertible notes which is popular now and basically is a loan convertible to equity on the same terms as the next, Series A round.  This avoids negotiating terms and valuation before it makes sense to do so since a VC will likely want to dictate these.  There are drawbacks.  Seed round docs or docs for angels used to be less sophisticated / simpler in terms and conditions but nowadays I think this is less so.  Angels are investing in more developed companies and so are asking for much the same things as VCs so structurally they may be similar, especially if groups of angels are investing together in a syndicated deal.  Closing a round literally means signing the docs (getting the equity or notes) and wiring the money.  Popular these days is the rolling close where there will be multiple closes as money comes in, however as an investor you really want a minimum before any close because if the company doesn't raise what it wants that greatly magnifies the risk.  Also all things being equal you want to wait as long as possible (maximize your optionality) and close when the full round closes.  Which is why sometimes companies offer incentives to people who close early.
[What kind of covenants are there in the converts? Like can you convert given specific credit events or do you have to wait for the next round of equity? My thinking with your system is that your writing paper, for which there's presumably no secondary market, and in the downside case (start up blows out before they can raise the next round of funding) you're the only capital in the company, so even if you have recourse, it's not to anything really. Meanwhile you're debt, so until you convert you have no say in corporate governance... So it's sort of a catch-22 right? You don't have any real recourse unless your upside case proves out, at which point recourse wouldn't really matter. Seems like kind of a shitty deal from a fixed income POV. How do you protect yourself against the downside?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3uerqd?context=5)|Yes you can convert on specific credit events but as you say it doesn't matter.
[What is your view on ""lifestyle"" businesses?  Ie. those that make their owners a nice bit of money to live on comfortably, but allow them to spend very little time actually working.  Do you think those are great?  Or do you think those people are missing out on huge opportunities?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u7axr?context=5)|Funnily I think many owners of lifestyle businesses never actually reach that goal of working little.  Keeping a business going through all the ups and downs is hard and you can never really trust someone else who is just on salary to look out as you would (as an owner).
[Pardon my ignorance in this area, but are there other types of exits beyond selling your stake?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u9p4d?context=5)|You don't have to sell it all and then there are all sorts of things like earn outs, restrictions, etc.
[Is this something an angel investor would be interested in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u6otx?context=5)|I don't know your space but there is no reason why angels wouldn't invest in OEM or suppliers to OEMs so long as it is a scalable business model that can payback the investment with a gain!
[What are OEM companies?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3uj93x?context=5)|Http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_equipment_manufacturer.
[How did you get into it? What education? Background? Parents come from money?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u701k?context=5)|Kind of accidentally honestly.  People I knew were looking to found a company and I liked the idea and had made a little extra money from working on wall street so put it in.  Frankly I was completely unsophisticated about it but was excited by the opportunity.  Plus I still had a bit of the entrepreneur in me from etechtransfer.  There were a lot of twists and turns from there but as time went on I heard about more companies and it went on from there.  Originally I'm an MIT Engineer.  No family money.
[Course # at MIT?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u9w4w?context=5)|6.
[Did you even have a chance to invest into twitter/facebook early on? Or similar question, what company became successful but you weren't interested?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u74j0?context=5)|Nope.  Better question is would I have invested had I the chance.  Honestly I didn't really care for either when I first heard of them.   Frankly I haven't been doing this full time or near full time until recently (~2 years) so there haven't been any huge successes yet that I know of where I declined.  There will be!
[Proof please?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u6nnp?context=5)|Just tweeted this iama.  you can see my companies on my profile.  http://www.newcanaannewsonline.com/news/article/Stamford-Innovation-Center-unveiled-to-the-public-3333718.php  http://www.ctpost.com/news/article/Stamford-Innovation-Center-lands-500-000-aid-2970722.php Not much left on the web on etechtransfer but here's an article: http://knowledge.emory.edu/article.cfm?articleid=179  At one point three of the founders (again not me!) were on the cover of the Industry Standard.
[Just curious about your thoughts on Angelist. How do you like it? How often do you use it?  Also from a start-up Point-of-View, do you think it's easier to get attention, and reach out to angels. Any tips or other comments?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u7nu0?context=5)|I like Angelist a lot.  Naval is doing great things with it and it is getting a lot of traction.  As I mentioned to him the flow on there is surprisingly good and in some cases better than I get through my local angel group.  Perhaps because since it is public people self-filter or peer-filter out the really bad ideas... Attention is easy to get but really do you want it?  Meaning buzz can be gotten but is often fleeting.  In general, I think startups should make as much progress as they can without taking outside money or only friends/family.  If you can get all the way to making revenue (or profit) even on small scale then you'll get the attention you need to scale up, no worries!
[How do you compare potential value of a smaller idea/product that might be more niche or a larger (but more high risk/reward) opportunity?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u6u46?context=5)|Personally I like ideas that don't have to be home runs to succeed.  World changing potential is great but let's be honest, there are few of those ideas and the ones that get there often evolve a lot (facebook is a perfect example).  Break up the larger idea up into concrete executable smaller ideas and dominate niche by niche.  [insert cliche here like walk before you run]
[Also, what kind of returns do you expect if the company becomes successful? Do you think that investors put too much pressure on startups to have an exit strategy and help everyone cash out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3uc53l?context=5)|There definitely is a lot of pressure on exit strategy and the more money you take in in later rounds the more pressure builds.  That's why you really shouldn't take money unless you really need it because the incentives can get misaligned. That said early exits often make sense for the entrepreneurs too and it is important to have founders who are starry eyed enough to shoot for the moon but who are practical and understand when they've done well enough along the way and external concerns just make it impossible to really grow as fast or easily (such as lots of new competition, big entrenched player is throwing money at it, etc)
[What is the timeframe for that? How does it work--do they pay you after raising bigger money from venture capitalists? Isn't that sort of close to a ponzi scheme?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3uc8u9?context=5)|No one is promising any returns so it's not a ponzi scheme.
[For those seeking angel investors, what is the best way to find one?  Once we find one how do we convince you to invest in a start up?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u7fev?context=5)|Reach out to angel groups in your area or on angellist (which BTW is a great newish site bringing together angels and companies).  As for the convincing have a great idea and a great team to execute it.  Know what you don't know and be honest about weaknesses.  Get us excited about building a business with you!
[How did you get started in your career? Did you build your way up from nothing?  What is the best advise you can give about being successesful in the corporate world?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3ueh5y?context=5)|I did some internships while in college and was recruited by Lehman Bros my senior year.  I started off in the front office as a jr trader = coffee boy.  Then went back to tech as a consultant at JPM but it wasn't long before I left w/ some others to found a startup.  It went on from there.  The corporate world is a tough one.  I think the number one thing is to understand it is all about people and that there is a lot of politics.  So just being right isn't enough, you need to make sure you get everyone going along with you too.  I don't think I ever completely learned that.  Also you should understand where the money gets made and be as essential to that as you can.  Of course startups are kind of non-corporate which I like ;)
[One last one...  I consider myself an extremely savvy marketing person with a very broad digital background who has been very successful at what I do in the digital marketing space for some pretty large companies.  With that background, is there any sort of place for a person like me who does not have a Finance/Wallstreet background or who doesn't have a successful list of startups they've created to join a VC firm in some capacity?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u7bjx?context=5)|As an employee off the bat I'd say no.  If you want to get involved you should start by networking and becoming an advisor/subject matter expert where you can leverage your background in a way that benefits them.
[, whats your first tip to a person who is not necessarily a designer/developer but wants to start his own startup?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u84q5?context=5)|First tip: get involved in the scene and meet people doing it.  See my earlier response but in particular you should come to the Stamford Tech Meetup.  Despite the name, it isn't all for techies.  Also get involved in startup events like the startup weekend stamford we are hosting soon.
[Yeah I've been to a few of the Stamford meetups, thats actually how I got my current position.  I saw at the SUWeekend you have a ticket for non-developer/designer.  What exactly do you expect someone who attends as that category to do at the event?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u89xv?context=5)|Join a team!  I know other startup weekends have done it differently but really I think broader teams are better.
[Which investments/companies have panned out and which have failed? What lessons have you learned from each?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3ueu2m?context=5)|As I've said below I've had limited gains/losses and most investments are ongoing so I can't talk specific names.  That said major lessons learned are: 1) Team ability to stick together in rough times with the same goals and commitment is critical.  This was a huge issue in my own startup failure and in my largest investment was an ongoing struggle that led to 3 of 6 founding team members leaving before management could stabilize enough for the company to mature.  2) Always be analytical not emotional in investing.  On my investment where I had to write most of it off I didn't put my usual rigor into the market opportunity and long sales cycle because I knew the founder very well and the company too.  3) Growing customers/revenue too fast can be a killer.  Keep your eye on expenses.  I'd heard this before anecdotally but one company just scaled up and up and when the recession hit they were caught with a too large office, too many staff, etc.  4) VC/PE and institutional money in general play for keeps.  If there is something in the contract or DD they can exploit they will, so make sure everything is in order.  5) On that note run the company professionally.  This means things like keeping minutes, voting on board meetings, audited financials, etc.  Act like a larger, professional company or you won't ever get there!  6) You need a strong supporting team not just a single or two strong founders.  Especially technical, financial, and marketing.  If these skills are represented the company will spend time finding people after the money comes in.  Individuals should be identified ahead of time.
[9 member team = 2 full-time co-founders , 3 partners (engineers), ( 4 friends &amp; family investors all strong techies) everyone having stake in company.   4000+ hrs already put in (each day/hour can be pointed and accounted for, just in case :)  Launching pre-beta (productized) on 29th Feb, looking for angel investors, to bring everyone on the ship full time.

[How do you pitch your idea to an Angel Investor without them stealing it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3uawor?context=5)|In general you shouldn't pitch pure ideas because pure ideas don't get funded.  You need some traction (prototype, team, etc).  Also I can't speak for every angel investor and I'm sure there are bad apples out there but most of us don't have the capability to execute your idea and just like you certainly couldn't do it without a team.  Even if I could execute it if I think your idea is a good one and I think you are a great jockey (see above) then why would I steal the idea vs backing you since you've already taken it somewhere (presumably)?  Especially since doing that means there is a motivated and angry person out there doing the same thing who can also sue me?
[I live in a city famed for it's abundance of angel and venture capital and am a partner in a kitchen-sink start up. The kicker is, the money is focussed on tech and bio-pharma and we're in music... Do you think it's possible someone might invest in music for vanity purposes ?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u8y08?context=5)|Lots of people would want invest in music for vanity purposes so they can say ""I found that band"".  It's up there with restaurants and bars.  How many actually do I bet is limited though.
[I am a PhD student in Nuclear Engineering right now, thinking about my plans after finishing my degree.  I read economics books as a side hobby, but have no real business-type skills.  If I want to commercialize my research, what kind of market would I need to attract an angel investor?  I understand that I really need a Day 0 product that I need to develop and show to potential investors, but what kind of return would they need to see?  Also, how in-depth would research of that nature need to be to be realistic?  What kind of business plan would I need to show them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3ukwcr?context=5)|Hi you've got a lot of questions and I really am not the best person to answer them plus it would take quite a long while to do so.  You should speak to the commercialization people at your university and they can get you going.  End of the day though if you have no real business-type skills then you need to partner with someone who does.
[What's a good amount to start angel investing? I know Angel investors aren't considered Accredited investors by the SEC, but are there any legal hoops you have to jump through? At what point did you hire a lawyer to deal with your deals?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u8pkn?context=5)|Angel investments are by definition highly risky and illiquid so you shouldn't invest money you will ever need.  What that amount is is different for each person based upon their needs/lifestyle.
[How did you originally qualify to be an accredited investor? I'm not sure I'll be able to get to the point of $200k annually or $1 mill net worth easily. Should I go the route of opening a business investment company?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u9myi?context=5)|I think qualifying as an accredited investors is the minimum before you can make investments.  Of course the gov't is looking to lower the barriers on certain types/sizes of investments.  I'd wait on that.
[Do you happen to know of any one/site/groups who do what you do in western continental Europe?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3ub1sl?context=5)|Sorry I don't.  I know Europe has a lot more funds than angel investors though anecdotally.
[What are your thoughts of getting an MBA?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u7uvz?context=5)|Ok broadly speaking I think an MBA's top value is in the people you meet (networking) and in the name on the diploma.  In this economy given the cost I think anyone should think hard about the actual value versus two years of learning by doing.  Can you tell I never got one myself? As an entrepreneur or as an investor?
[Hey rich 1 percenter stealing from the poor, get off the internet!  All kidding aside, do you think capital gains should be taxed at a rate closer to income tax?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3udnsm?context=5)|Nope.  Unless you inherited it, you paid income tax already on the money you used to buy the asset that you were lucky to have capital gains on.  Even if you did inherit it, if it was in a year other than 2010 (recently), you paid estate tax.  So capital gains are already double taxed.  Furthermore I should be incentivized to put my money to work by investing it in stocks, bonds, real estate, and yes startup companies (which by definition create jobs!)  And I think the AMT already causes capital gains rates paid to be higher for big earners.  I think our tax code is hideously and needlessly complex and full of loopholes, fix that not the capital gains rate.
[Ok, I've got a great idea and need money to pay a programmer - probably less than $25k. Infinitely scalable and ridiculous profit potential. Your wheelhouse?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3ubo0u?context=5)|If that's what you need and potential is as huge as you say then you should borrow that money from friends and family so you keep all the equity.  Seriously.  Don't reach outside unless you absolutely need it.
[Do you invest in technology biz, or any kind of start up?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u8d3m?context=5)|I'm pretty broad and have invested in pharma/biotech, sales/marketing, ecommerce, fashion, etc.  All of my investments have a technology component but these days what doesn't?
[I work for a startup that is seeded through a VERY wealthy individual. We are a SaaS company with patents. The market we're trying to sell to right now has a sales cycle of about 1.5YEARS. Every day, I lose a bit of hope for longevity, and for ultimate financial success here. Is there any way to get in touch with you when you're done with this AMA so I can pick  your brain?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u7hzf?context=5)|Sure.  I'm @tedsensei.
[I have a very successful website that is read by most hedge funds, investment banks, and securities law firms in the United States.  I do this on the side in addition to my full time job working on Wall Street.  I would like to expand this website but need capital and time to do it.  Do you suggest I quit my job before reaching out to angels or contact angels while I still have a seat and get soft circles and a lawyer retained?  In addition, can I contact you offline for further advice?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u95s4?context=5)|First I think you should make sure that you aren't in conflict with any policies of where you work.  Assuming that you are ok then sure, stay employed while you get everything else lined up.  Since you've been able to run it successfully while keeping a day job nothing should change.  If your plan to expand makes sense and you get a good read on capital, then you can quit and be happy.  Clearly your investors will want you 100% focused on the site after that.  Some may care that you are working a day job now but honestly I think most will understand, again provided that the site is doing well that's the most important thing.  Caveat: they probably won't fund your salaries or whatever on the assumption that you have savings from keeping the day job for so long.  @tedsensei.
[It seems like there is no room for young people in VC.  Is there any entry-level way into the field?  You would think there would be plenty of associate level work to do but these positions don't seem to exist.  It seems like I have to either launch a startup or have a tremendous amount of wealth to start doing VC as a career.  Any idea how one would make the career transition?  I'm in the Northeast.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3uaim1?context=5)|I don't know firsthand having never worked at a VC, but I hear where you are coming from.  Fact is there are way more people who want to get into it than there are spots because it simply doesn't take massive teams to do the work (and they can't afford them anyways).  This is one of the cases where you might actually get an MBA so you can network your way in and have the ground level skills through internships or whatever.  Also many people transition to VC/PE from working at banks.
[However, nabbing 10-30k from a single Angel isn't really enough for me to quit my job and invest heavily in the business.  Do you recommend finding a group of angels?  Do you usually make investments with three or four others?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3u9omy?context=5)|See above, I don't think it will happen that you'll get money to do it as a side business, frankly it isn't fair to the investor that you have such a huge hedge/out.
[If one has a great business idea with a business plan that doesn't require too much capital, say &lt;100k. Should one take out a business loan or seek capital from a VC?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3uh20s?context=5)|I think you'll find it difficult if not impossible to get a loan for a business plan if that's all you have.  Same goes with a VC (plus that size is way too small for them).
[I should also mention one does not like to share profits. Is there an agreement one could put in place stating that you can make 100-300% back on your initial investment?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3uh20s?context=5)|Not sure what you mean about sharing profits?  Legally you can cap returns through some kind of buyback clause, but I don't see why an investor would agree to do that given the risk/reward.  After all, if it fails are going to guarantee they get their money back or some part of it?
[Well isn't that part of the risk that VCs take? They either get a healthy return on their initial investment or lose it if the business fails?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3ulmq7?context=5)|Right but then why should/would they agree to cap those healthy returns if the downside is not similarly capped?
[So what would you do if you were the guy with the business idea?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3uq00i?context=5)|I've been that guy. Take it as far as you can without taking money or taking money only from friends and family.  Then when you are ready you can bring in investors if you need it.  If you really can't do it without lots of money, break the idea down into smaller bits that are probably more realistic to execute on anyways.  Then by the time you really need money you'll be able to get investors on terms more like you want.
[Which verticals is your accelerator fund most excited about?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3uah7o?context=5)|Right now media is a big deal, especially in Stamford as more production facilities are moving in.  Similarly there are a lot of opportunities in healthcare related companies.  But we are open to all verticals.
[Do you invest more in the horse or jockey?  (idea or entrepreneur)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3uah7o?context=5)|Definitely the jockey.  Most if not all companies pivot through several ideas IF they ever win the race.
[I have an invention idea. Is it worth pursuing? It's not very technological, but it's original and (I believe) fairly useful. Do you ever consider these projects?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3ucm8n?context=5)|Personally usually not because I have limited connections in the consumer goods type businesses plus it is very marketing ($) intensive.  That said if it is a good idea you should go for it!  What space is the invention in?
[I'm also working on a startup in the music space (and no not another Internet radio platform) and planning on launching prior to SXSW. We are considering angel investors but we're incorporated in Illinois (I'm the lone NYCer). How urgent is it to reincorporate in Delaware when looking for angel investment? Also, would you say it's worth paying a lawyer for a few hours of their time to go over the terms and services, etc prior to launch?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3uh2az?context=5)|Is it a C corp?  If not then you should take the time/money to reincorporate as a C in Delaware if you are seriously looking to raise money.  However you can always do it as a conditional to the raise.
[No we're an S corp. I was told that most startups should incorporate as a LLC, so C corp is new news to me. Can you explain that a bit further?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q2kx4/iama_angel_investor_entrepreneur_accelerator/c3ulqx6?context=5)|There is no one obvious answer other than S corps don't work for angel investors and any kind of pass through tax treatment won't work.  Unless they aren't investing in equity.  That said people will do just about anything I guess, I'm just saying most won't.  If you already have an S you should just go to C which is ultimately what you must have if you want institutional money at any point.

Except Burnett made it too human interesty and blubbery.  Oh and some of the deals are ridiculously overpriced (which I've started to tweet about).  The original show is called Dragon's Den and is all over the world.  I'm a big fan of the UK Dragon's Den which was the first popular one.  1) The Dragons aren't as big a-holes and really try to give good advice and help even when they must be harsh 2) There isn't a huge amount of backstory, it's about the companies and investments 3) They don't want one up each other just for the ""drama""

q3xhc,0,2012-02-24,Spongebob horror storry! LONG READ (Part 1),[deleted],WTF,https://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/q3xhc/spongebob_horror_storry_long_read_part_1/,"
I’m NOT saying this is real. I just find it interesting. One reminder: NONE of the stuff said below are in my own words, but instead in the words of an intern at Nickelodeon.


“I want to start off by saying if you want an answer at the end, prepare to be disappointed. There just isn’t one.”


“I was an intern at Nickelodeon Studios for a year in 2005 for my degree in animation. It wasn’t paid of course, most internships aren’t, but it did have some perks beyond education. To adults it might not seem like a big one, but most kids at the time would shit themselves over it. Since I worked directly with the editors and animators, I got to view the new episodes days before they aired.”


“I’ll get right to it without giving too many unnecessary details. They had very recently made the Spongebob movie and the entire staff was somewhat sapped of creativity so it took them longer to start up the season. But the delay lasted longer for more upsetting reasons. There was a problem with the series 4 premier that set everyone and everything back for several months.”


“Me and two other interns were in the editing room along with the lead animators and sound editors for the final cut. We received the copy that was supposed to be “Fear of a Krabby Patty” and gathered around the screen to watch. Now, given that it isn’t final yet animators often put up a mock title card, sort of an inside joke for us, with phony, often times lewd titles, such as “How sex doesn’t work” instead of “Rock-a-by-Bivalve” when spongebob and patrick adopt a sea scallop. Nothing particularly funny but work related chuckles. So when we saw the title card “Squidward’s Suicide” we didn’t think it more than a morbid joke. One of the interns did a small throat laugh at it. The happy-go-lucky music plays as is normal.” 


“The story began with Squidard practicing his clarinet, hitting a few sour notes like normal. We hear Spongebob laughing outside and Squidard stops, yelling at him to keep it down as he has a concert that night and needs to practice. Spongebob says okay and goes to see Sandy with with Patrick. The bubbles splash screen comes up and we see the ending of Squidward’s concert. This is when things began to seem off. While playing, a few frames repeat themselves, but the sound doesn’t (at this point sound is synced up with animation so yes that’s not common) but when he stops playing, the sound finishes as if the skip never happened. There is slight mummuring in the crowed before they begin to boo him. Not normal cartoon booing that is common in the show, but you could very clearly hear malace in it. Squidward’s in full frame and looks visibly afraid. The shot goes to the crowd, with Spongebob in center frame, and he too is booing, very much unlike him. That isn’t the oddest thing, though. What is odd is everyone had hyper realistic eyes. Very detailed. Clearly not shots of real people’s eyes, but something a bit more real than CGI. The pupils were red. Some of us looked at eachother, obviously confused, but since we weren’t the writers we didn’t question its appeal to children, yet.”


“The shot goes to Squidward sitting on the edge of his bed, looking very forlorn. The view out of his porthole window is of a night sky so it isn’t very long after the concert. The unsettling part is at this point there is no sound. Literally no sound. Not even the feedback from the speakers in the room. It’s as if the speakers were turned off, though their status showed them working perfectly. He just sat there, blinking, in this silence for about 30 seconds, then he started to sob softly. He put his hands (tentacles) over his eyes and cried quietly for a full minute more, all the while a sound in the background very slowly growing from nothing to barely audible. It sounded like a slight breeze through a forest.”


“The screen slowly begins to zoom in on his face. By slow I mean it’s only noticeable if you look at shots 10 seconds apart side by side. His sobbing gets louder, more full of hurt and anger. The screen then twitches a bit, as if it twists in on itself, for a split second then back to normal. The wind-through-the-trees sound gets slowly louder and more severe, as if a storm is brewing somewhere. The eerie part is this sound, and Squidward’s sobbing, sounded real, as if the sound wasn’t coming from the speakers but as if the speakers were holes the sound was coming through from the other side. As good as sound as the studio likes to have, they don’t purchase the equipment to be that good to produce sound of that quality.”


“Below the sound of the wind and sobbing, very faint, something sounded like laughing. It came at odd intervals and never lasted more than a second so you had a hard time pinning it (we watched this show twice, so pardon me if things sound too specific but I’ve had time to think about them). After 30 seconds of this, the screen blurred and twitched violently and something flashed over the screen, as if a single frame was replaced. The lead animation editor paused and rewound frame by frame. What we saw was horrible. It was a still photo of a dead child. He couldn’t have been more than 6. The face was mangled and bloodied, one eye dangling over his upturned face, popped. He was naked down to his underwear, his stomach crudely cut open and his entrails laying beside him. He was laying on some pavement that was probably a road. The most upsetting part was that there was a shadow of the photographer. There was no crime tape, no evidence tags or markers, and the angle was completely off for a shot designed to be evidence. It would seem the photographer was the person responsible for the child’s death.”


“We were of course mortified, but pressed on, hoping that it was just a sick joke. The screen flipped back to Squidward, still sobbing, louder than before, and half body in frame. There was now what appeard to be blood running down his face from his eyes. The blood was also done in a hyper realistic style, looking as if you touched it you’d get blood on your fingers. The wind sounded now as if it were that of a gale blowing through the forest; there were even snapping sounds of branches. The laughing, a deep baritone, lasting at longer intervals and coming more frequently. After about 20 seconds, the screen again twisted and showed a single frame photo. The editor was reluctant to go back, we all were, but he knew he had to. This time the photo was that of what appeared to be a little girl, no older than the first child. She was laying on her stomach, her barrettes in a pool of blood next to her. Her left eye was too popped out and popped, naked except for underpants. Her entrails were piled on top of her above another crude cut along her back. Again the body was on the street and the photographer’s shadow was visible, very similar in size and shape to the first. I had to choke back vomit and one intern, the only female in the room, ran out.”

q3ssi,3,2012-02-24,Somewhat confused about my options,SonOfSpades,gis,https://www.reddit.com/r/gis/comments/q3ssi/somewhat_confused_about_my_options/,"I am about to graduate university with a Computer Science degree, with a Minor in Geomatics, and i am somewhat confused as to where i stand/go from here. I have taken almost all of the Geomatics courses offered by my university from Remote Sensing to Cartography, unfortunately I feel really confused as to where I fit in. 

A bit of backstory, my first coop internship was with Environment Canada, working as a developer, coding applications (in C++) to process/convert/etc satellite imagery into formats that were more usable for the analyists/science people, following this I ended up creating/working on extensions (or add-ons as ESRI calls them now) for ArcGIS, along with other various tasks. I really had no understanding of what a “Spatial Reference” or what “Symbology” was and why it is so important, at the time. However I loved the work, so much that I ended up doing a minor in Geomatics, and ended up working with Environment Canada for two years on and off, as a developer (for coop).  Also for the last year I have been rewriting/porting (Ugh Avenue)/updating peoples Python Scripts/Geoprocessor tools, ArcObjects/ tools and extensions. I have been doing this for free, to try and get more experience.

I tried to get into and contribute to the Open Source GIS Community; however I never really was able to get into it. However I do love the open source community, libraries such as GDAL, Mapnik, and even applications such as Geoserver / Postgresql + PostGIS are invaluable, and I have used them a fair bit for my classes/thesis/personal projects.

Skillset wise however the majority of my experience is using ArcObjects / Python / GDAL (Since working raster’s in ArcObjects/arcpy + numpy is slow and horrifying). However I do have a fairly good grasp of the open source GIS tools, especially when it comes to a lot of the Web GIS stuff. 

I somewhat feel I over specialized with ESRI, and should have instead been more focusing on the general areas of GIS. What should I be focusing on? Furthermore where do GIS Programmers really fit in?

q3kbh,1,2012-02-23,"Prospective Office Manager, Need Help",[deleted],Dentistry,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dentistry/comments/q3kbh/prospective_office_manager_need_help/,"I have recently left the US Navy after nearly seven years. I initially enlisted as a Dental Technician, however in late 2005 all Dental Technicians became Hospital Corpsmen. Wanting to stay in the dental field (which was difficult for Dental Technicians at the time, as there was quite a bit of cross-training to the medical field), I took on additional training as a Dental Laboratory Technician to 'stay dental.' Knowing that I did want to become a civilian eventually, I started course work and eventually earned my BS in Health Sciences with a concentration in Health Care Management, and I am continuing to work towards my Master's in the same. I have operated as the senior NCO in several dental clinic/laboratories, directly managing the work schedules of 12 people.

That said, for the past two months I have been applying to positions as a Dental Office Manager with little luck. I have received, perhaps, a 15% callback rate for applications submitted. However, when my potential employer learns that I have no real world experience with insurance claims, I'm often quickly dismissed (albeit, quite politely). To rectify this, I have attempted to contact several practices in my local area for an unpaid internship position where I can learn this portion of the trade but have had absolutely no responses.

At this point, I'm quite concerned. I'm contemplating going back to school for a year to earn my ICD-9-CM certification. However, I'm not sure if this certification is particularly valued in the civilian dental sector. Is there, perhaps, an alternate certification that is more valuable to the dental community?

Also, I have included a [1] link to the resume I have been using to secure job interviews. Any comments regarding how to improve it would be greatly appreciated.

EDIT - Wanted to add that I have applied to Dental Front Desk positions in the hope that I could gain insurance experience there. However, I have found I have absolutely no callbacks when I apply to that position.

Should I just give him space?,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/q60o0/advice_he_says_he_loves_me_but_he_wont_take_me/,"We've been together for 2 years. I fucked up last summer and made out with another man, who tried to have sex with me. I stopped. I didn't want that. But I still cheated. I was upfront. It took until I returned to the state I hail from (I had an out-of-state internship for 4 months when it happened), about a month but I told him what happened. To this day I am sorry.
He also hates that every so often I smoke. He hates it.
Since getting back together after the summer, I've been busy. I'm in college, have 3 jobs, and he lives an hour away. I know I could've tried harder to see him, but it was simpler for him to stop by up here since he worked 20 minutes from my university. 
Ever since this summer he's been hesitant to let me go out with friends. And ever since this summer, I've been feeling really independent. 
We started fighting a bunch. He wanted me to put forth more of an effort and I wanted space. One day I finally asked for it. We ended. But he wanted to make it more of a break. So I did. I didn't hook up with anyone, do anything stupid or break any of his 'rules'. 2 weeks later we agreed to talk. We didn't. He was too scared I'd break up with him.
All I wanted was him back in my arms. I knew it was stupid, but he wanted the break, so I thought he wanted me back. 
Now he doesn't know if he wants me back. It's been 2 weeks since we were supposed to talk. Whenever he calls me we fight and cry. I feel he doesn't care. He doesn't want to see me. He says he wants to get back together, but he says no whenever I ask if we are going to. 

I feel played. Manipulated. I wanted out, but I worked on my feelings and myself to be able to get back with him at his bequest. Now all I want is him. I still love him deeply.

But he won't have me. He says he still loves me, still cares, but he won't take me back. He claims I don't deserve another chance, and that I shouldn't talk to him, give him space. But I feel like if I do that he'll leave and never come back. 

Why do I want him? What should I do?"

(excuse me if my site seems far more cocky about my design skills than I really am, I don't think I'd have much chance with finding clients/an internship if I mention that I am a total newbie)

Anyway, heres where I need help!

Though I got most of the site to resize through mediaqueries I can't figure out how to get the text input areas on the contact form to resize and thus I sloppily applied an overflow:hidden at the smallest window size (480px). 
Related: the contact box as a whole isn't resizing as small as I would like it too (im 90 percent sure Im just forgetting to declare something in the mediaqueries). Any idea?

When viewed on a browser that doesn't support @font-face the design breaks horribly. Im not one hundred percent sure why, but it appears guilder is much smaller and more condensed than the fallback font (arial narrow), this may be a super newbie question, but is there a solution to this that doesn't involve me using alternative type (or setting each instance of that typeface as an image)? also, I've got my website to show these typefaces as far back as IE6, is there any significant browser share that would use the fallback font anyway?

I know the blog link is a little awkward as it renders that other nav links useless, I plan on cleaning that up soon. I think thats one of the bigger problems in my site currently, are there other major things you would suggest I do to my site?'

Thanks guys!"
q5b93,23,2012-02-25,"I've been straight-ish my whole life, but suddenly find myself desperately wanting a girlfriend. Confusion! Help?",PixelatedMouse,bisexual,https://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/q5b93/ive_been_straightish_my_whole_life_but_suddenly/,"This is my first real Reddit post, and I have no experience with any of this, so please be gentle with me. 

  I'm 20 and I live in Los Angeles. I've been pretty much straight my whole life. I've always found girls attractive, and I find myself checking them out sometimes, but not the way I check out guys (not necessarily in a sexual way, although I do often notice their bodies). I've only ever had boyfriends, and the most I've ever done with a girl is kissed one. I've had two serious, long term relationships with boys. One I dated for two and a half years, one for one and a half. Both times I've been potentially open to a threesome with another girl, or at least liked the thought of it, and both times after the breakup I've found myself considering the possibility of a girlfriend. After the first breakup, I was going to Mills college in Oakland, which is an all girls school, and so I was considering a girlfriend for that reason. Now however, I'm back in Los Angeles and am leaving for Berlin in a few weeks for a paid internship. I went through a breakup about two months ago (I think), and although I've slept with a few guys, I haven't really wanted to or been seriously interested in anyone since the breakup. I've just been trying to force myself into liking someone, because I feel like that's the norm for me I think.

  A week or two before Valentine's day, I started thinking about a great date to take a girl on. I joked about it for a second in my head, kind of planning it out, and then I thought ""I'd love to take a girl out on a date like that. I'd be the best boyfriend ever!"". I know that is incredibly dumb, and that a lesbian relationship doesn't have a boyfriend and girlfriend dynamic, but somehow I fixated on that idea. I'm not sure why, but I feel like I should say this. I'm very girly. I wear heels everywhere, I giggle, and I typically like my boyfriends to be the dominant ones. I love being a girl and don't want to be anything else. Somehow, though, I seem to be thinking more and more that I would make a fantastic boyfriend, for lack of a better term. I've been thinking that I'd love to be the dominant one sexually, and that I'd love to dote on a girl and take her out and do sweet and lovely things with her. 

  I initially thought it was just that, and that I wasn't really sexually attracted to girls. That maybe it was just that I don't think I could ever be attracted to a submissive boy, so I was just switching teams for that idea. I've always thought of myself as only liking girls in my head, and even then only above the waist. As I've started thinking this over, however, I've started having these fantasies. I think of having a girlfriend, and all the things I could do with her and to her. I imagine being dominant in bed, and with a girl specifically, and it actually interests me. A lot. Instead of fantasizing about boys, I now fantasize about kissing a girl, pressing her up against a wall, feeling her chest against mine (maybe doing some other things, but I'll stop there for your sakes).

  I just have no idea what to make of this. I'd love to try a girlfriend, but I have no idea if I'm actually interested in girls or not because I just have this fantasy, this idea, and no real experience. I don't want to experiment on someone and then find out I'm straight. In fact, I don't want to use anyone as an experiment at all. That seems so horrible, especially because I feel like everyone else pretty much knows what their sexuality is by now, and it feels to me like I'm mocking people who are actually bi or lesbian by just trying it out to see if it fits. There's the huge chance that I'm just fixated on this idea in my head and that in reality I'm actually totally straight. Then again, I was never able to find guys sexually attractive until I had had a positive sexual experience with one. 

  I'm not sure I'll be able to figure this out  unless I try, and I desperately want to try. Which brings me to my next problem. I'm sure no girl wants to fool around with and/or date a straight girl, especially one that has no sexual experience with other girls. I wouldn't even know where to start, really. I mean obviously I know how my own body works, but I can't help feeling there's a bit more to lesbian sex than that (you know, just a bit). On top of all that, I don't know how to pick up girls, and I have no idea if I'm attractive to other women. I get in to bars all the time, and someone suggested that I try a lesbian bar, but I don't know if that's how this works. I just feel so clueless and inexperienced, and I'm completely confused. I especially don't want to hurt anyone, or demean anyone by being some dumb little straight girl who thinks she likes girls for half a second and then finds out she doesn't really. Help? Please?

(Also, sorry for the giant wall of text and the shitty writing. It is late at night, and i had a lot to say, but I'm being horribly inarticulate. I'm so much better with words when I'm speaking them.)"
q5898,2,2012-02-25,Strange Internship Dilemma,ragstoriches918,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/q5898/strange_internship_dilemma/,"Hi Reddit, this is my first post on the site ever!

So here's the dilemma:

My college is on the quarter system which gives us the flexibility to take quarters off as we see fit.  I am scheduled to take the upcoming spring and summer terms off interning.  

I have been extremely fortunate to have already accepted two internship offers: Company A for the spring term, and Company B for the summer term.  However, just today, I received an offer from Company C, and this really is my dream internship.  

So, I want to do an internship at Company C in the summer, but want to find some way to push back the start date of Company B's internship to the spring.  This would mean Company A gets the ax.

How can I go about making these changes without hurting anyone's feelings/getting blacklisted?  

Thank you all so much!"

q6yex,6,2012-02-26,"Ladies of Reddit, I could use some help. I just found out my fiance (4 years together) cheated on me - bad - 2 years ago while on a trip overseas. What are the chances we can stay together given the circumstances?",Sorry_Dude,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/q6yex/ladies_of_reddit_i_could_use_some_help_i_just/,"I'm crushed. We were in a good place. I'd like it to work out, but recidivism on these sort of thing is damn near 100%, right? 

Back story: Two years ago, she graduated college and got a 2-week internship in Southeast Asia. She stayed for 6 weeks (against my wishes) and while there convinced me to fly out and meet her. Before I got the chance near the end of her trip, she was robbed and came home before my flight left. By chance, my trip was cancelled. 

I suspected strongly she was cheating on me with one or more guys, but certainly one, while over there. I also figured it was more than a one-night stand because his salacious messages on her on her FB wall quickly disappeared. 

The inquiry: During her trip, I suspected something was going on. All the signs were there. I begged her to tell me and she insisted I was being jealous etc. After her trip I basically found out, but without hard evidence, all I could do is ask her to tell me the truth and let the chips fall. She insisted nothing happened. I had asked her while she was abroad, specifically, if I was flying out and going to find her with a new boyfriend? She lied. I tried to believe her. I'm reasonable and forgiving, but not totally stupid. Later, getting insecure from time to time about this, I begged her for the truth so we could move on. 
She lied to my face without hesitation, total denial, maybe 10 times between 2010-2012. 

Despite my concerns our relationship did well. We got counseling. I was told my fears were normal but unfair. I needed to trust her and so I did. I began to trust her again. We got engaged. Our families are very close and she and I live together and run a business together. 

Fast forward to January 2012. She left on vacation again, this time to Central America for 20 days without my blessing. With her dad. I wanted to go with, but work wouldn't allow me the time off until April. Her dad had to go on vacation in Jan/Feb, so I was left at home.

The Discovery: I was cleaning the house in preparation of her arrival home. In the living room on the floor - plain sight - I found a black berry with Thai writing on the keys. Never seen it before. I honestly tried not to look - for 1.5 seconds. Then loneliness and curiosity got the best of me. 

The Details: She was carrying on a relationship the whole time she was gone. Fully - banging this guy, maybe more, but one over and over, maybe 20 times in 40 days. She was texting him salacious stuff. 100% guilty. Between messages about how excited she was to have sex with him later, she texted me that she was thrilled I was coming to meet her. My messages to and from her were dispersed through a sickening lattice of adulterous text messages that are hard to forget. 

So now she's coming home in 2 days. It's her birthday the day she gets home. I confronted her on the phone and she says she's sorry. She's devastated. It was the only time. She's been keeping some contact with the guy, Jonathan, through Facebook since then, she admitted, but not regularly. She's so sorry. She says she was in a bad place then and now were good and she want's to have my babies. ETC. 

So...

What should I do. I love/loved her. Dearly. I was all in with her. But this hurts.

  
tl;dr: Fiance cheated on me and lied about it repeatedly for two years after until she was straight busted. Any chance of salvage or is this sort of thing game over?  
   



**UPDATE: she's going to read this thread again in a few hours. If anyone has anything to add to her that might help, it would be most appreciated**

[¿ What scarred you for life?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uxs6t?context=5)|The one thing I will NEVER forget is a young girl who hung around on the weekends.  I had a suspicion that she was younger than 18 but she claimed she was 18.  When I asked to see her ID, she showed it to me and it looked legit (holograms and what not) and said she was 18.  I come in one weekend and ask where she is because she was not around.  It turns out she was a runaway who got sucked into the sex trade which is rampant in Ohio and was shipped down to Columbus.  Guys were passing her around upstairs for 10 bucks a pop.  She was 14.    I felt fucking horrible for not trusting my gut. I guess I will tell you something else since I already posted something about a young girl who was a a runaway and was passed from guy to guy for 10 dollars a pop.  Another instance involved another prostitute.  She was legit mentally handicapped, could barely function.  She started showing up towards the end of my time there.  She was passed around as well but I believe her rate was 5 for sex.  Apparently she was having a heart attack and a guy just put her in the elevator and pressed the down button so she would come to the lobby.  The elevator opened and she was obviously in need of help.  I laid her down and called an ambulance.  It turned out it wasn't a heart attack but she turned out to be alright and showed back up later that night.
[Since when is the sex trade rampant in Ohio?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uyh9v?context=5)|Toledo is a huge hub for interstate human trafficking.  I will find some stats if I get a chance.  I'm not insulting Ohio, it is just that you can get to somewhere like 75% of the country within 24 hours from Ohio. http://www.examiner.com/women-s-issues-in-toledo/recent-study-cites-toledo-as-fourth-worst-city-nationally-for-human-trafficking-offenses.
[Did you make friends with any of the people there and what did they think of you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uxv69?context=5)|Oh yea of course.  There were about 150-200 residents there. I tried my best to help everyone.  When I first showed up they thought I was a cop because I was white.  There was a guy James who would come and mop the lobby every night at 3 AMish.  We built a pretty strong bond.  I helped him make a resume and he eventually got a job because of it.  I found out that he had never eaten out at a breakfast restaurant so I took him to breakfast one morning after I got off and he had a blast.  The funny thing was he ordered a burger and fries for breakfast.  There were plenty of people I made friends with they were usually older than me though.
[What can you tell us about your views on systemic problems? That is, on a macro scale, what problems do you see with the overall system (i.e., the governmental response to poverty via the policing system/war on drugs, welfare system, social services, education, etc) that have impacted the lives of people where you work? Do you have a sense of what changes could be made to improve these people's lives over the long-term?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uyixj?context=5)|As with anything else on the macro scale it all comes down to money.  These residents cant afford to pay 1000+ dollars of rent every month so they are ignored.  Columbus is also trying to gentrify the west side where these projects are so they are in talks to blow this building up because they dont make money off of it.  The police really could give two shits about this place.  I called the police plenty of times and it would take them an hour or more to show up. That's what pissed me off the most.  They would show up, write things down and leave.  Even if we had video footage they would say that a detective would be there Monday to investigate and the detective would never come. This happened twice. If you do not have money you are fucked. The fucked up thing is that say a person who is paying 20 bucks a month in rent gets a job.  Their rent immediately goes up to about 460 dollars a month.  Most jobs residents got were minimum wage so how are you supposed to work you way out of the system when the system keeps taking any money that a person makes. I do not see a wide spread change such as tearing the building down and giving residents housing assistance working for everyone.  I talked to residents all the time about how life could get better and it seemed like a more micro approach would work.
[460 dollars a month? I live in Columbus and that's more than I pay... Is that comparable to other apartments in the neighborhood?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3v4sn4?context=5)|I am not sure.  From what I saw while I was driving around that part of town there are not too many other apartments.  The location is ideal though.  Downtown Columbus is a half mile away.  Like I said rent was on a sliding scale, however I did not dig deeper into how they decided those rates.
[Did anyone ever lie about if they had a job to keep their rent down?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3v0mx5?context=5)|Yea...I even advised a few to do so...
[What was the racial makeup of the residents?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uy620?context=5)|Racial makeup=80% black, 19% white, and two mexican guys.
[Was there ever a time where you saw someone being treated unfairly or being taken advantage of because of race, age, ethnicity, etc? If you saw this, did you ever feel compelled to do something about it? Could you have done something about it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uxsz6?context=5)|The Housing Authority (CMHA) really treated these people like dog shit.  Most residents barely paid rent. Rent is paid on a sliding scale so some residents paid like 20 bucks a month but that might have been 50% of their net worth.  Anytime ANYTHING went wrong in their apartments (flooding, heat not working in the middle of winter, AC not working in older residents apts in the summer) residents had to wait until monday.  I did my best to hound them until they sent someone out.  Sending someone out meant paying overtime and they were too cheap for that.  Maybe three times they sent someone out in the year I was there.  I tried to help and have basic mechanical skills but I am limited in my abilities to help.
[So you saw a lot of misery. But with 150-200 people there, and you with a (remarkably) open compassionate attitude, I'm guessing you also saw some good people trying hard to make good lives. Can you recall some things that *pleasantly* surprised you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uyc7q?context=5)|Oh yea there were plenty of people who just had slipped in life and they were working hard as fuck to make it back in their lives and when bad shit happened to them I just felt horrible because I knew they were working.  One big success story was that guy James who mopped the floors, he helped out anyway he could around the building.  Whenever pipes would burst he would be there to mop up the floor and put buckets down.  He would wash and wax floors. He got back on his feet. Got a job. And because of all of the work her put in around the building the building manager actually paid his rent for a year. I would say 2/3 of the residents were hard working people who either were injured or just kept fucking up and ended up there.
[What was the most dangerous situation you were put in?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uxt1v?context=5)|There were plenty of times I had to defend myself.  One time in particular a couple was walking into the lobby to go up to their apartment.  Another couple came up behind them (who did not live there) and tried to snatch the ladies purse and beat up the guy.  I hopped over the desk and had to ""L"" the one guy out until he agreed to leave.  I saw his lady Friend reach into her purse and pull out a knife at which point I let them go.  They left and I called the police.  I believe they were caught later.  I HATE bullies and to see that just pissed me off.
[What is ""L""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uymlg?context=5)|It is a choke hold.  Looks almost like a sleeper hold.  One arm goes across the throat and the other one behind the head.  It immediately shuts off the airway.
[""L""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uynmg?context=5)|Sorry it must be something we called it growing up.
[Kill niggers.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uzo1t?context=5)|The funny thing is, the couple who was doing the robbing was white..
[What? o.o.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uyp06?context=5)|I explained it above, it was a chokehold. I am sure it has many names.
[Its a TJ Strongbow lol.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uyzka?context=5)|Styx is the Gweatest Amerwican Wock Band, and the only Weason they caught a bad Wap was cuz most critics were cynical Assholes.
[*cwitics.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3v0cow?context=5)|Damn autocorrect.
[What was the biggest moral decision you had to make there? and how great was the racial tension between you and the majority black population there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uyb5t?context=5)|Moral decision....that is a tough one.  I would say always just trying to remain unbias no matter how shitty a particular resident had treated me.  I  was threatened pretty much on a weekly basis. I just brushed it off.  But the next week they would usually be apologetic (and sober) and would ask for some kind of help.  There wasn't too much racial tension. It wasn't like they hated me because I was white.  Once they got to know me and realized I had grown up in Baltimore and was not just some rich ohio state student they started to accept me. However I was called ""cracker"" and ""honky"" on a regular basis and I had to explain to them that this wasn't ""the jeffersons"" and those words dont sting anymore.
[What was the craziest thing you saw?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uxrxn?context=5)|There are a lot.  I wouldn't say this was the craziest.  I mentioned my craziest in a previous post.  A particular resident was really off the hook.  Let's call him E.  He was addicted to crack and would wander the streets all night and just steal from people (how this guy survived this is beyond me) but he would show up every night with a cart full of stolen goods/shit he found in the dumpster and try to sell it to me.  I started calling him Bubbles but he didnt get the reference. The craziest thing was probably this twenty something year old guy who had alot of women in and out of his apt.  One day during the day shift (I wasnt there but saw on camera later) a girl came and started arguing with him in the lobby.  He beat her within an inch of her life.  Closed fist punches and everything.  Once she was on the ground he booted her right in the jaw.  Teeth and blood were everywhere.  When I had gotten to work I noticed the stain and asked the working second shift what that was and he said it was the womans blood.
[""He just waltzes in there, and becomes the king of the carts. What the fuck does he think I'm supposed to do? ""](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uy85j?context=5)|Yea man I am from Baltimore, so any chance I get to quote the wire. I take it.  I actually did a project at OSU which involved videos and references to The Wire...
[What is the story that you would most like to share with us?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uxwni?context=5)|There are plenty of stories.  There was alot of crazy stuff there.  I mentioned some already.  One story that comes to mind was with this resident nicknamed Frog.  He was hooked on crack.  Right before I left he got hooked on bath salts which is a rising craze among addicts because it doesnt show up on piss tests.  He attempted to commit suicide and almost jumped but the fire dept saved him.  While I was there two people jumped (1 survived).  Two guys died from medical reasons.  One guy died from going fishing on a boat while drunk as hell and falling in the water and did not know how to swim.  A lot of misery there.
[What do they do with bath salts and how does this get one high?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uyt1r?context=5)|Haha I am still learning tryin to figure it out.  From what I have been told you snort em and it is just like a coke high.  I hope your not gonna go out and start snorting haha, shit will fuck you up.
[Was there a housing police force that policed the area?  If not, was it just the city police force?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uxt6y?context=5)|Yea, they came by usually once a night.  But they were pretty much rent a cops even though one was cool and former Air Force.  They were not armed.  Pretty much stopped by every night around 2 AM to take a shit in the employee bathroom haha.
[&gt;One day the cop arrested CT for a humble.   Do you mean that the cop's intent was to humble CT, or is ""humble"" some kind of slang for an amount of drugs or something like that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3v1yc2?context=5)|Its slang, sorry its habit.  It means a minor misdemeanor charge (i.e. disturbing the peace etc.)
[What is the drug scene like in a project high-rise?  Is it run of the mill crack and impure heroin? Or since it's Ohio is meth a big deal?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uyv9y?context=5)|Not much meth.  Mostly crack and heroin. We had dealers come in and pay residents to move in with someone else so they could just set up shop in an apt and people would go right there.  They would usually last a couple of weeks and word would get out and they would either leave or be kicked out.  Like I said the police were useless. While I was working, there were two big drug guys everyone would go to for their shit.  One used to be a cat burglar who would pay hookers so he could go down on them (not the other way around haha), and the other was more of a stone cold dealer, never talking unless he needed too and people respected him.
[1) Did the residents ask you for money/handouts? 2) Did you ever give money to residents? 3) Ever get mugged/robbed or items stolen while on the job?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uytbv?context=5)|1.)ALL THE TIME! haha.  every night it was ""hey john, you got a dolla?"" Usually people would come with four quarters and ask for a ""hard dollar"" because the dealers didn't like change 2.) No, I would sometimes give change for a dollar if i knew they were using it for laundry 3.) No but someone did put nails under my tires so that they would go flat.  One of them did, I was lucky all four didnt.  I was careful to keep all my stuff locked up and my car within sight in the parking lot.
[&gt;Hey john, you got a dolla](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3v6av4?context=5)|I need dolla dolla....dolla is what I need.
[Did you ever have to take the witness stand in court for something that went down during your shift?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uy88q?context=5)|After that attempted robbery the columbus police took my info but I was never called.  The guy who was working during the beating of that woman was asked to be a witness but turned it down.  He was changing jobs soon and didnt want the hassle.
[Good luck, and congrats. My wife's an LISW, MSW, from OSU.  *edit* I had asked first if graduation was in June, then remembered OSU is switching to semesters, from quarters, and it all made sense. You going to go to grad school at OSU?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3v23ey?context=5)|No. I am moving back to Baltimore and going to grad school at the University of Maryland. Not at OSU.  They are still on the quarter system so technically they have 3 or 4 graduations a year.  I planned it so I graduated this quarter so I can get a jump start on getting a job.
[This is off topic but I'm thinking about joining the military to help pay for college. Are you happy with your decision to do so?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3v1soh?context=5)|I do not regret the experience.  I do regret not being more prepared to handle my recruiters.  The GI Bill was def worth it but make sure when you go in you are doing what you want to do and not what your recruiter nudges you to do.  What branch are you considering?
[&lt;3 BC.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3v1vdy?context=5)|Moi aussi.
[Did you like Seattle?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3v0qf2?context=5)|Loved it..I was a lacrosse coach on bainbridge island...I have a lot of great memories out there.
[Were the police shown the video evidence? what did they say about it? What is the reasoning behind them not making an arrest?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3v7cqr?context=5)|Yes they were shown evidence...they said I detective would be along Monday to investigate further....no detective showed up....it happened multiple times.
[Jeez.  How many justified arrests were made while you worked there in comparison to all the crime that was going on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uz6j0?context=5)|Honestly, one.  A guy named E who I compared to Bubbles from ""The Wire"" was arrested one time for selling stolen goods.  It was some shameful shit. Cops were there almost every weekend but no arrests were ever made.
[Sounds weird.. but has someone ever died while you were working?  Natural or otherwise?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uyp6l?context=5)|Oh shit...I almost forgot.  This did happen.  I think my second month working there.  A woman came in looking for her brother.  I called up to his apt but there was no answer.  She said that no matter what he always had lunch with their brother every saturday and he had not shown up or answered his phone.  I got a sinking feeling when she said that. I called the police (this had to happen for me to go into someones apt without their permission) they came and I opened the door and saw this guy laying there.  He was dead and I had to go down there and console his sister and nephew.
[Oh man, that sucks for them.  You ever find out what it was from?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uzk25?context=5)|He had heart problems.  I asked around and people told me it was a heart attack but I never saw a medical report or anything.
[So what's the solution?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uybei?context=5)|There is no solution really.  I could take it on a case by case basis but it is up to the people to want to change.  Believe it or not some people loved that existence and did nothing to better their situation no matter how much I tried to advocate for them.  They would just keep making excuses. It's sad really.
[If you had the capability, would you dust off and nuke the whole site from orbit?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uyojv?context=5)|No haha, although after some rough nights I wish I could.  I did joke that we should somehow get the drug dogs into the building for a surprise raid and I would sit outside in a lawn chair drinking beer and laugh at how many drugs are thrown out the windows..
[My dad worked at a liquor store across the street from the projects, he always had a gun on him, in plain sight did you do the same?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uygad?context=5)|No I never carried a gun.  I am pretty good with my hands (boxing, wrestling etc.).  I know the corner store workers by the projects here had a gun.  A guy came back pissed off because the store owners pulled the gun on him for apparently no reason.  I didnt believe the guy at first but I could see how distraught he was.  I felt bad for him.
[Which do you think comes first; homelessness or addiction?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uyvkj?context=5)|Addiction definately.  Most of the residents were referred there from a local shelter called the faith mission.  None of the ones I talked to that used to be homeless were clean while they were homeless.
[Sorry, read through a little bit more and wanted to ask another question.  You're from Baltimore, where the drug trade and problems with the city was much publicized by The Wire (and David Simon in general).  Then, you worked in Columbus, which I think most people would be surprised had a ghetto at all.  Anyway, do you think the publicity of Baltimore's inner city helped it?  Does Columbus struggle to get help/resources because of an out of sight/out of mind mentality?  Or, do you think it has no effect at all?  Lastly, I'm assuming you're white because of your white flight comment.  Did race play any role in how the tenants treated you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3v9hk0?context=5)|The only thing ""the wire"" helped was to open up people's eyes to a society they had no idea was 10 mins away from their fed hill rowhome.  I have not seen any reform or resources thrown to the west side of Baltimore since the wire came on the air although the ports which were focused on in season 2 seem to be doing a little better. Columbus's west side has its own reputation which is very well known.  Politicians know about it.  However right now it is going through a gentrification process.  A casino is being built and I believe 2 public housing complexes have been destroyed (dont quote me on that figure, I know of one for sure Riverside Bradley).  The projects that I worked in are scheduled for demolition but the date keeps getting pushed back so who knows.  Some resources such as section 8 housing vouchers are being thrown their way but besides that there is a long way to go.  FInally race did play a big role at first and in time that dwindled.  At first they assumed I was a cop because I was white, and then people took a long time to warm up to me which I expected.  After they realized I was not just some rich Ohio State University kid whose mommy and daddy paid for everything they warmed up to me pretty quick.  I said before that racial terms like Honky and Cracker and Whiteboy were thrown around but they never affected me.
[So, I notice a lot of negative questions, which is normal, but as someone who spent  years living in and around the projects I always was impressed by the underground economics of the place.  The residents are seriously very ingenuitive and find interesting ways to make money (fixing things that are FUBAR, getting ppl. free cable, making homemade meals for lunch etc...).  What are some interesting ways you saw people making money?  Also, as far as gangs go, did you notice the gangs and other organizations helping to police the community, or in your eyes were just making everything worse?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3v9dd6?context=5)|Oh many the economy of the projects was amazing.  You nailed it.  People would make money doing anything.  Some people would clean your apartment.  There was one guy who would fix your car, another who would wash it.  Women would do your hair.  One sign I saw hung up offered to actually bathe people (this included a foot scrub and cleaning behind the neck haha).  There was always a way for people to make money. As far as gangs go, there was not too much activity in the actual project.  Dealers were there, however gangs were not their muscle at least in the building.  In the surrounding communities they were active.  However the dealers did try to help the residents.  They bought a TV for the lounge area, they would order the boxing fights and throw parties, and they would order pizza for random people and sometimes even pay peoples rent.  However if you got in debt to the dealers you better believe you would do your damndest to pay them back.  As long as you were on their good side you were fine.  However, I have digressed.  To your question of self policing, most of the time this is what happened.  People would fuck up and others would either help or punish whoever was involved.  Police were called quite often but it was mostly for minor squabbles. I hope I answered your question.
[Did any of the statues or props in the inner city houses come to life overnight?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uzfq6?context=5)|Naaa I dont think the golden tablet was there...probably stolen by one of the fiends and pawned.
[To my knowledge there is really only one true high rise projects in Columbus, by osu east? Is this where you worked?  Assuming you went to osu, how would you compare where you worked to the section 8 around campus?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3v1cg3?context=5)|The one I worked at u can see it from 315. It is called sunshine terrace. I'm not sure if there are others..its on the westside by mt carmel west. I did not hang out too much by the on campus housing I live up in Dublin. So I can't compare.
[Also a question. ive done work with at-risk kids in these kinds of projects.   Are there any programs in place by you to help keep the kids off the streets, and out of the whole poverty cycle?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uzhoi?context=5)|There were not any kids in these projects except for maybe those that visited on weekends.  We had one little guy call 911 and hang up in the lobby and all kids of cops and fire engines showed up.  I do work with at risk youth at my internship and there are alot of programs to help them get off the streets.  Two are LiFE Sports and Camp Mary Orton's Wilderness bond program.  Both can be found online..
[Why is it relevant that you're white?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3v4w1e?context=5)|Its not.  I was just putting it in the title to get people's attention...it worked.
[Did you ever have any homo erotic experiences with any of the people that lived there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3v07xm?context=5)|Aaaaaaalllllll the time....jjjjjuuusssstttt kkiidddiiinngg....there wasnt too much man love but I knew for sure three gay guys who lived there....its not exactly the most welcoming demographic.
[Were there any kids growing up there?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3v6d84?context=5)|No..kids would visit on the weekends and stuff but there were no kids living there.
[Mine is.....](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3uzctz?context=5)|Nice...just recently discovered the band I love their shit. Although you could be a Dicken's lover haha.
[Why did you feel the need to call out that you are white?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/q5qco/iama_white_guy_who_worked_the_overnight_shift/c3v18kz?context=5)|Gotta be honest on this one.  It was kind of a big deal with people around here knowing that I was a white guy working in a predominately black housing project.  I could care less either way but it was just habit I suppose..

I'm extremely willing and able to teach myself the skills needed for a project and would be willing to accept local or remote work.  I'm mostly looking for any industry experience, being a possible non-paid internship or simple project.

q627d,3,2012-02-25,The pain of an EET major.,ChristianCMcKay,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/q627d/the_pain_of_an_eet_major/,"A few months back I got my AA in Electronics Engineering Tech.  I'm currently working on a 4 year, but just because I know I'll need experience, I start looking for jobs.  Hoping to get something in my field with an employer who would understand that I'm in college and will have to have my school hours off.  That would be kind of nice.  I could get some experience and make some money doing something in my field.

I start looking online to see what I can find in the area.  Nothing.  No job for 50 miles.  I finally think to myself, ""kinda sucks, man.  Maybe I can find some kind of paid internship or something then.""  After a few days of searching for that, I find nothing.  No paid internships.  No unpaid internships for a 100 mile radius of my area, not that I could drive that much in my car anyway.  It's old and the engine has to be at 4,000 RPM's to do 70.  Not the best of ideas in a 23 year old car with over 200,000 miles on it.

So as if that's not enough, lets get on to actual school.  At my old school, the EET program was so heavily underbudgeted that my first semester there, I had to fix the trainers.  Not to mention that the program turned out to be such a joke that there were people graduating that didn't understand how to wire up potentiometers.  Not through fault of the teachers, either.  Every time some kid ends up not knowing anything and fails a test, he goes and bitches to the dean of students who was more than happy to talk the teachers into giving away passing grades.  I did alright in the program though.  Friends with the teachers there.  I was a TA for one of them.  He retired after having been a control engineer for almost his whole life, and is the reason I want to go into control engineering.  However at this point, it's starting to look like just anything in the field will be a godsend.

That being said though, there were certain things I didn't learn at this school, not because I couldn't, but because it wasn't taught due to the incredibly low bar.  Things that I didn't know I needed to know.  Now that I'm in a university, the bar has been raised significantly, and I'm trying to catch up.  That's okay though.  I'm going to be okay there.  It's just a tough catching up process.

So I'm in school, looking to make some money and my options have been reduced to unpaid internship when I left off.  It's not making money but at least it will get me that pesky experience thing that all employers keep asking for on entry level jobs.  It's an investment.  Well I can't get it still.  There's not one.  So what are my options down to?  I applied to work at Autozone yesterday.  The same job I applied for in high school.  I also looked into TA jobs for first and second year EET courses since I had already done that and was damn good at it, but the only way anyone knows to contact the guy in charge of that is on e-mail and he never answered mine.  I could go flip burgers, but it kind of stings to know that I graduated college having been on the Deans list 3 of 5 semesters and used what I learned to work in food service.

And who do you talk to about feeling that way?  My dad things I shouldn't even bother working because it will take away a lot of time from school.  My mom won't talk to me because she's afraid I'm going to ask for money to pay for school.  My girlfriend works two jobs and is in college.  She works harder than anyone I know and whenever I try to talk about it to her she takes it to mean that I'm insulting what she does and how much she gets paid, which I'm not.  Society has started their deal about how even as a college graduate, you shouldn't feel like you're too good to flip burgers.  I hate to say this too, because it makes me feel pretentious, but I do feel like I'm too good to flip burgers.  I have a skill that I worked really hard to learn and spent the last few years of my life trying to be great at.  I was always told I had to go to college to avoid this exact thing.

So who do I talk to about my problems?  I talk to you, Reddit.  Out of everything else in my life, writing these rants about my life and what a waste it seems to have been up until this point gives me my only serenity.  Thank you for listening.


**Tl;Dr** I feel like my AA degree isn't worth the paper it was printed on, and I'm ranting.  Reddit is the only place I can do it."
q8uqd,11,2012-02-27,Breaking into the ECE field,unspokenToken,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/q8uqd/breaking_into_the_ece_field/,"I hope this is an appropriate subreddit for this kind of question. I am graduating soon with a degree in Computer (and Electrical) Engineering from a Candian University. I have no real internship experience and have worked as a programmer for the past few summers. I really want a career in embedded systems development, so for the past two years I have been playing with micro controllers in my spare time.  Unfortunately, I can not find any work in the field of ECE, and out of desperation I have accepted a job as a Java developer for a small software company. 

After the initial relief of getting a job, I realized that my engineering career just went down the drain. Might as well burn my degree and melt my iron ring. My friends have tried to comfort me by saying that ``experience is experience'', but I'm not convinced. Do I need to look into going back to school? I can't find a grad program that I think will benefit me. In the opinion of an experienced embedded engineer, would you consider hiring someone with a B.S. in ECE (with some spare-time projects) and a few years of on-the job experience in Java programming (sigh). I've heard that the US is the mecca for Electrical Engineers; Should I look into moving to the US? Would an M.S. from a US University help?

tl;dr: Got degree in ECE. Good GPA, extra-curriculars. Can't find job in ECE. Accepted job as a Java developer, but really want to work in embedded systems."

I'm in this space of ""I screwed everything up"" and ""this isn't how things were supposed to be"" without knowing how to move past it. It's paralyzing. Potential long story ahead.


I was the definition of over achieving growing up. I started university in a program that only took 50 students and required a very high GPA to enter the program and to stay there. I got through alright, but by the end of my first year, things were not going well. I was depressed, not sleeping, and having panic attacks. I went home for the summer, got some Zoloft, and seemed to be back on track. In retrospect I spent most of that summer in hypomania, although I'd give anything to be back at that level.


I start my second year and before I've even finished my first week of classes, I'm off the rails manic/psychotic. It was humiliating. My residence put me on behavioral probation. I fell behind in my classes and fell into a deep, near suicidal depression, sleeping, skipping class, crying, and drinking myself sick. Though I had seen a few different doctors and a therapist, no one suggested that I be treated for bipolar or even that I stop the anti-depressants. I finished second year with a C average and repeated 2 courses over the summer. I was out of my enriched program, obviously, and I had a lot of catching up to do if I was going to bring up my GPA in 3rd year. 


Every year after that I told myself that I would do better this time around, and make up for everything that I had done wrong. I got better but I've never fully ""recovered"". In my last semester of 4th year, knowing I wouldn't graduate without coming back full time for a 5th year, I burned out and nearly quit school altogether. I got a good doctor over the summer and entered my 5th year because I didn't know what else to do. 


That year went better, all things considered. I got Bs in most of my courses with the help of my Dr., academic counselors and the disabilities office. I was on and off medications constantly through that year to try and get the right dosing, so I was often drowsy or physically ill, or in a fog, which made if difficult to attend all of my classes and keep up. Luckily I was able to get extensions and accommodations when needed.


I got a BSc. and started my first job as a writer in the most awful workplace I've ever experienced. I was deeply depressed for the few months that I worked there and had frequent panic attacks and attendance issues. After 3 months of working there I moved to another city with my boyfriend and began trying to rebuild. I have been unemployed ever since - I've now been unemployed for over a year.


I had always wanted to go to graduate school, get my PhD and become a researcher. I loved my field of study (still do). I don't have the grades or references from my undergrad degree to get into any grad program. I applied to the near by university to take courses as a non-degree student in hopes of upgrading for grad school, but was told I didn't have a high enough GPA to even upgrade at their school. 


It's hard to find a job in my field with no advanced degree and mediocre references. Every day that I'm not working is another strike against me when competing for jobs. I am considering trying to find a volunteer position but am so anxious and lacking in self esteem that I am afraid to even talk to anyone about it. I can't sell myself to potential employers because I do not believe in my abilities. I've had too much failure and humiliation over the past 6 years to have much confidence.


I'm angry at myself because when I should have been getting good grades, building relationships with professors, finding volunteer positions and applying for internships, I was fighting just to get by day to day. Now all of those opportunities are behind me and I feel like I'm in limbo.

And I'm angry at the money that I have cost my family in medication, therapy, repeating courses, extra time in school, time spent unemployed, etc... when they have been supporting me. I don't know how to let go of this either.


tl;dr: About to turn 25, going nowhere. Angry and unsure what to do next.

I'm really sorry about the length. I've wanted to get this stuff out for a while and haven't known how."

I didn't have any internships or co-ops during school and I've had little success in my job search selling myself on my coursework alone, so I thought I'd explore the internship angle to make myself more marketable to employers. 

 - I received my Engineer in Training certification in Maryland after one attempt.
 - I have some experience with Pro Engineer and Solidworks through a class, and I've used MATLAB for various purposes and classes. Other programs I've used are LabVIEW and Fluent/Gambit. 
 - I have done some programming in C++ for a couple classes, as well as HTML and JavaScript just for fun in my high school days. I wouldn't say I'm an expert coder by any means but I am comfortable with programming. I've always generally been glued to a computer so I know my way around them and I can easily figure out anything I don't know.
 - I've worked on several class teams ranging in number from two to six people and in purpose from weekly laboratory experiments to semester-long projects. I get along well with people and have plenty of experience putting together technical reports.

I have been employed at a sports and fitness facility as a lifeguard since 2005, and was promoted to pool manager in 2010. 

My main responsibilities are to maintain proper water balance in the pools and spa and to ensure a safe environment through consistent enforcement of rules and timely and effective response to emergencies. 

I also supervise an average of 10 lifeguards, customer service representatives and maintenance staff.
The pool sees a lot of traffic and I interact with people of all ages and from a wide variety of backgrounds.

I'm not exactly sure what I want to do in the engineering world, but I am generally more interested in testing and evaluation (or research), product development and possibly maintenance roles. I am, however, certainly open to other possibilities. I am generally introspective which lends to strong analytical and evaluation skills as well as creative problem solving and a penchant for seeing the ""big picture."" 

I'd prefer to stay within about an hour from the Baltimore area."

I guess this will be the first post on here, so wish me luck!

I am currently in my 3rd year studying Electrical and Computer Engineering at CU Boulder.

I am very excited to be looking for an internship for this summer.  I currently live in Boulder, but my lease is up in May, so I am completely free to move. In fact, I love to travel, and I have never lived anywhere outside of Colorado so the prospect of moving out of state for an internship is actually quite exciting. 

Anyway, I am looking for hardware or software internships. I have experience in C/C++, Java, Android, Arduino, Nios II, ARM M0, and soon a bit of MIPS.  

I am confident using MatLab, Mathematica, LTSpice, SolidWorks, Emacs, and Eclipse.

By may, I will also have completed all my required analog analysis and design classes including microelectronics.

I am currently enrolled in a digital design lab in which we are linking the ARM M0 board to an Android app via Bluetooth and I have been enjoying it greatly. This tells me that embedded design might be my specific area of interest.

Other than engineering, I love music passionately. It would be amazing to get work in digital audio systems, although I do not really know where to look.  I love to ski, bike, and read books. Pretty standard Colorado behavior I suppose.

I would love to find a company that values creativity and passion, as I think they are my strongest traits. I really do love working with technology, and I think there is a beauty well designed tech.  I am hoping to find a place where I can help create something I am really proud of. 

If I sound like I might be a good fit. Please PM me for Resume, Cover Letter, References, etc... and I will surely provide in a timely manner. 

Hope to hear from you, and thank you for your time!

q87i1,11,2012-02-27,"My mom is diagnosed with severe depression, what can I do to help her?",blackhawknl,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/q87i1/my_mom_is_diagnosed_with_severe_depression_what/,"So my mom is diagnosed with depression she got from a burnout working at a doctors clinic as an assistant. She's been walking around with it for the last 5 years and went trough therapy, medication and the like. 

At the moment she receives Electro Shock Therapy. This means that she has to go under treatment twice a week, where they apply little pads or something (don't know how to call it in English) to her head and shock her brain whilst under narcosis. 

This treatment has severe side effects to her brain meaning that her short term memory is totally gone. Dory from Finding Nemo describes the current situaton the best and I'm not kidding. She asked me 3 times in the time span of 5 minutes if I liked my current internship at the IT company. And everytime when she comes home from the hospital it's always the same. She will tell me what she ate whilst in the hospital and that the staff there is very nice to her and so on...


My question is as follows: What can I do to help my mother deal with this, or to improve her recovery?


I try to help her with this situation by being very tolerant of the things she says and does. Doing my chores, talking with her and trying to get her to open up. She is very introvert with her feelings because she thinks people won't understand the things she is going through right now. This also presents a problem for the people working at the hospital. She has to mention when she's feeling down or insecure so that they can help her and monitor her progress.

But my dad is a different story. He's not the best at dealing with things like this so he is always joking about how she forgets stuff and impersonates her when we're eating dinner etc.

I think my dad isn't making things better for my mom as she is already having a very hard time dealing with this depression. I feel my dad is actually making it worse for my mom.

Can anyone here on reddit, who may have been through the same problems with a relative or a close friend, help me and my mom getting through hers?

**Edit:**
_____________________________________________________________________________________
Thanks for all the kind answers my fellow redditors. I really appreciate all the help i've gotten so far.
Just to clarify things, my mother does not have suicidal tendencies. The main thing here is that she is extremely occupied by thoughts and such. She has become very introvert and sees going to the supermarket or gas station to get cigarettes as an enormous task. Same thing for going to church. Everything she has to do besides staying indoor is seen as a task. She is affraid to run into fermiliar people, having to explain them how she is doing and the like.

Also, my mother ""hurts"" herself unknowingly. To be more precise, my mother used to pick the rims of her fingernails. I don't know how to properly explain that but in stead of biting nails, she bites her fingernail-rims. (I also have this tick). But ever since she was depressed, she started to rub her thumb on her lower arm, producing rug burn marks on her arm. Because of this, she became even more insecure because she doesn't want people to see this and think: ""Oh wow that's weird!"" or something like that. Even to the medical staff that have seen this sort of thing many times. We tell her to stop when she is scratching or rubbing her arm again, but since she has very short/no short memory at all, it doesn't stick. She won't listen or remember.

If there are any questions, or you want me to clarify things, please comment and I will try my best to explain.

Thanks again reddit!"
q7wew,0,2012-02-27,Learning Multivariable Calc?,canas15,math,https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/q7wew/learning_multivariable_calc/,"So, third year undergrad. Long story, but the honors sequence in my college doesn't really cover multivariable calc and diffyq- We're supposed to cover multivariable analysis and then do differential geometry. My year, the material got changed around (measure theory instead of multivariable calc...), but we still did differential geometry anyway, learning the ""kinda-basics"" as we needed to.

This hasn't been a problem until now. I'm doing an internship this summer in which people seem to like math a lot. This may include calculating things like gradients which I have little idea about: what are some good resources for a somewhat advanced undergrad who just happens to have a small gap around where multivariable calculus should be? I've got a couple of weeks to study before my internship begins, so I've got time to study. Also, books would be preferable to sites since I might be out of country and in a location with pretty cruddy internet.

Thanks guys!

P.S.: Yeah, I know, it's embarrassing not to know basic multi-var. But we literally didn't cover it since pure math people really don't like these kinds of messy things, apparently. 

Also, as a quick note, stuff which would help me build some computational comfort would be nice (aka not ALL theory please, although some proofs will not be completely unwelcome). I was thinking of Spivak's manifolds initially because it's such an oh so nice small book, but I'm not sure it does that :/. Also I'm kinda traumatized by his introduction to differential geometry book. Because that thing is scary. "
q7w1j,0,2012-02-27,My boyfriend just broke up with me via text at midnight on the eve of a series of stressful events. What's one of the most inconvenient break ups you have been through?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/q7w1j/my_boyfriend_just_broke_up_with_me_via_text_at/,"I'm sure this has done a million times, but I just needed to vent. I have been stressed out for a matter of months because of a series of major events in my life. Focusing that down to the past three, my grandmother just passed away in January and I wasn't able to spend much time with her before she died. I was busy working a full time job, going to school full time, and participating in an internship that had the promise of becoming a full time job. 

I've been dating my boyfriend since the middle of November. He is my coworker and I was hesitant to start a relationship with him for a myriad of reasons. We finally decided to be serious after about a month or so of fooling around and having fun. I haven't had more than a day off from work, my school, and my internship in over two and a half months. I haven't had more than two days off of work or school in about a year. I am wearing a little thin. 

This quarter also just happens to be one of the hardest quarters in school that I have ever had. For one class alone I have had two to three projects due a week. I am a graphic design student so this means full fledged projects with design briefs, concept sketches, digital roughs, the works. I ended up dropping a class and turning my internship into a class just to make things more bearable for myself.

ALL of my free time that wasn't spent doing homework I spent with my SO. I would stay late at work to spend time with him on his shift and get four or five hours of sleep just so that we could spend some quality time together. 

Three weeks ago I got offered a full time position at my internship. Two weeks ago I put in my two weeks notice at my current job. Last week for no reason at all, my boyfriend decided he wanted to take two days extra off this week because he felt like it. This ended up screwing up my schedule for my last week of work and messing up my schedule with my NEW job, because I didn't realize they would schedule me for as many shifts as they did. 

We got into our VERY FIRST fight about this on Saturday when I saw the schedule. I told him I was mad and he didn't understand why. I explained it to him and he didn't really say sorry. Then out of nowhere, he texts me tonight to tell me that he thinks I am a very pessimistic person and that I'm too emotional for him. I tell him that if he feels that way, maybe we shouldn't be together and he responds with, ""Well, if you think that's for the best""

So he broke up with me in the middle of the night, while I was working on a homework assignment for school. I also have to be at my internship at 9AM tomorrow morning and the class that my assignment is due for is tomorrow night at 5:45. I have several other huge projects coming up right now, my best friend is leaving the country for two years in two weeks and that friend also happens to be my room mate and I need to find a new place to live by the end of the month. Not to mention the fact that I still have two more days of work left at the place where my now exboyfriend works. I do not want to have to see him both of these days (and I will have to see him). This couldn't be a more inconvenient time to break my heart and trust in men. The assfucker.

TL;DR: My life is like a damn country song. Boyfriend breaks up with me, grandma dies, best friend leaves the country, have to move, and have to see boyfriend at work since he's a coworker.

So tell me Redditors, what's the most inconvenient break up you've ever been through? "

I go to school in the East Coast and just couldn't motivate myself to exercise with schoolwork etc....

Anyways, I'm taking this semester ""off"" and getting internship experience back in CA. I'm working 5 days a week, 9-6. My commute is about 1.5 hours both ways so I wake up at 7 already, have a half an hour then drive. Get home around 7:30, eat dinner and am usually ""free"" for the evening around 8:00. 

I was wondering, what is a good exercise program for somebody like me? I want to get back into shape, but I also sleep terribly at night (exercising doesn't help me usually, was sleeping just as bad when I was working out regularly) and I'm not so sure I can convince myself to get up any earlier than 6:30 to get in about 30 mins in the morning. 

Maybe working out after getting home at 7:30 before eating? I guess I'm just asking if any of you guys are in a similar working situation? Do you always have to compromise rest hours to exercise? Are there any programs that can help you get into shape with short bursts of 30 mins?

q7syg,14,2012-02-27,This weekend I put on my big boy pants and figured out if I wanted to be a trainer or just simply a man who liked playing with dogs.,Devlik,Dogtraining,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/comments/q7syg/this_weekend_i_put_on_my_big_boy_pants_and/,"I had a put up or shut up weekend with the dogs at the local shelter I donate time to. Just some back ground I am an intern with the canine behavior team at the second largest shelter in my state. I have had a good amount of experience with guardian breeds especially those that have severe behavior issues ranging from fear aggression to kennel stress to simple house breaking issues.

So one of my favorite dogs at the shelter turned into a bite case as he drew blood on an intern (not out of aggression as he would have likely been put down).

 He is now out of bite quarantine and thankfully above ground. He is however, exhibiting symptoms of major kennel stress. For those that are note familiar with this, it is the dogs slowly and quite literally going insane from the stresses of a large kennel environment (constant barking, lots of people, the cleaning process, etc are all very hard on the dogs). Pit bulls especially and most bully breeds fall victim to this as they spend more and more time in the shelter. This pit bull has already bitten one person and is going nuts. This is a major killer of these dogs in shelter environments.

So what do I do? Not just work with him in the training rooms and outside but lock myself in his kennel to give him massage and work on stress reduction with him. Helping show that his kennel is not just a place of confinement but also where happy fun times and relaxation happen. This is critical in helping reduce the stress and keeping him adoptable.

So lets recap on my brilliant choice of hobby 

* 1) Work with guardian breeds almost exclusively 
* 2) Make sure they are the breeds that can really mess you up 
* 3) Find the craziest one of the lot 
* 4) wait for them to come out of bite quarantine 
* 5) lock your self in a space smaller than your closet with them in hopes you can help make him less crazy.

Either I trust my skills and these dogs or I don't and so far I am not finding my faith lacking. However I am starting to understand rock climbers, sky drivers, and other lifestyles that are bat shit crazy on paper but rewarding and worth it in the long run."

1st part of 2011 - temporary job at unrelated company to hold me over until Sep 2011
Sept 2011 - current - job with ABC co

I liked my internship with ""ABC"", but I've since learned that I don't want to do consulting work. Too much stress, traveling, long hours, etc. Honestly, I'm pretty burned out by the job and the fact that I have no social life because I'm always working 50-80 hours a week.

I've started looking at opportunities elsewhere, but I am afraid that having 4 different positions in 3 years might make people think I am a job hopper when they're skimming my resume. It may look like it on the surface, but when you look at the details, 2 were internships, one of which lead to my current position, and 1 was a temporary job I was doing until the F/T offer became effective.

A) Graduate in May with my MechE Bachelors and go work where I interned, doing aerospace interiors (seats, lavs, etc.) Not really my area of interest at all but it is aerospace related, so maybe experience there would transfer?

B) Graduate in May and continue my job search with my experience as is, while living at home....really not hoping for this one. I've put in a ton of applications, gotten one interview which went well, but they only had one position, so I am in limbo, not rejected, but no positions to put me in.

C) Not graduate in May and spend the summer and fall finishing up the 24 or so credits for my Masters in engineering. Then find a job from there, hoping that the Masters + Bachelors + experience will push me higher up on the list for many of the jobs I am applying to.

All of this needs to be decided in the next two weeks or so. I would love to hear from anyone in the industry as to what they think might be the best course of action. One thing I kind of wrote off was applying outside of the industry, as I am very set on working in aerospace but if its a viable option to later then come back in I could look into that.

I posted a similar account of this the other day with a different throwaway account but my comment got buried with downvotes. It was in one of those ""What's your most unbelieveable sex encounter?"" threads. After 20 downvotes, I deleted it. Maybe it'll do better here, especially if I go into more detail.

When I was in college there was a girl named Tammy (not real name) who had a reputation for sleeping with anyone and everyone. She was a party girl for sure, the kind of girl who would flash for 'Girls gone Wild' (she actually did; I used to have the DVD) or make out with a female friend in front of a room full of strangers just for attention. She was totally hot. I jerked off thinking about her all the time but never had the balls to really approach her.

I was a shy loser I admit. I rarely went to parties and I barely knew her but whenever I saw her all I could about was fucking. 

During second year I met my first serious girlfriend. While I still enjoyed hearing the stories of Tammy's sexual exploits, and occasionally catching a glimpse of her on campus, I was more than happy with the love of my life, Rachel. She wasn't in Tammy's league but she was attractive. The sex was nothing crazy but it was good. I was content.

About a year ago I got my first job at a marketing firm in the downtown of a major city. Being the new guy, barely more than an intern, I did all the shit jobs (still do, mostly). Like changing the water cooler or writing the rejection letters to other applicants or attending the meetings that don't matter in any way. Those sorts of things. One of those shit jobs was to go and get coffee for the office each morning.

About three months ago I started my day as usual: texting everyone in my department to ask what kind of drinks they wanted from the Starbucks. The rule was simple: if you didn't reply, you didn't get a drink. So in other words, I always got replies.

When I got to the Starbucks I had a list of nine drinks via text and as I waited in line I tried my best to memorize each one (I hate people who take forever when placing their orders). When it was my turn at the register I looked up from my phone and was stunned to see none other than the infamous Tammy standing behind the counter.

She looked even better than I remembered her, even in that awful looking barista outfit. Long brown hair, large chest, slender body, smooth skin. She graduated a year before me and that year had been kind to her, I though, but there was sweat on her brow and a grimace on her face. Her demeanor had definitely changed, too. Back in college she'd been a queen almost. Here she was just a common worker and she was obviously stressed out and frustrated with the morning rush of customers.

She didn't recognize me at all at first. She just asked what I wanted.

I began listing the drinks. She kept telling me to slow down as she messed with the computer. Realizing she must be new and still learning the ropes I offered her my cell phone and credit card. ""Take your time. I'm in no hurry.""

She smiled for the first time once she realized I'd just made her job a whole lot easier. She gratefully took both and said, ""Thanks! I'll only be a minute.""

About fifteen minutes later she came to my table carrying a paper tray that contained all the steaming cups of coffee. After I signed the credit card receipt and handing it back to her she said, ""Do I know you from somewhere?""

My heart sort of fluttered. All thoughts of Rachel, who was still my girlfriend and actually living with, went out of my head. With shameless excitement I explained to her that we had gone to the same university. I mentioned mutual acquaintences and parties we had been to. One class we had both taken during her last year. When none of that jogged her memory I said my name was Josh Smith (not my real name) and finally she acted like we were long lost best friends.

""Oh my god, Josh! I knew it was you!"" Her lie sounded cheap but I loved it anyway. ""How have you been!?""

We chatted for a few moments and I explained where I worked, which is just down the street from where the Starbucks. She bobbed her pretty head and then told me that she was only working there as a second job. Her REAL job, supposedly, was at an art gallery. I didn't quite buy it but I smiled and nodded as I tried not to stare too much at her chest.

""Here,"" she said after a few minutes. She took my copy of the credit card receipt and wrote a phone number on the back of it. ""We should totally catch up. Give me a call, okay?""

What do we have to catch up on? I wondered. Thankfully all I said was, ""Sure!""

During work that day I realized I couldn't contact her. Doing so would be a betrayal to Rachel. I couldn't get rid of the number though. I entered it into my phone under the name of my Dentist's office instead. Just in case.

Less than a month later I decided that was the wisest thing I ever did.

q9u21,4,2012-02-28,Do people think its fair that while the law has been followed my girlfriend and I just had our holiday completely fucked?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/q9u21/do_people_think_its_fair_that_while_the_law_has/,"Here's the story. We were due to have a holiday at the Mantra Erskine Resort in Lorne (We're Australians, Lorne is a few hours drive from Melbourne) and we had a room booked for this weekend. We had been assured over a month ago when my girlfriend booked it that everything was fine. Today rocks around and at 5:00pm the hotel rings us up and tells us they had an ""IT problem"" and that the whole place has been double booked.

Now I should be fair. They did offer us a stay in another resort about an hours drive from where we had originally planned to stay. However we had planned other things in Lorne, including a massage for my girlfriend which was part of the deal with the room we had booked. However because this was booked with another company, in order to get this massage we'd have to drive for an hour just to attend the massage, and then drive back. 

They then offered a refund, as required by law but nothing else was offered. I understand that monetarily we haven't lost anything here. However, we now have no holiday destination and everywhere we look is either completely booked or far too expensive. We both have started back at University now and will not get any time off probably for another year as I will be most likely be busy throughout the middle of the year and my girlfriend has another internship planned for the same time. 

I know its very much a first world problem but we're both feeling pretty shit, especially her as she's just been completing an internship in which she has not enjoyed very much and this was going to be her reward for sticking with it. 

Do we have a right to feel a bit down or are we just whining?"

&gt;November 04, 2007

&gt;Unpaid Internships - Common but Illegal

&gt;A common, but frequently unreported labor violation is the use of unpaid interns in violation of minimum wage and possibly overtime laws.  The scenario is fairly typical: a company offers an opportunity to ‘break into the business’ in exchange for the intern working for free.  You see many examples of this in the entertainment industry.  In fact, despite jobs sites such as Craigslist prohibiting the posting of unpaid “internships,” you can almost always find one posted.  Some companies try to get around the law by requiring that the internship be part of a college program.  However, there is no exception to the law allowed just because the “intern” may receive college credit.  While it might be possible for a college credit course to require some type of training for a company, the vast majority of these internships are in violation of Federal as well as California labor laws.
&gt;
&gt;In order to qualify as an unpaid internship, the requirement is simple:  no work can be performed that is of any benefit at all to the company.  That is, you can not deliver mail, sort files, file papers, organize a person’s calendar, conduct market research, write reports, watch television shows and report on them, read scripts, schedule interviews, or any other job that assists the employer in any way in running their business.   
&gt;
&gt;Examples of internships that have been legal are where the job is a “dummy” job.  For example, there was a case of an internship for working on a train.  The company had the interns driving trains from one end of their yard to the other under close supervision.  The moving of the trains was completely unnecessary and was just being done to train the potential employees. As such, no “work” was being performed, so the internship was legal.  On the other hand, if the workers were moving the trains as part of the regular re-positioning of the trains, but were still performing it under close supervision, they would be required to be paid for the work.
&gt;
&gt;Thus, if in the entertainment industry, you read scripts that have already been read and rejected by the company and the company will not use your input in any way but is simply instructing you on how to read scripts, then they would not need to pay you for your time.  However, if you read the scripts and perform any work that is used by anyone in the company to make any type of decision about that script, then you must be paid for your time.
&gt;
&gt;Another common type of unpaid internship is in martial arts schools that require students to teach classes in order to receive additional belts.  This practice is illegal unless the student is paid for the time.  Because the act of teaching a class is work that benefits the employer, it must be paid for.   
&gt;
&gt;The U.S. Department of Labor has outlined a list of criteria that ALL must be met in order for an internship to be unpaid.
&gt;
&gt; 1. The training, even though it includes actual operation of the facilities of the employer, is similar to that which would be given in a vocational school;
&gt; 2. The training is for the benefit of the trainee;
&gt; 3. The trainees do not displace regular employees, but work under close observation;
&gt; 4. The employer that provides the training derives no immediate advantage from the activities of the trainees and on occasion the employer’s operations may actually be impeded;
&gt; 5. The trainees are not necessarily entitled to a job at the completion of the training period; and
&gt; 6. The employer and the trainee understand that the trainees are not entitled to wages for the time spent in training. 
&gt;
&gt;From the above list, #4 is really the key one – all the others will follow from whether the employer derives any immediate benefit from the activities.
&gt;
&gt;The main reason that you do not see more lawsuits regarding unpaid internships is that the interns are very unlikely to sue.  In most cases, they fear being blacklisted, as they will undoubtedly need to use the internship as a reference to get any future work.
&gt;
&gt;This is where California’s Private Attorney General Act comes in.  Because this law allows anyone at the company to sue for labor violations, even if they themselves are not affected by the violation, it is now possible for these companies to be brought into compliance with the law.  If you work for a company that uses unpaid interns and would like to put an end to this illegal practice, you should consider bringing a Private Attorney General cause of action.
&gt;
&gt;Of course, if the internship is work, not only minimum wage must be paid, but also California overtime (8 in a day / 40 in a week) as well as meal and rest breaks."
q9a9v,3,2012-02-28,I want to stop making excuses and realize my dreams,UMadBreaux,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/q9a9v/i_want_to_stop_making_excuses_and_realize_my/,"I've been dealing with depression all throughout college. It has definitely been a rough time, I got involved with some bad people and ended up relying on substance abuse to take away the pains, or at least try to.

Fast forward to today. I am currently in my last semester of an internship, after which I have a full year of classes before graduation. I want to really make the most of this time and actually enjoy myself, as I have spent the past few years slaving away in class and work(I have been working 20-30 hours a week while taking classes).

Above all, I want to start reconnecting with people again. I used to be a fairly extroverted person, depression definitely made me hide in my shell most of the time. I may not ever be able to return completely to my old sociable self, but I would definitely like to start reaching out to others and connecting to other people. My goal is to eventually start dating again, I have dreamed of a meaningful relationship for years and it's time to finally go out there and follow my dreams. I deserve it, I need to quit holding myself back and being my harshest critic.

That being said, I am not afraid to admit I am really scared. My self-esteem is still pretty low, causing me to fear intimate connections out of fear of rejection. My only experience dating in college was a rather traumatic relationship freshmen year: I was in the beginning stages of depression when I met this girl at a party, as I began falling deeper and deeper into despair she wasted no time using me to her advantage, ultimately cheating on me to get back with her ex-boyfriend. I caught them cheating on me with my own eyes, and she never even apologized. Or thought about warning me that she had herpes.

Since then, I have been damaged goods when it comes to relationships. The few times that someone has shown interest in me, I found it easier to believe that they had mistaken me for someone else, that there was no way anyone could be attracted to me in any way. I wish I could go back in time and smack some sense into myself, but those opportunities are long gone and that is that.

I really want to try and start dating again, but I'm really scared to put myself out there. I don't want my self-esteem to completely shatter again, but I know I have to take risks and put myself out there. Can anyone offer some advice for starting to date after dealing with depression for so long? I'm just not exactly sure who I am or where to go from here.

If you have read down this far, thank you for taking a minute of your time to try and help me, it means a lot. I hope that you all can leave depression in the past and chase your dreams and ambitions, we're all in this together."

For example, last year a friend of mine did a report on Gödel's theorem. 
Other suggestion's I've been given by various lecturer's have been the Banach-Tarski Paradox, Gaudi's use of geometric surfaces, or even creating some mathematical artwork or poster's for the department. 

This seems to me like an amazing opportunity, and I'd like to use it to do something which will further my mathematical understanding, while being fun and perhaps even being useful in some way. 

I'd love to hear of any suggestions you might have.

I'm having difficulty breaking into the industry with the rough market so I thought I would try here.

I am a hardware and networking professional that has been building computers and other equipment from the ground up since I was in middle school. I have completed an internship in the field as well (more info on that available on request).

If anyone here handles hiring for a company or knows one who is hiring for IT, please message me for more details, resume, experience, etc. Please link to the business website if possible as I do not want to give out too much personal information to anyone on Reddit (can't be too careful).

I appreciate any help anyone can offer.

edit: Thank you everyone for your input. I will crosspost this to r/pittsburghjobs soon after I follow through with the opportunities found in your replies. Upvotes all around!"
qaxml,29,2012-02-29,Outdoors Adventure,[deleted],LetsNotMeet,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/qaxml/outdoors_adventure/,"Back in 2008 I was working on my Environmental Science internship in a brand new place.  Where I come from had an extremely low crime rate, lower than the average for the US, so maybe I was a little naive or just not expecting much to go wrong.  

So, for my internship, I worked outdoors banding birds.  My fellow worker and myself had set up a new spot to band birds at this little secluded fishing access area.  You could drive in from the main, somewhat rural route, and head down to the lake.  It also had a picnic area that no one ever seemed to use, so we set up shop there.  We had our banding area up this forested rise that had zero trails and no one had a need to go anywhere near there for anything else other than what we were doing.  

My coworker would park at the bottom of the rise, so the car was pretty visible, which I later realized was rather dumb.  We learned that gay guys used the spot to meet up, so we felt somewhat safe as we saw them regularly and we'd wave to each other.  

One morning, things went as usual, and I was up near the top of the rise by myself.  I have a habit of looking behind me, and on this morning I noticed a car parked at the edge of the woods, right at the base of where we were working, right near our car.  I crouched down and moved around to see if I could see anybody down there, and saw a man leave the car.  I got ready to call out to him to tell him to please leave the area when he began taking off his clothes.  He took off all of them, and left them on the hood of his car.  He then proceeded to take out a gallon jug of water and two of those large rectangular buckets that hold cement mix from his car.  

I had a chuckle at how strange this was while finding a dip near the top of the rise to hide in.  I started panicking though as the man entered our work area and started walking up the rise.  I didn't know exactly where my coworker was and he seemed to be headed right to where she had gone earlier.  I called her on her cell and told her there was a naked man in the woods.  She started screaming to get out of the woods and hung up on me to call the police.  

Problem was, there was no way out of the dip I was in without him seeing me when I got up, so I knew I'd have to book it.  I got up, and he turned right to me, total frontal view and set his buckets and water down and started heading right for me.  I booked it down the rise to the parking lot till I found my coworker.  

The cops came, found the guy, took him in and looked him up.  He had traveled over an hour to this particular spot and never gave his motive as to what he was going to do there, but those cement buckets were both full of porn magazines.  The cops showed us what came up when they searched him in their system: Repeat Violent Sexual Offender.  "

He moved the files from his laptop (mac) to a portable hard drive. The portable hard drive took was a piece of shit apparently, and everything on it is gone. Needless to say he also lost the data that was on his computer. If anyone has any suggestions, they would be most appreciated. Thank you."

I am currently a junior studying ECE, and I think it might be really awesome to go get my PhD after graduation. I am currently debating whether to take a summer position with an REU program doing HPC research or working with one of the National Labs working with their supercomputing. Is there one that looks better for a graduate school application?

Also, here's my resume if that might help you provide an opinion: http://db.tt/xELv77iq

TL;DR - Which looks better on a grad school application DoE SULI internship or a REU program? "
qarz8,13,2012-02-28,"I went to a t-14 school for one year, and then quit after my first summer internship. I have now transitioned into a different career. AmA.",[deleted],LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/qarz8/i_went_to_a_t14_school_for_one_year_and_then_quit/,"I just figured I'd throw this out there - not to discourage everyone from law school - but to hopefully help out a few people who may have been in my position either before starting or part of the way into law school. Basically, I loathed the experience, lost a lot of weight and was constantly sick, and almost destroyed one of the most important relationships in my life. I initially took a leave of absence, which eventually turned into an official withdrawal. Grades were decent but not spectacular.

TL;DR - LSAT 170, went to a T-14, finished 1L and a paid summer internship (mostly to recoup some costs!), and then quit. Took me about 1 year to get fully situated into another career track, and now I'm happily employed in a highly enjoyable and rewarding job in the tech/new media field. (Had I stayed, I would now be a 3L.)"
qar6n,0,2012-02-28,"I'm a 3rd-year MechE undergrad at a good university, just got offered an internship involving programming O____________O",trawlinimnottrawlin,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/qar6n/im_a_3rdyear_meche_undergrad_at_a_good_university/,"Title says it all. &lt;insert i-dont-know-what-i'm-doing-meme&gt; My past programming experience: nonexistent. Just kidding, but it's really close. Seriously though: Ti-83 BASIC in high school (weak to put on here, I know, but I self-learned the language to a point of pride, although I was far from very good), and one semester of MATLAB programming during my third semester at Cal's MechE program. I personally believe that I'm fast at learning computer languages, from my experience, and good at self-teaching myself things. I don't make it to class very often as a MechE student due to unrelated reasons, but have self-taught most of the material and am passing all of my classes. 
Anyway, the internship was offered by a family friend, and I'm assuming it's related to Intel. I asked him for more job specifications, and this is what he replied:

**A Strong knowledge of the Microsoft .NET framework: VB.Net, .NET Framework Class Library**

**Object: oriented programming, Classes, encapsulation, data abstraction and abstract data types, DLL, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Exception Handling, Files and Streams, Regular Expressions, GUI, GDI+, Multithreading, Binary and/or Hexadecimal, Data Structures, Arrays, and Software Debugging**

**Experienced or Familiar with Electronic Signals: Software DSP, Electronic theory, Understanding of Digital Storage Oscilloscopes, Knowledge of PC architecture**

Please let me know if it's possible to learn all this stuff! At least a basic knowledge, where I won't feel overwhelmed by everything going on. I have until early June to learn everything, and can probably allocate between 3-6 hours a week on learning programming. Thanks guys! Let me know if I should post this in any other subreddits as well.

**tl;dr: I got offered an internship, but only have some basic MATLAB programming experience.**"

I have good problem solving abilities and I have devotion towards my work. Problem solving has been my most well known attribute as I am very creative in the way I execute ideas. I am also devoted towards what I do and I will put in extra hours because I utilize my free time to further my skills for a job and increase productivity. Also I am not limited to the tools I use for programming. I can easily adapt to different languages and environments.

qakvs,2,2012-02-28,[Hiring] Video Post-Production Engineering Internship,uncletex,colum,https://www.reddit.com/r/colum/comments/qakvs/hiring_video_postproduction_engineering_internship/,"Hi there...

These seems like a perfect subreddit to repost this at the moment.

We're a post-production house in Chicago focused mainly on commercial spot work. And we're looking for the perfect intern to work with our engineering/IT department.

We fix things when they break. We install and make everything work together perfectly. Our projects include planning and installing new equipment, computer hardware and software support, maintenance of video and audio gear, IT networking, and general troubleshooting alongside our editors and artists.

If you're interested, you should already have some background in video production and post-production. Knowledge about editing and graphics, and the software and hardware behind it would be nice. Knowledge about video and audio cables...how to make them, crimp, solder, troubleshoot, etc. Ethernet? Yes. Troubleshooting Mac, Windows? Yes. Linux? Oh, that'd be real nice.

If you're dreams are to become an editor, graphics artist, audio engineer, or some other awesome person who sits in the chair and runs the gear...that's great. But don't apply to this internship.
If instead...you think you've got a great mix of potential talent, interests, and desire to rebuild computers, wire networks, climb around ceilings digging in cable trays, and help support a video post-house...well...we should talk. 

We're located in downtown Chicago. Send me a PM with a non-form-letter introduction, and I'll be in touch.
