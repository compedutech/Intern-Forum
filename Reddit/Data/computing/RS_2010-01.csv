As a girl in computer science, I never really got the point of women technology groups and conventions. Why are we singling ourselves out? Why aren't we just a part of normal engineering societies?

I'm currently going to school for computer science, and I have faced literally 0 sexism in my major or in any internship I've had. Outside of engineering I've experience sexism, but never in any engineering environment. And I'm serious when I say 0 sexism.

I noticed that in the post about sexism in the work place most of the posters saying that they didn't face sexism were computer science majors who were still in school or had a job.

So convince me XX, why should I support women's engineering societies and conventions?

This isn't supposed to be combative or anything, I'm honestly confused about why people feel the need to have these things..."

I've been lurking here for quite a while now and this is my first time posting here. I'm just looking for some advice regarding learning programming. 

I'm currently in College doing a Computer Systems program (2yrs) and so far the first term is composed of very basic stuff that I am already familiar with so I'm looking for something to do ""on the side"". What I know right now is some **basic** VB.net, Java, and C++ and I enjoy building small OS (windows) utilities like file renamer, etc. 

I'm wondering if I should go and learn some new language (scheme comes to mind or python?), expand on what I know right now, or look at stuff like design patterns. I know that these are all important but right now, my goal is to do or learn something that will get/help me in an internship probably as early as next year.

I used to think of myself as a smart guy. I graduated high school at 16 and got my bachelor’s at 19. During my last year in college, though, I took up pot. It supplemented my natural laziness. My grades slipped a bit, though they were still decent when I graduated. The stupid thing is that I didn’t give a shit about internships or work, as I had a decent amount of scholarship money. This was a terrible mistake. Experience is like money, except that it stays with you. 

After graduating, I quit pot, cleaned up my piss, meandered for half a year, and managed to find a good-paying entry-level job. I learned a lot in the 10 months that I’ve worked. I think I could’ve been a better employee had I not been a night-and-weekend toker, though.  However, the underboss at that job was just a terrible being. I pretty much got myself fired for a small, but blatant act of disobedience. Looking back, it was a mistake, but fearing that woman every day is a pretty strong counter-argument. I still get bad dreams about her. My firing was pretty civil, though; I was granted 2 weeks of severance pay and they agreed not to oppose my unemployment benefits. 

Throughout all of this, I’ve lived with my parents, as I do now. After getting fired, I avoided looking for a job for 6 months. I kept smoking, and that shit kills any motivation to look for work. I was also more afraid of failing a pre-employment drug test than remaining unemployed. 

This July, I quit pot, and have been looking for work ever since. My bachelor’s degree is in accounting, and I have a pretty good GPA. I don’t have a criminal record. However, I’m 22 years old now, and it’s been 2.5 years since I’ve graduated. I only have 10 months of experience and a year-long gap after it. I’ve applied to &gt;100 clerical and accounting jobs, and have not succeeded. I know I would be a better employee now, but how do I make future employers to agree? How do I find a job?

I’ve been meandering between continuing my search for office work, and working in retail/fast food and starting up smoking again to deal better.

TL;DR: Have degree, little experience, big gap. How do I get a job?

anpu4,9,2010-01-09,Made the mistake of taking her back after she cheated; one more broken heart and many months later and I just can't get right,OneLastTry,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/anpu4/made_the_mistake_of_taking_her_back_after_she/,"I told the story here many times before when it was first going down, so sorry if this sounds familiar. The details hardly matter any more, I don't think, so I'll skim over it.

In short I fell in love with this girl when she was just a child and could not possibly imagine how manipulative and dishonest she'd grow up to be. I ended up following her to college when our initial plans of going to nearby schools didn't work out because she got rejected from all of them. We both hated the place, so we decided to transfer and tried again, and this time I had my sights really set on one of the best schools in the country. When she again got rejected from the places she applied nearby, she sat me down, crying, and begged me not to abandon her by transferring. I thought about it for a while, decided to take the chance and told her she was more important to me. I didn't send out my transfer apps, then at the start of the summer she got an acceptance letter from a school I didn't know she'd been seriously considering, and they gave her a tight deadline to reply, so she didn't even tell me about it until after she'd sent off her acceptance. I was obviously upset and deliberating breaking up with her when my little brother (who was honestly my best/sometimes only friend) passed away suddenly. I needed some support and we ended up staying together. Over the course of the next year when we were long distance, she'd have me do her homework so she'd have time to go out drinking. Even when I asked her to stay in and talk to me. We broke up for a bit, I felt guilty and asked her to take me back, we lived together for a summer, and two weeks after she went back to school she cheated on me, repeatedly, because she was too 'proud' to stay with someone who couldn't divine, after being together for three years, that she'd made the first drunken-mistake hookup. I figured out what happened, she felt guilty and spent the rest of that academic year telling me that if we stayed together, how perfect everything would be after that. She told me that all the cruel shit she'd said about how I was inattentive and didn't care about her unless she threatened to leave me, was really just so that I'd be able to get over her more easily. Yes, in hindsight, I should've seen how much of a psycho bitch she was. But I was excited by her promises to live with me the next summer, and at the end of the school year we drove out to where I got my internship. Or, started to -- her parents (who always hated me) said she was stupid to let me manipulate her into doing what I wanted her to that summer, and that they would stop paying for her school and essentially disown her. So she left. Me. Alone, on the opposite side of the country from anyone I'd ever known. But told me that she had to deal with her shitty relationship with her parents, and then she'd be back. Just, for now, she was too unstable to be in a relationship with anyone, but she really loved me and I was so strong for being able to wait for her. Then she stopped talking to me entirely, and when I pressed to find out why, it turned out that she started seeing someone else as soon as she got back to school. I was pissed and went legitimately crazy, I'd have done anything I could to hurt her or get revenge in some way, but it didn't help much and she got her father to threaten me so I eventually stopped (fortunately for her, before showing her school all the copies I had of the homework I'd done for her).

So that was at the start of the Fall. I took a semester off from school to sort shit out and work on one of my own projects. Ended up getting hired full-time back where I was over the summer. I'm (at least temporarily) dropped out but that doesn't really bother me. Now my life is perfect in pretty much every way. I love the city I live in. I love my job. I'm in the best physical shape of my life. I've removed all of these negative influences. I should be happy. But most of the time I'm haunted by these memories I have from when she wasn't such a crazy bitch, and just depressed that the girl I remembered ever could've turned out that way. I feel like it could be ages until I feel like myself again. I... don't really know what I'm asking here. Help?"

* Packages are already available to make a nice layout.
* Better control over formatting most of the time.

LaTeX cons:

* If I'm getting help from someone who needs to edit the résumé, they will probably want to use a WYSIWYG word processor. Relatively few people know how to write LaTeX.
* If an employer wants a .doc then I will have to rewrite the whole thing using a word processor. (Bonus question: What file format do most employers want?)
* I can only build the résumé on a computer with LaTeX somehow available (can be done via USB drive).
* No WYSIWYG editor (bad when I'm trying to get everything onto one page).

Some or all of this may be heresay - I dare say none of it is cited in a reasonable way.  However, the allegations, if true, are stunning.  I have reposted it below in case the original post disappears.

_________________________________
If you have any doubts about the following truth or if you think that there are other versions out there, then you need to explain the following fact:

When Google headquarters announced their withdrawal from China, they immediately canceled the rights of all Chinese engineers to access the servers on which their program codes reside.  The engineers only found out when they showed up for work that they could not longer enter the home page of their server.  There was no pre-notification.  Many people were halfway through their coding when they were frozen out.  They will have to wait for weeks when they are transferred to the United States before they can continue to write.

If Google had planned to leave beforehand, why would they do this?  They could have continued to let the workers work and clean up.  For example, the Chinese company does Google Music differently than the US (music.google.cn and music.google.com).  If Chinese Google Music is canceled, the Chinese engineers can do the code migration.

But all Chinese engineers were placed on paid leave while that work is being taken over by foreigners.

Why did Google suddenly distrust its Chinese team?  After all, they developed their own codes and they should be more efficient in making the migration.

The only reason is that the Chinese Communist Party must have inserted special agents inside Google (specifically in the Shanghai office of Google).

The truth of the matter is that this person was sent by the Chinese Communist Party.  After being hired by Google, this person copied down the critical program code and handed it over the the Chinese Communist Party.

The purpose of this action was to gain access to the email of the ""human rights organizations.""  Google's official statement noted this.

The flaws of the Gmail system became exposed.  Google could not officially acknowledge this, or else their reputation would suffer internationally.  All Google could do was to stop all work in China.  All engineers in China were not allowed to access the program code server.  Then they seized the opportunity to correct their Gmail code over the next few days.

So the whole truth is simply this emergency incident.  You can read the original Google statement.  It was written in haste, but you can sense the shock among their top leaders.  The three top managers of Google held an emergency meeting and came to a unanimous decision.  How could they have reached an agreement with the United States government to do this beforehand?  Do you feel that an official Google announcement would be so crudely written unlike any official document?

Google's withdrawal was not because of the Internet censorship.  While that was something that Google felt uncomfortable about, they had put up with it over the past few years.

But the code theft this time caused Google to face a total collapse crisis.  (The official Google blog said that this involved an intellectual property theft problem).  To put it bluntly, the survival of the entire company would be threatened if they stayed in China.  Therefore, they put a stop to all work at their China company.

While Google planned to negotiate with the Chinese government at first, they have given up the effort today.  Even if the government makes concessions, Google does not plan to stay.  If they stay, they risk their lives.  This is not a question of making money in the China market or not.  The risk is too high to make a little money but losing the entire company.

As for limiting the access rights of the Chinese engineers to the program code, it should that said that Google trusts its technical staff.  Even an intern can access more than 99% of the program code.  Google has only one program code database.  Each person who enters learns the first law of development: Search!  Search for similar code in the program code database and then email the original author.  By sharing the program code across the entire company, they were able to achieve tremendous coding efficiency.  The Google program code, comments and technical description are open to every engineer.

You can criticize me, or you can offer other explanations.  But please read my whole essay and then see if you can justify your own version!!

I can only say that the Chinese Communist Party has gone too far and made it impossible for Google to go on.

P.S. This case is still under investigation.  There is a person who is a Chinese Communist Party member.  After arriving in Google, he downloaded the core program code of Gmail.  This person has vanished now.  But we know the above.  As to who sent him, we can only guess.  Over the past couple of days, Google headquarters people have interviewed every engineer in China to see if this person has collaborators.  At the same time, Google headquarters is accessing how much program code has been leaked and how much of it has to be re-written.  When this is done, they will begin to transfer the Chinese engineers (if they didn't investigate and transfer them immediately, they would be bringing the moles to the United States).  At that time, Google headquarters will state the truth.  You can wait a month and come back to re-read this post.

P.P.S.  Forget it, let me explain this.  There were three moles, one of whom was the Chinese Communist Party branch secretary.  This party secretary was set up four years ago by the National Security Ministry.  This guy studied at Jiaotong University and then jointed Computer Security Department.  The department sent him to study computers at the Computer Security School in Jiaotong University.  He programmed every day.  When he graduated, he joined Google.  There, he recruited two more insiders.  One of them was the insider who broke into the source code for Gmail and gave it to the Chinese government.
The government wanted this mainly to monitor the anti-Communist persons who use Gmail.
So this was sensationalistic, because of the involvement of the Chinese Communist Party branch.
This guy got a 1,000,000 yuan reward, plus public servant status.
These people used to sneak over to Lujiazui after work to attend Chinese Communist Party branch meetings.

P.P.P.S.
How did Google that their code was obtained by the agents?
Unless Google installs surveillance software on the computers of all the workers.
To access the program code, one must log into the only program code server at Google.  The server will keep a record of your visits.
It is only known now that this person is a Chinese Communist Party member and he reviewed a lot of program code within a short time.  This person has now vanished.  Based upon this, I conjecture that he turned the code over to his organization.
Firstly, he clearly attacked many servers that carried source code.
Secondly, he clearly obtained it illegally.
Let us continue to watch this.  My mobile phone will be ringing ...
Right now, most of the colleagues are prepared to leave.  A small number of technical people and the legal department will stay.  Everybody is depressed.  Nobody thought that this was how this would end."

Heart surgeon waging war on saturated fat seems seriously short on science to support his claims
Posted on 21 January 2010

Eagle-eyed readers may have noticed that the commonly-held belief that saturated fat cause heart disease appears to be waning. In the last few weeks alone we have seen the publication of two significant and weighty studies which have found no link between sat fat and heart disease. These come hot on the heels of another review last year that found the same. I covered these studies last Friday here. These recent studies did not get much airtime in conventional media, but they did at least appear to whip up some interest in the blogosphere.

Now, this might be a coincidence, but on Tuesday there was here in the UK a huge media splash instigated by the suggestion from a heart surgeon that we should ‘ban butter’. (See here for an example of this coverage). The surgeon in question, Mr Shyam Kolvekar, urges us all to cut back on saturated fat (sigh…) to save our coronary arteries. Now, Mr Kolvekar’s message got widespread exposure (see here for an example), but he was not acting in isolation. He was aided and abetted by Unilever’s PR agency (KTB). Unilever, in case you are not familiar, is a food company that makes, among other things, highly chemicalised, non-food margarines touted as a ‘healthy’ alternative to butter.

There is no good evidence that I can find that supports the supposed ink between saturated fat and heart disease. So I emailed Mr Kolvekar asking for evidence that supports his assertions. I also asked him to clarify whether or not he had received payment for Unliever for this or any other work.

To his credit, Mr Kolvekar responded. He declared no commercial gain from any work with Unlever (I believe him). However, on the evidence, he was not so forthcoming. He referred me to the FSA (Food Standards Agency) and Department of Health websites. He stated, that what I read in the news was his own personal opinion.

I emailed him back, pressing him for actual studies. I wrote: “Can I ask you to specifically cite the evidence (preferably human intervention studies, but epidemiological evidence too if you have it) that supports the assertions you have made regarding saturated fat and butter. Please do not refer me to websites, consensus statements or the like. It is actual studies I am interested in.”

I did get a reply, which I suppose I should be thankful for. But it was not particularly fulsome. It actually contained just one citation, with no supporting text. Not even a ‘Dear John’.

I responded to Mr Kolvekar with the following email.

Dear Shyam

In response to my request for you to supply evidence that supports your assertions regarding saturated fat you provided a single reference [1]. This reference concerns what is commonly referred to as the North Karelia Project. As you may know, this project was an attempt to reduce the risk of heart disease in individuals living in the province of North Karelia in Finland. The project started in 1972. Outcomes were initially compared to a control group which was not subjected to any intervention. The intervention was deemed a success, and was subsequently adopted on a country-wide basis. The reference you offer refers to that country-wide intervention.

The first thing to note about the North Karelia Project is that is was multiple intervention in nature. In addition to attempts to have people eat less saturated fat, it also aimed to reduce smoking and blood pressure. It employed a number of strategies including health education, screening and intensification of treatment in those already being treated for cardiovascular disease. Because of the multiple intervention nature of the project, it is simply impossible to gauge which element(s) of it might have been responsible for any benefits seen from the interventions.

A closer look at the project itself reveals other issues, which have been highlighted before [2]. Shah Ebrahim and George Davey Smith point out that while the results of the North Karelia project have been held up as a ‘success’, the reality is that it’s results were quite unimpressive. Let me quote from this letter: “CHD mortality trends over the period 1969 to 1995 show a greater decline in North Karelia than the rest of the country, but the 95% confidence intervals for the slopes overlap. An intriguing pattern of decline is hidden in the overall trend. First, North Karelia experienced an almost immediate and rapid decline, a rise and a fall in CHD mortality (1971–1975). Second, rates of decline were significantly greater in the country as a whole than in North Karelia (1976–1985). Finally, death rates tended to approximate to each other (1986–1995). Such trends do not provide unambiguous support for the hypothesis that the intervention was effective. “

It is notable that one of the original North Karelia investigators subsequently wrote to the Lancet to express his own doubts regarding the ‘success’ of the project [3]. He expressed the opinion that he did not think it was possible to draw the positive conclusions that had been presented in the original paper.

With the one piece of evidence you have cited to support your assertions regarding saturated fat we have two fundamental problems:

1. It is a multiple intervention in nature, and it’s therefore impossible to draw conclusions about the effects of any specific intervention within it

2. The multiple interventions appeared to have little or no benefit anyway

My belief is that to hold this up as evidence for the benefits of eating a less saturated fat is scientifically untenable.

Against, this, I think it’s appropriate to take a wider view of the saturated fat/heart disease ‘link’. Last year, Mente and colleagues at the Population Health Research Institute in Hamilton, Canada, published a comprehensive review of the link between dietary factors and coronary heart disease [4]. They found that epidemiological evidence did not support a link, and neither were they able to identify appropriate intervention studies that supported any link.

A recent edition of the Annals of Nutrition and Metabolism was dedicated to reporting an expert consultation held jointly by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the US [5]. The consultation undertook a comprehensive review of the relationship between fats and health, and took place in late 2008. The report states with regard to epidemiological evidence that “Intake of SFA was not significantly associated with CHD mortality…” and “SFA intake was not significantly associated CHD events…” With regard to interventional evidence, it was concluded that “…fatal CHD was not reduced by… low-fat diets…”

In addition, earlier this year saw the on-line publication of a meta-analysis of cohort studies assessing the relationship between saturated fat and heart disease [6]. This meta-analysis comprised 21 epidemiological studies (almost 350,000 people followed-up over a period of between 5 and 23 years). This meta-analysis found no significant association between saturated fat and risk of heart disease or stroke.

I do not doubt your motives and think it’s laudable that you would attempt to help inform individuals about healthy eating in an effort to help prevent cardiovascular disease in the public at large. However, it is important I think that such messages should be accurate and evidence-based. Otherwise, we risk doing more harm than good.

I’d be enormously grateful if you would perhaps give me your thoughts regarding the deficiencies of the North Karelia ‘evidence’, as well as the (in my view) compelling evidence which demonstrates that saturated fat does not cause heart disease.

Yours sincerely

John Briffa

48 hours on, I still have not had a response to this email. If I get one, I’ll post it. At this time, however, I think it’s fair to stay that when Mr Kolvekar embarked on his quest to save us from the ravages of heart disease, he was either unfamiliar with the science in this area, or had studiously ignored it. I am genuinely prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt, though, and imagine that Mr Kolvekar’s statements were just misguided and ill-informed. However, if he is unable to produce the evidence that supports his ‘personal opinion’, and now he has in front of him quite a stack of evidence to the contrary, surely the decent thing would be to issue a retraction?

I’m tempted to remind Mr Kolvekar of John Maynard Keyne’s quote I referred to here: “When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, sir?”"

I have been contacted by some places, but they have refused me due to my GPA being low.  It's at a 2.8, but it seems like most places are now requiring a 3.0.  Does anybody feel like this is happening?"

Any suggestions or recommendations about places to go (or not go,) things to do and  advice about general etiquette would be greatly appreciated.

Also still need to find a place to stay - in Kensington near the museum would be best, but on a student's budget a longer commute might be acceptable. Anyone know of anything?"
auvxt,15,2010-01-27,What kind of salary should upcoming mech. engineering college graduates expect to get realistically?,Ogi010,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/auvxt/what_kind_of_salary_should_upcoming_mech/,"Saw a post on a similar topic like this in /r/programming, but figured the information could be useful for /r/engineering.

I've been hearing wide array of salaries out there that mechanical engineering students get when they graduate.  One of my professors was talking about how we would get job offers for upwards of 80k/yr once we graduate.  I do have some work experience in various tech positions,  but salaries like that really sound exaggerated for someone coming straight out of college; and that's not even taking into effect the current state of the economy.

Then again, what do I know, I am only in my junior year and I'm grinding away on my dynamics homework.  Let's hope I get at least one of the internships I'm applying for this summer.

edit1:
I should note that I attend UCSD, so it's a respected engineering program in an area with a high cost of living.  "

Hoping for an instant death.,whatisdestiny,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/avlob/the_tears_on_my_cheeks_is_the_warmest_feeling_i/,"If you are emotinall sensitive please leave. English is not my first language and my fingers are pretty close to being frozen so please bare with me. Call me chicken for not sliicing my wrist but I feel incredibly selfish for posting this because i do have have a loving family but I feel very I would be placing a huuuge burden on them with this. I know its selfish to do this to my family but the emptiness i feel is just unbearable at this point. I have detered this as long as possible by reading websites about parents who lost their children to suicide but I am done now. My dad works like a dog from the time he gets up to the time he gets to sleep and my mom works a shit job just to put me through school. My parents have very little saved for retirement which I think is my fault of me not being able to pay for uni. 

Academically i'm doing fine, recently got an internship in the IT field but I still feel empty.I feel incredibly selfish for posting this here but as many previous redditors i have no other option. 

I simply cannot find the source of my emptiness. I try to keep a positive perspective on everything but I simply cannot find happiness anymore. My smiles, my caring attitude, and my forgiving nature all go unnoticed, if anything, I am constantly 'used'. I try to remember that more than half the worlds population doesn't have the luxury of feeling like this but that can only deter my thought process for so long. 

I have been treating my body as a temple for a while but recently just gave up and started smoking, drinking, picking fights for no reason, and been planning my way into meth / heroin. I walked home on the wrong side of the highway hoping I would die instantly yesterday but no luck. My car just recently died and now my family has 1 car between the 4 of us. My best friend is moving away and i recently got dumped by a girl i would give the world for. I am more afraid of being alone for the rest of my life after my parents are gone than anything. It seems respect for women or anyone else for that matter is no longer a requirement in the western world. As a last act of good faith I helped a passed out student get home from the bar to ease my conscious about this.

If destiny has it, I will make it home and read any words of comfort you anonymous redditors can offer. If not, this song ""In the music 2010"" has provided me with an attitude to not fear what may come of my last attempt on the highway to find peace.

Thank You.

I'm one and a half year away from graduating with a B.Sc. in CS. 
Since the beginning of the year I was thinking about what to do with 
my (professional) life, and I finally decided to become a software developer. (I realize that this happens much to late :( )

I know the basics of C, C++, some .Net with C#, OOD, OOP and UML.
Also the basics about computer architecture, complexity, algorithms and so on. 
But I also know that this is not enough to get me started on a career in software development.

So if I want to get into C#/.Net programming , how much can I learn about it, during the remaining 80 weeks, if I dedicate 30 hours each week to learning?
Do you think it is enough time to get me a starting/junior position?
And where would you suggest to start?

I am looking for an internship right know, to get me some practical experience."
