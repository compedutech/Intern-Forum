eeppd,2,2010-12-01,Some help with measurement uncertainties required,Madmonkey91,statistics,https://www.reddit.com/r/statistics/comments/eeppd/some_help_with_measurement_uncertainties_required/,"I am a 2nd year mechanical engineering student doing an internship at an aircraft maintenance firm. Currently I am tasked with calculating uncertainty values derived from calibration tests, so that they can be recorded on the test certificates. 

I am doing this by first using the calibration certificates provided by labs using reference standards, reading the standard uncertainty value off it, and then combining that with standard uncertainties derived from in house testing. The in house testing procedure is as follows: 

1) Take 3 measurements

2) Derive mean and standard deviation values

3) Using student's t-distribution with 2 DoF, k=4.3 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-distribution

I have an excel spreadsheet to calculate the combined expanded uncertainty with inputs for the standard uncertainty from the reference standards, in house testing as well as for the k value/DoF, with sheets for each individual instrument being calibrated.

Unfortunately I have not had much experience in this field in the past and as such am running into several problems with my understanding of the subject matter and thus getting stuck. For example, the calibration takes place over a range of values. Is it necessary to calculate the uncertainty at every test point? Because that seems way too time consuming for the person carrying out the calibration ( even with the use of my excel spreadsheet). Is there some way of calculating a total uncertainty for a device?

EDIT: Just realised hadn't specified formulae used for calculating combined expanded undertainty. Total degreres of freedom are calculated using the Welch-Satterthwaite formula and the total combined standard uncertainty is calculated by adding all the input standard uncertainties in quadrature. Then the coverage factor is derived and multiplied to the combined standard uncertainty give the combined expanded uncertainty"
eetzn,6,2010-12-01,"Trying to land an EE job, need some ideas on preparation.",n00bEE,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/eetzn/trying_to_land_an_ee_job_need_some_ideas_on/,"Reddit engineers, I'm really excited that I've been given the opportunity to interview in a couple of days for what I hope is my first electrical engineering position.  At the same time I feel woefully unprepared and a little nervous about asking for help.  You guys, I'm ready to be an engineer.  My professional experience thus far has been four years of mind numbing IT related work, I'm (surprise) very good at it.  I'm very rarely challenged when tasked with finding a solution to what my employers feel are ""big issues"", and I feel like my mind is rotting from the core.  I want to contribute my technical and problem solving abilities to the world.  I feel like this is my last chance to be an electrical engineer as I've had absolutely no luck with landing a position over the past 3 years since graduating with my BSEE.  I don't know what I'll do with myself if I fail to get into this field.

Here are a few things that I'm not quite sure how to explain to a would be employer.  I really could use some help with phrasing my responses to questions that prod at what I'm about to mention.  I have absolutely no professional engineering experience.  A few extra curricular projects is it.  I never managed to land an internship, and couldn't stay in the city during summers since I had to move back to a remote rural town.  I have a low GPA.  While I had tremendous work ethic towards practical things such as my labs, or my extra extracurriculars or even my self-taught knowledge of web-programming, I found it very difficult to achieve in a structured learning environment.  Still I am stubborn and I refuse to quit.  I redid any courses that I had to and did what it took to complete my education.  On top of all that, it's been nearly 3 years since I graduated and I feel as if my retained knowledge of analog and digital electronics is fading pretty badly.  I have my books though, and I try to keep my mind exercised with a couple of fairly simple hobby projects (i.e. most recently restored and old radio).  I feel though that the combination of the lack of experience, poor gpa and time out of school are things that produce a mountain of complication larger than Everest for me.  I'm not quite sure what I can do to prove myself. 

I think after explaining all of that, it's important for me to mention that I still I feel that I have confidence in myself as a worthy candidate.  What I lack in experience, I make up for with my skills in critical thinking and problem solving.  I'm an engineer, I organize a problem that I don't understand and am interested in and science it until I come to a conclusion.  I'm never satisfied with letting others figure out or fix my electronics, my computer or whatever (excepting my car, it's too essential for me to test inaccurate conclusions on).

The next thing I want to do is study up a little bit on a few things that pertain to this position.  I have a little insider information on the position (an awesome friend graciously gave my resume to their boss, prompting this interview).  The hiring manager apparently has an interest in my skills with web based programming, HTML, PHP, CSS, mySQL, etc.  On top of that, I'm told they tend to have applicants analyze a couple of circuit diagrams and either look at or produce some programming in C.  For the circuitry, I'm told that the company is fairly serious about intrinsic safety.  Understandable as the company specializes in machines that deposit coatings, adhesives and lubricants (and ketchup at McDonalds).  These are coatings, or components of which, that could be explosive (hopefully excluding the ketchup) in the presence of a spark or heat from competent failure I'd imagine.  My first guess is that this involves circuitry with diodes or fuses, but can anyone give me any insight into what I should really be familiarizing myself with regarding this?  What do I do if they show me a circuit, and I can't off-hand tell them or calculate what it does?  Does anyone have any ideas on what people tend to ask when it comes to jotting down a simple C program?  I don't program in C, I program in PHP (similar), I have no idea what little ""gotchas"" or simple nuggets/tricks a budding C programmer tends to know.  Something like programming the actions of a physical digital component seems reasonable.  For instance, a D-flip-flop doesn't sound difficult to do quickly on paper, and honestly I just put a rudimentary program together in my head while writing this, but that's just a shot in the dark.  And again, I don't really know what to do if I'm stumped on the spot.  I certainly can't go back home, converse with friends, read a book and google it until I can resolve the problem like I might normally do.

I don't expect the holy grail of answers out of this, but I value any input that folks might have.  I've seen other people that've been given a tremendous amount of help on here, many times with positive results.  If nothing else, I hope that I can leave my interview feeling confident that I fully explained who I am and what I can do for them.

Thanks everyone.

(for those who want short details):  I have an EE interview.  I have no experience, had a low GPA and graduated 3 years ago.  I feel like it's my last chance to get an EE job.  What can I familiarize myself with regarding circuitry that's intrinsically safe?  What kinds of things to people like to ask to test knowledge of C programming?"
ef3ui,1,2010-12-02,"Can we talk about what you mean by ""unlucky""?",[deleted],WTF,https://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/ef3ui/can_we_talk_about_what_you_mean_by_unlucky/,"[Can we talk about what you mean by ""unlucky""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/eekrs/while_rpolitics_stays_obsessed_with_wikileaks_i/c17lzvr)

I mean my dad was certainly “unlucky”. My father was born with no arms or legs in one of the most mountainous states in the country, with the poorest transportation system. He was a 16th generation carnie, and in addition his father started his own interpretive dance studio and hot dog parlor to produce things like interpretive dancers, hot dogs and hot dogs made from interpretive dancers. Then one day the Union demanded that he stop making his special hot dogs and then shut the place down...

“You bastards!” He yelled as he looked away with his bad eye and stared them boys down with his good eye. Grandpappy would have defeated those Union boys had it not been for the poorly placed industrial cotton candy machine right behind him. To this day folks talk about how he was back flipping away from a group of Union soldiers and just never noticed and jumped into that vat of cotton candy. Though some folk like to think that grandpappy just dern gave up on living that day when his dance studio/hot dog factory was shut down. My father's mother died shortly there after, she said “If'n my brother ain't here by my side I reckon there ain't no reason to go on livin'” Then she too followed my grandpappy into the fluffy pink beyond. Now some people will tell you that those wasn't no Union boys and instead were health inspectors, well that may be true; but I ain't gonna hear no talk about. Now some people may tell you that my grandpappy called his puppy mill an interpretive dance studio, but he did have a hot dog factory! 

So my father was there with no arms or legs. He had to travel to school up hill both ways, and he ain't got no legs. So my father invented a way to travel to school, and that is how a popular dance called the worm was invented. In fact it was Teddy Roosevelt who was traveling through town that day and noticed my father making his daily trek to school, and then with a wink and laugh announced that he was gonna patent the dance. Oh my father tried to get it back from President Roosevelt, and he did managed to chase him for a quarter mile; but Teddy's greater mobility combined with that dang gravel road proved to be my father's undoing. So defeated by President Roosevelt my father made it to school, where he had to shovel coal all day long. This was on account that the only school that would admit my father was a school devoted completely to the study of shoveling coal which weren't easy on my father on account of the no arms or legs.  

Upon graduation from Coal Men's Academy, my father wrote something of 3,000 letters to businessmen asking them to help pay for his education. This was hard for my father on account of his not having any hands, and suffering from that thar illiteracy. You know what happened to my father? Do you wanna know? All 3,000 of those businessmen showed up and beat my father with Nerf bats. For 5 days they all took turns beating my father with Nerf bats...they took vacation time for this. After the five days was ended each of those businessmen tossed my father a nickle which he went down to the corner store with. There he bought seven loaves of bread, 18 gallons of milk, 50 pounds of sugar and 19 dozen eggs. He then used those to create a rather drastic pastry treat, and that is how cup cakes were invented. The remaining money my father used to buy the corner store, and then finance his first three college degrees; which was amazing on account of the no arms and legs and the fact that my father was completely illiterate! All while working at the corner store as an unpaid intern putting in 185 hours a week on account of inventing a time distortion field that allowed him to work, sleep and study more hours than actually existed in a standard Earth week. That was was over 95 years ago, and my father has since earned 17 masters all while putting insurance, clothes and etc on our table...
I wasn't even born with a body, but that ain't stop me from earning some of that thar book learning. Earning me a Ph.d in Nuclear Physics, which is amazing on account of being a disembodied spirit who suffers from the illiteracy.

Just because you are ""unlucky"" doesn't mean that your life has to suck long term. All it means is you have to work harder to get where you want. Suck it up, realize that ""shit sucking"" is a temporary condition as long as you are willing to work hard enough to pull yourself out, and stop feeling sorry for yourselves. Cause ain't nothin' bad ain't never happened to no one who ain't deserved it. "

eg4y7,3,2010-12-04,Frugal Canadians: Bankruptcy Options.,brokeinjapan,Frugal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/eg4y7/frugal_canadians_bankruptcy_options/,"OK guys, throwaway account here.

In the last 5 years, since finishing University, I've gone through some ups and downs with regards to my debts. I want to start with some history. Don't take it as excuses for my debt. Feel free to skip to the tl;dr.

* 2005-2006: Finished school with about $15,000 in student loans. Stupidly, I paid these off quickly (2 years) and simultaneously used my credit card to start two project cars, leaving me with $15,000 debt. Basically I traded my student loans for credit card debt. At the time, I had a job where I was banking hours but not able to take the time off. Eventually I needed both the time off and a change.
* 2007: I quit my job. The banked hours were worth $7,000, but I didn't use it to pay off my debt. Instead, I went on vacation and moved to another city, where it took me 7 months to find a job. I regret it now, but at the time I didn't worry about anything until the money in the bank ran out. I also assumed that my future job would be high-paying. At the end of this period, I had about $20,000 in debt. I sold one project car and bought a cheaper-to-run car.
* 2008: Bad relationship. I ended up supporting someone else for close to a year, and at the end of the year I had about $40,000 in debt. At this point I knew I had to change my lifestyle and I sold my car and moved again, to Vancouver. This time I got my new job first.
* 2009: Unfortunately I had to buy a new (old) car for work once in Vancouver with a line of credit. But, for the whole year I was able to put over $1,000 a month to my debts. I felt great about it. Last summer my car broke in a very expensive way but I kept chipping away at my debts.
* 2010: Really did well at my debts until June but I also got a a half-scholarship for a summer university program in France. It still cost me a lot of money. I borrowed $10,000 from my parents and sold my car and anything else I could. This led to an unpaid internship in Japan. It's an opportunity I couldn't afford to miss. I'm in Japan now, until May. I'm living very cheaply here.
* Current situation: $10,000 in debt to parents, $7,000 secured debt, $20,000 unsecured debt.

I have enough saved to survive here until May and also make my minimum payments. My plan was to work after and continue paying down about $1,500 per month.

But now, I have the option of staying here on a full scholarship for three years to get a Master's degree. It's something that I really want to do but it's a time limited offer. I guess if I declare bankruptcy, it is possible to stay here. The parental debt can wait and I would have enough scholarship money to be able to keep making payments on the secured debt. If I do declare, the sooner the better, I suppose.

But I could also leave in May as planned, go back to work and pay my debts. I fell really conflicted about not paying my debts back, when there is a simple solution to be able to pay them back. I think it would take about 3 years. But, I have the opportunity of a lifetime here.

My third ""option"" is somehow refinancing. I'm not sure if it's possible but I will start to make some phone calls about this soon. If anyone has gone this route I'd like to hear about it. Keep in mind I potentially won't have an income for 3.5 years. If I stay for a Master's degree here, it would be year-round, and I wouldn't have a summer break to make money. This is the best ""option"" but I don't see how it's possible. I can't just call the bank and say ""I can't pay anymore, talk to you in 4 years"".

One more thing: After getting the degree, I wouldn't be going back to Canada, so I'm even more tempted to declare because I'd be ""starting over"" in a new country anyway. I have a bunch of stuff in storage in Vancouver that I could sell for maybe $1000. I still have one project car in storage. It's listed for sale for $3,000 but no one is biting. In other words, selling everything I own would get me about $4,000 max.

**tl;dr**: I have $50,000 in Canadian debt. I'm Canadian, living in Japan right now. Half of the debt would disappear if I went bankrupt, and I could get a Master's degree in Japan in my dream field. Or I could give up on that dream and pay the debt in a few years.

Looking for input on people who've been in this situation before.
Is there an option besides giving up the dream or bankruptcy? What are people's experiences with calling the credit card company and asking for better rates and making agreements? I am SO nervous about doing this for some reason. I feel guilty about the whole thing.
Also, can I declare bankruptcy from overseas? "

I have been trying to find a job for the last year and have had exactly zero interviews/replies from applying online with a resume/cover letter.  Since I am no longer a student and have no experience whatsoever it seems that nobody wants to hire me, even for 10$/hr.

egfc3,1,2010-12-05,Do jobs look at your overall GPA or what you received in your Major GPA?,bewareoftraps,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/egfc3/do_jobs_look_at_your_overall_gpa_or_what_you/,"So here’s a little something about me. First off, got into a decent university and was accepted into their Aerospace Engineering Major. Started to do bad in physics, got Academic Probation because having mediocre grades (B-C) and an F (or 2, yeah Physics…) can really hurt. Dropped into Undeclared Engineering because of my belief that I wasn’t all that bad (big mistake) and could still make it. 

Come summer, my grades were still relatively shit (GPA at 2.25, average for engineer student: 2.75). Took some time and asked my friends what they would do in my shoes (which was extremely hard, as they are all smart and I didn’t want to be looked down upon…stupid pride), and finally decided, enough is enough. Switched out to Business Economics and now my Major GPA is relatively high but my overall is still a lovely 2.2 (Only my single variable calculus class was counted into my Major GPA)

My question is this, to all you people who look at resumes, if I were to send my Major GPA, would you then ask to see my overall GPA? Or is there not even an option to show your Major GPA and you automatically have to send in what your overall is? 

Also, I know that for the most part a lot of people have been telling me to not worry as much, because if I get an internship then for some strange reason, I’ll magically be fine. But then my question is, a lot of internships ask for your GPA, what do you do in that case? (Submit overall or major?)

TL;DR I did bad in engineering, moved to Business Econ, will my old and bad grades from Engineering affect me for applying to a job?"

Time went on, we became best friends, and then much more. We married the summer before she graduated. She started working at Walgreens as an assistant manager. Her plan was to go to Japan and teach English after building up capital.

As for me, I went to school to get a BBA in computer science/programming/business analysis (main language was Java). I got good grades and consider myself to be very amiable compared to most of the people in my program. I became trilingual (English, Japanese, Spanish). I also had many leadership positions in clubs that I learned a wealth of knowledge about leading and teaching. I also had an programming/business analysis internship with a fortune 500 company.

Problem is, I graduated a year ago and everything went to crap. I pursued quite a few companies, but a lack of experience seemingly killed all my chances (even for entry level ones). Not only that, my training in Java and MySQL didn't seem to take me very far. I searched for months and was never hired (I'm very good in interviews, usually anything that gets to that point, my success rate improves dramatically).

At this point, I start to work for a buddy of mine at his establishment as a business consultant/web developer/programmer for a sum far below what I need to pay for my loans, let alone living expenses so I can get something. This means I have to start dipping in to what my wife is making to pay for my most of my expenses.

It is at this point that my wife feels we should prepare to go to Japan. We start doing an online course for teaching English in a foreign country for a hefty sum of money. Problem is that I'm working a lot of hours to get things done for my friends shop and don't have time for this course. During this time, my wife reminds me that she is only staying in this country because she is waiting for me.

Finally, I'm forced to stop working for my friend and settle for a job in manufacturing so I can make ends meet. Trouble is, second day on the job, I get injured pretty bad and can't go back to work. At the same time, my bank account is basically empty, bills are piling up, the English teaching online program deadline is closely approaching with me having completed less than 50% of it, and I've got forced time off for injury.

The worst part is that I combat this indecision and extra free time with video games and surfing reddit/kotaku/internets because I'm so confused as to what I should do, leaving completely unproductive.

What the hell do I do? Do I try to make my programming knowledge functional again for me? Do I pursue some other business venture? Do I use my time to finish the English teaching course? Do I just focus on getting better, working manufacturing, and paying bills? Is there some way I can use my skills that I am missing? I AM SICK OF FEELING USELESS AND BEING A BURDEN ON MY WIFE!!! 

I would appreciate any insight offered.

First off, a short intro on myself: 20 yr old college student who recently lost a bit of weight, gained some self esteem, and started looking for ways to continue to improve myself as a person. Long time lurker, first time poster. Came upon the seduction community a while back and been using the concepts in situations other than dealing with women (some inner/behavioral stuff for my aspiring career goals etc... helped me get the internship of my dreams next summer.. thanks!) and decided to take the next step and use the concepts for what they are ultimately intended for. I've been reading up a lot of what's posted here (yes including the sidebar + listening to videos) and want to put things into practice.

Decided to take this implementation with a small step: being able to make comfortable eye contact with a woman and hold it confidently with a smile until she breaks. I can do the eye contact with people i'm not attracted to during convo or anything well... but with women I think are attractive it's a different story. Trying to get over that.

Problem: When I seek the eye contact, I can pull this off and then roll on. When I do not and it HAPPENS SPONTANEOUSLY (woman and I happen to meet eyes by chance for a second) it always triggers the ""flight"" of the ""fight or flight"" in my brain that i've always been subconsciously (and consciously in the past) doing, and I look away never to look back. I've tried to purposely stop myself from doing this but it's proving difficult because i cannot tell when these spontaneous eye-locks will happen.

It's annoying. Am i too focused on getting over this? Has anybody else had this habit too ingrained? How'd you get it out? Another approach?

Thanks a lot "

I'm a student over at IUS.  Finishing a degree in economics and mathematics.  But after changing majors a half dozen times, I have decided I want to go to grad school for architecture and urban design (urban planning is also a possibility).

I do not have training in architecture, but I am a self educator and a fast learner.  With a bit of guidance I can go a long way.

I am very skilled with computers.  I know programming (c, c++, java), I have also done webdesign and I am familiar with most adobe software, including Photoshop.

Currently I am going through lynda.com tutorials on Revit Architecture(a few more sections to go) and 3ds Max (completed the essential training and moving on to materials and lighting with mental ray training).

I'm trying to get my foot in the door; improve my chances of getting into a good graduate program.  Maybe even find a good firm in Louisville that I can return to once I finish my M.Arch.

I still have a year and a half to finish at IUS, so I could work with someone for almost 2 years before I move on to grad school.

Note: I'd prefer to do urban architecture, not residential homes."

From the time I was in junior high school I really devoted myself to working hard. Ridiculously hard. I've lost whole groups of friends, potential girlfriends and put myself socially quite far behind my peers just to succeed academically. The thought of future success coupled with the idea of making my parents proud drove me.

For a long time this worked out. I've always been an above average student. I did amazingly well in high school, got into a great university, and currently have a tremendous gpa coupled with extensive research and even a corporate internship. All the while I went out occasionally with friends, managed some hook-ups and participated in a varsity, intercollegiate sport.

Then I met the one. The girl who everything just seems right with - the person who you trust beyond anyone else. Long story short: quite a while after we got together, she cheated on me and left. Right as this was falling apart, my best friend passed away. I fell into quite a depression. I forced myself to keep working out and to keep my grades up. While I was crushed and barely capable of leaving my room, my will to succeed academically (and shit tons of whiskey) helped push me through...

Fast forward a year. This semester I applied to ~100 jobs and received about 15 interviews at extremely well respected companies. All of the positions were high paying with full benefits and lots of room for future promotion. Outcome? Zero offers. This has utterly demolished me.

I feel a lot like Dexter right now. Emotionless. Removed from life. The one driving force in my life - my will to succeed academically - has been lost. What's the point in working anymore if I can't get a job? My whole life I was delusional: If I worked my ass off, got good grades, conducted outside research, joined a sports team and got an internship, I was guaranteed to get an amazing job upon graduation. Coupled with this, every relationship I've attempted since last year just falls apart. I'm more than capable of putting on a poker face to look happy and confident to draw girls in, but I quickly lose interest. No one just seems as perfect as that last gf...

So here I am. A jobless, emotionally vacant college student whose only single friends are named Jack Daniels and Mary Jane. I just feel so empty every day. Nothing I try seems to fill the vacancy...I'm just about at the point where I just want to end it. "

eiiqt,2,2010-12-08,Internship dilemma,apatosauruswalrus,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/eiiqt/internship_dilemma/,"Hi Reddit,

I need some advice on my very brief, but confusing career. I'm currently on a gap year after having finished college, planning on doing my masters in the coming year. I decided to use this year to gain some professional experience, landing my first real working experience at a big company as a PR intern. Going into this, I wasn't sure exactly how a PR department operated, but knew I wanted to do something media and communications related. During my interview I was told that interns receive a lot of responsibility, and that I would have a role in creating and managing content.

Fast forward a couple of months later, and I've found that my job involves a buttload of menial tasks (i.e: updating contact information and spreadsheets, uploading images, assembling gift bags for conferences, making birthday cards for board members), that offer little in personal or professional development. While I understand the role of an intern, I also feel that in this case the role that was described to me was slightly embellished, and that I would be able to find something more rewarding and in tune with my interests.

After doing a little research I contacted a small weekly publication, focusing on art/music/movies/events etc, which can possibly offer me the chance to write and produce actual content.

The only thing thats preventing me from quitting the PR gig tomorrow is that I signed on for 6 months. Doing the whole 6 months is out of the question, but I figured I could at least do 4. At the same time, dragging out an internship which I feel is a complete waste of my time at a company in which I see no future with no doors opening up for me, seems futile.

Having said that, it is a good name to have on your resume, and I don't want to leave on bad terms, even if it's merely for the sake of a reference. In general, opportunities around here are few and far between due to me being an English speaker living abroad.


To put it briefly, I understand that this decision probably won't have any long term impact on my future, but if anyone has any advice on the situation it would be much appreciated.

**tldr; Trying to decide whether to leave a PR internship (without pissing anyone off for quitting early) at a biiig company in favour of writing for a tiny little magazine to attain a sense of fulfillment  **"

I loved Android, saw my funds dwindling, and decided to give it a shot.  I stayed up for almost 48 hours in a weekend and pounded out the framework used for most of my apps.

This is finals weeks for me. I go to a prestigious college, consistently ranked in the top 5. I have a shit ton of work to do but i dont have any motivation to do it. I get good grades A- B+ ish. But i just dont feel like doing anything. 

Laying on the bed, i just thought to myself, wow im a disgusting fat fuck. im not fat at all. i use to be a collegiate wrestler and recently quit this year. gained some weight and body fat but im sure im still healthier and more fit than 95% of the population. 

i was thinking to myself wtf am i doing? wasting my friday, smoking, eating and chillin out. i should def be doing something productive. but then i thought to myself why do i feel like i have to be productive? why cant i just enjoy this time and get to work later? then i thought whats the point of all this shitty work? im not that interested in it. im not that interested in much really. i dont have any burning passions or  hobbies. sure i like to hang out, eat good food, play some video games, work out, go out on weekends, try to bang some bitches and normal shit like that but no real desires on what i want to do with my life. 

im an econ psych double major. Im planning to work in the finance industry and am going about the typical path of many kids at my school. going to job recruiting meetings, kissing ass, networking, trying to secure a summer internship that will lead to a full time offer. 

im following this path because i have no clue what i want to do and the jobs pay a shit ton of money, 6 figures for 1st year analysts. 

but whats the point? why do i want to be a baller? stack chedda and slay some bitches? iunno mayun. 

it just got me thinking i have no purpose. whats the point of it? am i suicidal&gt;? no. dont have the balls and never thought of it. but i just feel life is kinda empty. i love smoking weed but am thinking of quitting just cuz i feel so retarded when im high. 

my rooms a mess, i have a shit ton to do. dont know where to start. i dont know how i got into this school but im here hanging and actually doing well. am i smart? far from it. i just know how to play the world. not cheating just knowing what to study whats important. efficiency. came from an urban city. not rich. but not poor. but def my parents cant help me post college. im on my own. have a lot of friends. and few very close ones. ive had gfs. i dont have one now. 

i dont know why im writing this. i dont know if anyone will read it. i question u, if u made it this far. 

whats the purpose of life? why live? why do we work and do the things we do? why do i try so hard in school? why do i care about econometric analysis and the stroop effect? i have to write a lab report on an experiement we did and i think its the most retarded lab and dont wanna do it. 

damn i just wanna smoke, eat some good food, and get my dick sucked and go to sleep.

There'll probably be things missing or out of order a bit, but whatever.  I don't expect anyone to even care enough to read this, just as I don't expect anyone to actually help me or anything.  I can't think of the last time in my life that anything worked out for me, so there's no reason that'd change now.  I don't even know if I'm suicidal or not.  I know I wish I was just... just gone, or elsewhere, or I don't know.

I busted my ass for years to get into a great college.  I'm in the US, so of course I took a large chunk of debt (and threw my family another large chunk) so I could attend; my family has never been more than a lower-middle-class type, and some points we've been close to bankruptcy.  Even with that, they helped me go to a college to study what I had wanted to for years prior.  While there, I determined what exactly it was that I want to do, changed degrees within that program, and graduated with good standing.

I graduated in May 2008, and since then, I have never landed a job better than working food service.  I did everything I could during college to find internships, but I'd always get shafted at the last minute, some way or another, and I could never get one.  It didn't help that my focus wasn't something that particular college did a lot of outreach for.  I graduated and spent a year living with my family, building my portfolio and applying for work, with each application bringing a lower standard for job quality and farther distance from home.  After a year, there was still nothing - in the entire time, I got two declining emails from two companies, and a call from a third also declining my application.  Otherwise, I never heard anything.

With almost no money, I moved back to my college town to get away from my family, which had always been miserable - yelling, swearing, and general discomfort.  I met a great girl there, and since have been living in a shitty apartment with her and a few friends.  The apartment is a shithole, and we're under sports jocks who scream and yell and run all day and night, keeping us awake and raining plaster from the ceiling.  The landlord is a deadbeat, so no help there.

Upon first moving here, I found a dishwashing job and worked it for two months of absolute misery - 14-hour shifts with no breaks allowed for bathroom or eating, standing in two inches of dirty water.  I quit after they cut my hours repeatedly and had me earning so little that I could only afford to eat one meal every two or three days.  I found a ""better"" job at another restaurant, and then transitioned to the attached hotel's banquet hall, where I busted ass for 13 months.  They had me working 60+ hours for minimal pay, and no raises allowed.  My longest nonstop shift was 25 hours; I once worked almost 40 hours in two straight days, where I slept in the kitchen to save time.  I was treated like garbage, but I worked hard and saved up a small amount of money.

I quit that job in October due to job stress causing me to have constant breakdowns (which the managers didn't care about despite me crying and once blacking out).  I've lost hair, and my body has permanent stress-caused injuries (for example, I have no sensation in most of my feet/toes, probably from all the months of working 7-day weeks, 10+ hours each day).  But there was a hope!  I found a new college to attend, and was planning to move to Boston with my girlfriend and another friend.  I lined up a new bachelor's at that college, and was ready to turn my life around - the place was just perfect for me.  They loved me, accepted me, and wanted me to attend, and I had it all going smoothly... until I needed a loan co-signer, and my family refused because their finances are too shaky to sign a loan.  I begged them, but they refused.  I tried every person I knew, but not a single person could reliably offer to sign for the loans I needed.  Even with scholarships and grants, the amount I needed was too high, and at the last minute, I turned it down.  This happened just a few weeks ago, and the move was planned for mid-December.

My girlfriend is also attending the college, and will still be.  My friend is still moving there too.  I can't back out, and the lease was already signed anyway, so now I'll be moving to an extremely expensive city with barely over $2k in savings.  With all this in mind, I buckled down hard and got my portfolio website online, and made some new projects to show.  Even with all that, I have been turned down by every job I applied to.  Then I tried data entry places, and no luck.  I've actually been told that having food service on my resume is bad for me, because it makes them question why I spent time doing crap jobs - makes them think I don't have the drive to get or hold a real job.  I basically wasted my time with those jobs, when I was sure they'd make me seem like a solid worker.  

Now I'm stuck looking at food service jobs, but they don't pay enough for my bills and loans, so I'll need two.  The idea of doing even one food job makes me want to die.  I have not have health insurance in years, and before I lost it when I turned 23, I was already diagnosed with multiple severe sleep disorders, bipolar manic depression, and being pre-diabetic.  I need health insurance, but I sure as hell won't get it working food service!  I know how they operate to make sure employees don't get coverage, and besides, on the pay I'd get, I could never afford it.

I'm about to move to a new place, and immediately watch my life sink to bankruptcy.  I have no family to support me, no savings, and my degree is worthless.  Even my resume is too weak, and every day that goes by is a step closer to being a ""lifer"" in the food service industry.  I would honestly rather die painfully than ever go back to that madness.  My options are so limited though - I check job sites every day to no avail, and the stress is driving me to a breaking point.  I'm an emotionless blob that sits at home nearly crying... I lose time, my hair is still falling out, and I can't sleep or eat right.  As it is now, I've been awake for two days and I can barely eat without feeling ill.

I don't even know what I'm typing this for.  I'm a wreck.  I want to just disappear from all this, but I can't.  By the end of January I'll be out of money, and then what?  Jobs are so scarce, and I'm so miserable that I can't even think about looking for them now.  I just wanted to work an honest job and earn some money so I could live like a human.  I have a goddamn degree, for fuck's sake, but apparently I'm just trash.  I wish that someone could help me.  I swear, I just need those loans signed, but it'll never happen.  Good things don't necessarily happen to good people; maybe I'm one of those people who will never get a chance to be more than a slave, serving food to those who are actually successful.

I suppose I can chat to people if they want.  I tried to be vague since I know a lot of friends use reddit, but if you message me, I can maybe talk more detail or chat on AIM or something.  I dunno.  I doubt anyone is still reading by now... why would you?  I'm just a mess, and you probably have better, more important things to be doing.

EDIT: I hope people don't think I'm just here to beg or pester them or whatever.  I felt this was a better place to post for some helpful words than something like /r/Self... the last thing I want is a ton of upvotes turning me into some ridiculous circle-jerk front page charity case, so this seemed to make more sense.  I apologize if I was wrong."

ek519,0,2010-12-11,Can I just say this. WTF is so great about democracy in the first place?,DrewChambersDC,politics,https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/ek519/can_i_just_say_this_wtf_is_so_great_about/,"There have been a lot of posts lately about how someone is scared for the future of democracy and how we ""supposedly"" live in a democracy. But I just want to get something off my chest. We shouldn't be fighting to preserve democracy, democracy is an archaic system that will one day be looked at on the same level as monarchies in the ""I can't believe people used to do that"" systems of governance. What we should be doing is taking our anger at the current state of American politics and somehow channeling it into working towards creating a new system that will actually help our country. 

Think about it, democracy allows for the oppression of the minority by the majority. What concepts become policy? Good ideas? Ideas with the best scientific backing? No. Popular ones. The ones the majority thinks are right. And not the majority of Americans, referendums aren't taken on most issues, it's the majority of a handful of people with the same majors in college that most of us have nothing in common with. It's amazing how flawed this system is.

EXAMPLE: I used to intern for ChooseResponsibility (The primary advocate group for eliminating the 21 year old drinking age) and it's mind boggling just how terrible America's alcohol policy is. The National Minimum Drinking Age Act is one of the dumbest laws that we've ever passed. How did it get passed? It was voted on, and seen as bad politics to oppose. 

A law was passed, taking rights away from American citizens, based on a GUESS that raising the drinking age to 21 would reduce the amount of alcohol related traffic fatalities. We now have overwhelming statistical evidence that this is NOT the case. The presumption that the law was based on has been found to be FALSE. A law that is completely hypocritical (you can be prosecuted as a legal adult for minor in possession of alcohol), completely detrimental (wastes so many resources) and universally ignored, is allowed to persist... HOW? Well if you take a poll of Americans, most of them support the 21 year old drinking age... HOW? Well because it doesn't effect them. Most of America's population is over the age of 21, more than half of them could drink at 18, the law has no visible effect on them so they are complacent in its existence. The only people who are effected are a small minority group (18-21 year old drinkers) who get completely dicked by a terrible law that is allowed to exist only because of democracy.

EXAMPLE 2: The TSA full-body scanners. A moral panic can cause our elected representatives to vote that we need to implement these in every airport. That's democracy, peoples opinions can be swayed based on talking points ""we need to keep our country safe"" and that's all it takes to implement policy. Wouldn't it be better if we had a system where before a significant expenditure could ever be implemented its merits had to be proven?
Ok that's great you want to spend $300 million on these body scanners. Now instead of showing me how it works and voting on it, go run a trial at seven different airports and prove to me that they're needed / a valid expenditure.

What's that? After a five month trial person B who ran an experiment with just metal detectors had the exact same rate of terrorism prevention (100%), was more efficient in moving bodies through his airport, and did it cheaper. I'm sorry but the full body scanners cannot at this time be justified no matter how many people think they're necessary.

This is just my opinion and hopefully will spurn some meaningful discussion, but I just have never understood why people care so much about preserving democracy. Democracy isn't the endgame of political systems of governance, clearly we all have anger at the way the US government works. I just think instead of trying to ""take back our country"" and ""save our democracy from the government"" we could think of how to create a new system where these grievances we have could never arise.

tl;dr - Democracy is a flawed system that allows for the oppression of the minority opinion. Instead of fighting to preserve it we should work to create a system where ideas of the highest proven quality get implemented instead of popular ones."

Do I try to get her back?,dumped554,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ek53k/girlfriend_dumped_me_do_i_try_to_get_her_back/,"Background info: We dated for 10 months. The first time we kissed she was dating someone else. (I knew, yes I'm a jerk) We made out a couple times after that, then she dumped him and started dating me a couple days later. Her previous boyfriend was her first and they dated for about 4 years. They were long distance and she just didn’t like him anymore. We are both in college, I'm 21, she's 20.

2 days ago she randomly told me she wanted to take a break. Our college semester is over next week and she didn't want to talk for a couple weeks during our college break/vacation. I tried finding out why she wanted a break but she only said we were fighting alot and a bunch of little things made her unhappy. She couldn’t mention a single specific thing. She said that we weren't getting along this semester and she wanted us to be like we were last year. She didn't want us to hookup with other people during our break but she told me she couldn't tell me what to do during the break.

After arguing for a while I agreed to try a break starting next week. I tried to talk about what was wrong instead of taking a break but she wasn't interested. After agreeing to the break she asked me how she could cheer her up. I jokingly said anal and she actually gave it a try minutes later even though we never did it before. The day before she brought up the break she also let me cum in her mouth for the first time and let me film us having sex. Right after I finished taping, she told me to delete it because she didn’t want me to show it to friends if anything happened. (but she was fine with random people she didn’t know seeing it..go figure)

I stayed up all night after the conversation working on a project for finals due the next morning. I couldn't sleep at all worrying about our relationship. Yesterday, I told her I wanted to talk. We argued about having the break and then I asked if she was still my girlfriend. Crying she told me no. I asked her if she wanted to make this a break, and she no, said it was a breakup.

I'm really not sure what to do. Once, during thanksgiving vacation she told me that she was drinking with a couple of her girlfriends. I asked if her ex was coming and she told me no. (Her friend is good friends with her ex.) Late at night she sends me a text saying ""the guys are here"". I ask her to call, and she does. She cries on the phone and says she is staying upstairs and doesn't want to talk with her ex. I'm annoyed because it turns out that she found out the ex was coming when she arrived at her friend’s house. She claims they just talked in a group for a minute then she went upstairs to avoid them. I wake up the next morning and see that they are friends on facebook.  

I’m just really upset about the whole thing. After finals I’m looking at my last semester of college. Pretty much all of our friends are in the same friend group. I’m worried I won’t be able to hang out with them if things don’t work out. I still want to be with her but I’m not sure what I should do. I’ve been thinking about texting her to talk sine we’ve broke up. I’m good friends with her suitemate (she’s dating one of my roommates) and she is going to talk to her today. 

edit: She did say that our fights made her unhappy and that we fought too much. A mutual friend said our fights were pretty average and we always resolved them within an hour. Her other complaint, which she mentioned during our relationship was that I was snappy sometimes.

In 2 weeks I'll be moving into my brothers apartment (He'll be away for 2 weeks but his housemates will be around) for my semester break to continue working at a F500 company I had an internship at last summer. Maybe I'll have fun going to West Hartford bars/clubs. I haven't been to bars too much because I've been dating her before I turned 21. I know everyone says to end it, but I feel like if I hook up with someone, that we will be done forever.

Also I'm worrying about my friend group because the group is a few of my guy friends (my roommate is dating her friend) and girls she has known since freshman year. It's not as simple as just keeping the friends we had before the relationship because our group consists of both of our friends and I became friends with her girl friends before I even met her. "

I have to find a way to pay for books next semester, depending on what my car costs I can probably afford it but it will seriously deplete my bank account. This xmas I was planning on getting computer parts to replace my gaming rig that died 1.5 years ago(i was going to have to put a little money into it, not the smartest idea on a limited budget but i really needed a pick me up), but with my car having issues I can't do that anymore.

My parents have been having their own issues and haven't been able to help me since my freshman year with money(half way through Jr year now). My dad got a new job and they said they should be able to help out next semester. I love my parents to death, but I'm not counting on it.

On top of that I royally screwed myself in a class. i went to the hospital the night before a test. only got 4 hours of sleep and took the test anyway I should NOT have, but I slept through my class and ran to the next class and just made a horrible judgement call. Talked to the Prof he said there is nothing he can do but if I do good on the final he will consider that into my second test score. only problem is his questions are set up so that the smallest is worth 5 out of 100 so i miss one question and thats a 95%. I can get a C if I ace the final but given past tests and quizzes doesn't seem likely.

The amount of stuff I have to know for my other finals is mind boggling and I will be spending all week studying.

I am trying to find an internship this summer with no luck so far school can't help me. I am just so stressed out. Even after finals I have 5 days till I know what my grades/ GPA is and I just want to know now.  What do you do when your stressed?

ekjgu,48,2010-12-12,Ophthalmology,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/ekjgu/ophthalmology/,"I'll start by saying I have a very skeptical viewpoint of the supernatural. My parents are both fiercely religious as well as superstitious (perhaps you'll say that's redundant, ha) but I'm almost always an agnostic and I don't think I believe in ghosts.

That said, I'd like to tell you about an unsettling experience of mine.

My sophomore year at university I applied and was accepted as an intern in an ophthalmology lab. The position was unpaid, 15 hrs a week, performing cell counts. It was hardly interesting work, but necessary for a premed student to get lab experience.

The lab was in a converted hospital. That sounds ominous I know, but actually the section where I spent my time was a maternity ward, so it should have been filled with happy thoughts, right? The actual work we did, however, was a little creepy. We were testing compounds to try and find a way to decrease cell death and increase cell regeneration after crush of the optic nerve. We did this by surgically crushing the nerve of adult beagles, treating them, then putting them down and harvesting the retinas. My job was to take pictures of the retina, and quite literally count the cells under a microscope.

I had an almost immediate negative predisposition to my coworkers. They were irritable, impatient, and disrespectful even towards each other. They also seemed almost bafflingly incompetent. Equipment and samples were often lost, refrigerators would be left open or unplugged spoiling compounds, even data would occasionally get deleted. In hindsight, considering the frequency of these events, I should have thought it odd that no one had proposed the possibility of a poltergeist in the lab, but that would have required a modicum of humor between us, which I can assure you there was none.

As a result of these tensions, and the fact that my work was solitary, it wasn't long before I started keeping odd hours to avoid my colleagues. I'd come in around 6:00pm and work for 8 hours, twice a week. Since I was alone I'd play a book on tape or a netflix instant movie, and the experience would be largely more pleasurable without the bickering and conflict that defined the lab's daylight hours.

At least it was at first. I can only imagine it was the movies and books that kept me unaware for so long, but a few weeks before the holiday interim I let payment on my netflix account lapse. That night while I worked in silence I experienced a few sensations that I consider to be truly unexplainable.

It started fairly early in the evening. The dogs had already been fed, and I could hear them shuffling about and occasionally yipping from the kennel. It was already dark out, and the wind was whipping like it only really does in the winter, rattling the old glass panes of the windows. I left my desk to refill a water bottle. Upon stepping into the long hallway of the wing I was immediately hit with a nervousness. At first I didn't know to what to attribute it, when it struck me I almost called the lab supervisor. First, there was not a sound in the whole lab. No vibrations of washers, no spinning centrifuges, not even the gentle hum of computers. Secondly, every single door, dozens, was unlocked, and flung wide open on its hinges.

Instead, I quickened my pace. As I walked past room after room I noticed their interiors sickeningly dark, as if they could not be penetrated by the light from the hall. As I neared the fountain even the dogs had fallen silent, the hall's only sounds my footsteps. I began filling my bottle, only to drop it, startled, as I heard from the kennel a single impossibly simultaneous bark, from each dog. Not a bark, or really a growl, it sounded wet and I don't know how else to explain it.

At this point I was scared, and I was alone, so I dropped my bottle where I stood and ran. There's something about running down a hallway, try sometime at night, the hallway stretches and the running makes you afraid.

I spent the rest of the night rigidly at my desk. I don't know if it was in my head, or reality, but I felt at the time quite certain that there was a single shadow in the room that didn't belong, flitting outside my vision. Anyone who's worked in a lab like me, or perhaps a library, knows how you can feel after hours of silence, under a flickering fluorescent light. I stood up only once, to spin around and catch it, and immediately sat back down, knocked back by the screech of the autoclave's steam relief. I swear, I almost died at that moment.

I came into the lab again the next day. No one mentioned the unlocked doors. I can only imagine tests left to run over night were re-prepared, and run again during the day. People were irritable as usual, but there was no mention of things out of the ordinary. We did have one visit, a grad student who worked further down the wing walked by the labroom I was working in, no doubt to speak with my supervising professor. When passing by the room she stopped dead in her tracks, mouth agape, and stared first past me, then looking me straight in the eyes, before continuing.

A half an hour later the fire alarm went off. Grumbling, the lab workers shuffled out, we stood in the cold, then started to funnel back into the staircase to the ophthalmology wing. Thats when I saw her again, the staring grad student. She was standing at the mouth of the stairway, scanning the crowd. Her eyes finally landed on me, and she motioned me into a side hallway. Curious, I followed.

When we had moved a sufficient distance away from the grumpy crowd to talk I gave her a smile and asked how I could help her. She seemed not to hear me, gazing over my right shoulder she asked ""Have you lost an relatives lately? An older man? Or anyone close to you?"" I responded no and she quickly followed up with ""Has anyone you know of passed away that may have a special interest in you?"" I was mostly amused, a little spooked by her questions. ""No, why?""

What she told me next was stated with such matter of fact confidence, and followed by her immediate departure, I was left accepting it on default for moments before my skeptical brain could kick in. ""There's a dead man behind you, he's a ghost. One arm outstretched he's been pointing at you all morning.""

I've never believed in psychics, although I had before this point had one odd encounter. On a elementary school field trip a chaperone had turned to a friend of mine, eyes glassy, and abruptly said ""your dog is dead"". Afterwards she denied saying this, but sure enough... The dog had been struck by a car. When it didn't come to the door when called, even into the night, he was terrified. It was found the next day by the cloud of flies, it had dragged itself under the porch and died.

After returning to the crowd of people unevacuating the building, I purposefully pushed my way in to avoid standing next to the girl I had dubbed crazy. I returned to my lab room, and sat at my computer. Behind me two grad students were fighting. The argument, over another missing sample, grew louder than average. In fact, one girl turned to the other and actually rose her voice to a shout, and at the exact moment a glass cabinet shattered, pouring beakers and cylinders to the floor. Both grads students immediately stood quietly. One whispered ""Fuck this place"" and then walked out without making any attempt at cleaning.

It was that statement that pushed me over the edge. It was as if they knew, they knew there was something completely insane about the lab, and were resigned to it. I never came back to the lab at night. I worked two more weeks, frequently peering over my shoulder, and scampering quickly past the kennel on my trips to the bathroom, and then I left. I've not had any contact with the people I left behind, and for all I know they are continuing their business.

Whether anything I experienced represents a haunting, or a disturbance, or just paranoia and crappy employees, I have no idea. I tell people I quit because my coworkers were lousy. But there's definitely more to it than that, and I wont step in that building again."

Over the last few months, we have fought a lot and have ""broken up"" a handful of times, despite my plea that labeling us with 'girlfriend' &amp; 'boyfriend' titles has done nothing but put unneeded pressure on our relationship.

I don't want to come off as an cocky insidious prick, but a lot of our problems stem from our difference in intelligence. Simply, she struggled with (but had the determination to get through) a very easy college curriculum at an entry-level school. I have had a generally easy time with a very technical major that led me to internships in multiple ivy league research labs.

I feel that her inability to approach things from a practical and reasonable point of view is the root of many of of our problems. But, this might be the engineer in me speaking.

She is, also, my first real girlfriend. This is a classic 'high school sweetheart' kind of situation. 

Yet, I love her a lot. But this relationship is becoming increasingly frustrating. Is it right for me to break up with her because of this?

I started writing this without anticipating how long it could become. So, I decided to stop here.

I feel that I have generalized a little bit and that we are both very complicated multi-faceted individuals. Perhaps take this post with a grain of salt.

elmjr,1,2010-12-14,"In one week, I can light up once more; How I experienced my break from smoking up.",Possimbable,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/elmjr/in_one_week_i_can_light_up_once_more_how_i/,"Hey fellow Ents.

I'm a Dutchie that smokes quite some when I'm back home, but I've been doing an internship in Munich the last 4 months. While living here, I smoked up once in 4 months. I'd like to share with my fellow Ents how I experienced it!


I've been lurking around trees for about 4 months now, and in that time I've smoked one spliff (which was about 3 months ago). I've been sober for a few reasons, the first being that it's just too hard to get and expensive here. Since Munich apparently does not have that much criminality, the police can focus on small offenses such as people smoking them marijuana's. 

Secondly, since I have to work from 9-18 every day, I've found that smoking weed just makes it a whole lot harder to get up and be focused all day. I have kind of proved to myself that I do not really need it, although I kind of miss it at times. Funniest thing is that I made a list of things that I have to do, watch or play when I am high, because sometimes people tell me about a movie, game or whatever and I just think it would be so much better when high so I just add it to the list of things to do when I get back to NL. Another thing, which surprised me, is that apart from the times I smoke alone, it feels a whole lot different smoking with the people here than it is to smoke with my friends at home. This is another reason I'm looking forward to smoking with my friends again rather than trying to get some shit to smoke here. 

So in 7 days, I'll be heading home, and I can say I'm fucking eager to light a big spliff with my friends and eat and play videogames all night. I've also noticed that I started smoking (yeah, I'm starting to notice small things like this now I'm sober, haha!) as a substitute for spliffs, which I can hopefully stop doing aswell when I'm back. I have to hold on for 1 week more, but I have a whole period of eating, chilling, vacation, spliffs and skateboarding to look forward to.


In this time, /r/trees has had 2 effects on me. one: I love weed more. The atmosphere here is so great that I'm starting to notice the difference between stoners and sober people more and more, in a positive way. But, all this stoner talk and all these times I've laughed and thought “Oh man, I do that all the time when high.“ has made it harder for me not to smoke. But, I made it, and I'm going to celebrate it next week. Because of this, I love you guys (,and I hate you guys a little for making it hard not to smoke... But mostly love)! I'm not sure anyone gives a damn about this (Edit: Or has the energy to read all this!), but I just felt like sharing my experience. :)

TLDR;
Dutchie lived in Munich for 4 months without smoking, happy he goes back home and can smoke again in 1 week!"

My preference is to work either in the North West or North East at a creative branding/marketing agency (mainly because I enjoy working in creative agencies), and I'm ideally looking to work on multiple apps (not just one) and get good exposure to different types of apps (games, core data, etc).

I do not want to be working on one app, nor do I feel I would enjoy a role that is primarily aimed at maintenance of existing apps.

I've looked on quite a few forums, websites and Twitter; but a lot of them want commercial experience, or apps in the app store.

I'm open to internships. I notice there is a lot of internships/junior iphone gigs in the US; its something I'm looking at, but I'm conscious of the fact that my lack of commercial experience does hinder me.

With this in mind, I'm hoping by posting on reddit will at least point me in the right direction."

It's been great working with this company, but they have only put up one of their researchers for once a week 20 minute phone calls, and my thesis adviser is not an expert in the subject I'm working in.  I've been teaching myself these skills, and worked out the algorithm myself.

AMA.,actuarial_student,IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/enwld/iama_new_hire_in_the_actuarial_development/,"Been a pretty long journey to get to this point for me. I graduated with a math degree (and CS minor) and a 3.1 GPA from a well known and respected state university in Dec 2008. I had also passed Exam P in Sep 08.

I tried looking for jobs before/after graduating and could not even get a phone call. It was one of the most frustrating and discouraging times in my life. It was pretty hard going from living on my own for 4 years to being unemployed and living with my parents again. I didn't give up, I really wanted to get into the profession so I was studying for the next exam and applied to graduate school for Actuarial Science. I got accepted, passed exam FM in May 09, and started school in Sep 09.

I didn't try to take another exam during my first semester (which was a mistake) but they did bring in a few companies so I managed to get an internship for the Spring 10 semester (not the greatest company in the world, but it was something and they paid in the form of a scholarship for school). In the spring I was taking 2 classes, working 20 hours a week, and studying for another exam (MFE).

I also interviewed for internship positions at other companies for the summer. I got an internship at the company I am currently at now (a large life insurance company), which paid me real money (as an intern I made more than most people with full time jobs). I started in May 10 and found out I passed MFE in July (and got a raise for it). In late July, they asked if I'd like to stay on part time as an intern while I finished up school. I agreed.

This semester I took 4 classes, was working about 30 hours a week, and was studying for another exam (MLC). I took MLC in November and am waiting for the results now (though I'm not hopeful). I had a couple of interviews this semester and was offered jobs at both of them, as well as the company I am with now. I decided to stay with the company I am with now and am starting full time mid-January.

I am almost done with finals and finished interning a couple of days ago. This semester I probably worked about 65-70 hours a week between work, school, and studying. Now I basically have a four week vacation and a decent amount of money to saved up to float me until I start working again.

**TL;DR - After 2 years of working hard, studying a lot, and a lot of hopelessness, I have a very good paying job as an actuarial student. AMA about the exam process, my decisions, or anything else really.**"

eosjm,2,2010-12-20,21-year-old college student needs advice on future job/living situation,ellydee,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/eosjm/21yearold_college_student_needs_advice_on_future/,"Hey guys I'd really appreciate some advice on my future job/living situation. This is a little complicated so bear with me.

Some background: I am a 21-year-old college student with very little money in the bank. After all the bills I am expected to pay at this time of year I will probably be more in debt than ever. Currently, I work during breaks while I’m home. I just recently found out that my job will be cutting my hours and I will not be able to get full-time hours during the times I am home. Instead, I will only be able to work about 4 days per week. On top of all this, I have not been getting paid what I am “worth” for the past 1-1.5 years. I am in a graduate degree program with intern status and should be making a bit more than I am (2-3 more dollars per hour). For these reasons, I have decided to quit my current job as soon as I’ve secured employment in the city where I’m attending college. Previously I could afford to not work while at college so I could focus on my studies, but that just isn’t cutting it for me anymore. My problem is where to live this summer.

My parents would prefer that I stay home during my breaks so I don’t have to take out more loans to pay for housing. This would be nice, except that I do not have a place to stay in my house anymore. In September, they gave my room away to my 18-year-old brother and now I am sleeping on an air mattress downstairs with no place to put any of my belongings and little to no privacy. I don’t want to seem like a spoiled brat, but this is just not what I am used to. I feel like they no longer have room for me in their house, yet expect me to have no issues staying here for long periods of time. Specifically, they want me to stay here for 4 months over the summer. They have offered to kick my brother out of my old room and have him share a room with my other brother for the summer, so that I can have my room back for 4 months. I don’t think this is fair at all and I really don’t want to take my brother’s new room away from him.

As I see it, my options are:

(a)	Stay at home, suck it up, live rent-free and have my job in college city (assuming I can find employment) transfer me to a store near hometown. Spend the summer living with my family but sleeping on an air mattress.

(b)	Live in college city working at new job, pay rent for the summer, have a room and privacy, not see family as much.

I’m having a hard time deciding how to weigh the pros and cons on this one. I’m wondering if there is a way to do this that I haven’t thought of yet. Any advice is appreciated."

Brief summary on myself.  I graduated from UC Irvine in 2009 with honors in Biomedical Engineering.  I ended up in recruiting due to the shitty market and my general lack of interest in engineering after doing several projects and internships.  I've been a Redditor since high school (2004-ish) and I love the community.

I like what I do and I do it pretty well.  I can code in several scripting languages (python, C/C++, Javascript, HTML, CSS) so my background is completely different than most of the other recruiters out there.

I work for a large and well established firm and I sit in downtown San Francisco.  I know a lot of the community is in IT and here in the Bay Area so I wanted to give back.  I'll answer any questions to the best of my ability.

The company I work for, AYC Media, is seeking college interns to write and produce content for our website aroundphilly.com and heyphilly.com. We are looking for English and Communication majors, and verbally gifted artists, graphic designer. Below is the official intern listing. But feel free to private message me. Our website, aroundphilly.com, is about to be re-designed to a hipper, more youthful blog format, featuring music and art reviews so this is great chance to get in on the ground floor of a brand new website venture. 

Some things you should be able to do:
-Photoshop
-Video Editing
-Own a working laptop
-Good people skills to interview
-maintain a good grasp on trending events, stories, viral media
-be a cool person
-Ability to write quickly and be funny and interesting
-Reliable
-professional
 


A local nightlife and city guide is looking for a stellar intern to join our team.

This is a highly competitive promotions and editorial internship in a fun, fast-paced creative environment.

Interns work along side our top editors and designers creating content, pitching ideas, taking videos, researching and interviewing on the streets of Philadelphia and streamlining information. We have a lot going on this semester and need a good deal of responsible and creative interns/street team members. This internship can be as big as you make it. This is a non-paying internship but students will get credit and recommendations... and maybe tickets to some of our local sports partners, if you really impress us.

CREATING CONTENT
We are looking for talented writers who don't take themselves too seriously. Someone who uses their knowledge of politics, media, gossip, local news, trends, pop-culture jokes and national headlines to craft reverent, witty and smart articles about the serious and superficial things people are interested in.

MANAGING NEW MEDIA
You're probably already using Facebook and Twitter, and maybe even FourSquare. But with thousands of new location-based marketing and networking applications out there, it's hard to keep track. We need staff members who can keep their ears to the ground on the latest and greatest in what people are using to access what we're doing - sweepstakes, mobile applications, deals/specials at various local venues and more.

FILMING AND PHOTOGRAPHY
We are taking steps in a new direction with our articles, given the recent decrease in newspaper/magazine readership. So while we still need journalists looking for newsy and reverential clips, we need to incorporate more videos. Our interns are out in Philadelphia interviewing bartenders, chefs and store owners on camera. These videos are included within your review/article.

ATTENDING, PLANNING &amp; POSTING EVENTS
As an editorial team member, we also ask you keep us in the loop of fun events (college, dance, film, music, underground-- anything). You will have to pitch and post events, as well as attend some events to take photos and mingle with the crowds who are probably daily readers of our website.

Requirements include:
Determination and drive
Communications, English Marketing or PR major or minor
Detail-orientated and perfectionism
Creative thinking and passion to be involved in all processes

Our audience averages 155,000 unique visitors, reaches 500,000 sessions and registers over 6.5 million hits per month. Powered by AYC Media, Heyphilly.com is the premier online nightlife and entertainment guide in the Delaware valley.

Please submit your resume, a writing sample and the reasons why we should give you this internship spot to: chrisl@aycmedia.com


Preferred majors: English, Comm, Marketing, PR"
epgs1,7,2010-12-21,Is exam grading/curving this bad at most Uni's?,CrimsonVim,ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/epgs1/is_exam_gradingcurving_this_bad_at_most_unis/,"I just completed my BSE and I just started a good job at a company I've already had 3 internships with, and I feel like I was generally pretty successful throughout college and was very involved in multiple aspects of college life. But the one thing I could never understand was the idea of professors who design [engineering] exams for a 50%(ish) average score. As an example, one of the classes I just finished was an intro VLSI design course and as many of you know, that covers a wide variety of topics throughout the semester and the pace is pretty fast. I felt like I knew the material pretty well and the professor was a guy I knew well and liked his teaching style very much. But I was still very nervous about the exams because I know he likes to design them around the 50% average, so that the top students ""have a chance to show how much they studied/learned"" or something like that. So I took the exam, and as I feared, it was extremely hard - one of the toughest I have taken, with both short answer theory questions and long, multiple-part technical/math/calculation/sketching questions. Walking away from the test I had this nasty feeling in the pit of my stomach because even though I felt I was well prepared for the test, the sheer amount and breadth of material on the exam was out of control, and many questions were ""application"" type questions that I had never seen before and required very high level thinking to understand what the question was asking and how to apply multiple concepts we learned to answer it. The average ended up being 55% for a class of about 25 students, and I got a 64% which was toward the upper end of the scores (I think 70 was the highest in the class). I ended up getting an A in the class and yet I don't feel accomplished at all, knowing that I only answered slightly more than half of the material on the exam correctly. I guess my question is, do most Unis do it this way and does anyone else feel discouraged about this method? I really can't wrap my head around this."

eq1lv,1,2010-12-22,Feeling down and lonely,DownAgain,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/eq1lv/feeling_down_and_lonely/,"Hey, Reddit.  I guess this is my first actual post, despite the throwaway.  Not really sure why I'm writing this.  I realize a lot of this is gonna seem petty compared to a lot of the other stuff on here, and reading about how this community helps people out does make me feel better.
But I guess I've just been really down lately.  I've never exactly had a large group of friends, but my girlfriend (of several years) broke up with me a few months ago (I still miss her, or maybe just miss being in a LTR), and turns out a lot of the ""friends"" I'd been hanging out with the last few years were really just hers.  I haven't heard from them since.  My job pays decent, but I'm not sure it's really what I even want to do, and despite working here for awhile and having a degree and a brain, I'm basically treated like an intern.

I'm starting grad school just because I want to improve my situation some, but it's a pretty broad major with a lot of options for concentration and I really don't even know what I'd want to go into, if any area of it at all.  I don't feel like I have much of a passion for or am good at any one thing.

On top of that, I'm almost 30 and still living at home.  I've been looking at apartments and can probably afford it, but to be honest I'm kind of scared of the idea of being completely alone in a new place when I basically have no one to talk to or visit or help out or anything.  Some nights when I'm down I just find myself looking through my facebook or AIM list for somebody to talk to and just can't find anyone I'd even feel comfortable talking to (mostly just some acquaintances I don't really see or even talk to anymore).

I don't think I'm especially shy or hard to get along with or anything, it's just hard meeting new people or finding the motivation to Do anything when you don't have much of a foundation to begin with or people to go out with.  I don't really think I'm looking for advice or help or anything, I don't know.. but thanks for listening and letting me get it out there."

Microsoft is always hiring, and if you're a college student, I highly recommend applying for an internship. Even if you don't want to work here full time, it was a great experience for me, and I learned more in a 3 month internship than I did in a year of school.

As a side note, I just wanted to mention that I've been watching the various ""AMAs"" that Microsoft has been posting (like the one from the IE team), and I just want everyone to understand that the official AMA stuff you see have very few responses written by developers. Everything is posted or filtered by middle-management types, which is why they always seem ""fake"". One of the reasons I wanted to do another AMA is so that anyone who was annoyed by those AMAs could ask me anything they want and I'll be as honest and straightforward as possible.

eq2s3,5,2010-12-22,Is it time to forget about this girl? [long distance Germany - Canada],dreamsofastronomy,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/eq2s3/is_it_time_to_forget_about_this_girl_long/,"Okay, Ill begin with a little background.

I´m 26, living in Germany and had been with a Canadian girl for close to 3 years until last September. She was an Au pair here and had 1.5 years together here in germany, and the rest was long distance. We´ve put up with a lot to make it work. In those last 1.5 years of our relationship we were able to make about 4 trips over the ocean seeing each other a few weeks. i always paid the tickets and did everything in my power to make it work...

She is 21 now and very good looking. Probbaly a 9, while im more of a 7.

So this summer she was able to stay here for an internship for 3 months...  things started out a little rough but we got back into our groove after about a month or so. But by the end of the trip everything was super lovy-dovy again, she said I wasn´t gonna be the one who got  away etc. we made plans for me to come over in october and pull on through until next September (2011, when we will both have our education finished, Im grad student, shes a social worker).

Now as soon as she goes back and we are apart again, she will close up and its almost like talking to a concrete wall...  she says she does it to protect herself. But we actually make some decent heartfelt phone conversations before i go on a 2 week trip to france/spain.
As soon as I come back shit hits the fan. I get an email telling me she cant do it anymore and wants a break. Its all too hard on her. A chain reaction ensues. I call her and get quite mad cos well duh..  what a change of policy. We both say pretty rough things. But especially hard stuff comes from her.
she eventually says: ""I feel like I need your permission to break up with you"". I burst in fucking tears (hasnt happened in years). and im sitting there crying not comprehending wtf is happening. we hang up. And silence for 3 months. I tried really hard to keep the distance and let her figure out what mistake she has made.
2 months in though, I was pretty sure this was all over and altough thinking about her constantly I decide its time to go out a lot and make new aquaintances. I go on a few dates with kisses but really I´m just trying to distract myself. 
So come the three months apart she calls me in the middle of the night telling me how she had to think of me constantly and misses me so bad she wants to get back together and made a terrible mistake.
I tell her I need to think about it and will call her next week.
When I make the call she seems to have changed her mind again, telling me her phone call was a stupid idea and she doesn´t know what she wants. (I was and still am willing to get back together.
Oh yea, she also asked me if I had been seing anyone. Being honest I said I had been on a few dates but nothing serious. And that I did so because I was sure of us being through.



So last night after a bottle of wine I miss her once again and call her to see how things are. She seems to be real uninterested and tries to let me go after like 5 mins or so. she then does go on asking me about my mums and my neighbors address so she can send them christmas gifts, while mentioning I wont get anything because we are seperated and dnot have anything to say to each other.

I am incredibly disappointed and angry. And if I didnt love the girl so much i wouldnt bother any further.
However I know that everytime we are together (in the same place) its almost picture perfect. But as soon as we are apart being in our countries she closes down like concrete.

Help me reddit. I need to make a decision for myself. should I avoid contact and just get her out of my head? Is it time to let go?
She is in my thoughts constantly and I miss the times we had everyday. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

PS: Long time lurker, first post...   Hope I´m doing it right.

edit: oh, did I mention we even considered marrying bout a year ago...   what a  rollercoaster ride it has been :-/"
eqdbm,14,2010-12-23,Do people really move up in a corporate world or is it just a whole bunch of bullshit?,TheGraduate83,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/eqdbm/do_people_really_move_up_in_a_corporate_world_or/,"Hello Reddit,

I have been a lurker for two years but I never posted anything until today. This may be a long post, but I need your help here, reddit.

There is a question that has been bothering me and I think that reddit is the only community that can answer it. This is what keeps me up at nights, so here it goes…

I am going to graduate with a master's degree in engineering this coming spring and was wondering: 

Do people really move up in a corporate world or is it just a whole bunch of bullshit fed to us in order to make us work harder? 

I have been in the engineering world for 4.5 years, and from personal experience, I will have to say no. I have worked at different places, and there always seems to be a plateau that one can reach and then you cannot go any further! And that level that one can reach is actually shit work, with maybe 20% increase in pay over starting pay. For example, the furthest you can go is a ""team lead"", or ""project manager"" which is pretty much the responsibility of a boss, but with the authority of a grunt. 

It seems to me that companies don't grow people nowadays. They hire ""experts"" with ""industry experience"" outside of the company that end up being our bosses. Let me tell you my personal story with the most recent bio-tech company that I worked for which grew tremendously over the past two years. The executive management did not promote people but hired directors and team leads outside of the company in order to bring ""expertise"" from the industry. These new bosses and directors were pretty much clueless about what we did, they did not even care; all they did was talk bullshit industrial lingo and argue with us. In the end, because of their incompetence, we missed two FDA deadlines, we missed two grants, and the executive management ended up laying-off 30% of its workforce while keeping most of the idiots that caused the failure in the first place on board. I hear about shit like that all the time. 

So here is my final question to you:
Have you or have you not moved up in your company in the past 5, 10, 20 years doing corporate office work engineering, accounting, business, etc? Have you gotten a better pay, better benefits, more responsibility, and more recognition? How much more pay to responsibility did you get(pay to responsibility, eg. Becoming a boss for 5% pay increase is not a good deal)? Has anyone of you ever made it into executive management by working hard, by working smart, by hitting deadlines, by developing the company, by being nice and getting along with coworkers? Has anyone ever become a big executive pimp raking in at least $300k with options after 10 to 20 years of hard work? How long have you worked in the industry and what has your percentage pay increase been over your starting pay?

I will be fine with either answer. It would be really nice to talk to me about your corporate experiences because that way I can know and I can concentrate my energies towards things that matter. I would like to become financially independent, as anyone on here. But if I cannot do it through the corporate world, then I'd like to explore my options.

Thank you.

-------------------------
edit1: I was literally amazed by how many replies this post has gotten in such a short time. Based on what I have gotten so far, the best way succeed in the corporate world is to:


1. Kiss ass and suck **** as much as you can in order to be considered for the next promotion.
2. Be fair and play nice with the right people.
3. Change companies for a better pay and position. Or come back for even more pay.
4. Love your job, over-deliver and hope that the opportunity will present itself. It sometimes does.
5. Pimp Pay with corner office not likely in 5 to 10 years, maybe after 15 to 20+ years of hard and smart work

This post turned out better than expected. I wasn't expecting many positive comments about the corporate world, but it turns out I was wrong. Tell me more guys, I need more personal experiences and examples!

------------------------------
edit2: There seems to be a confusion on here about my own carrier path. I worked for the same company in 3 different departments and buildings over the course of 4.5 years. I went from intern, to technician, to engineer with every promotion adding $10k to my pay. But I could have just gotten that same pay as an engineer right out of school anyways. I just worked at that company before I even graduated with my BS degree."

Just for background info - I probably won't use programming as a math major, but some of the research I'm looking into doing for summer internships recommends knowing *something*. But it's not required, and I fulfill other optional requirements, so I'm not worried that it'll hinder me completely. I just want to learn something because it'll be useful/practical/fun.

erzlp,3,2010-12-27,Dear Redditors: You all seem relatively smart. Help me decide where to work this summer? ,throwoutacnt,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/erzlp/dear_redditors_you_all_seem_relatively_smart_help/,"This summer I have been offered two internships and circumstances make the decision a toughy. One is located in Silicon Valley, and the other is located in Irvine, CA.

I grew up in Southern California (Coto de Caza area) and was offered the internship in Irvine through mere connections. I'm only a second year Electrical Engineering student so I would be living at home (probably for the last time) if I interned in Irvine... but if I took the Silicon Valley offer, I would probably live in a really beautiful appartment in a great new city, which would be nice, etc etc.

Both pay essentially the same, and would look great on my resume regardless. I'm not quite sure which company I would rather stay with when I graduate, as the ultimate decision factor would be location.

My GF of 2 years lives and works in San Fran, but that's not really a factor because I would only be able to see her on the weekends anyway, and it'd either be an hour drive from San Jose, or an hour flight out of SNA to SFO. 

Maybe I just needed to type this out, but I feel like you are all much wiser than most internet goers so I figured I hear what you had to say etc. Thanks.

tl;dr:
I can't decide if I want to live at home and work somewhere where I got a job through connections, or move to a nice new appartment in San Jose on my own and intern at a place where I got offered the position based on my abilities. Both pay the same, have the same title, and are for world wide companies.

esseu,0,2010-12-28,Is it right to pursue an ex that broke up with you?,CantShake,TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/esseu/is_it_right_to_pursue_an_ex_that_broke_up_with_you/,"My ex-gf of ~2.5 years broke up with me about 3 weeks ago. She wants to remain friends and is sincere about that (she is friends will all of her ex's) I, on the other hand, realize only now what a complete idiot I was for not realizing what a gem I once had.  I want her back so badly, but she clearly wouldn't have broken up with me if she wanted to be with me. I don't really know what I am trying to ask, I'm just in a haze right now and wish she was still with me.

Why she ended it: During the fall semester she had an internship in another city, we would chat all the time on IM and call each other and she would always vent to me, and she had a lot to vent about being in a new city with no one she knew. This started to bother me a bit because I was talking the heaviest/hardest course load of my life and I was stressed out as it was and so I wasn't as sympathetic as I should have been. So needless to say the ldr was wearing on us. We broke up during the semester but we both hinted at getting back together when she came home, I figured she partly wanted to be able to mingle with the men in manhatten and not feel guilty about it and I was cool with that but I always assumed she would eventually come back to me. When she came home she said she wanted to make our breakup permanent.
some things she mentioned about me that influenced her decision: I am currently on SSRI's and it destroys my sex drive, this obviously was a source of stress for us both. We also both like to drink quite a bit but she thinks I drink too much, but over the past semester i drank roughly 10 times in total. She also says she wants someone who is more affectionate and likes to cuddle and stuff more (i grew up with two parents who were in the military and basically conditioned the guys to express very little emotion) umm, i think that about sums it up.

I've offered to go to counseling to work through my bullshit and also relationship counseling but this was during our breakup discussion and she said she didnt want to.


edit: Welp, a drunken phonecall last night revealed to me that she had been sleeping with my best friend since before she even went to nyc. Life is pretty lame sometimes."

##Miscellanea:



&gt;What makes you laugh?



&gt;&gt;People doing stupid stunts. Often involving fireworks.


&gt;What is your biggest pet peeve?


&gt;&gt;People who justify killing hundreds of thousands of citizens with politics (Hiroshima/Nagasaki, Vietnam, Palestine, Iraq/Afghanistan).



&gt;What general area of your country you live in?


&gt;&gt;Upstate New York.


&gt;Do you love it?


&gt;&gt;I love snow, but it's kind of barren. It can be depressing.


&gt;What was the best thing about the last year?


&gt;&gt;I decided I was going to be a photojournalist, fuck making lots of money.


&gt;What are you looking forward to in the year ahead?


&gt;&gt;Several newspaper internships (hopefully), and my last year of J-school.


&gt;If You Were Granted One Do-over, What Would It Be?


&gt;&gt;Buy my name as a url ten years ago before it was taken.


&gt;A butterfly flaps its wings... what small thing have you done or said that lead to something disproportionately larger?


&gt;&gt;I like to think that I've made a bit of change by exposing the stories I have done so far. Hopefully they have made a little bit of a difference.


&gt;All things considered what is the most important thing in the world to you?


&gt;&gt;People die of injustices all the time without anyone caring. It bothers me almost as much as people I know dying. I want to spread this pain. Maybe people will do more to help, but at the very least the forgotten deserve to have someone cry for them. Especially someone from a country that tends to be responsible for their deaths...


##Concerning reddit:


&gt;What is the origin or meaning of your user name?


&gt;&gt;When I was around 8 or 9, my cousin introduced me to AIM. It was rapidly becoming a ""thing"" in her school - everyone knew each other's screennames and talked for hours after school got out.
She made a fake account called ""Constipated_HELP,"" and trolled her classmates. Hers was the one username people couldn't attach to a person, but they knew it was someone at the school. She wreaked havoc and caused AIM to get banned from her school. Kids weren't even allowed to talk about it because of the amount of drama.


&gt;Total number of reddit identities you’ve had?


&gt;&gt;7


&gt;What is your favorite part of reddit?


&gt;&gt;/r/bestof


&gt;What do you do when you’re not on reddit?


&gt;&gt;Photojournalism, and a little bit of downhill skateboarding.


&gt;Do you think reddit has changed in the last year or so?


&gt;&gt;Yes. I think I joined at the end of the days that it was dominated by almost-socialist left-wing programming genius 35-year-olds.


&gt;&gt;I remember the days that the front page was sometimes dominated by links I couldn't even read because I've never gone beyond CSS, HTML, and flash.


&gt;If so, do you think it’s been for the better?


&gt;&gt;Nope. One can always move further into the subreddits, but we're constantly shifting to a larger representation of the ""normal"" population.


&gt;&gt;I strongly believe that ultra smart, über sensitive, conspiracy theorist geeks are far better than ordinary people.


##Final Question: 


&gt;Is there anything you'd like to plug/promote/advocate?


&gt;&gt;At first thought, I'd like to promote my own blog. But I still use this account somewhat anonymously, so I'll avoid the temptation.


&gt;&gt;My motivation to get better as a photojournalist is my intense need to do something about what my taxes pay for overseas. So here's my plug:


&gt;&gt;The US has killed well over 1,000,000 people overseas since 2001 (mostly undocumented). Around 200,000 of these (documented) were considered ""non-combatants.""


&gt;&gt;Those that are considered combatants are condemned by pretty much everyone in the US. But the problem is this: if we were invaded in a similar way, I can guarantee that seeing family members die would be enough for most of us to pick up some fertilizer and fight back.


&gt;&gt;We call them ""terrorists,"" they call them the resistance.


&gt;&gt;Enough soapboxing. Thank you, redditor of the day."
et5dm,0,2010-12-29,What type of freelance work can I find with these skills of mine?,[deleted],ECE,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/et5dm/what_type_of_freelance_work_can_i_find_with_these/,"Hello All,

I am a new member to ECE subreddit (new account, but have been hanging around and reading stuff for a few months).

I am currently working as an intern in a robotics company, mostly programming Atmegas and LPC2148. I have learned enough to handle small projects as a freelancer. I will be putting up the code I had written for LPC2148 on my github as soon as the internship ends to showcase what I can do.

So, what kind of freelance work can I get with these skills?"
et5uj,6,2010-12-29,Alright /r/engineering... The new boss laid it out for me. Help me get back on the horse.,LaxBouncer,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/et5uj/alright_rengineering_the_new_boss_laid_it_out_for/,"Here's a little context:

I'm 24 years old, I have 96 credits from 3 different universities (Syracuse University, Hofstra University, and SUNY at Buffalo). I landed an internship at company, and asked them to pick me up full time, which they did. Now, the reason I asked them to pick me up full time was because I was failing out of school, I couldn't dedicate the time to both working at my internship and school. I now work 50-60 a week standard and everything was great. My boss made it clear that I had the potential to move up in the company based on my work quality and ethic, life was good.

And then my boss got a sidemotion and there's a new VP of engineering who's made it quite clear that degrees will be important. As of now, I can sit in my same position as I've been grandfathered in, but I have pretty much lost my growth potential in the company.

I've got to go back and finish my degree. 

There's a couple things holding me back:

1.) I was kicked out of the engineering department at UB right before I decided to go full time. I was in the process of taking the two classes that would get me back in, granted that I got the grades in them, when I dropped them in order to work. 

2.) My GPA at my first two universities was very good, but at UB not so much. I live and work in Buffalo so I feel like I would have to go to UB to finish, where I have a poor track record. 

3.) I can't stop working. I work ten hour days, I need the hours. From what I remember at UB there's very slim to no choices for night classes that I need. 

So I'm looking for some advice on what you folks think the best way to resolve these issues would be? My company will pay for half of my tuition, and I'm still eligible for grants/loans, so hopefully tuition won't be a limiting factor. Would I be able to get back in at UB? Are there any online options for accredited engineering degrees that could work around my schedule? What would you do if you were in my position?

Thanks for the time. "
etq5b,9,2010-12-30,Why are so many apache cluster projects written in Java?,zaneyhaney54,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/etq5b/why_are_so_many_apache_cluster_projects_written/,"I've been working on a web application and I decided that I'd break from my normal pattern of using relational databases (MySQL primarily) and try something new. I've been interviewing for an internship at facebook and I thought Apache Cassandra might be an interesting choice, when I started reading about it I thought it was strange that it was written in Java, later when I learned that Hadoop was also primarily implemented in Java, aswell as Hive and Derby I started wondering what the reasoning behind this decision was. Most of my studies have been in Scientific computing and the codebases are usually in C (or in some cases Fortran), in a cluster project like Cassandra or Hadoop why would you pick Java (a language that I've always been told is slow) as opposed to C or C++? Is it strictly a portability decision? Any insight here would be helpful."
ettv1,38,2010-12-30,IAmA web designer from the '90s (and still today!),jenzo,IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/ettv1/iama_web_designer_from_the_90s_and_still_today/,"I am a web designer from the '90s. After having an internship at Wired Magazine in 1994, I became extremely interested in the web. There were no schools or classes to teach web design or html, so I taught myself. My senior project at the University of Cincinnati involved making an interactive campus map. Even though it was live for several years, I got a B because my professors did not know how to use the internet. 
After graduation, I got my first job for Time Warner's Pathfinder. (talk about an oldie). Not long after, I was given the great opportunity to work for Don Buckley at Warner Bros., the visionary responsible for bringing these kinds of movie sites to the web. We had a great team and created several awesome, though now old-school, sites. 
Today, I continue to work on the web. And I still love what I do. Any questions? http://www.jenzo.com"
euceg,0,2010-12-31,please give me a job,pleasefindmeajob,vancouver,https://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/euceg/please_give_me_a_job/,"I came online today to start applying for jobs again. After clicking a couple links I went to update my resume and scrolling through the various resumes I've made over the past year almost gave me a breakdown. I have at least 75 different versions. I simply cannot do this anymore.


For any potential employers - I have not been unemployed all year. I have been taking courses through a certificate program, working an unpaid internship at a publishing company several days a week, and working a near-minimum wage job in the hospitality industry to pay the bills. I cannot work that job anymore as I fear for my sanity if I stay there much longer.


All I need is a part-time job that pays at least $12/hr (but preferably much more). I have a lot of work experience, a good work ethic and excellent references. I hold a University Degree and graduated with a B+ average. I have worked in supervisory/management roles in retail, customer service and hospitality, taught English both in Canada and Abroad and worked in office environments. I am excellent with computers - I have an average typing speed of 65 words per minute, an advanced knowledge of word, excel, access, power point etc. I am also great with kids and animals.


If you have a job, here is a sample of the things I can/would be willing to do:


***Editor (I can help you with copy editing, proofreading or substantive editing. I have helped many people with their novels, children's stories and non-fiction books. If you have a book you are writing I can definitely help you with the process)

Anything in the non-profit sector

Receptionist/Office Administrator

Office Temp

Support Worker

Childcare

Dog Walker

Personal Assistant

ESL Teacher/Tutor

Elementary or High School Tutor (I have also worked as a math tutor for grade 9 - 1st year calculus)

Bartender (not in a club, bars or pubs are okay)

Inbound Call Center Representative

Travel Agent

Library Clerk

Store Clerk (in a non-big-box store - feels less degrading in some way)

Production Assistant


This list is not inclusive, as I'm sure there are many other things I would be willing to do. If you do have any of the above jobs to offer, or anything else that you could hire me for, please do not hesitate to contact me, as I am desperate.

Thank you.
