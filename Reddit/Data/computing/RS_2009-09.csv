If you are a programmer, what skills would you expect an intern working with you to have (other than the skill of getting your coffee and refilling at appropriate times) or what level of knowledge in a particular programming language, technology, etc...??  If you are a person in the position of hiring interns, what skill set do you look for?

PART 1: WHAT
I would like to be fairly close to the action. As in not .NET webapp things. Not tiny things. I used to be really into graphics, and I could enjoy that. I would also prefer to work on fairly new, cutting edge technology. I see Software Engineering and Graphics in a few graduate schools. What exactly do they teach and what are my employment opportunities for them? What other programs are floating around out there?

PART 2: WHERE
0 idea. None. I'd like somewhere fairly well-known, just because I'm trying to go to the same school as a Math major friend who has phenomenal grades from a very well known school. He will probably shoot for the moon. I live in Virginia now. I'd rather stay on the East Coast. Any ideas?

Thanks buds!

PS: I'm coming from a fairly respectable program with extensive work, research, and some teaching experience. My grades are good. I couldn't get into MIT or Berkley, but I can try for most any other."

I'm studying Bioinformatics with an emphasis on informatics and software engineering. Currently I am doing an internship in a laboratory with some ties to developing bioinformatic tools. 

problems:

- my boss is a strange fella and nobody actually likes him as a person. he treats people like shit and  he seems a bit bipolar - one minute sunshine, the other minute he is mad like a thunderstorm. people left the lab just because of his presence. 
he also lies about some things, which is really annoying. scientific discussions are very hard because he wants to have the last word with everything.

- the project i'm working on is not very satisfyng. It seems that it has just been made up of ""stuff"" that nobody else wants to do. Hence, my motiviation level is not very high. And it's not very informatic, it's more like 3d modelling and i have never worked in this field before.

Additionally i want to do a big software engineering project, where i can show my skills in GPU programming...

It's hard for me to find a field in bioinformatics i can speciallize in. That's the reason I'm doing this internship right now. I don't know in what other field i want to work. 

MY QUESTIONS:

- should i quit and find some other internship? Right now I don't even have a signed contract (boss has problems with organizing it), but I planned on staying here until next year. Which is a very long time.

- are there any bioinformaticions out there that can help me with finding the right field for me?

- does someone have a cool bioinformatics project or internship available? especially if it's GPU programming related, but i also like plain C/C++, Java or C# projects.

What do i like in Bioinformatics?
Sequence Alignment, Signal Processing (i'm working in this field right now), Protein Structure prediction/modelling
not so much: Biostatistics (because it involves not so much programming)

EDIT: gpu computing is for me: using Nvidia CUDA or OpenCL.

A bit more about me:
I'm not very social to begin with, and most of my projects have been done individually, till this internship.  My previous internship was mostly working on my own stuff, though I did work as part of a scrum team, and sometimes worked with the other developers. My first internship was 100% solo. As a result, my team work experience is more limited than it should be, and I'm not sure what the best way to fix it is."
9jo27,241,2009-09-11,"I work for Microsoft as a developer, and worked on Vista and Windows 7. AMA.",DrinkingKoolAid,IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/9jo27/i_work_for_microsoft_as_a_developer_and_worked_on/,"I worked on Vista and Windows 7, and will also be working on Windows 8. Ask me anything you want about the company, culture, lifestyle, seattle, products, etc. and I'll answer the best I can without getting fired.

EDIT: I've had tons of people mail me about internships, so I'm going to put the info here since I realized I'd just be copying and pasting the info.

The best way to apply for an internship is through the recruiting programs done at a university. Usually if you have a decent résumé, you'll be given an interview at your university or college campus. This interview is generally a ""weeding out"" interview.

Alternatively, you can apply directly through the internship program website here:
https://careers.microsoft.com/careers/en/us/collegeinternships.aspx
Again, if your résumé is decent, you will likely get a phone interview that will play the same role as the school campus interview. Even if you apply through a school recruitment event, it would be good to visit this website to get some background information on the program and figure out what sort of position you want to apply for (SDE = programmer, SDET = programmer/tester, PM = program manager). 

Once you get past the first phase, you'll be contacted and asked to fly to redmond for interviews at the microsoft campus. Generally this is 5 to 6 interviews with various employees. Within a week or two you should have an answer from us.

Please feel free to send me a PM if you have a specific question about the recruitment process and I will try my best to get you an answer.

EDIT2: More advice to people applying to Microsoft:

If you are a student, make sure you're involved in personal projects or other projects outside your classwork. When I see students who have never programmed outside of homework and class projects, it is a huge red flag for me. There are exceptions, but they're rare.

A few people have mentioned that they think it is too early to start applying for internships. It's much better to start as early as possible, especially if Microsoft is your first choice for an internship. Right now we have started recruiting for Summer 2010 interns.

Also, there is one other way you can consider to try to get an internship. The [Imagine Cup](http://imaginecup.com/) is a competition that Microsoft hosts for students. In the past, top ranked students from each region have been flown out for interviews at Redmond, skipping the whole screening process. I can't promise that they will continue to do this, but if I ever saw a student who placed well in the imagine cup, I would definitely see it as being very positive."

BUT ANY ADVISE WOULD BE SO GREATLY HELPFULL.
and if you come from a diverse relationship as well, tell me your secrets

 I'm 25 American female, He is 28 French,  and we live in the Uk. I am graduating from bachelors program in a couple months while he has already been working for the past 3 years. 

I am of latina (hispanic) origin from texas.  I was brought up in a very ritualistic latin catholic manner. The Hispanic approach is lest dogmatic than the conservative christian, but mainly focuses on many codes and traditions of the mexican heritage. Just imagine a large crazy screaming high stress hilariously funny fighting family, and thats where i come from. 

He on the other hand comes from a very educated liberal free, artistic atheist family,both his parents come from christian background but his home life did not enforce any strict religious practices. Just  the regular celebration of christmas easter, etc for family purposes. His upbringing was very different from mine and his parents pretty emotionally stable and balanced. 

We both come from the same social class, the only difference I'd say  is his family went to college , while my family is more self made business people. 

Our huge different cultural upbringing and religious differences have never really been a problem. If anything they were really interesting. I'm in Uk for studying art, so I'm not all hardcore catholic like my family , I have a free thinking spirit inside, but I still am spiritual and religious in my own way keeping some beliefs while dropping others from my faith of origin. I have never felt a need or urge to convert him or change his religious beliefs. 
Its not till recently these differences have started to clash 

We will have been dating for 3 years in november. and I will have known him for almost 3 years and say 7 months at that point. 
I am now living with him for the past month and he has asked me to take the decision to move in with him fully ( move out of my flatshare completely)  
We have always been really close these past years, spending most our time together,  and i basically lived with him in a half manner spending on average half of my week at his place  for the past three years, as he lived in a flat share. He only recently moved into his own flat about 4 months ago. 

My big issue is the idea of moving in with him before marriage. From my culture and upbringing this is a HUGE NO and very shameful for the woman. I Basically latin upbringing is that if a man wants a girl to move in with him and not commit to marriage he is just trying to get you for free...basically his a ""a motherfucker that doesn't want to commit and just wants to use you"" any woman that moves in without marriage is really looked down upon and seen as an easy whore. If I were to do this it would be really shameful looking to my family

I have always believed strongly in this concept and promised myself i'd never move in with a man before marriage. Not so much because of the old world belief of macho men and sexism, but because I always imagined and wanted the deep commitment of marriage before moving in with a man. 
We have discussed this and has said he is not ready for marriage yet and doesn't know when he will be, but is very committed to me and can't see his life without me, he does consider the possibility with me but just doesn't know when he will be ready. 

This is where I feel deeply torn and tortured on in the matter, as I feel very ready for marriage and just want my life with him. Many people get married already after 1 year from my culture, where from his they wait 6- 8 years, which i see as crazy, some of his friends had babies first, and then decided on marriage. I would never consider this nor would he so that has never been an issue. And he has also said that 6 years and not married is a bit long to be in a relationship.

Our lives are already so much together and its as if we are a married couple in ways, I am very happy in the relationship in all the other matters and we are very much in love and work through our differences when we have them.
Its just this idea of marriage that is really breaking me mentally and making me feel horrible and sad on a daily basis. like heartbroken. 

On one hand I am just so happy to have him and know he is not like all the macho men from my culture that yes marry quickly but... cheat cheat cheat cheat anyways. 
These are the things and differences i deeply love and appreciate from him being so different. 

But on the other hand i feel horrible and deeply rejected inside, it hurts me to know I am ready for marriage and he isn't.It makes me question our relationship and love together.  It leads me to believe perhaps I'm just that warm up girl a man stays in a relationship with for so many years and never marries, only to break up with her and quickly marry the next one that comes along...sounds silly but these are the things that bother me daily. It makes me really angry and sad every day. I worry that If I move in with him   our relationship will never lead to marriage and I will just be wasting all this time in energy in somemone that doesn't want to commit. Basically i'm afraid of getting used and hurt. 

We have discussed these things, and all though he has said he loves me deeply and cant imagine being with anyone else but is not ready for the commitment of marriage, he wouldn't want me to move in if it meant me feeling horrible and begrudging him....some days i feel great about the idea, while others i feel utterly terrified and hurt
what to do!? Am I wasting my time?  the only people i can discuss this with in real life are from hispanic dissent so there is a large bias on their part. 

***EDIT 
One thing i failed to mention as well and this is a huge factor- 
I am in the uk paying for school with financial aid and some assistance from family. 
If I do not move in with him I am left in the corner of having to move back to the states... as I pretty much can not afford to pay for the very high rent here without some help from my family, and help from them doesnt seem possible after graduation, as it has already been a huge fight for me to even get my education, and i've had to fight to stay here on a continuous basis. my parents would love me to stay there, but unfortunately its my grandparents money that have helped me this far and their values are old school and relentless 

the plan was to take this next gap year for internships  and part time job, before i go in for taking my masters. he has even offered to help pay for the visa and master course for me to do this,  
It really comes down to going back to texas and being sucked back into the family,or stay here and half break this strong moral code that has been programmed into me, in efforts to follow scholastic dream and become financially independent from them"

I had just graduated college, my employer would not extend my hours, and I was unable to find employment. Many of you gave me great advice towards debt consolidation, saving money, and looking for jobs. The unpaid internship that some of you thought was a bad idea turned out great. I interned for a month, they hired me part time, and just today they offered me a permanent position.

I just wanted to thank all of your for reading and responding. Even if I didn't follow all of the advice, it was very much appreciated and gave me an important perspective I otherwise wouldn't have had. Unfortunately in the debt dept., AES no longer consolidates (they won't tell you that on their website, future students beware) but the Dept. of Education does. I hope to hear back about my application with them very soon, but I'm less concerned now that I will have more income. My boyfriend also proposed and we're getting married in a month, so life seems to be going great right now. 

I know my situation is hardly rare or even that rough, but I just wanted to share my happiness and thanks with all of you and hopefully let others in similar situations that know things will turn for the better as long as you're aware of financial situation, call on your contacts, and remain patient but active in your job search.

I have been working in my city's IT department as an intern for nearly two years.   My job responsibilities range from standard desktop and some network troubleshooting to large scale projects.   My most recent (and biggest) accomplishment is the installation of a voting/sound/video system in our city's council chambers.  

I like a lot of what I do.   The ideal job for me would be one that involves a lot of problem solving or research as opposed to the mindless desktop support.  The ideal business would probably be a bit smaller/not so corporate.  I think I would be happiest wearing many hats.
