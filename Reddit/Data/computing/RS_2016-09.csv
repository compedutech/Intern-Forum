---

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 3 Years ago planetary scanners detected a strange object in motion in interstellar space. All routines failed to classify it as an asteroid or any similar body, as soon as improved scanners were calibrated, the object in question was determined to be of possible alien origin and was promptly reclassified as **Object 0**.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Brief isolated outbursts of panic occurred planetwise as the doomsday prophets declared that ""The End Is Nigh!"", and that an alien invasion was sure to come, to destroy our young spacefaring civilization. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; This ship and crew were selected as the finest among the research institutes, and I was appointed as Captain. Our mission is simple, yet could change the course of history forever. We are to approach the object, match its orbital speed, and verify the reports of alien origin. If said reports are confirmed, the object is to be secured in the Anti-gravity Vacuum chamber and brough back for analysis. 

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; We are now approaching Object 0, will report after contact.

&amp;nbsp;

**END OF REPORT**

---

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; *""Captain, we are approaching Object 0. Should come into view soon.""*

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The veteran captain, who had commanded hundreds of research expeditions, retracted the recording equipment which he had just used to update his Captain's log back into the console, and laid back. He hoped that he was emanating a figure of calm and professionalism, despite the fact that his mind was racing with thoughts, his heart beating as fast as the moment he was informed that he was to lead the expedition that would could change everything forever.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; *""Match orbital velocity, bring us to 50 units of distance and 0 relative speed.*"" - his calm and ragged voice being answered by the shuffle of his busy crewmen, bringing the spacecraft into position.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; *""Velocity matched. Object remains in course. Activating lights ... now*""

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The crew stood in awe as soon as the lights came on. Object 0 was most definitely an alien object. A probe, clear similarities with our own designs. A comms dish stood, battered and pierced by tiny asteroids and by stellar particles, the signal it transmitted long gone. The hull itself suffered the same fate, being battered in multiple points, the craft slowly spinning as result of some of these impacts. Markings and paint could be seen on the body, eroded to blurs by the stellar winds.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; *""Just... how old must this thing be?""* was the only comment that rang across the bridge

----

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; It was the discovery of the millennia. *We are not alone!*. The top minds of the entire planet pounced on the object, hoping to discover its purpose and creators.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Soon enough, a golden disc was dislodged from the side of the craft, reminding us of the very probes we had flung out during our spacial infancy. The material had stood the test of time, and the markings on its surface were readable, albeit untranslatable. There were traces of radioactive material, which told us that this tiny probe was over 5 billion years old.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; It took a decade until we were able to start decoding them. A young intern who had spent many nights in its youth staring at the pictures of the disc managed to translate one of the markings, opening the floodgates.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Whoever made this disc knew that they could not use their own symbols and writing. No one else would be able to decode this message. However, there was one language that could be universally understood, the laws of physics and science. The smallest of markings talked about the hydrogen atom, using its universal spin movements to set up a basic time unit. The first whispers of another intelligence were coming to us.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Another simple diagram was translated after a year, a series of lines, with a message encoded in binary, told us of several pulsars and the rate at which they pulsed. Such old records, those interstellar clocks were surely dead, but using jump drives to travel to light-years worth of distance and other methods, the faint signals were tracked, mapped and its meaning finally uncovered: a map. The lines converged into a single point. Telescopes looked at the location, and a faint glow was detected. A white dwarf, the remains of a long-dead star. 

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The world stared in awe, as the countdown for the warp-drive reached 0, and the research craft headed towards the location marked on the map. Billions of breaths were held as the images flooded in. A solitary white dwarf emitted its faint glow, the corpse of a dead star, several planets of different sizes orbiting it. Soon enough the scans were complete, and the research team headed for the one closest to the star.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; A charred world, its life burned long ago by the death of the very star that had once provided it with heat and life, and yet, the presence of civilization was undeniable. Remains of satellites, constructions, colossal cities abandoned as the apocalypse of the dying star threatened to consume all. Sentient life had once inhabited this place. The proof was undeniable, we were not alone. But where was everybody?

----

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; *""Captain! We are receiving a signal! There is a body orbiting the star at exactly π degrees of inclination!""*

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; *""Set course, now!""*, the shaking voice of the Captain shouted hopeful.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The whole world watched as the new probe came into view. This one had a huge rectangular block, giving it a very unusual form for a spacefaring object. But it was clear that it was far more recent than the one they had found, its markings were clearly visible, the hull almost unscathed.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; As the scientific craft attempted to communicate with it, the huge block came to life with light, its role as a screen revealed. Standing there, a message recorded many years ago, an alien stood proud, its features very similar and yet noticeably different from the investigators. As it spoke, its voice was transmitted for all to hear, and intercepted by the newcomers.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Of course, the Rakkish scientists and population were completely unable to understand a word of what was being said, but for the first time in millions of years, the voice of humanity was once again heard across the galaxy:

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; *""You found us, or what's left of our cradle at least! I always knew good old Voyager wouldn't let us down!""*"

I've done two or three for other internships and didn't end up getting them (was not surprised). I really think I'm a qualified candidate, I have exam P passed, math major with insurance and risk management minor, 4.0 gpa, involved in my school's risk management and insurance fraternity, involved in other campus activites, blah blah blah... but I have a really hard time selling myself in interviews. I'm a very social and talkative person and have no problem talking to people in non-interview settings but for some reason in interviews, especially over the phone I get so nervous and don't do as well as I probably could in person and have a harder time selling myself.

Does anyone have any tips on questions they will ask and answers I should have, aside from the standard ones in any generic interview? 

Also tips on what questions I should be asking them... I want to seem interested because I am extremely interested but I know what actuaries do and I feel like asking generic things about the profession will make me seem uninformed about it. But at the same time I want to ask questions.

If anyone has any input at all for me it would be much appreciated! Thank u all :)"

I don't have any side projects to talk about. I have some work experience but nothing related to CS or Stats. The only thing close to it is that I was a desktop support intern for a company. 

I am generally a shy guy and not good at starting conversations. I have never been to a career fair and sort of scared. I know my peers are ahead of the game than me in terms of projects and extra activities. I know about the imposter syndrome, but it just seems like that they are doing some pretty neat side projects. 

What advice do you have for me?

How much BS is there?,pcs444,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/50kw0j/am_i_21m_latching_onto_nothing_with_21f_how_much/,"Detailed Backstory: We both graduated from the same college a few months ago. Claire (this is what we'll call her) and I met early on freshman year and she was one of the first few friends I made at college. As that year went on, we became really close friends. However, we grew apart the following year, after our friend group fell apart. Things got dramatic too, and we didn't talk. I felt bad, and it sucked that we virtually became strangers. One night at a party junior year, we ran into each other and we ended up drunkenly talking about everything until like 6 am in the morning. It made me realize that there was nothing anymore and that was it. I never saw or spoke to her again until senior year rolled around, and we bumped into each other quite a bit in random places. We would just have small talk, but we didn't shut each other out like we did in the past. Halfway through the year, we run into each other at a party. We were both drunk, flirty, and we started dancing together. Then, I decided to kiss Claire and had no idea what kind of floodgate I just opened. We stared at each other before making out until the party ended. We were both kind of freaked and we went our separate ways. We texted a little bit throughout at that week, and eventually I asked if she wanted to hang out one night. We hooked up, and then it became a weekly thing. 

After about a month, she wanted to talk about us. She said that she didn't want a relationship but that we should keep doing this, and I agreed because we were graduating and I felt there was no point. So we were friends with benefits, and two people who eventually fell super hard for one another. After a bit of jealousy on both ends, we talked about it and decided that we were official in March. We never had sex together until shortly after becoming official. I wasn't a virgin, but she was, and I could tell that it was a big topic for her so I didn't want to press too hard when we were just fwbs. 

In April, we started talking about what we were going to do after graduation.  Although we were just 45 minutes away from each other (which isn't that bad of a LDR, but way different from 45 feet away in college), she got a 1-year internship that she really wanted across the country in California. I stayed on the East Coast working in finance. She had doubts, but we promised each other we were going to try. We finished out the year great, very lovingly. We were crazy about each other. Graduation was bittersweet for many reasons. We saw each other that night before we moved back home, and we started making out until she just got overwhelmed with emotion. We both did. We didn't want to say goodbye and wished that we had more time. We cried into each other's arms. I've never cried about a girl before. 

We were together for about just under another month after graduating. We saw each other after a week and a half and it was great. We talked on the phone almost everyday, texted too. We never really did phone calls while at college, but I took some advice from friends to do that at least once a day. I saw her again after a couple weeks, and we were having dinner. She dropped that she didn't want to be in a relationship anymore. She cited not being mentally prepared for going long distance once she's away in L.A. Even though I told her I was ready to make it work, she wasn't. She also said that she isn't ""emotionally mature"" enough for a relationship and although we both had the same sentiments in the beginning to the end, at the end of the day she wants to pursue her career more than anything. She said it was ""commitment issues"" and although she had briefly mentioned that before, I didn't buy it. I especially didn't buy it when she said, ""It's not you, it's me."" My experiences have shown me the bullshit behind that statement. I asked her on four separate occasions throughout that talk if she was talking to anybody, she firmly said no each time in a way that seemed like I was asking the dumbest question she's ever heard. I believe it, as she is a serial monogamist. She said she wanted to be friends, and being in a dazed state, I accepted it (wasn't thinking.) 

A few days later, thinking I was cooled off enough, I called her asking if we could talk about it a little more. She opened up a little more, saying that being in a LDR would hold her back when she's away in L.A. That she wants to really focus in on the job and succeed. She said that the prospect of building future plans around someone was terrifying to her because she wasn't sure if she would return to the East Coast after the internship is over. Things eventually got heated and she hung up. A couple days later, I sent her this long message and apologized, wished her luck, and said we could be friends. (Still was a lot more emotionally charged than I thought.) I figured, fuck it, let's start the healing process and get it done like I've done in the past. I saw her a couple weeks later for a mutual friend's birthday and while I was cool and calm on the outside, I was infuriated when I saw her throw herself and flirt with this guy for an hour in front of my face. Nothing happened, but I felt sick to my stomach. After that day, I went NC and thought I could just get over her.

But it hasn't been way. A couple months later and I'm still hung up on this girl and heartbroken. I've never felt this way, usually with exes, I was over them in a week, tops. We started texting a little bit about a month and a half after, in the weeks leading up to her departure. I wished her luck, and it's been almost a month since we last talked. On Facebook, she put up a picture of this wall of photographs she has in the room she's staying in. I saw that I was in a handful of them, and I was stunned. One of us together, but then the others are in group photos.

I miss her dearly, I immerse myself at the gym and work, but the distractions aren't enough. I know she'll be back for the holidays. I can see why people say go NC after a breakup, now that the fog has cleared and since logic set in, I realize a lot of the boneheaded things I did when it came to handling this and the flaws on both sides. I understand why it happened, but I just don't believe it and I'm conflicted in feeling that there's nothing to save. Especially when there's just so much time until the holidays, we're both bound to get over it, right?

TL;DR: I started hooking up and eventually dating one of my ex-closest friends that I met in college. We reconnected senior year and started dating second semester and through graduation. She got a big post-graduate 1-year internship that began earlier this month in L.A. With me being in the East Coast, we were ready to try a LDR. About a month after graduation, she called it off, citing commitment issues, not being emotionally prepared for a LDR, feeling trapped, and the ""it's not you, it's me"" card. We started talking a little bit, but not since she left, and I've been having a hard time recover/deciding if I'm holding onto lost hope. "

I recently started an internship at a major ISP in my country. I've been having issues with things like laptops, desks, internet and I was wondering if this is common at other large companies that aren't Tech Giants.

For example, my current work laptop is an ancient Toshiba with only 4gb of RAM and a super slow HDD. My work consists of web development as well as dev-ops stuff such as Docker, Kubernetes and OpenStack so you can imagine it's super impossible to do anything when u need to simulate a Kubernetes environment on a dev machine with only 4gb of RAM, hell, even just webpack-dev-server + chrome is already too much.

The corporate internet is also impossible to deal with. The only internet access is via a proxy (http/https) so I can't use ssh/ftp etc. SERIOUSLY!

I can't access any corporate services such as Email from my dev workstation (linux) because it's not the SOE Windows image. I can't access wireless for the same reason so i'm developing with the fucking guest wireless.

I've been here over a month already and I still don't even have a desk. It's called 'hot desking' where basically everyone has a desk but you, so you need to snipe others and just ignore they have pictures of their kids and sentimental items that you need to push aside to set up.

I'm super frustrated and will 100% not work at this company post internship, but I'm desperate to know if this is a common experience at large companies so I can avoid this in the future.

prior to this internship I worked part time for a super small soft. dev. agency and it was wonderful! So at least i'm hopeful!"

--------------------------

""Dad. Stop."" Mr. Delcrius was fixing up Richard's hair, commonplace during their meetings. He's never really liked the way his son presented himself in the whole hair-department. Richard showed up late, and Mr. Delcrius had no way of seeing him before hand, the long hair was a bombshell that had to be addressed.

""I'm not stopping, Richard. Your hair looks like three Grindylows tried to duke it out with its strands."" He said curtly. ""You have a meeting with Marlon Rolphe, you should've addressed this before coming here!""

Richard sighed, he figured he'd be met with some sort of criticism. A thought then occurred to him, and his eyes widened in near-horror. ""Wait, Marlon Rolphe...what...what the heck? You told me we were meeting with his adviser, Steven! Not the man himself!""

""If you want to get into the Beast division, you're going to meet with Marlon. They're quite picky, pickier than the Spirit and Being divisions."" 

Richard groaned. ""God, I should've been an Auror.""

""If they set you off with an exploratory pass, you'll have free, funded reign to travel the world and find, research, and categorize Magical Creatures. I did it for years, Richard, it's rewarding as all hell, and you *know* it's what you want to do.""

Richard sighed. ""Yeah, I know, dad, it's just, I mean, this is going to be tough...they could just deny me, you know.""

Mr. Delcrius laughed. ""Not with my beautifully crafted character reference, not to mention your brother's friend Jordan! You'll be certified in no time, Richard.""

A women entered the hallway, clipboard in hand, Richard looked up, expecting to see a dull, devoid of meaning intern, but she seemed quite peppy. Dark brown hair flowing down in curls, a cheery smile as she shook Richard and his father's hands. ""Hey! Marlon's ready to see you now.""

Mr. Delcrius pat his son on the back. ""Off you go, then, good luck."" Richard took a shaky breathy, nodded, and followed the women along down the hall. His future was literally waiting for him at the end of the hallway, once he stepped through those large, cheery-wood doors, he'd find that he made it to where he wanted to be, or that he failed, and his whole life would have to be reworked. Like kicking down an anthill, his whole being would be disrupted, perhaps even destroyed forever. 

""Don't be nervous."" the girl spoke up. ""I was nervous, too. I mean, I'm from Ilvermorny, I moved here for a fresh start. I only graduated last year! Good things happen here, even if we're new to all this.""

Richard smiled. ""Oh, uh, thanks. I know...I'm not usually nervous before meetings. But...you know, this is Marlon we're talking about. He's notorious for being an arse, isn't he?""

She tilted her head. ""He is? He's been nothing but kind, to me. So...guess we'll have to see! Good luck, Richard."" 

He wanted to ask her name, though he supposed she would be one of those vagabonds that stroll through his life and instantly flee when they've passed him. She turned and left as Richard wandered through the doors. What awaited him was a large desk, a few papers floating about, along with a large, ornate globe towards the right.

Marlon sat in his reclining chair, looking through some paper work, he was an old, tall man. Not pudgy at all, some wrinkles here and there, though he retained most of his hair. Dignitary and just, the man seemed to be. A small, black dish sat on his desk as well, it looked a lot like a satellite dish, though far smaller.

Marlon nodded towards the chair in front of his desk, and Richard quietly shut the door sitting in front of him, hands gripping each other on his thighs. 

""Hello, Richard."" Marlon started dryly. ""Before we begin, do you have any questions?""

Richard cleared his throat. ""Erm, yes, sir. Is that dish a-"" Richard had begun to point, but the man had already interrupted him.

""Secrecy Sensor, yes. I dislike lies."" 

Richard furrowed his brow and nodded, still sitting upright, waiting for the man to speak some more. ""So, Richard, you want to join the Beast division? Straight out of Hogwarts, huh?""

""Yes, sir. I do. I think you'll find that-""

""Hush, now. I'm still talking."" the man wagged a long, rough finger. ""You're gunning for your father's old position, huh? One of those explorers that prattle about?""

""Yes, sir."" Richard said quietly. 

""Nowadays it's much rougher to get a job here, Richard. We need a lot more. You have outstanding research of your own...however, if you're not combat ready, you can't go out there.""

""Combat...ready?"" Richard asked.

""Yes, I run my researchers as if they were soldiers. You need a whole arsenal of charms, hexes, and curses, if you're going to be dealing with those 'Fantastic Beasts', as our friend Newt would put it. Not only that, you're missing a few field tag-alongs.""

""Sir...I assure you, I've studied magic everyday of my life for years-"" the Secrecy Sensor shuddered. 

""Might want to avoid exaggerations, Richard."" He narrowed his eyes.

""Yes, yes. Sorry. I've studied magic as hard as I could for years."" he paused, waiting for the detector to set off, it didn't. ""Some days were exceptions, obviously, I mean, sometimes I'm too sick to move. Though even on those days I did everything I could. I know every damned charm in the world, some of my research was even for a newly worked charm I was in the process of creating! The beast sound replication charm. Jynxes, hexes, the whole nine-yards! You've read my papers, right? You know how passionate I am about this. You know I'm qualified. Over-qualified, even. Why are you delaying it? Why would you *not* want me?! Erm, sir."" Richard squeezed his fists to calm himself. 

Marlon smirked. ""You've got a mouth on you, Richard. I'm a fan of that, honestly. You're like your father. And your brother...and your grandfather."" the man rubbed his temples. ""You Delcrius men will be the death of me."" Marlon sighed, continuing soon enough. ""I had your father spread those rumours about me, I'm quite a cool-headed man, Richard. You have the job, more or less. This was just a formality. You simply need some more field experience.""

Richard blinked a few times. ""So...wait, really? What happened to...you seemed so tough...""

""Hey, I *am* tough. I, however, conduct interviews under intimidating conditions. I test to see whether someone will crack, or not. You cracked quite fast, these normally last an hour. If you don't crack at all, you don't get the job. Because that, in itself, is a lie."" He smiled broadly and opened his arms. 

""So...what now, then, sir?""

""Just call me Marlon, Richard."" the man yawned. ""My, it's been so tiring here...anyway, you're going to go back to Hogwarts, naturally. Spend some time studying with the Magical Creatures professor. Barrick has already been contacted."" 

Richard smiled. ""Wait...Hogwarts? I-I can go back?!""

Marlon nodded. ""Yes, you can, Richard. You can stay till you've fulfilled all the requirements. You'll assist the professor, and do your own research. By the end you should have a stunning enough resume for us to allow you in."" 

""Hogwarts...I'm going back..."" Richard realized he was crying, tears dropping delicately onto his pants despite his smile.

Richard shuddered a little. ""I-I'm sorry I don't...I don't know what's wrong. Just...just a flush of emotions. P-probably. Are we done?""

""We are...and, you sure you're alright?""

""Yes, yes, of course!"" Richard chided, standing up, shaking Marlon's hand, and quickly starting for the door. ""Everything's great! I'll see you soon, sir!"" By the time the door shut, the Secrecy Sensor was still vibrating.

And I decided to apply two years post graduation and two years in a software development role. I decided to get my MBA because eventually I want to start my own software development firm. 

That being said, here are some of my stats:

Major: Mathematics

Minors: Physics, Computer Science with extra study

Internship that I won best internship with at the showcase

Undergrad GPA: 2.6

GMAT: didn't take it

GRE: 760/900

3 letter of Rec. + other clubs I was in


Anyway, I never thought I'd get in because I didn't take the GMAT and my GPA was crappy. But I still applied, and I got in and I'm grateful and it drives me more. Today was my first online class and I'm glad I'm doing it and I just needed to share with you guys."
50lafu,17,2016-08-31,How I overcame my gaming addiction.,fabri_jinga,StopGaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopGaming/comments/50lafu/how_i_overcame_my_gaming_addiction/,"Hello, today begins my new life challenge, one that I have been planning for a long time now. I am a 21 year old Canadian guy who is studying Software Engineering at University. My grades, as of now, are average given that my CGPA is 3.3/4.3 (B+ average OR 77-79%). I strongly believe that online video games has had a negative impact on my ambition, my academics and my overall life. I would like to share, with you guys, my action plan to quit gaming ,my thoughts, and hopefully help or inspire someone.

## My Gaming History
After reading a couple of posts in this sub-reddit, I have always been curious about what games or consoles the authors were addicted to. I think that it can help the readers relate more.
&amp;nbsp;

* I was born in 1995
* The first video game that I played was *Putt-Putt Saves the Zoo* in the late 90's on my father's computer.
* Around 2001, I got my first console; a PS One.
* In 2002, I got my GameCube.
* In 2005, I spent most of the summer playing *Super Smash Bros Melee*.
* From 2006-2008, I played *Runescape*.
* In 2007, I bought a PSP and I played *Monster Hunter Freedom 2*.
* In May 2009, I bought my Xbox 360 , where I played *Call of Duty 4* and *Fallout 3*.
* In August 2009, I got Xbox Live.
* On November 11th 2009, I bought *Modern Warfare 2*.
* On November 9th 2010, I bought *Black Ops*.
* I created my steam account in May 2010, where initially I played *Half Life 2* and *Counter Strike Source*.
* In January 2012, I restarted playing *Runescape* until early 2013.
* I first tried *League of Legends* in the summer of 2012. 
* The summer 2013, I played Xbox 360 single player games such as *Assassin's Creed*.
* In December 2013, Started playing *Dota 2*.
* I sold my Xbox 360 and all games in the summer of 2014 for CDN $120.
* Summer and Winter of 2014, 2015 and 2016 I played *Dota 2* and some *League of Legends*.

## My Gaming Play Times
I only listed the games where I spent more than 50 hours or that I could calculate the number of hours played. For this reason, all the games in older consoles are not listed.
&amp;nbsp;

Game|Playtime                        
:--|:-- 
Dota 2| 1526 hours (64 days)
Modern Warefare 2| 50 days approx.
Runescape| 50 days approx.
Black Ops| 25 days approx.
League of Legends|537 hours (22 days)
Call of Duty 4| 20 days approx.
Fallout 3| 400 hours (17 days)
Steam Games (excluding ones on this list)| 371 hours (15 days) 
Monster Hunter Freedom 2| 200 hours (8 days)
Counter Strike Source|133 hours (6 days)
**TOTAL HOURS** |6647 (277 days)
&amp;nbsp;

**Analysis**
&amp;nbsp;

It is shocking to me that I wasted AT LEAST 277 days of my life playing video games and as of now, I did not benefit in any way from it. It's quite the opposite; gaming screwed up my eye sight (- 4.00 prescription), got me out of shape, and all that time was **quick pleasure without long term benefits**. If I had worked all that time for the minimum wage (assume CND $10), I could have earned theoretically $66,460. Also, if I had studied or worked out, I bet I would not be writing this post. 
&amp;nbsp;

## My Thoughts of Gaming
As of now, September 2016, I believe that some video games are a work of art, while others are just made for pure profit. I know that a handful of people can make a living out of video games using platforms such as Twitch and YouTube. Additionally, professional gamers can earn millions of dollars in competitions. However, that is not my case what so ever. When it comes to me, gaming is a waste of time, since I do not gain any benefits other than forget about the things that I should be doing. I also used to get this weird feeling of regret every night after I spent all day gaming. Every night I would say ""tomorrow I will be productive"", but the next day my urge of gaming brings me back to my pc to game all day. That cycle repeated so many times. Don’t take me wrong, gaming has a bright future with the constant technology improvements such as VR, and a growing industry. I felt like buying a new gaming rig after watching the Battlefield 1 trailer for the first time. I am glad that I didn't. I don’t consider gaming with moderation a bad activity. I just cannot control myself, so the problem is me.

## Why am I quitting?
The main reason why I am quitting gaming is for a better future. If I continue gaming at this frequency, I will regret it later when my friends start getting married, landing nice jobs, starting companies or buying houses. The numbers that are on the table were shocking to me, and I was quite ashamed to be honest. I hesitated to post them, but I did to help you guys realize how many hours we *waste* on gaming. I am happy that I still have control of my life and that I realized this before something happened. 
&amp;nbsp;

Another reason is because I am starting to feel old when I play online games. I don’t like the feeling that I get when I play online video games, and there are 11-12 year old kids in the same lobby as me. I feel as though I am wasting my life. There are also new activities that I want to try, such as video editing and vloging. I think that I spent enough time gaming (see the table above), and it is time to move on.
&amp;nbsp;

I am just glad that I realized how many hours, I have *wasted* and that it is not too late now. Hopefully, I also helped one of you guys realize that you were in the same sinking boat. 


## My Action Plan
I think that in order to quit gaming, you must have a strong action plan. 

* **The best way to start would be by gradually reducing your gaming time.**
This would allow you to familiarize yourself with the feeling of deprivation of gaming. I have been only gaming on the pc ever since I sold all my consoles. I remember that every time before school started, I used to uninstall all my games. However, I remember always being on YouTube and Twitch watching people play video games. For this reason, I strongly recommend to permanently delete all your social media accounts related to gaming such as your Twitter, Twitch, YouTube, etc. Which is worst in my opinion, since I am helping a random guy make money while I was my time and do not benefit what so ever (only the quick pleasure). 

* **After, the next step would be to find a hobby or something to fill up that void.**
There are tons of hobbies out there, you can just google for some ideas. Personally, since I am studying Software Engineering, I started learning new software technologies, and programming languages/frameworks. I also started taking online courses related to web programming to boost my resume. This really paid off, since I got an internship in a prestigious software company as a Front-End developer. I will start September 6th 2016. I will be working until December 2016, and then go back to school in January 2017. I am saying this to motivate you guys, not to show-off. I strongly believe that if I can do it, then anyone can. Also, I will start a monthly [blog]( https://fabrijinga.wordpress.com/), where I will keep track of the progress I make, the things I learnt, funny mistakes that I did, etc. The last thing, an the most interesting in my opinion, is that at the beginning of each month, I will give myself some challenges to keep my life fun and entertaining. For September 2016, my challenges are to run 30 minutes per day on the tread mill ( haven’t exercised in 3 years) and continue with my strict diet. Another challenge for this month will be to watch at least one movie per week, and hopefully finish a trilogy.

## My Plans For the Future
I intend to do activities/changes that will benefit me in the future. I will list a few the activities that I plan to do before Summer 2017.
&amp;nbsp;

* ONLY ALLOWED TO WATCH YOUTUBE ON SATURDAYS; 2HRS MAX (no more procrastination)
* Go to the gym (many benefits)
* Start swimming (many health benefits)
* Continue with my diet (many health benefits)
* Go to sleep everyday at maximum 10:30pm (No more sleep deprivation)
* Do a monthly blog (improve writing skills, keep track of time)
* Build web applications to improve my resume and get another internship summer 2017.
* Go to at least 3 hackathons (improve coding skills, socialize, meet employers)
* Read the news (stay up to date, can start conversations)
* Learn video editing and vloging (improve communication skills, keep track of time)
* Learn Photoshop (boost my resume, can create crazy websites)
* Learn more about buying properties, start-ups, stock markets, etc.(personal interest, possibility to make money)
* Read/Learn about Bitcoin and Ethereum (personal interest, possibility to make money)

I am a very sociable person so interviews would be a breeze if I could have gotten one, but due to few companies recruiting aerospace interns at the job fairs and to my 2.91 cumulative GPA it has just been very difficult to get an opportunity. I have a decent resume and all, I just really worry what it will be like if I don't get an offer this year with the job fair in a few weeks. Are there any other students or alum out there that have been through a similar situation and can shed some experience on my predicament?"

Is it okay if I get an internship after graduation? I'm going to try to get one for the spring semester, but do all companies require that I be a computer science student in college or do some not care? I'm just worried that companies will not see that I started late (I literally started 1 yr ago, and will be completing Data Structures this semester) and will thus dismiss me due to my lack of internship experience. I am an American citizen, if that helps any. I am in a project-based class this semester, so I will have at least 1 major project this semester. I'm also planning on doing some side projects with friends and maybe doing a hackathon or two.

I'm primarily interested in front end, but unfortunately most of my projects (due to school) are back end. Should I focus on back end SE positions or should I just make as many front end projects as I can this semester? Do I have time for this before summer internship interviews start? "
50lesz,4,2016-09-01,Would it be realistic for me to search for an internship?,alexa097,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/50lesz/would_it_be_realistic_for_me_to_search_for_an/,"Hi, I'm currently a sophomore majoring in Computer Science. Until the second semester of my freshman year, I wasn't even interested in CS, but after taking an intro to python class, things changed. I really took an interest from then on, and taught myself SQL and a bit of Java over the summer. 

The deal is I worked mostly at a grocery store during the summer after freshman year, and I didn't work on any projects as such. For my sophomore year though, I'm currently taking a Java class, and I've decided to go to a couple of hackathons, also joined a couple of coding and tech clubs that are genuinely interesting. I know it was a bummer to have wasted my summer this way, and for now I'm working for my university dining, so you could say my experience is not very relevant. Now with these credentials, should I even try my luck at any internship? I know I'm not in a position to choose, but any company would do for me I think. I just don't want to waste my summer again, so even if I don't land an internship next year, could you suggest how else I could boost up my resume ?"
50lfz9,1,2016-09-01,Potential Drastic Change in College and Life Direction,rabbitjellynopeanuts,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/50lfz9/potential_drastic_change_in_college_and_life/,"So throwaway account because I don't want some of my friends to find me. I just started my junior year in Electrical Engineering and have come to the realization that I do not want to be an engineer. I had a very good internship this summer and have slowly come to the conclusion its just not for me. Hell, I even had a dream interview with NASA the other day. I just don't feel any excitement or passion for it anymore after seeing what my work life will be like. A few weeks in and I already have no motivation to do my work, and it will only get done when I absolutely have no more time to procrastinate with. The only saving grace is if I can get into project management of some type or leverage my degree and good grades to change into a different field. With my lack of commitment, those good grades may go away though. 


A major reason for this is that I have changed so much over the past 8 months. I am not the same person that started engineering several semesters ago. I am far more social and outgoing, and am always looking for adventure and excitement. I am willing to work hard, but I struggle to see the point in hard work for no personal satisfaction, and the next two semesters are hell for my major.


Another choice is to switch majors and become an Econ major or a business major (focus on Econ/data analytics). I can do the Econ major in 3 semesters due to some credits I already have and graduate in 4 years or take an extra semester for the business major (more practical courses than pure econ). This would be very difficult to do though and I would be booked with courses. 


A change would also potentially alienate some of my friends (I am in a Professional Engineering Fraternity) that I really care about. I'm afraid they will think I am quitting, and I pride myself on being able to work through the struggles that school, work, and life throw at me. I'm afraid that I am failing myself and will throw so much hard work away. I am horrified that I will make the wrong decision.


And there is another voice in my head whispering to take a leave of absence from school and explore the world or volunteer somewhere. I have a major scholarship for school that I would lose if I am gone for more than a semester, but I could drop this semester (maybe medical leave or something) and take off for a few months to return in the spring, perhaps with some clarity in life. 


If anyone has any advice, I would really appreciate it. I can't think through this well and my gut isn't helping me either. I really feel lost here.

50ljm1,1,2016-09-01,F4M Some scenes to choose from!,[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/50ljm1/f4m_some_scenes_to_choose_from/,"Hey there DPP, tonight I have a couple scenes for you all to choose from and/or work out with me!

We can discuss specific prompts in private and please, do not message me with a scene already started, that’s the easiest way to get blocked. The same goes for one line/word messages.

I'm fairly open with my kinks with my only hard ""no""s being scat, unrealistically huge cocks, 3rd person writing, and vomit.

Without further ado, here are some of my prompts:

**The Lawyer and the Con**: For this one, I was thinking I’d play a young and up and coming lawyer tasked with defending you. We can discuss the specifics in PMs but one thing is for certain, I’ll be taking my payment in the form of cock.

**Breaking the Law**: For this one, the roles are reversed, I was caught committing a crime and you’re the officer/journalist/detective who caught me. Where that leads? Well that’s up to you.

**Wrong neighborhood**: What happens when me, a young and sexy girl finds herself in the wrong neighborhood? Do you help me find my way or decide you want to take advantage?

**Sports Star and Reporter**: A classic scene were I’m a reporter and you’re the sports star, that can only lead one place, right?

**The intern and the boss**: Fairly self explanatory, I’d love to be the intern at her dream job who meets you, her boss and potentially so much more.

**I’m gonna fuck your sister**: For this one, you’ll play my little brother’s best friend, I’ll be his big sister who is now recently single and back in town. You guys always joked that you would fuck each other’s mom/sister only this time, you’re not joking.

**Giving back**: In this RP, I’ll play someone  famous be it an actress or singer or sports star. You’ll be the person tasked in helping me set up some sort of event to give back to the community, only you want me to give you something more than this event.

**Bullies always win**: In this one, you’ll be as the title suggests, you’re a bully who grew up terrorizing my son (or brother), only unlike the stories we tell our kids to make them feel better, you know better. You get what you want, when you want it, in this case, me.

For those of you so inclined, I do like playing celebs in any of these roles so we have visual aids, if you’d like me to be any, just ask!

As for celebs I’d play, here are a few:

Celebs: **Mary Elizabeth Winstead**, **Maisie Williams**, Anna Kendrick, Selena Gomez, Hailee Steinfeld, Taylor Swift, Willa Holland, Daisy Ridley, **Melissa Benoist**, Emma Stone/Watson/Roberts, Hayley Williams, Alison Brie, Alexandra Daddario, Aubrey Plaza, Bella Thorne, **Alicia Vikander** Jennifer Lawrence, Keri Russel, Neve Campbell, Jennifer Connelly, Scarlet Johansson, Sophie Turner, Oliva Munn, Olivia Wilde, **Miranda Kerr**, Jessica Biel/Alba, Victoria Justice

YouTube/Social Media: **Meg Turney**, Lia Marie Johnson, **Alli Speed**, Barbara Dunkelman, Ashley Jenkins, **Bree Essrig**, Maude Garrett, Trisha Hershberger, Datev Gallagher, Lindsey Stirling, Christina Grimme, Dodger, iJustine, or Meghan Camarena.

Whew, that was a lot. Hope to get some dirty orangereds soon!

50lom1,1,2016-09-01,College and grief and depression,awesomeabby,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/50lom1/college_and_grief_and_depression/,"Hey everyone! I have never posted to reddit before, so here I go. 

I am a senior in college, and ever since I came to college I have been battling depression. It has gotten awful in the past year because my mom died in November, with a fraternity brother of mine passing away the next month. After this happened I never went to class and was incredibly depressed and eventually attempted suicide. Dealing with grief away from your family is so difficult. I also got very bad grades.

I was very proud of myself this summer because I did an internship and finished a class that got me out of academic probation. 

So fast forward to now. I am VP of my fraternity, but I want to drop. I think my fraternity is toxic, makes me anxious and is  bad for my mental health, and makes me upset regularly. I care about my brothers and my organization but I shouldn't stay in if it's bad for me, right? I feel so bad about letting everyone down though. I am also afraid that I am just alienating myself from people because of my depression.

I am still dealing with my grief a lot, it takes up a lot of my thoughts. But I also am generally depressed and am already falling back into not going to class. And I'm only one week into the new semester.

Basically, if anyone has any experience dealing with these things in college, let me know how you dealt with it or what you did to keep you going to class. Also- has anyone removed themselves from a thing they used to love because it stopped being good for them?"

I am in a sort of situation that I have come to realize most people who post here are in: not great GPA, pretty decent extra-curriculars. My EC's are pretty unique and I'm using a throwaway just so that my friends (who know my reddit account lol) won't see this. 

Demographics: Chinese male, Cali, Competitive school (same-old...) No hooks lmao. Rising senior.

Intended Major(s): CS, Economics, Statistics, potentially Operations Research? (idk enough to apply to engineering schools, so I may not yet)

Academics:
ACT: 34 SAT: 2270 (720 CR, 800 M, 750 W, 9 Essay) single-sitting 
SAT 2: 800 Math 2, 750 Physics
Class rank: unavailable, but top 11-12% of class UW/W GPA: 3.67/4.15 (Weak, ik, but upward trend). Coursework:7 AP Exams taken (AP Calc AB, Calc BC, Comsci A, Statistics, Physics C Mechanics, Physics C E&amp;M, World History (lol got a 3... let's not talk about that) ). Honors and AP mainly

Awards: At least 10-15 Awards from robotics competitions, some state business tournament good placing and awards, AP Scholar w/ Distinction

-Captain of FRC Robotics Team (9,10,11,12). Won awards and went to Worlds 2 times. Led a large group of kids and wrote business proposal to gain a lot of money for funding for my team. I am currently trying to coordinate a tutoring project using robotics to teach underprivileged kids about STEM and programming and such. This is a big part of my life and I really became great at helping others learn and attacking situations analytically. 

-President of FBLA (10, VP in 11th, P in 12th). Won regional awards, in charge of the club. Lots of duties and too many to list here, but generally, I enjoy it a lot. I lead a special stock-education part of our chapter, where I teach my classmates about stocks, because I really enjoy discussing them and reading about them. All in all, I really enjoy being in this club :)

-Science Education Club where I became in charge of a tutoring project that works with our local elementary schools, as well as helping a lot to coordinate science fairs and school related events. 

-Teaching kids Computer Science A separately from school. My responsibilities include grading tests and holding study sessions with my other friends (who are teaching it with me). All kids got above a 4 and placed into higher compsci classes. Totally gratifying and fun. 

-Flute Player since 6th grade (6-12). In top orchestra of school/district (1st Flute), in top local orchestra in the region. 
Won 1st place in a solo competition. Private lessons from grades 6-10. Performed at pretty esteemed concert halls.

Volunteering:

-Local hospital for 84 hours as a patient escort.

-Local tutoring center as a teaching assistant for 100 hours. Grades and taught kids math concepts, worked with the database and actually learned how to use Excel extensively here. 

-Robotics Summer Class at local STEM center for 50 hours. Taught kids about robotics and helped them out when they were making their robots (programming, mechanical problems). Did inventory and cleaned up too.

-Church's summer camp for 75 hours. In charge of kids and taught important lessons through fun activities. Volunteered at 5ks and other fundraisers for this organization too.

Summer Activities: 

-Pre calc course (at the same tutoring center where I volunteered lol) which allowed me to take calc AB as a sophomore.

-Volunteering at church summer camp and robotics summer class to get into honors societies.

-Summer internship at Financial Services company this summer where I worked with statistics and back-tested their databases. I also worked with customers and tried to sell financial products to them, which required a lot of research (you can't sell something if you don't know everything about it!). Lots of fun, learned a lot, and I think I'm going to write about it in a supplement at the very least. 

Final thoughts:

I think that I can easily write about how I'm great at helping others and teaching, because that's a general trend in all of my extra-curriculars. What are my chances at the following schools? I'm mostly applying to east coast schools because my family is moving there once I'm done with high school (dad got a job offer in NYC for a hedge fund and my mom is currently looking for a position in that area too). 

Schools: 
1. Rutgers University 
2. UC's (Berkeley, LA, Davis, San Diego, Riverside, Santa Barbara)
3. Cal Poly SLO 
4. Cornell University
5. Brown University
6. Dartmouth College
7. Columbia University
8. University of Pennsylvania
9. University of Michigan

50lqkv,1,2016-09-01,FC St. Pauli: Trendwende auch ohne weitere Verstärkung?,betamax65,fcsp,https://www.reddit.com/r/fcsp/comments/50lqkv/fc_st_pauli_trendwende_auch_ohne_weitere/,"[](http://ift.tt/2cswKlk)Bekam kurz vor Transferschluss keinen neuen Teamkollegen mehr: Robin Himmelmann © Imago

Intern hat man beim FC St. Pauli nicht zuletzt wegen des kapitalen Fehlstarts in der Liga mit drei Niederlagen an den ersten drei Spieltagen zwar über Verstärkungen kurz vor Transferschluss diskutiert, doch letztlich haben die Verantwortlichen des Kiez-Klubs darauf verzichtet, noch einen neuen Spieler hinzuzuholen.

### Kein passender Spieler auf dem Markt

Die Optionen, die auf dem Markt waren, beheben unsere Probleme nicht. (Thomas Meggle)

_„Wir haben links und rechts geguckt. Die Optionen, die auf dem Markt waren, beheben unsere Probleme nicht. Es gibt keinen, der uns am 10. September gegen Bielefeld in eine andere Liga gehievt hätte“_, begründete Sportchef Thomas Meggle in Bild die Entscheidung gegen einen Transfer damit, dass schlichtweg kein passender Spieler zu haben war.

**Sebastian Kerk, der nun [vom SC Freiburg an den 1. FC Kaiserslautern verliehen wurde](http://ift.tt/2bGK3Ja), war zwar wohl ein Thema am Millerntor, doch nach monatelanger Pause in Folge von Achillessehnenproblemen ist der 22 Jahre alte Offensivmann aktuell noch nicht einsatzfähig und eben kein Spieler, der schon am übernächsten Wochenende gegen Arminia Bielefeld für frischen Wind gesorgt hätte.**

### Vertrauen in den Kader

Wir sind uns einig, dass wir mit diesem Kader eine stabile Saison spielen. (Thomas Meggle)

**Gleichzeitig sprach Meggle aber auch dem vorhandenen Personal sein Vertrauen aus und glaubt daran, dass damit die Wende zum Besseren geschafft und die Abstiegszone schnell verlassen werden kann: _„Wir sind uns einig, dass wir mit diesem Kader eine stabile Saison spielen.“_   
**

Im „Kicker“ (Ausgabe 71/2016 vom 01.09.2016) machte Meggle indes auch klar, dass sich teamintern nach dem Verlust von mehreren Eckpfeilern wie Lennart Thy, Marc Rzatkowski, Enis Alushi oder Sebastian Maier erst noch eine neue Hierarchie bilden müsse, die für den Erfolg enorm wichtig sei: _„Wir hatten in der vergangenen Saison einige Profis, die in einer funktionierenden Mannschaft funktioniert haben. Durch die Abgänge müssen sie nun Führungsaufgaben übernehmen. Diese Schwelle zu überschreiten ist nicht einfach, da bleibt mitunter die Leistung auf der Strecke.

50mgpy,11,2016-09-01,I've cultivated a victim mentality for too long.,ParisSky84,confession,https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/50mgpy/ive_cultivated_a_victim_mentality_for_too_long/,"I am feeling regretful right now because of really trivial issues. You can probably criticize me all you want for feeling remorseful for them too. 
I regret not going to a more prestigious university and dorming there (first world problems). I had an option between a prestigious university and a full tuition scholarship for a university I would commute to. I had suicidal thoughts beforehand, and I was self-harming as well. Even though my parents reassured me that they would pay for everything, I was still anxious about going because of how much I would pay. I thought I was too immature to go, and alongside with my suicidal thoughts, it would be too risky (financially) for my parents to pay for it. On the day I had to decide, I showed them my self-harm scars and told them I couldn't make the decision. They told me I should go to the commuter college instead. I felt thankful that they took the responsibility of making a simple decision off of me. 

Now it's been a year at this commuter college, and I still can't decide on a major. I've lost my motivation simply because the college simply isn't prestigious. My parents have to make a 45 minute trip each way to drop me off (I'm barely getting my license this week-yes, I'm a piece of shit). This makes it not only more difficult for them, but it's makes me lose opportunities to network and explore career possibilities. Yes, I know it's my fault. I also know that I can intern outside of college, but I haven't done that either. 

Looking back, I completely regret not going to the prestigious university because of how it would stop me from being too sheltered and it would make the foundations of my career a little bit more smoother. However, despite this, sometimes I can't help but get angry at my parents for not properly teaching me things from age 12-17 (changing tires, cooking, laundry). I get more embarassed that I feel this anger at my age (19) because I have the ultimate control over this. I decided not to get a job this summer either and decided to take several online courses to see what I really wanted to do as a career. I haven't finished anything. 

I am now realizing how much of a victim mentality I'm having over this regret. Honestly, I have the ultimate say on whether or not I fail at finding a career. No one truly cares about us until we actually fucking try, and I haven't. The grass is always greener, and I'm going to see this commuter college as a precious opportunity to jumpstart my career, regardless of the prestige. 

If I never cultivated a victim mentality, then I would have fucking tried to be an adult and enroll at the prestigious university. I would have gone to therapy there, treated myself, and applied myself further. It seems as if no matter where I went, it was always someone else's fault that I didn't apply myself.

Understandably, my parents are becoming more sarcastic and bitter at me for not trying. This is the first time my parents aren't putting a charade on me. I'm glad that they are beginning to recognize me for the piece of shit that I am because they shouldn't be supporting me financially or emotionally at this point (at least, in my point of view).

For now, I'm trying to get rid of this victim mentality by becoming more positive and taking simpler steps to problems. Despite this, I still feel unmotivated because I'm scared of the pain of adulthood. I know that's a generalization. I know that I will still survive because I live in such a developed nation. I still want to commit suicide, but I still think it's because I see myself as a victim. I've talked to a therapist, and he doesn't think it's serious, so it's probably just me being a helpless child. I can't help but suspect that even if I have a mental illness that it's fucking treatable and I shouldn't burden others because of it. 

I'm still a piece of shit, and I still don't have any form of purpose or motivation, but you know why? It's because I've never been hit hard with responsibilities before. 

I'm so sorry mom and dad for being a burden. I promise that I will become a fully functioning adult. I will never bother you again.

I know I'm looking for some form of validation, but I don't deserve any just yet because I haven't done anything. I just don't see a reason to live, but we all know that's bullshit."

Some years back, Washington Post reporters Mark Halperin (currently of Bloomberg News and MSNBC) and John Harris (now editor in chief of Politico) wrote a book about political journalism called “The Way to Win: Clinton, Bush, Rove and How to Take the White House in 2008.” In it, they made a famous admission about how Beltway journalism works in the digital age:

    
Matt Drudge rules our world … With the exception of the Associated Press, there is no outlet other than the Drudge Report whose dispatches instantly can command the attention and energies of the most established newspapers and television newscasts.

    
So many media elites check the Drudge Report consistently that a reporter is aware his bosses, his competitors, his sources, his friends on Wall Street, lobbyists, White House officials, congressional aides, cousins, and everyone who is anyone has seen it, too.

Mitt Romney’s former spokesman called Drudge the political media’s assignment editor. And in 2012 on the day after the election, Halperin gave credit in where credit is due in a tweet:

I had assumed that Matt Drudge’s star had faded a bit in the intervening years as fresher, sexier right-wing sites like Breitbart and The Blaze had emerged. But as Politico has reported, Drudge is doing better than ever:

    
For the first time, The Drudge Report moved into second place on Similar Web’s top U.S. Media Publisher rankings, placing just behind MSN.com with about 1.47 billion page view for the month of July. The Drudge Report’s traffic beat out the likes of news sites from Disney Media Networks (which includes ESPN.com and ABCNews.com), Yahoo, Google, Time Warner and Fox Entertainment Groups.

In an article last month called “The Man Who Could Have Stopped Donald Trump,” Oliver Darcy of Business Insider noted Drudge’s still-dominant role:

    
Drudge was the top traffic referrer to The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Fox News, and other news outlets in 2015, according to a Vocativ report. The report said the site accounted for a staggering 52 percent of referral traffic to the Associated Press.

All those organizations are very well aware of the potential for clicks from a Drudge link, and they know what kind of stories he wants to flog. The incentives to please him are obvious.

As the last leg of the 2016 campaign approaches, it’s worth remembering Drudge’s original claim to fame:

    
Web Posted: 01/17/98 23:32:47 PST — NEWSWEEK KILLS STORY ON WHITE HOUSE INTERN

    
BLOCKBUSTER REPORT: 23-YEAR OLD, FORMER WHITE HOUSE INTERN, SEX RELATIONSHIP WITH PRESIDENT

The original post, which went on to name various publications that were allegedly holding the item, put journalists at the center of the story. Needless to say, they were excited. The rest, of course, is history. For years Drudge was fed news items by the media, which would often launder them through the foreign press. Then he would feature links with screaming headlines reporters that editors could use to show that a story was “out there.”

Today such stories are still generated in the British tabloid press, but also in right-wing conspiracy sites and bigger operations like Breitbart News. Recently Drudge managed to disseminate the discredited story of Hillary Clinton’s alleged ill health by posting a picture from a fringe website showing Clinton’s slipping on the stairs some months before with this screaming headline:

    
2016: HILLARY CONQUERS THE STAIRS
    
2012: FALLS AT HOME, BLOOD CLOT
    
2011: FALLS BOARDING PLANE
    
2009: FALLS GOING TO WHITE HOUSE, BROKEN ELBOW

That story is now part of the election campaign, with people demanding her full medical records and the press watching her every move like a hawk for signs of brain damage.

With the news this week that Clinton’s right-hand woman Huma Abedin had separated from her husband, former Congressman Anthony Weiner, after yet another public humiliation, Drudge used the opportunity to tee up one of the right’s favorite rumors — that Clinton and Abedin are secret lovers. Unsurprisingly, whispers among unenlightened right-wingers about the feminist harpy Clinton’s being a lesbian go back decades. But the Abedin insinuations, which started in 2007, have taken off in this campaign.

Mainstream publications have fed the notion with click-bait stories like this slide show from Politico, which sat at the top of its “most-read” list for months this year, despite its having been originally published back in 2013. As it turned out, Drudge had been up to his old tricks. He had linked to a British tabloid story in which Abedin was quoted as saying that she thought Clinton was beautiful, which sent millions of drooling Drudge readers searching for “Clinton Huma lesbian.”

There’s no way of knowing if mainstream reporters were among those intrigued by Drudge’s dirt. But we do know that The New York Times found this item worthy of a breathless front-page lead:

    
Among the trove of emails released from Hillary Rodham Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state was this instruction to a trusted aide who needed to brief her on a matter that could not wait:

    
“Just knock on the door to the bedroom if it’s closed,” Mrs. Clinton wrote in November 2009 to Huma Abedin, then her deputy chief of staff.

Drudge doesn’t even try to find political relevance to his lewd, juvenile innuendo. But the mainstream media’s reaction to this week’s Weiner-Abedin story was hardly any better. Attempts to make it into a campaign story were downright embarrassing.

Yesterday under the headline “Weiner free!” Drudge insinuated once again that Abedin and Clinton are lovers with a picture allegedly showing the two of them hugging with joy now that they have vanquished one of their husbands. As it turned out, the other woman in the picture wasn’t Abedin. It was Burmese opposition leader and 1991 Nobel Peace Prize recipient Aung San Suu Kyi, but whatever. He made his point.

We can be sure that Drudge’s nasty little sex rumors aren’t the end of it. The more scurrilous charges that Abedin is a secret Muslim agent are now breaking into the mainstream direct from the fever swamps, via none other than Donald Trump himself. And publications like The Hill and the New York Post, hungry for Drudge links and eager to give the monster what it wants in return, are already pushing it into the mainstream. As long as Matt Drudge is driving the news cycle, it will only get worse.

I'm trying to determine if I should visit her or not, and if so, which week.

One of the week options would be in late September — I would miss an important presentation that counts for 100/700 of my points for that class. I'd also miss an art critique, but that will be fine if I miss it. But, she's in classes instead of internship at that point, and she will have much more free time to spend with me.

There's another week that works much better for me (no conflicts) in early November, but she would be at her internship four days a week, 9-5, and she wouldn't be able to spend as much time with me. This week is also slightly more expensive with airfare, but nothing unmanageable.

The other option is to not go. It's a lot of money, and I'd miss class. But it's also a unique experience that I don't think I'd have with her again.

Help me make my choice!"

I ended up getting an offer yesterday: 67k starting pay, 5k signing bonus.  I would not start until after I graduate in May, but I need to decide before Oct. 1, so in a month.  So there would be about an 8 month gap between accepting the job and starting.

I would be fine with that except they can't tell me where I would be working.  I would spend 6 months right away in their entry level training program in the midwest, then after that I would be put where there is an opening.  They said that they would try to match my location preferences, but the office I want does not have as much software dev going on as other offices, so I could end up anywhere.  If that's the case, how can I accept the pay without having any clue about cost of living?  67k would be fine in Indy; not so much in Seattle.  

I don't know if it is wise to accept my first offer, especially when I would be sitting on it for 8 months.  What if something better came along?  On the other hand, although I have a 4.0 gpa with an internship under my belt, it might be risky to assume that I will get plenty of other offers.

SUMMER PROGRAMS:


Over this summer I stayed by myself for 8 weeks in Austin, so I could attend these programs:

- I attended Create@UT over the summer, where  over the course of 5 days, I got to meet members of UT's Women in Engineering program, visit the buildings for each Engineering Major at UT, meet engineering professors at UT, attend a Computer engineering lecture, and do various hands on activities to learn about 6 different majors( Aerospace, computer/electrical, Petroleum, Chemical, Biomedical, and Civil).


- I attended Girls Who Code's summer immersion program at the nearby Austin Community College, where over the course of 7 weeks, I learned learned essential computer science concepts (conditionals, while loops, classes, etc) and applied them to Python, Pygame, C++ programming, and HTML/CSS/Javascript creating a 2D scroller game, a robot on wheels that avoided walls, and a web portfolio using Bootstrap amongst other projects. My final project composed of a text adventure/visual hybrid game (think Oregon Trail) using Pygame, with interesting visuals and 4+ different endings, that i coded and illustrated myself!

- The summer before Junior year, I was given an opportunity to travel to the Balkans, otherwise known as old territory of the Ottoman Empire. I was able to visit Bosnia, Montenegro, Kosovo, Macedonia , and Albania and visit old historical sites of the ottoman empire and learn more about each countries cultural history! After the trip, I returned to my hometown of Turkey and got to stay at the dorm of a local high school and attend a few religious classes over the course of a month!  (Not sure if this counts).


I also need help figuring out which schools I should apply to, because Im really bad at figuring out what schools I match up to.

Thank You!!

50ns4b,2,2016-09-01,Please Help: Transfer Process,ThePaulitician,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/50ns4b/please_help_transfer_process/,"I am strongly inclined to transfer immediately after this semester to a school back home.

I am a native of South Florida and I attended the summer semester at Univ. Of Central Florida (UCF) and am currently attending the fall semester here as well.

My situation for going to college was largely based off the fact that I had a lot of AP Credits. I took 15 AP Classes in high school and passed all of the exams except for 2.

I originally intended on majoring in engineering but switched to Radio/TV on the first day of summer classes. I had taken AP Chemistry, Physics 2 and Physics C: Mechanics in High school and only passed the Physics C: Mec exam. I had decided that at the end of the day, the teachers can only teach so much in an engineering/science setting. Every one of these AP Sciences I took always had a first-year teacher or a teacher who was a rookie to the class. Now, they were smart and knew the material, they just struggled teaching it as it was very difficult material. And it would ultimately be up to me to teach myself and try to get help. I tried to get help, but then realized it was *just not possible* for a student like myself. I really had never seen such challenging, unfamiliar material to the point where I didn't even know where to begin some problems. So I decided to switch to Radio/TV because I am good at public speaking and already have some advantages with YouTube and connections to current students that are also communication majors (these students are not students at UCF though).

The summer was a questionable experience, but it was easy and I got 2 A's. The fall, however, is just as easy but I can't seem to get this topic of transferring off my mind. I had to change some classes for fall and was actually **running out of classes** due to the amount of AP Credits I came in with. Therefore, **the only way I will even be able to attend UCF in the Spring 2017 semester will be to declare a minor.** This is because the Radio/TV program here is application-based and requires a certain amount of credit hours obtained *at UCF.* So I would only be taking classes in Spring for that requirement.

I really just don't see much of a future for myself here. UCF is a great school for a lot of people, but **I just don't see a future for myself down the road here.** The University is in I guess what most people would call an expansion stage; a large portion of this campus is under construction and the school has recently developed connections to funding and internships almost exclusively for STEM Majors and are now looking at opportunities for other majors. Our President is getting very old (no offense to him, but he took the position of President in 1992!) and he's been a good leader that I feel he will be hard to replace. He wasn't even able to attend most of the Opening Ceremony here for freshmen as he left the stage early barely under his own control and he studdered with the teleprompters. This school also has a lot of resources and tuition paying for things I do not even use. There is a *huge* drug and alcohol prevention program, a Pride (LGBQT) place to name a few things and I just have no use for that. I'm sorry but this is college and I have no pity for people who are alcoholics or drug addicts for the most part and the money in my tuition that goes to that is just not reasonable to me and I'm not offensive to LBGQT people so yeah... On top of this, the Radio/TV program is seeming unstable to me. The first day of COM class, my professor showed up late with a very petty excuse and they subbed in another teacher who didn't know what she was doing for the most part.

All this worries me about a future here.

I'm strongly intent on transferring back home to FIU in Miami. Their communication program is application-based too but has less requirement including the credit hours. I also would find a job with the Miami Marlins and Florida Panthers to try to get a background in sports (the portion of radio/TV I want to go into) and it will also give me connections and the opportunity to work for a team if I can't find a job with my degree. Plus, it will be cheaper and I won't be paying for these ridiculously priced meal plans and stuff. Living away from home is expensive and I didn't realize how different it can be until now. I'm not homesick as I've done very well here as you can tell, I just think I have better opportunities and a path down the road back home at FIU instead of here at UCF. My brother graduated 3 years ago and still has not found a job with his degree and I just would hate to see the same thing happen to me.

The problem with this is going to be convincing my parents about it. They are very ""helicopter-ing"" as the UCF First Year Advisors put it. I originally wanted to go to a community college for one semester  (to avoid this situation) but my parents insisted I go to a normal school. My parents have this sort of pride I guess with me going away to school, but in all hoenesty, they won't be able to afford this place after the first year and they refuse to admit that.

I have until November 1st to submit a transfer application to FIU and I am confident at this point that I would want to submit one. I got a partial scholarship here to UCF and I have no doubt that I'd be accepted at FIU at this point.

Help!

How should I approach my parents about this?

For transfer students, can you tell me what influenced your decision to transfer?

Hey so I was offered a job at a large company not traditionally in the tech industry I worked for over the summer as an intern. While I love the city they will place me at (Seattle, WA) and I think a decent starting salary of 70k I have some concerns. First the deadline to accept will be in early October thus limiting my ability to look at other companies by quite a bit since the interview season does not kick up until October. Two the actual placement is into a rotation program where I have no control over of what I actually do( I do enjoy the fact I get to try other things) my concern is I may end up in a team where I really won’t do what  I want which is Software Engineering but that may be a false thought. Three the starting salary surprisingly enough 70k is great but I guess I have it in my head that if I am going out of an ivy league school with a degree in Computer Science I should making a tid-bit more in a place like Seattle(again may just be my imagination). 

I feel like I am being quite grateful for a job offer this early on but I for some reason I am having a lot of concerns the paramount being is this not the company I was hoping to work at after spending close to 4 years of my life in a meat grinder school and not have the ability to interview seriously with companies I really want to work at. What are your thoughts and more specifically your thoughts on accepting the offer and keep interviewing regardless and if a job pops up in a place I really want to work should I go for it?

50o0gm,16,2016-09-01,Tips for Business Horizon/Job Fair?,KingKyung,VirginiaTech,https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginiaTech/comments/50o0gm/tips_for_business_horizonjob_fair/,"What are some tips on making a great first impression during your Business Horizon? Some tips for juniors/seniors I received so far:

1. **COME IN PREPARED**: Research the list of the companies you want to work/intern for, usually 10-15. Go to their website/Business Horizon page, look up the company information, positions you are interested in, prepare related questions.
2. Example questions: @#$ sounds really interesting, can you tell me more about it? 
2. Practice conversations
2. **PRACTICE ELEVATOR PITCH**: Introduce quickly, followed by questions. Name, major, year, tell me more? Within X department, do you @#$?. Practice in career center. Can be structured or have a little more freedom.
2. DON'T ask what they do. If you don't know, fake it to the best of your ability. No salary information, etc.
2. At least 10 resumes + extra just in case.
2. **Tell the company why YOU want to work for them** by using the information you received from preparation.
3. Focus on smaller companies with little lines first to get used to the environment/calm down/shake off the jitters. Plus, with them it's easier to establish more personal connection and you might even find that they are the best company for you. If desired, hit your top companies (like Big 4) later.
3. When it comes to technical questions, qualifications you put on your resume have a greater chance of being asked. So be careful what and how you put on.
4. Some companies ask for technical questions, but not all.
4. Talk about your side or in-class project and/or what you are learning right now.
11. **SHOW YOUR PASSION IN THE FIELD**: Passion speaks louder than experience; talk about your coursework, interests in the related field.
11. **FOLLOW THROUGH**: Ask for a business card. Even if they seemed uninterested, send follow-up email within 24 hours and keep the relationship up and have them keep emailing you, so they can add you to the pool. Be very polite, but short and sweet like your followup text after your first date. Start with introduction, I loved talking about A, B, and C. Hope to talk to you soon. Ask for additional steps.
10. Make a Hokies4Hire profile, and apply, but it's different between companies.
10. It's a good idea to secure summer internship/jobs in Fall rather than Spring. So take this seriously and don't procrastinate.

11. Offer time frame differs depending on companies, but it takes weeks to months.
12. Don't feel pressured to accept every interview offers, ask them for extension if needed. 
13. If you feel you waited a bit too long, ask the career services on next steps.
14. Interviews are likely to be more technical. Go to the case study workshops in the career center.

Personally, I was a transfer Junior when I first attended Business Horizon and I got completely overwhelmed and intimidated by the environment. 

I don't know what I expected, but I came in unprepared and paid the price as a result, and I'm still looking for my first internship before I graduate Fall '17."

I have an interview for an internship during the year (in SE at a small company) and am finishing up an internship in software implementation right now. 

However, whenever I look for professional positions they post huge lists of qualifications and even entry level jobs ask for 2 years of experience coding professional software. Should I go ahead and just apply any way? I feel very strong in my fundamentals but find  myself feeling rather inadequate when reading the job descriptions. I guess I am feeling intimidated by the entire process due to every job listing a lot of things I have heard of but have not had direct experience with. Is it worth applying to entry jobs that still state they are looking for 2 years of experience? I work my ass off and love to learn. I just need a shot. Thanks for the feedback!!"

Over the last year I've started dealing with urinary urgency. It started when my girlfriend and I were having unprotected sex, and I noticed that before I would go to bed I would sometimes have an urgent matter of expelling the little urine in my bladder (even if I went to the bathroom a little while ago). 

This happened for about four months, and then I started noticing it during the day. This is when I found my Urologist in Prescott, AZ. He started wondering if it was overactive bladder, but to be sure, he had my bladder x-rayed for any malignant tissue. The x-ray came back normal, there was nothing to be worried about, but the urgency was still there. He started me on Rapaflo (8mg) and said to try that for a while and see if it made anything better. At the time I was just finishing up my junior year at college, and the main side-effect of Rapaflo was feeling dizzy or nauseous. I didn't want to take that chance until after my classes were over so I waited. 

In distress of moving out of my house and into a new one (landlord issues), I ended up throwing away the Rapaflo and never starting it. Which I know was a bad idea, but anyways, I spent my summer working for a company in Salem, Oregon. This is when the urinary urgency started disrupting my sleep. 

One Friday evening I noticed that the urgency was so strong that I could not get to sleep no matter how hard I tried. I would go sit on the toilet, try to open up the urethra and try to calm it down, but nothing worked. I was awake all night, into Saturday, and awake all Saturday into Sunday. I will digress here, and state that when I went into my internship, I had what I thought was a hemorrhoid and I felt like it never went away. That being said, I noticed a connection between the rectal pain (doctors thought it was a hemorrhoid as well), and the bladder spasms (what the doctors think are happening). I mentioned the rectal pain and urinary urgency to my doctor in Prescott, and they said they could not help me. So that sucked. I had an appointment with a Proctologist to find out if I had something wrong that was effecting both, but it ended up being a dead-end. Finally, when that troublesome weekend happened, I called the on-call proctologist of the clinic, and they got me worried about having an anal abscess, which could explain both problems. So I went to the hospital and got a CT scan of my lower abdomen, with an immediate urology appointment at the local urology clinic the next day. The CT scan was negative for an abscess, and the urologist didn't find anything wrong with his side of things. He also thought it was overactive bladder, and put me on Sanctura and Rapaflo. These two medications made me feel like shit, but seemed to help for a little while. Especially the rapaflo. I was fine for about a week, but then the urgency came back. At that point the doctor recommended trying a different brand called Vesicare, which didn't help either. This all happened towards the end of my internship, and they didn't want to do a cystoscopy or anything if I was leaving (returning for my senior year at college). So I waited.

I was still taking the Rapaflo and Vesicare when I returned to Prescott. My inital urologist said next step was to get a cystoscopy and CT Urogram to try to find something. The cystoscopy was this morning, and the CT Urogram is tomorrow. The cysto was ""perfect"" (excluding the burning and even more increased urgency afterwards...) and he doesn't believe the CT will come back with anything. 

Finally concluding this long-winded post of my urinary history, my doctor is going to put me on a pediatrich dose of Imipramine. Test that for a couple weeks, then move me to an adult dose and see if that can help. I am worried about taking an antidepressant, but hope that this can finally be the light at the end of the tunnel. This effects my work, my love life, and now it is going to affect my school. I have constant urgency still, I barely sleep anymore, and I try to stay home as much as possible so I don't have to deal with any of this in an unfamiliar environment. 
Should I worry about this antidepressant? Is there anything else I can try to relieve the urgency? 
I was working out at one point, but stopped when all of this got worse because I was so tired. I try to take Azo Urinary Pain Relief when it gets so bad that I can't sleep. It helps sometimes. I'm definitely on it now that I was scoped. God the burning is terrible.

Let me know if this isn't an acceptable place to post this. Just looking anywhere for help."
50pa8u,1,2016-09-01,"My husband, an absolutely fantastic researcher and one of the hardest workers I know, is being harassed and belittled by his academic advisor and I don't know what to do about it.",peecatchwho,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/50pa8u/my_husband_an_absolutely_fantastic_researcher_and/,"Hi, as the title says, I am pretty sick of observing my husband's advisor's behavior. 


Before anyone says, ""That's academia, welcome to it; he should suck it up and get used to it,"" I wish to say that as far as I know, my husband is the only person in our university's department (large state school) experiencing this. The department is constantly advertised as a loving, welcoming community where the students are treated like family and appreciated. When we came here, that was absolutely the feelings we felt and how we felt we were treated by the department.


Over time our feelings have changed. I started with an advisor who was absolutely amazing, but our research was interrupted when he suffered a devastating injury that took him from school for an extended period of time. He and I mutually decided that I should change advisors and take a new research project (which is going very well!). 


At that same time, the department hired a new faculty member, Person A, with a certain specialty that was right up my husband's alley. We both thought it would be great and a perfect opportunity for him to have a chance at a wonderful research plan. At first, he was coadvised by Person B, a long time faculty member, and Person A. 


Because B did not have as much experience with the new research in the area, everyone made a mutual decision that it would serve my husband better if he switched to being advised by A only; paperwork was submitted and everything was great!


Over the last two years, A has presented himself as someone enthusiastic about the department and helping students, but upon closer inspection, he appears to be serving only one interest, namely, himself getting tenure. This has become more obvious in the past three months. He had a second student who was a year behind my husband, but the second student had mental issues and difficulties passing exams the first time. A convinced him to leave the department and ""drop out for the better"", despite the fact that the department wanted to work with the student and help him with his exams.


Because A has not had much luck publishing over the last few years, he has pushed all of this burden onto my husband, and it is obvious that A is feeling the pressure of his mid-tenure review. My husband took a highly competitive internship this summer and worked toward his own personal career goals of landing a great industry job upon graduation; however, this summer A applied a tremendous amount of pressure on my husband to publish papers with him and essentially ignore a large part of his internship.


Shit hit the fan when a very rude email was sent to my husband. The backstory is that he was focused on working over a particular weekend, and did not clear his email queue as fast as he usually does. A's email went unreplied-to for 12 hours,  and apparently warranted a rude email from A claiming ""calls, messages, and emails have been ignored"" and work on the paper ""has absolutely not gone as expected,"" because my husband ""seems to have plans other than to be a contributing member of a team.""


This was the ~4th email accusing my husband of not being a ""team player"" and not doing work as promised; in actuality, research is hard, and sometimes things do not go as expected!


In my husband's reply, some statements were misconstrued, and tone was inferred in the message. This opened up the door for A to approach the graduate chair about ""a belligerent student"" who is ""absolutely not completing research on time"", among other things. Also, according to A, faculty members he discussed this with ""overwhelmingly recommended"" he drop my husband as a student.



Firstly, this is definitely not the case, and it seems that A is pushing off his shortcomings onto my husband, who IS making progress on his thesis, and who has most definitely and without a doubt passed each program requirement. 


Secondly, I cannot fathom any faculty member dropping a fantastic, award winning and hard working student over ONE instance of misinferred tone in an email, which leads me to believe that he has painted a terrible picture of my husband to other faculty members, smearing his name for his own personal sake.


I don't know what to do here, considering that one of the faculty members was the graduate chair of the department who is supposed to help students with such conflicts. I think that now many faculty members just have a tainted image of my husband because of the skewed picture A has painted.



It is really easy to read this and say we are overreacting, but the things he is dealing with have plagued him to some degree for the past year, and it has taken a toll on him mentally. He is now convinced that he can never work hard enough to satisfy his advisor, that he is a failure, and that his mental state is not important to his advisor (he battles depression anyway, and his advisor has made comments to the effect of ""you should have NO free time in graduate school,"" and ""depression is not an excuse"").


I am at a loss here, and am running out of ways to support my husband besides just convincing him that he IS worth something and that he CAN finish his work despite the beliefs of his advisor. I don't know what to do. :(

50pehy,1,2016-09-01,[Loan] Best loan options of around $20k for a soon-to-be college graduate (non-tuition related)?,finance_throwaway64,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/50pehy/loan_best_loan_options_of_around_20k_for_a/,"Hi everyone.

Short backstory: 22 years old 4th year college student, zero debt until now (had a credit card since 17 and actively used it all the time while paying it off in full at the end of every month) because I managed to pay my school/housing expenses using money I earned during internships and such. Comes Fall 2016, the company I used to work for during last school year (because I interned for a different company in a different state) got absorbed into another company and terminated. I saved enough during summer to pay for my tuition and a few months of rent, but that is about it. The company I interned with for summer gave me a full-time offer (~$9k/mo+stocks) with a signing bonus of around $30k (that I haven't even negotiated up yet, I have time until about end of October), but I only receive $5k on signing and the rest with my first paycheck. These $5k might last me a few more months, but not enough until I graduate (my rent is $1k/mo for a shared apt + some food/gas expenses, urban area).

Therefore, I decided that I need to take out a loan until I graduate in May. I won't have time for any work during the semester anyways because of how many hours of school and TAing that I am doing (had to request an override permit to go over the maximum allowed credit hours for my institution).

Would taking out a loan in my situation be not a bad idea? And if no, where should I take that $20k loan from if I am planning to pay it off within the first month of me starting the job I mentioned before (which would be around July-August, because I wanted to take a few of months off after graduation since I haven't had a single summer or even a month off since starting college)??

**TL;DR**: I have a full-time job offer lined up (I just need to sign it, which I did not yet because I am waiting on a few competing offers) after I graduate this May, however, my current savings will last me only a couple of months tops (even if I just pay rent and nothing else). The offer is good enough so that even the signing bonus alone covers the total amount of loan I am planning to ask for (but I will only be able to receive that bonus with my first paycheck after I graduate). I can't have a job right now because I am taking way too many hours of school in order to be able to graduate in May. Is a private educational loan (from a bank, for example) of $20k max a good idea? If yes, which one offers the best conditions?

**EDIT**: On another thought, can I qualify for a private (from a bank, for example) student/education loan? Technically, I only need money to pay housing expenses, which my college includes into their estimation of Cost of Attendance."

I'm a recent college graduate who is turning 22 on Sunday. It took me until now to come to senses with how I've been feeling lately.

Because my college internship hired me full-time, I accepted the job because it was employment right out of school. When we all graduated (my roommates and best friends), we moved out of our college house and parted ways. I stayed in the area for my job, and found an apartment to rent. My summer was great, because one of my other friends from school roomed with me for before he had to go back to school. As of last Wednesday, I've been living on my own for the first time in my life.

I don't know many people in the area, and my phone sure isn't buzzing like it used to. Besides the fact that I don't have a significant other (or never have for that matter), I'm not the most social person. I'm living in a pretty rural area and finding people (not only someone to date, but friends also) is hard to come by- even dating/meetup apps have been not helpful for me.

It's taken me until now to realize, that I really don't have anything in my life besides work. Work is starting to become a bother, because I'm incredibly underpaid for my field and my take net take home is about $200-$300 at the end of the month (after all expenses). If my parents weren't able to help me out with my groceries, I would be going into my savings to work at a job I'm not happy with anymore. I plan to have a new job before the start of next year. A lot of the time I question why I didn't just find a job back at home and live with Mom &amp; Dad for a year or so.

I've dealt with depression in the past, and have been prescribed SSRI's which I did not like. I felt that they didn't work for me and I felt mad at the fact that I had to take a drug to make me feel ""normal"".

Tears are beading down my face as I'm writing this post, as it looks like I'll be spending my 22nd birthday alone- the first birthday I've ever spent not in the presences of friends or family.
I really don't know what I'm expecting from this post. Maybe some advice, or a feeling of comfort. Mainly just to vent out because I haven't had anyone in my personal life to talk to about things like this for a while now."

I'm sure this has been posted tons of time but I wanted to hear what everyone's experiences is like to land their first IT job. To give y'all a quick background on me... I've been working in sales/account management for the past 10+ years. I played around with computers but never did anything too crazy with it. I took an A+ course back in 05/06 or so but never took the test (I should've). Fast forward to now, my last two roles was in account management with companies that sell Firewall and Networking gear. I've been able to hold my own on most of the conversations I had with customers but I still needed help when it got too technical.

I am currently enrolled at my local college within the CIS program but I shift gears a bit and now taking Helpdesk Support classes and hopefully complete the program by Summer 2017. Aside from that, I am taking my 901 next Wednesday (wish me luck!) and hopefully pass and take the 902 in October. With that being said, what else should I be doing? I've been looking for internships, speaking to recruiting agencies that place IT folks but haven't had any luck. I am for sure not giving up on what I'm doing but a little motivation would be nice!

Again, I am based out in the Bay Area. Anyone looking for a Jr person or know of any internships?

Thanks guys!!!"

--------------

So I'm 26, a math major from a good school that graduated in January of 2014.  I had one internship in NYC while at college, but that insurance company barely ever has any openings.  I'm currently working at a Barnes and Noble part time, been there for about half a year now.  

The time between my graduating and getting the part time job was filled with an infinite number of job applications, interview rejections (whether they be full time or part time jobs), and worries about it looking more and more hopeless for any companies wanting to hire me.  I've contacted lots of friends, but no one works anywhere that would have a job related to what I could apply for.  

My resume is solid, my interpersonal attitude and interview skills are fine, and I know my biggest weaknesses are the lack of experience, lack of connections, and broadness of my major, but I can't go back and change any of that.  I suffered from some extremely serious health problems in college that left me hospitalized a few times at the worst, and that clearly hurt my chances at stellar grades and more internships.  

So I'm not sure what to do.  I've been getting less and less responses from insurance/financial/tech/etc companies since I've started working part time, which makes it even more discouraging to go into work every day.  It honestly feels like I'm trapped there now since I can't find any full time job.  

I've considered almost every different job option you can think of, teacher, actuary, underwriter, business analyst, financial analyst, even going back to grad school etc etc.  I've been applying to any and all options I can (and I half regret not signing up for grad school in the spring when I started at B&amp;N, I assumed I'd have a real job by now) but I'm not sure what else to do.  

So does anyone have any suggestions of how to get out of this part time ""trap""?  It's not a terrible job, the people are all so nice and I love books so I enjoy being there, but sometimes I get home to my parents' house and it just hits me that I'm not getting anywhere with my life, seemingly no matter how hard I try.  I hate that feeling.  "

Need help deciding.",eldigg,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/50pwp0/two_job_offers_conflicting_advantages_and/,"I'm pretty new out of college, graduated in December 2014 from no-name state school, and I had an internship at a very small software company in town.  I got an offer and accepted a full-time software dev position at a large insurance company, right of school.  I've worked for them nearing on two years.

I've generally disliked working for the insurance company (old tools, old software, people who haven't kept up with modern tech, yearly release cycles).  I'm good friends with a number of people there, which has mitigated the dislike.  However, two weeks ago I moved to a newly created department within the same insurance company.  It promises modern development practices and a large number of experienced and passionate coworkers; we have been told that since it has good people in it, we'll be somewhat able to define our own tooling/processes etc.  I've met most of the people I'll be working with, and they all seem intelligent and team players.  It is a large opportunity within the company (so I'm told).

Here's the conflict, the place I interned at contacted me and offered me what is essentially a technical architect / software engineering position as they do an application rewrite.  They're very small, it would be me and two/three or so other new hires (which I've been offered to have input on their hiring).  This would bring the company to about seven employees.  There would be considerably more freedom in choosing tools/language/frameworks, and the work would probably be more interesting.  However, it's about 10k less salary, and only offers health insurance.  I have concerns about company stability (since it is so small), and due to a health condition I absolutely have to have decent quality health insurance.  Another concern is the possibility of not having a good mentor.

I've spent a long time trying to figure out which is better, but it is very hard not really knowing what to expect with my new position at my current company.

tl;dr Conflicting advantages/disadvantages, having trouble deciding between two companies."

Considering a gap year.,RedDeadPill,asktrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/asktrp/comments/50qhun/is_university_worth_it_cs_degree_considering_a/,"Uni starts in a couple of weeks **(UK)**, I didn't apply in time to make it into any halls where most of the socialization happens and friendship circles form, there are also hall specific freshers activities I'll probably miss out on. This means I will have to rent a place with a few other students.

Considering my Degree **(Computer Science)**, Is University worth it? I've heard that experience in coding is sufficient enough to land you a job or at least an internship where you can rack up industry experience. **Would a degree really separate you that much from other job applicants?** **Is the debt worth it?**

**My three options are:**

1. Take a gap year, save until January and leave, start Uni next year and get into a good hall/accommodation. Ideally I'll earn whilst abroad.

2. Put University off completely and work on learning computer languages on my own, seeking out internships. (I only know very basic JavaScript as of now.)

3. Suck it up, go university this year, put in extra effort to meet other people, network and form friendship circles. **(I'm friends/acquaintances with one person from my hometown who's also going to the same uni.)**

Honestly, despite the fact I'll have to save-up, the gap year is most attractive to me right now. Considering I've never been abroad and have very little worldly experience. I'am only half prepared for University right now, some advise would be appreciated."

But I had a clingy girlfriend of 2 years who pretty much left me for no reason. Saying shes upset. 

Shes had a tough history, I know shes had depression. I always did do everything I could for her. She would say things like sometimes I want to date you sometimes I dont. She would break up with me every few days for 2 hours and come back. One time in january she made it all dramatic and left for a few days and came back. 

She doesnt have any friends and complains about it often. On Saturday I noticed a guy who she doesnt know, was talking to her her over a video game, Sunday is when she stopped responding, and Monday is when she said its over. 
I feel like the guy influenced her in leaving me. 

But do clingy people usually come back? She wanted me to call her 24/7. And she was always addicted to me. 

I cried a bit for the first day, and begged her not to leave over text. She wouldnt bother picking up the phone. The next day though she said give her a few weeks. I dont know if shes trying to just make me wait a few weeks and get over her, or if she genuinely wants a few weeks. 

I dont want to toot my horn but her whole life, she suffered from depression and a moody family. And I honestly felt I was one of the best things that happened to her. she wore my tshirts day after day, kept telling me how cute I was, she loved getting presents and me comforting her when she was upset. 


I did as much as I could but this past month(s) I have been busy with work and I couldnt call her while at my internship, even though she wanted me to. 

I really miss her, Ill get over it if i absolutely have to, but Im not sure. Any input?

Add on: On Saturday she was even talking about buying a new video game I was playing to keep playing together.

I just finished an internship at a well known tech company in the bay area with an outstanding evaluation and a potential return offer which  they have considered my situation and I think? agreed on bringing me back. I am also in contact with another company that I interned for that is also excited with potentially bringing me back but they do not know about my current situation yet.

Currently, I have these paths in mind for the summer before going back to school:

Taking the return offer and intern for the same company again.

Pros:

* There looks to be a high percent chance that I will be received back by the team
* It is a well known tech company; from the word around, if I were to have them back to back, it would reflect as something positive on my resume

Cons:

* For the same company though, I am looking to intern at another team instead, I don't know how the process will go
* Not sure how the visa process will work since technically I am not in school? and I am not a US citizen

Trying out and apply to other companies for the summer

Pros:

* Diversity in experience, maybe I might land with a top tier company with my current resume
* Securing another location for potential full time after I graduate

Cons:

* Have to use the time off to prepare for the interview process
* I might not even be qualified for many because I am technically not in school at the time
* If I end up with nothing, pretty much in some ways, I have wasted a noticeable chunk of time

Going back to school for a non-degree term for elective courses

Pros:

* Refine me in the school environment
* Allows me to learn courses that I normally cannot take due to my schedule

Cons:

* It costs money
* Not sure if I want to be in school for 8 months in a row, (although this will not be a full load)
* I might have a gap in my resume where it is noticeable to the employers when I apply for jobs internally through my school for my next internship

Take the summer off

Pros:

* More time to reach my goals

Cons:

* If I were to reach my goals earlier, I will have a summer where I am doing nothing?
* Not earning anything to help pay for my tuition
* I might have a gap in my resume where it is noticeable to the employers when I apply for jobs internally through my school for my next internship

Overall, I don't know which route would be the best to take. Although I probably may go back, I also do want to take a step up and get a different (potentially better) internship to expand my resume and portfolio. Which path(s) do you think should I take and which one will benefit me the most overall? (career and personal wise)

We got into several fights throughout high school because of that. I ended up being really scared of telling them my thoughts because they'll criticize them as well as a lowered self-confidence because they say God will take away everything good I had if I disobey them or be ""too proud"".

Over the course of my first 3 years in universiy, I tried to please my parents as much as possible by doing nothing but school, only looking at jobs and website they'll be happy with. I actually got into a fight with them because they forced me to show them my browsing history and saw a bunch of video game sites. Needless to say, those years were the most miserable years in my life. I always got a summer job only because of my parents or their friends. I also ended up having to do an extra year of school because I fucked up too many courses because of me lacking drive. I ended up developing a habit of not telling my parents anything they didn't like and to be a people-pleaser.

When PEY (a year in my program for taking time off school to work) came, I ended up at a job I got through my parents' friends. Needless to say, I was fucking miserable. During that time, I ended up deciding on my dream and applied to the Canadian Forces Reserves. Over the course of a few months, I got another internship, and I also got sworn into the military. By the time I got back to 4th year, I realized I fucking hated school and that I'd rather jump out of a building than go for a Master's like what my parents wanted. Long story short, I managed to trudge through the school year and kept my Canadian military application and swearing-in a secret.

I got shipped out to basic training in June and ended up getting my phone taken away. The next time I called them, they were hysterical because they thought I went missing. I wasn't sure what happened, but I realized I didn't give a flying fuck about what they thought anymore. Even though we had a fight, I felt free for the first time in my life because they had zero power over me. I made friends during that course, and I did my best. My parents did come up to visit once, but only because I invited them. It was the first time we were on even terms instead of them looking down at me. I ultimately graduated top of my class in basic training, and my instructors said I'll have a great career in the military. 

Needless to say, my parents saw me in a whole new light when I got back home. They admitted that they thought the military wasn't right for me and that that they'd have been happy if I passed, they weren't ready at all for me being the top recruit. They finally said they'll support me if I decided to use my engineering degree to pursue a military career.

This summer was the first time I felt good about myself. The top recruit award didn't just boost my confidence in myself as a Canadian soldier, but also in myself as a person. It was the first time I found self-confidence instead of saying to myself I didn't deserve success. This school year (also my last) will be the first year I feel confident, and it'll be the first year I actually do something I enjoyed rather than what my parents approved of.

p.s. I had a few drinks, in case anybody notices I'm kind of inarticulate."

I know a lot of that is based off of what you want to do as a practicing attorney, your grades, and the school you go to, but I feel like some of you can still offer me good insight.

Due to a strong family connection, there is a good chance I'll be able to lock in an internship for the Senior Vice President Legal &amp; Regulatory Affairs of a Fortune 500 company in Switzerland, and this sounds like a dream come true. I'm very lucky if it comes to fruition. But is this a fantastic experience for a law student? It nearly sounds as though this role could be more administrative or business related and would be almost a divergence from the law practice. I don't know him personally, so I can't ask what his day to day business is. Obviously I would if he ever seriously began speaking to me about it (which I expect to happen relatively soon).

To be clear, my interests are in international, corporate, business, tax, real estate law. Very broad I know, but I feel like this could easily combine many of those into one. 

Mainly, I just want to make sure that this would be solid opportunity for my future as an attorney, if I were to take it (either to try and end up with that company or to use it to go elsewhere as a 2L). If it isn't, where should I focus? Do 2L internships prefer a certain type of 1L internship? Any and all help you could lend me would be appreciated."

It's been a while since I've gotten out of a city setting, and spent some time in the outdoors, near a fire, with people I actually care about. I travel a lot for work, and it seems like when I do actually get time at home, I spend it working in my home office while I do laundry, and begin packing to leave town again. Lots of airports, lots of hotels, lots of rental cars. 

Earlier today, I caught a really early flight from out west back home to the Midwest. I knew that later this afternoon, it would be nothing but me, and a few lifelong friends from elementary school packing up the car, and heading to the northeastern part of my state, where there's a popular peninsula community on one of the Great Lakes. Campfire, hikes, cold beer, and conversation from today through Sunday. This group of friends, all of us being about 30, are the type where we can all ""let down our guard"" a bit, tell bad jokes, etc. 

You know the type of friends. The people who've known you since your mom was still picking your outfits. 

In the midst of my packing, I remember looking at a portable charger sitting on my desk this morning that my cousin had given me as a Christmas gift.

""Should I bring it,"" I asked myself out loud, as if doing so would make the decision clearer. Don't laugh, this was a serious decision! I know myself well enough to know that, given the opportunity, with nobody around, I am still attached to my phone, and will still sneak in a work e-mail or two. That mindless action of swiping up on your phone and searching for wifi.  Don't pretend, you don't do the exact same thing to save on your data charges whenever possible, or have the fear of your phone dying when you just ""need"" to Google something.

Whatever, I threw the portable charger, AC adapter, and white cord into my backpack, zipped it up, and told myself I wouldn't tempt myself. ""Shit,"" I remember thinking. I almost forgot my stainless steel coffee mug, too. I quickly grabbed that and was out the door. 

The plan was to pick up my friend Jay, and drive to our hometown, only about an hour, to meet a couple of our other friends, Ben and Katie. From there, we'd hop in Ben's large SUV, and then nothing but the open road. Tomorrow, we were going to meet our friend Greg at his house, who now lives on the peninsula with his new wife. 

Well, we pulled up to Ben's place, and they were waiting next to his SUV, on the sidewalk, with their bags neatly resting by their feet. 

""Christ,"" I said to Jay. ""Either they're shooting the shit and haven't packed the car, or something is wrong."" 

Yeah, something was definitely wrong, I thought, just as Jay said, ""Well, Ben is beet red in the face, and already cracked a beer. That's not a good sign."" I pulled up behind them, put the car in park, and we got out. 

""Check engine light is on,"" Ben said before swilling down the rest of his luke-warm can of cheap beer, and greeting me with a hug. ""You mind driving? I don't want to risk it if it's something serious,"" he asked.

""Not a problem, we'll make it work,"" I replied quickly. I just wanted to get going. The drive would be cramped, now, but it's only three hours, and I'd be driving my new car, so what do I care? We threw our bags into the trunk, somehow fit the cooler in there, too, and hit the road. 

Once we got out of the city traffic, Katie helped me navigate the scenic route north. We made the decision to stay off the interstate, and were hugging the coast of the Great Lake the entire time. The views are stunning. For those of you who haven't been near one of the Great Lakes, it's almost as beautiful as the ocean. Endless water over the horizon. I could only catch a few glimpses when I was driving, though, since I had to keep my eyes on the road. 

Except for one pit-stop for fire wood, ice, and a bottle of bourbon, we made it there in 3.5 hours, and pulled up to the ranger station, where a tall, lanky guy in a green uniform put out his hand to stop us. We paid him the fee, filled out the form, and we were ready to go. 

""The tower is closed for repairs, but everything else is open. Should be a great night to check out the sunset from one of the bay-side bluffs,"" the park ranger said. I couldn't wait. Do you remember that restless feeling when you were a kid, the night before a field trip or something fun? 

""Sunset? Bluffs? Let's do it all,"" I joked. 

""Hey can we get a site with the electric hook-up,"" Ben asked. I caught myself sneering at him because I knew if we had a site with an electric hook-up, I would be even more tempted to charge my phone and ""check-in"" from time to time. 

""You got it,"" the ranger said. It was a done deal, and now I'd have to exercise some real self-restraint.

The night couldn't have gone more perfectly. In the evening, the temperature dropped down to about 60, and the highs would be in the mid 70s throughout the trip, with no humidity. We climbed the scenic tower, even though we were told not to. You can't visit this particular state park without climbing the giant wooden tower. Likely a stupid  move after we'd been warned, but we survived. The ranger was right. The sunset was breathtaking. A myriad of oranges and reds popping out of the horizon as the sun seemingly sunk into the water. You could actually feel the warmth of the rays on your face. 

Once it got a little darker, we saw the ranger truck shining his light on the tower.

""A white walker approaches The Wall, my lord"" Jay whispered. We all giggled as we sat on the observation platform, hiding. I peeked back down, and the small pick-up the ranger was driving was gone. Must have just been a nightly check, or something. 

We made it back to camp, sipped on a little bourbon by the fire, caught up with one another.  Katie just started a new job in logistics, Ben was still working as an accountant in the same firm that hired him as an intern back when we were in college. Jay was bartending and just recently got accepted into the police academy. 

Ben has been known to drink a lot. Some things never change, as they say. ""I don't feel so good,"" he said at one point. 

""Don't you puke on my shoes, Harry,"" I joked, quoting a 90's Travolta mobster movie. That got a laugh, and definitely made the situation less embarrassing for Ben, who eventually did the ""puke and rally"" technique. I think that's more common in our state than any other, unfortunately.

I can't tell you how refreshing it was to be around people I have known for 25 years. All of our families know each others families, and we've all shared so many of the same experiences, good and bad. We talked about Katie's mom, who passed away abruptly when we were all in college. God, I think that might have been the last time we were all in the same room together. We also did some bad impressions of elementary school teachers that we had. 

At one point, I just sort of dazed off, watching the three of them interact, laughing 'til they were red in the face, and so on. It hit me: I really needed this. Even with traveling so much for work and being around people constantly, then coming home to an empty apartment, I've been really concerned about what direction my life is headed. Maybe this trip was exactly what I needed to break some of the loneliness I've been feeling...that overwhelming feeling of stress and having nobody around to talk to just seemed to disappear, even in the short time we'd hung out tonight. Sometimes in the midst of wondering where my life was headed, I just wanted it to all go away.

""Alright, I've gotta piss,"" I said as I looked around for a flashlight. 

""Don't break the seal,"" Jay yelled. I couldn't find a flashlight, so I grabbed my phone, swiped up, and clicked the little flashlight icon. 

""I'll be right back,"" I muttered as I scurried off. 

There is a convenient little pathway through a very short strip of woods, maybe a quarter of a city block in length, leading from our campsite down to a semi-sand beach. The flashlight turned off, right as I was ""aiming,"" so I swiped up to turn the light back on. Fuck, there it was. I was pretty buzzed, and saw the wifi icon, and thought, let me just open the ""mail"" app, check once, and make sure no last minute work e-mails came in while we were on the road. ""After all,"" I bargained with myself, ""I'm taking tomorrow off, so something might've come through that needs my attention.""

I searched for a wifi connection, and sure enough, ""Free,"" it said. I can't tell you what a relief that word is, especially when I spend $5 here and $10 there for wifi in-flight and in airports. Such a scam. 

I clicked on it, refreshed my mail. Nothing. Great. I sneaked a quick cigarette while I was by the water, and took a moment to let it sink in. Here I was, in the middle of nowhere, with great friends, and not a care in the world. It was so quiet, save for the sound of the lake. 

I made my way back to the campsite. 

Nice, a practical joke. They were gone, fire still going, and my beer sitting right where I left it. Their bags and camp chairs were gone too, though. And only my tent remained.

What a bunch of pricks. 

""Okay guys. Funny,"" I said quietly to myself. 

""Fuck 'em,"" I thought. I sat back down, and opened another beer. Nice, there's that bottle of bourbon, too. I smoked another cigarette. For you smokers reading this, it was the type that hits so perfectly after you've had some alcohol, in combination with the cool, outdoor air. Or maybe it was because this was the first pack I've purchased in nearly a year. Probably a mistake, we'll see.

As a half hour went by, I starting to get a little pissed. Alright, granted, the joke was good, and took some effort. And, if they had been kidnapped or if something was wrong, I would have heard shouting, a struggle, something. The spot where I went to pee wasn't that far away, and again, if somebody had abducted them, would the suspect really be so meticulous as to have them round up their stuff?

I sat there and gave myself the decision to have one more swallow of bourbon once I finished my beer, or climb into my tent and close my eyes. I decided to go to bed. It had been a long day of travel for me, having started on the west coast at 4AM. I knew eventually, they'd come back when they realized I wasn't paying attention to their prank. The fire was small enough now that I dumped a little bit of water on it, and it started to sizzle. I got into my tent. The wind started to pick up. That noise. My god, it reminded me of something out of a scary Halloween movie. The strong wind rushing through the trees, coupled with just feeling very alone suddenly. 

Another half hour passed, and now I was starting to get a little scared. What finally got my ass out of the tent was that my head was starting to throb, and the smell of the smoke was just irritating me. The wind was blowing perfectly in the direction of my tent. 

Maybe if I contacted them, they'd know the gag was up. I group-texted all of them. 

""Okay, joke's on me. Ha ha. Let's call it a night tho so we can be at Greg's on time. Wanna do an early morning hike?"" 

I put on my hoodie, and went and sat in my chair, and chugged some water, checking my phone intently for a reply. I peed again, this time behind my tent, and felt my anger level begin to rise with every moment that passed. I convinced myself they'd respond, or agree that the joke had gone on long enough. But nothing. 

I started walking down the narrow dirt road that even my car had a hard time fitting down earlier today. It probably goes without saying, but it was dark and quiet. The type of dark where you're not sure if something is wrong with your eyes. And so quiet.

Perhaps somebody in a nearby tent invited them over for drinks or food? Maybe a ranger came by and told them to evacuate? I have no idea, but I'm humoring every possibility. But if that happened, why would they leave without me? Are you kidding? 

I made it to a nearby campsite. Vacant. I walked to the next campsite. Vacant. In fact, I still couldn't hear or see anybody else when I stopped. I decided to get back to my car and drive to the ranger station. I don't know why, but this might have been the eeriest moment in the dark. As I slowly drove up, I could see a green blinking light in the station. It's so dark out side that the tiny LED illuminated the interior of the whole booth-sized station. What's weirder is that I got this feeling like I was just here, with my friends, choosing a campsite, and getting ready for a great weekend.

""CLOSED,"" the sign said. ""OPEN DAILY 7AM-8PM"". I tapped on the glass just to make sure there wasn't some 24-hour emergency staff on site, and peered inside as best I could. Nobody.

Driving back just now, it dawned on me. It's basically Labor Day weekend. These sites, every one, should be full. 

As I write this, I'm at our site. I'm waiting and hoping there's some logical explanation for this. I've sent a few more texts, and I've also tried calling each of their phones. I tried calling Ben's phone first because I thought I might be able to hear it in the distance- he has this obnoxious ""boats and hoes"" ringtone from Stepbrothers. I couldn't hear anything. I even tried to call Greg, but he works until later. All of their phones must have been turned on, though, because they went to voicemail after a normal number of rings. 

I'm going to try to close my eyes for a bit and figure this out. Who knows, it's still early enough in the night that I probably won't be able to sleep. Maybe I'll make a fire? But I don't necessarily want to draw attention to myself? I'm getting increasingly frantic now. I know it will be easier to navigate during the daylight, though, and try to find some tracks or anything that might help me. But should I wait that long? 

In the morning, I can check back at the ranger station, or drive out to Greg's place. Hopefully at that point, they will have returned, and I can humiliate myself in front of the r/nosleep community when I post an explanation and have fallen for some ridiculous hoax. 

I'm newer to Reddit, but I know how helpful you all can be, just based on reading responses on other posts. If you have any idea what might be going on, please help me out. I'll update you as soon as I know more. 


---------------------

Update- 12:27PM: I don't know if any of you will see this, but I'm okay, and I have located my friends. I'm with them now, but something huge is off. I'm going to try to get in front of a computer tonight, and give you the long version. But for now I'll share this: Turned off wifi as per suggestion in comment, checked out of camp- they had no record of my checking-in yesterday.

50rair,1,2016-09-01,Worried about the future,PussyMoneyWeed_,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/50rair/worried_about_the_future/,"I've spent the last 3 years of college partying my ass off, dicking around on financial aid refunds, and generally making no progress toward setting myself up for the future. The result of that has been a 2.8 GPA and experience that consists of nothing but a high school summer job working for Baskin Robbins and an ongoing volunteership for an online crisis hotline that admittedly, I did mostly to feel good about myself. I'm not sure what I'm going to do after graduation - I'm an econ major with a business minor, originally intending to do investment banking or something else in finance for the money and prestige (like I'll ever get in with my GPA and no experience), I'm interested in cog sci more than anything and wish I had majored in that instead, and I'm considering computer science as the practical path that asks for more hands on experience than anything. At this point it's far too late to change my major without taking an extra year if not more of college. Worst of all, I was okay with all of this for the past 3 years.

Fast forward to today. I started dating a girl a couple months ago, and I can actually see a future for us. In fact, we've talked about getting married in the future once we both have stable jobs (at first jokingly, but now seriously). That's when it hit me, along with the fact that I'm about to be a college senior, that I do not have my life together at all.

It feels like I have so much that I need to do. I've been told that I need to gain practical skills, so do I start self-studying CS? I also need to find an internship, but where would I even start? I never got involved in any clubs and I dropped out of my frat early on because I was an ass and joined only for the parties, which turned out to not be that great. At the same time I probably need to find a job, for money if I need an extra year of college, or at the very least work experience (despite not necessarily being in my field). I just feel like I have so much to do with so little time, and I'm especially having a hard time because my girlfriend just left to study abroad until December.

Please help me Reddit. What should I do?"
50riy2,0,2016-09-02,F4M Some fun scenes!,[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/50riy2/f4m_some_fun_scenes/,"Hey there DPP, tonight I have a couple scenes for you all to choose from and/or work out with me!

We can discuss specific prompts in private and please, do not message me with a scene already started, that’s the easiest way to get blocked. The same goes for one line/word messages.

I'm fairly open with my kinks with my only hard ""no""s being scat, unrealistically huge cocks, 3rd person writing, and vomit.

Without further ado, here are some of my prompts:

**The Lawyer and the Con**: For this one, I was thinking I’d play a young and up and coming lawyer tasked with defending you. We can discuss the specifics in PMs but one thing is for certain, I’ll be taking my payment in the form of cock.

**Breaking the Law**: For this one, the roles are reversed, I was caught committing a crime and you’re the officer/journalist/detective who caught me. Where that leads? Well that’s up to you.

**Wrong neighborhood**: What happens when me, a young and sexy girl finds herself in the wrong neighborhood? Do you help me find my way or decide you want to take advantage?

**Sports Star and Reporter**: A classic scene were I’m a reporter and you’re the sports star, that can only lead one place, right?

**The intern and the boss**: Fairly self explanatory, I’d love to be the intern at her dream job who meets you, her boss and potentially so much more.

**I’m gonna fuck your sister**: For this one, you’ll play my little brother’s best friend, I’ll be his big sister who is now recently single and back in town. You guys always joked that you would fuck each other’s mom/sister only this time, you’re not joking.

**Giving back**: In this RP, I’ll play someone  famous be it an actress or singer or sports star. You’ll be the person tasked in helping me set up some sort of event to give back to the community, only you want me to give you something more than this event.

**Bullies always win**: In this one, you’ll be as the title suggests, you’re a bully who grew up terrorizing my son (or brother), only unlike the stories we tell our kids to make them feel better, you know better. You get what you want, when you want it, in this case, me.

For those of you so inclined, I do like playing celebs in any of these roles so we have visual aids, if you’d like me to be any, just ask!

As for celebs I’d play, here are a few:

Celebs: **Mary Elizabeth Winstead**, **Maisie Williams**, Anna Kendrick, Selena Gomez, Hailee Steinfeld, Taylor Swift, Willa Holland, Daisy Ridley, **Melissa Benoist**, Emma Stone/Watson/Roberts, Hayley Williams, Alison Brie, Alexandra Daddario, Aubrey Plaza, Bella Thorne, **Alicia Vikander** Jennifer Lawrence, Keri Russel, Neve Campbell, Jennifer Connelly, Scarlet Johansson, Sophie Turner, Oliva Munn, Olivia Wilde, **Miranda Kerr**, Jessica Biel/Alba, Victoria Justice

YouTube/Social Media: **Meg Turney**, Lia Marie Johnson, **Alli Speed**, Barbara Dunkelman, Ashley Jenkins, **Bree Essrig**, Maude Garrett, Trisha Hershberger, Datev Gallagher, Lindsey Stirling, Christina Grimme, Dodger, iJustine, or Meghan Camarena.

Whew, that was a lot. Hope to get some dirty orangereds soon!

Just so we're clear, everyone I'm playing in this post is 18+, so the prompts would take place in the future."
50s07x,0,2016-09-02,I [25 F] am having an issue with deciding between dating a new love [26 M] and a college crush [29 M]. The timing is just awful.,throwawaythekey22,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/50s07x/i_25_f_am_having_an_issue_with_deciding_between/,"Okay, so, 6 years ago I met Y[29M], and we instantly got along. We spent a week straight together during a blizzard, and the week ended in a kiss. Immediately after the kiss, he got very upset, kicked me out of his room, and explained he had a girlfriend. We spent the next 4 years battling an emotional connection whenever we saw each other at school. He refused to see me as his lover, even though when given the chance we would always cross that imaginary line. We would leer at each other constantly, and have intense discussions about our interests in history and philosophy. He was my dream partner, and I pursued him as hard as I possibly could.

Eventually, I got tired of being in love with someone who just didn't feel the same way, and we drifted apart. I kept dating these guys I didn't care for, and I always thought of Y. I even had a 3 year long relationship with a man, tried to make it work, but I would always think back to Y. It became hard for me to even bring Y up to myself, and I pushed him back from my thoughts, because I knew he never wanted to be with me. He made his choice, and the worst part was it sounded like his girlfriend didn't even care for him. I know/knew we could care for and challenge each other.

After I finally got close to not thinking of him, he contacted me. He explained that things weren't working with his girlfriend and they officially ended. He apologized for mistreating me, and admitted that had he been more mature and sure of himself he would have pursued me. I instantly met with him, and we began dating soon after that. One month after dating, out of the blue, he sat me down at his kitchen table and said he was worried about getting his work done and finding the right job, and he needed to end things. I was completely devastated because I was sure I wanted to be with him, and we were having such a great time together. Things were hard because we were poor and looking for work, and I had an internship I didn't much enjoy, but I thought we could at least help each other through it all. I left crying after we talked for hours, and I told him I would not like to see him again ever. I was so hurt. I spent a lot of time alone trying to recover from this pain. I got involved with a man who was emotionally abusive because I just stopped caring. I loved Y so much, and it hurt to be turned away again.

So, I start a new very relaxed job working with some close friends. I'm dating this emotionally abusive dude, who doesn't really see himself as emotionally abusive, but trying to ""help me succeed"" by basically controlling everything I do (friends, activities, interests). He was pretty unbearable. I complained constantly to everyone at work about how much I disliked him, but I stuck with it because I needed to make something work, and he was smart and exciting. my boyfriend hosts an event where my coworkers show up, and one of the coworkers I don't know a lot about sits down next to me (this is the 26 M). We start talking and I basically tell him that I want to disappear in India because I love it so much there, and I read Howard Zinn when I'm sad because it makes me feel closer to social change. After I say all this he grabs my hand instantly and squeezes it, and I remember thinking, ""uh, oh"". He says, "" I know exactly how you feel, like you can't do anything for people and all you can do is try,"" or something like that. I felt like he understood me so well, and I also thought he seemed sad. So I sign up to sing a song at this event, and my boyfriend won't let me sing it because it's too slow. 26 M writes a note that says, ""If you don't let us sing the song, H( me 25F) gives me permission to murder you,"" and this is the moment I can say I fell in love with him. We sang leonard cohen together and I loved it. I felt so sad to see him leave that night, and when I went home with my boyfriend I started freaking out. I felt something so good that night. I started hanging out with 26M more and I broke up with my boyfriend. Everything about him just gets better every day. He's extremely creative, and just in a short amount of time we've done so much together. I love every moment I've spent with him.

So immediately after I meet 26M, the other guy from college 29M writes me a beautiful letter about how much he's been struggling with depression and indecision and he should have doubled down on our relationship. This letter was incredibly heart-felt. I sent back a rather angry response, but I did respond. He just has something I will always be attracted to, and I will always want more. He asked me to marry him and spend our lives together. 

So, now what do I do? I JUST fell in love with someone else after 6 years of being completely lost.
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: An old lover who means everything to me sent me a letter just two weeks after falling in love with someone new. I love him very much, but this new person is exciting and more on my path. What is to be done here?"
50saok,1,2016-09-02,"First year SWE student thinking about the future, internships and looking for tips/advice",ChrisC-worldcoin,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/50saok/first_year_swe_student_thinking_about_the_future/,"Hey team,
I'm currently studying in New Zealand (think lord of the rings!) as a first year Software Engineering student. My academic position is currently good - I have received scholarships to study at my current university and am passing with GPA of 3.75. I know, I know - early days. The successive years will destroy that GPA! Fair enough. However I feel like my lack of projects are limiting me for potential internships.

As some background for my course, we are using Java predominantly and have had a small foray into C. We will learning some python next year alongside continuing Java but I'm thinking about taking a head start on that before summer, I digress. Personally in my own time I have done web dev stuff - HTML/CSS, JavaScript, bit of PhP. Some C and Pascal in my younger days when I was being personally taught programming. So pretty much - nothing major haha!

I'm thinking toward the summer (Christmas for us down under) where internships are often offered. My formal previous work experience hasn't been IT related, simply because I haven't felt like I've had the knowledge to enter the industry (it has mostly been bartending work). I have always been interested in IT from a very young age so I don't believe it's an issue with feeling commited. My main concern is that I haven't done personal projects outside of university that are documented on GitHub or any other VCS. Some things that was notable I guess was creating a basic robot using RPi's and C to follow a line, solve a maze etc. However, nothing I personally drove. I have a few ideas for this summer but as I'm thinking about an internship over the summer, I can't tell prospective employers 'oh I'm going to do this thing but I haven't gotten round to it yet...'.

I think what's probably relatively common in my situation is my current feeling of ill-preparedness and incapability. Which is why I reach out to you, the likely more experienced and knowledgeable. Have you been in this situation before, how did you solve it? Do you recommend I wait another year? Do I take up a menial data-entry job? I'm currently liking the OOP we're doing in Java right now - it just makes so much sense and love it. Maybe even a direction to fire myself for the future.

I am 100% willing to drop my prospects of a Junior Software Dev internship for a foot in the door in the IT industry itself if I do need to.

Much appreciated and apologies about the wall of text

The problem is that there's a huge chuck of founders who rely on nothing but B2C-marketing and eventually fail to tank up their startups with money.

So here we are. Bootstrapped, profitable and proud: a B2C-startup doing content for others. Let's take a look back and see how we got initial clients without pouring cash into self-promotion.

**Blog about your expertise (even as a newbie)**

Both of our co-founders stepped into marketing around 2010. RoR-development and SMM for local startups is a good way to learn and build up your portfolio but what really gave us a jumpstart to where we are today is blogging the heck out of what we were working on.

Looking back at it, it's hard not to make fun of how childish and miserable our personal blogs were but this is exactly what brought us our first client – one of the major local UX-shops. Freelancing for around a couple of month (job boards is a good option for getting initial leads) brought us to thinking about doing it as a business and we were lucky to have our offers accepted and implemented as a content-marketing project.

The project was focused on delivering usability insights to potential customers and employees via client's blogs and social media profiles. It resulted in 1.5m views leading to actual sales and hires by our client thus giving us a case to approach more tech companies.

**Approach niche sites and journals**

Blogging is good but it's not enough. One of the most important sources of potential clients is located outside of your comfort zone and it's niche sites and journals on tech, startups, media (or whatever) journals.

Reaching out to editors helps you formulate your offer and think about your business from the standpoint of an average reader. Publications or comments on the right topic may drive tens of instant leads that are hooked by your expertise and thus are easier to closing a deal.

We're happy to have good relationships with tons of folks who blog about tech and startups locally and worldwide but it's really cool to discover new spots and publish there.

**Approach your ex-colleagues (and even classmates)**

Sometimes we fail to follow one single career path as we move from one university to another or switch subjects and it's actually not as bag as it looks. Actual working experience and even internships let you connect with industry experts and prove yourself as a responsible employee. It's extremely important to keep it up and stay in touch with your network even on switching jobs.

One of our founders managed to approach his ex-colleagues and this is how we got our second client – one of the major local brokers. They've trusted us with their content and it's been a great journey for about 3 years.

The point is that we didn't approach them with just an idea – we had already gained outstanding results with the UX-shop client and prepared thought through solutions on how to invigorate their content. This one have got over 3m views and thousands of potential clients pouring into their system.

The ex-colleagues model is hard to scale but you can look at it as a continuous networking and building on top of that. Let's talk about that in detail.

**Network wisely (even when you travel)**

Pitching to your customers in person seems to be one of the most effective ways to sell... but how about being average tech guys who haven't yet mastered the game of thrones (apart from actually watching it)? Yep, you have to start somewhere and prior to going places our co-founders looked around a bit.

One started curating StartupDigest Moscow and StartupGenome Russia, the other went on to write for a local tech journal. Thus, we discovered coolest events, places and folks to network with – knowing what's where keeps you from wasting hundreds of hours on pointless lectures and seminars (and commutes). We do our best to meet as many folks as we can when travelling and having established connections prior to hitting the road saves you time and opens doors at your destination.

TechCrunch Moscow 2013 was one of the many gigs we attended and got two clients straight out of the crowd – a local eCommerce-startup and an innovation consultancy group from France. Both companies were great to work with and we had lots of fun creating content for them.

**Get recommendations from your clients (even ex-clients)**

It seems like an obvious move but applied to the initial traction stage it only depends on how lucky you are. There are really low chances that you will have your first client go out and recommend you but you might want to take it into the account when hustling on your initial projects.

Scaling this requires you to be able to provide discounts and additional services to those who recommend and often those who become your next clients. It's really hard to balance out your ""recommendation"" offer and you should really tailor it individually.

One of the main points here is to be aware of your client's needs and be there to provide necessary help. One of our founders hosts weekly shows (podcasts) and interviews local startups, tech and media companies – this helps us in expanding our network and promoting our services in person.

**Host local seminars and discussions**

Public speaking is great for understanding real-world problems and syncing with your potential clients. We enjoy hosting seminars on content-marking as we share our tips on marketing your project with no or minimal budget.

Preparation matters but what's really important is understanding your audience profile in order to be talking to ""your"" people instead of trying to get to folks with no need to buy what you're selling.

And how did you get initial traction (espesially as a B2B company)? Share your experience in comments — I'd like to find out some new ways. "
50tdlv,7,2016-09-02,22Futa4F - Lilith Fairchild: The High School Futadom,RPDiem,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/50tdlv/22futa4f_lilith_fairchild_the_high_school_futadom/,"Hello there. I see that title caught your attention. Well, certainly don’t leave now. 

You heard me: *stay.* After all, we’ve only just started.

My name is Lilith Fairchild. I’m in the last semester of high school, and as you’re probably aware, it’s a very… *tumultuous* time in a young girl’s life. One of my outlets is self-expression, largely through my personal appearance. I wear what I guess many people would call a ‘punkish’ look. I keep one side of my jet-black hair buzzed, with piercings dotting my ears, eyebrows, nose and lower lip, as well as some more… intimate places. But we’ll get to that soon enough.

My clothing aligns with my overall style. I like black skirts, tattered jeans, combat boots and leather jackets. They make me feel more like… *me*, I suppose.

It probably wouldn’t surprise you to hear that I have what polite people refer to as *attitudinal problems*. You might be surprised, however, that I’m what less polite people refer to as an *angry psycho bitch*. I personally think that I’m misunderstood. 

After all, it’s not my fault that my parents had a rather ‘hands off’ approach to parenting. When they found out that their first (and only) child was… neither one thing or another, they let me make all the decisions as to who or what I wanted to be, and what I wanted to be was *powerful.* So, they turned a blind eye when I shoved the other kids around during preschool. They turned a blind eye when I hit puberty and my sheets started getting stickier (although they insisted that I do my own laundry at that point). They turned a blind eye when I started smoking and skipping class. And they sure as hell turned a blind eye when they heard what I’d done to the pastor’s wife...

These *attitudinal problems* extend to my love life. My girlfriends tend to either get scared off, worn out or *broken*. A lot of girls can’t handle what I’m packing (all nine, uncut inches of it) or some of the kinkier stuff I enjoy. I mean, don’t compliment my ass if you don’t want to spend an hour or two beneath it.

So, given the turnover rate in that department, I sometimes like a nice, quick anonymous fuck. Sometimes it’s in the back alley behind a bar (fake IDs for the win!) and sometimes it’s at a concert. I wouldn’t be surprised if I had a kid or three running around out there, but it’s not like I’d give anyone my name if I’m going bareback. I’m not a fucking *idiot* like some people…

Anyway, what I’m looking for is a new bitch to break in. Who are you to me? Well, you have a few choices:

- *The Popular Girl*: Oh, poor, stupid, popular girl. I guess you never noticed that weird girl staring at you from two seats back. Maybe you’ll notice when I cop a feel during gym class. Or when I slip in behind you in the locker room showers. Or when you’re picking my cum out of your hair. I’m certain that’ll lodge itself firmly in your memory. I might just get you to give me a cushy spot on the student council. Wouldn’t that be nice?

- ~~*The Nerd*: Well, calling you a nerd would be like calling the kettle black. I like many of the things that you like: fantasy and science fiction, video games, Doctor Who, girls… When I invited you back to my place to hang out, I could practically *taste* your excitement. I suppose you thought we’d be playing a co-op shooter when I brought you down to the basement lounge. Really, I just thought your face would make a comfortable seat while I pwned some noobs.~~ **Temporarily retired due to overexposure.**

- *The Teacher*: I’ve had the hots for you for quite some time, Teach. I mean, come on, nobody wears clothes *that* tight unless they’re trying to show off for the boys. Unfortunately, you’ve caught the eye of someone quite a bit more dangerous. *I don’t care* if it could mean losing your job, and despite how much you whine about it, I don’t think you really care either.

- *The Neighbour:* Welcome to Lawrence Terrace, a pleasant little cul-de-sac featuring green lawns, sunny skies, and a particularly predatory teenage dickgirl on the lookout for a new conquest. I’ll start out as just another helpful neighbour, showing you around town, mowing your lawn, walking your dog... But soon enough you’ll be the one at *my* beck and call. After all, I’ve always wanted my own place, but I can settle for taking over yours.

- *The One-Night Stand*: I don’t want to know your name, and I certainly don’t want you to known mine. All that matters is that I’m going to give you the fucking of your life. If you pop out a little brat in nine months, well, that’s not my problem.

- *The Boss*: With high school behind me, my next challenge is finding gainful employment. Luckily for me, truancy aside, my grades are pretty stellar across the board. As such, it isn’t too much of a problem to get an internship at a local office. It’s nice to see that, even after high school, there’s still bitches out there to tame... Including my *incredibly* fuckable boss. I hear that she’s married, but then again: so was the pastor’s wife. Maybe I can convince her to take me along on a business trip. Hell, after that I might even blackmail her into promoting me to secretary, although she’s an idiot if she thinks I’ll be spending any time under *her* desk.

- *Someone Else:* Impress me.

*Hi there! I hope you enjoyed my prompt. I'm trying something different today: I’ll be playing a bitchy, mean 18 year-old futadomme with more than a few destructive habits.*

*If you're interested, send me your character's name, appearance, relationship to my character and a few personality traits. Also, your kinks and limits would be helpful.*

*Some of my kinks include oral, anal, petplay, bondage, dubious consent, impregnation (one-night stands only), cumplay, sweat, spanking, facesitting, modification (piercings, tattoos, etc.), humiliation, domination and body worship. Limits are bestiality, ageplay (18+ only), blood, vomit (unless plot-relevant), scat and watersports.*

50tq5a,1,2016-09-02,How do I become a better Release Engineer?,samort7,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/50tq5a/how_do_i_become_a_better_release_engineer/,"Five months ago, I was hired by a fairly big internet company to be their new Associate Release Engineer. Prior to this job, I had been an ESL teacher for 3 years, a self-studying programmer for 1 year, and a Computer Science student for 6 months (I was trying to switch careers as you can probably tell). I had initially applied for a Software Engineering internship position, but the company felt that I was promising and wanted to hire me on as a full-time Associate Release Engineer instead.

From the company's end, it was a generous, albeit risky move. Their current Senior Release Engineer was switching departments and they needed to replace him but finding a seasoned veteran at a reasonable price is difficult, so they decided to hire someone fresh and train them up for the job. That someone was me.

They are aware that I am new to the job and  that I have a mountain of learning ahead of me, so I do not feel pressured by them in the slightest. However, its the aforementioned mountain that is causing me the most distress. There is so much to learn, and it all comes in the form of a system that has been build upon since almost the beginning of the internet. (No joke, this company has been around a *long* time.)

I only understand the whole development process from a surface level. The whole system is custom-made with custom tools that have no documentation because they've only ever been used by maybe 8 people here. I try to read books on Continuous Delivery and Continuous Integration, but they are all written about how those systems *should* work which is very different from how they actually work at my company.

My team consists of 4 people - my supervisor, two senior release engineers and myself. The senior release engineers are both located off site so I have never seen them in person. My supervisor is a great guy, but he was also recently moved to this department 8 months ago and he is still learning everything too. The only real person I can ask is the former Release Engineer who set everything up, but he's in a different department now and I hate bothering him all the time.

How do I go about learning this huge system with all these moving parts? What resources can teach me how software is developed and moved through the different pipelines to release? Where can I learn what packages are, how they're made, what artifacts are and why they are important and all the other stuff that comes with programming that isn't programming itself? There's just so much stuff to learn. 

I'm doing my part when I can. I resolve tickets I understand and create documentation when I learn something new. I even made a tool to help examine build boxes and converted it to a C# MVC app (my first great achievement). But all the inner workings of the core development and build process are just so enigmatic. I often sit at my desk not sure what I should be learning next or how I should go about learning it.

Just for reference - my company uses the following technologies which I've slowly begun to absorb as I can:

Jenkins, MSBuild, Perforce, Confluence, Jira, CCNet, NuGet, Artifactory - however, its not the tools I have trouble with, but how they all interconnect.

I'm not stressed out, I just want to be a more effective employee.

So I graduated in May with a BS in CS at age 27. In school I was never a rockstar with side projects, never had an internship, but got good grades. I would say my lack of projects/internship was due to a combination of a lack of ""passion"" for the field (not that I hate it, it just doesn't really excite me like it does others) and also just feeling lost every time I tried to start something on my own.

Since graduation I have not really done programming, because while searching for a job, I had major anxiety problems I was getting treated for, and the thought of picking up a computer to program literally made me feel sick with anxiety. My problem has always been lack of confidence in my skills. I don't think it helps that I'm older than most graduates but still lack experience, which adds to the feeling of being behind everyone else.

But I still got a job just based on doing well in the interview, which entailed talking about my school experience and common behavioral questions.

The fact that the job I got is geared toward new grads and mentions ""continued learning"" with a mentor as part of the deal hasn't really eased my mind at all. Probably because the process didn't include a whiteboard interview, which makes me feel like I'm a fraud who lucked into a job because they didn't bother to check if I know what I'm doing. I kind of wish they had, so that if I'm not qualified, I wouldn't have gotten hired. I know this probably sounds ridiculous to people who are still searching for work and can't get it. In addition, the pay is higher than I was expecting to get, which really makes me feel like they made a mistake by giving me this job and are going to be expecting a lot.

I only have a little over two weeks until the job starts. It's in a new language (C#) than what I primarily worked with in school (Java). I feel like I'm totally rusty in addition to already not being very knowledgeable. I just don't really know what to do. I would probably consider backing out of the job if that was an option, to give myself time to get back into programming, but it isn't, because I already signed a lease and everything. 

Basically I don't even know what I'm asking for here, I guess just any advice for how to handle this predicament I've gotten myself into."

My ex GF is a single mom and is still legally married but separated. 

In last week of June She informed me about the pregnancy, I wasn't happy at all as we both still in School and hardly have money to support ourselves. She said that she will do it with or without me, She went to Ohio for a month to her grandmas during this time we hardly spoke. She owed me $1150 in Credit card bills , when I asked her about the money, she broke up with me saying I care only about the money (I honestly would not have cared much about $1000 if I had a full time job), I tried to get back together but she wasn't interested at all. So she burnt bridges with me.She also to me that I shall not be seeing my kid ever.

Now comes the part I am most concerned about. I am not a US Citizen, and have taken $55000 in educational loan to get a degree here in US. Due to nature of my degree its really really hard to find a job in US as a foreign national not impossible but hard. People just to get their foot into the industry work as an unpaid intern for 9-12 months so that they can an entry level job.

 Since she is still married , initially her husband will be on the birth certificate. I understand he can disprove his paternity and that's where I will come into picture.My fear is that I will be on the child support hook life and wont see my kid. Lawyer told me if she isn't willing to cooperate my legal fees may rack up to $6000-$7000 just to get visitation rights. I hardly have money to meet my bills , I don't know how can I afford this legal fees. Right now for me the easy way out looks like going back to my country after graduation, I know its wrong thing to do, I cry my self to bed when I think about it. She on the other hand will show no mercy and go after me for child support.

This is the moral dilemma I am living with right now. Here in Florida if she applies for Govt assistance (She likely will as she too doesn't have any income at all) There are two possible scenarios 

 1) The child support agency comes after me , I am hooked for 18 years. I will be mentally disturbed as she wont allow me to part of kids life, If I don't get work visa (its hit or miss) I will go back home in debt and mentally lost. She doesn't even have to work because of money she will be receiving money from two baby daddies and all the government benefits, while I lose it all supporting my child and family back home (my parents are old).

2) I move out of united state soon after graduation, be a dead beat dad and Look like a worthless piece of shit. Her husband will become legal father of child and he will be hooked on child support.


I know supporting the child is the right thing to do, but I can guarantee this that she wont make things easy for me if I decide to be in my kids life. She will enjoy seeing me struggle and would love to have the last laugh. Right now we haven't talked in weeks at all, I wanted to discuss this thing with her , but, she doesn't even want to see me. I can hardly eat or sleep now a days , I also have been puking a lot due to stress. I would really appreciate any advice, I just feel lost at life. Should I meet her and explain the whole scenario or just move back to my country and never ever speak to her again. 

TL;DR-  Ex GF pregnant, She doesn't want me to be part of this kids life, Should I try to be in kids life or leave?   "

When taking courses through my university though, all I've learned is command line C++ and am currently taking on OS programming and Web programming (+ some other knowledge based ones).

Is this gap in knowledge to be expected before becoming employed?

50usx0,3,2016-09-02,Help with appeal letter,throwfaraway994,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/50usx0/help_with_appeal_letter/,"I cannot take the remaining classes (34 credits) needed to graduate because I am not admitted to my major. I was not admitted because my GPA is .1 short of the requirement. I retook classes last semester to improve it but fell short for a variety of reasons. My federal aid runs out this year and I also will fail SAP requirements if I do not finish my degree this year. So at the advice of a couple people I am asking my school to temporarily allow me into the major with the stipulation that I meet the GPA requirement at the end of this semester. I don't want to come off as making excuses. I would really appreciate if anyone could offer any advice for improving my letter before I submit it. I am trying to keep it pretty brief, let me know if i should expand or remove any topics I covered.



Dear Sir or Madam,
My name is throwfaraway994 and I have been a student at school since September 2013. I transferred my sophomore year from different school. I will be entering my fifth year this fall. I am asking for major status for the fall 2016 semester. Over the course of my college career, I have faced many struggles and challenges in being a successful student. Over the past summer break; I have made many strides and preparations that will allow me to reach my goal of becoming both an engineer and successful student. 

The primary issues that impacted my success in college thus far have been financial and personal. Initially, my mom was able to help me pay for college but could not afford to after my third semester. I have worked part time the entire time I have attended school and work full time (usually internships) during the summer to pay for my rent, tuition, food, etc. Working these hours in addition to my mom’s income kept affecting the amount of aid I received from FAFSA. As a result I received less and less aid each year, which resulted in the need to work more hours during the semester to pay for more tuition in addition to my other expenses.  Additionally, I will have exhausted the little aid I receive at the conclusion of the 2016-2017 school year.

Additionally, I was recently diagnosed with ASD. I am high-functioning and have developed many coping skills over the years which allowed me to go undiagnosed for so long. This has impacted my academic career in many ways I did not realize. I worked with a professional this summer to identify why I struggle with certain things as well as create solutions for these issues to allow me to be more successful going forward. I will use these strategies both inside and outside the classroom.

I meet all requirements for admission to major with the exception of the GPA in core courses; I stand at a 0.1 below in that category and a 2.72 overall. My primary goal this semester will be to get that GPA over the requirement to allow myself to continue in the major. I take full responsibility for my shortcomings and have made every effort to address them.  I am positive that given the chance, I will be able to succeed where I have fallen short before.  Grant me temporary major status for the fall 2016 semester and I will do right by myself and by the College.

I have made many adjustments that will aid me in being successful during this academic year. I will be using outside funding to supplement my financial aid, in order to dramatically reduce the number of hours I need to work. This will allow me much more time to study, participate in study groups, meet with professors, TA’s and tutors and overall be more able to focus on my academics. I have study groups planned for my classes as well as dedicated study hours. I have also reduced the number of extracurricular activities and responsibilities I will be participating in.  Additionally, I have improved methods for keeping track of assignments, future tests and project due dates to ensure nothing is overlooked. I have an academic plan for the both the fall and spring semester (see attached). 

I truly hope that this shows I am dedicated and determined to being a successful student at school. I will put forth all the work and effort necessary not only to graduate from school this spring but also to becoming a great engineer and alumni member of school. Please do not let my past bar me from a successful future. I have taken many strides and steps to ensure I will be successful this year. I truly believe I can be a great engineer and ask that you consider granting me major status.
Thank you,

Going into the pathways program, possibly getting a part time job, and continuing my volunteer work, and working with community resources to get a better handle on my mental health issues. 

Or

Getting super serious about school and going through a trades program and get an internship right after. (I'll try to continue with my volunteer work but I might have to take a step back with it). Most everything else would need to be shelved for a while.

I'm pretty sure that I don't technically need any college prep courses to get into to the program (I'm 26 and considered a mature student). But I fucked around during highschool and despite graduating I'm not sure if I have the necessary skills to keep on top of an intensive program (despite having improved significantly and definitely having the will). 

Is the pathways program worth it? Has anyone done it as an exmormon? Are the religion classes sort of ok?

Preferred Combat Style: Commando 

Prewar History: Jack was always a smart and charismatic young man. His schoolwork and social life were packed with oppertunities. During highschool he signed on as an intern of RobCo and helped them develop and test robotic prototypes, he soon graduated and went to college with a scholarship. During his college days he met his soon to be wife, Nora and they dated. During their relationship his department in RobCo was assigned military contracts. Hearing the call of duty, Jack answered it with his sharp wit. After his military duties were finished, he moved to sanctuary hills and had a son by his wife. Then the bombs fell. 

After leaving vault 111, Jack's entire world is destroyed. His successes both financially and scientifically are gone, his wife is dead and son missing. The kind intellectual and flirtatious man was gone, in its place was a cold calculating man who put on a smile when inside he was seething with rage. He was, Handsome Jack. 

Upon entering the wasteland Jack will make all haste towards any leads of Sean he can find. He comes in contact with the Minutemen, and while sympathetic to their plight he has his own problems to deal with. 

While exploring the Commonwealth and heading towards Diamond City, he comes across the Police Station, where he meets Paladin Danse and behold the power of the Brotherhood of Steel. The BOS overwhelms Jack with their military presence, here he thinks, is the best shot at getting Shaun back.  

He continues on to Diamond City only to find the detective, Nick Valentine is missing. Taking Piper, the new newsreporter he had just met, the pair go off to find him, in another Vault. In a daring rescue, Nick and Jack discover it was a mercenary named Kellog who kidnapped Shaun, armed with this knowledge and using Dogmeat, they head towards Kellogs hideout, fighting their way through the synths and finally confronting the mercenary. They gun him down and use his memories to find the Institute. 

After dealing with Kellog, Jack is welcomed aboard the Prynwarden and granted the rank of Knight and his own set of Power Armor. Jack, starts buying into the Brotherhood Code, forming a hatred of synths that goes unmatched and is accepted with his new friends. Clad in Power Armor, Jack takes on the fancy that he is a hero. As a hero it is his duty to save everyone, not just his son. 

Returning to the Minutemen, Jack realizes he can help these people and help himself. He establishes new settlements, and a new militia, and new trading routes, all loyal to him. He discovers Vault 81, and the vast amounts of resources there too, after killing the would be ghoul Overseer.  He turns it into his base of operations. 

He continues to assist the Brotherhood, eventually destroying the Institute. The revelation at the end, shocks Jack, but he soon realizes the son he would have had, is Dead, and the synths are nothing more then dirty impostors who have corrupted him. 

Upon reaching Far Harbor, Jack is disgusted with Acadia and the Children of Atom. Believing the Children to be foolish zealots, he works towards using them at first, but realizes they cant be controlled, so they are destroyed. Once their base is destroyed, he marches with the Brotherhood on Arcadia, killing everyone inside down to the last Synth. Leaving The Island to Far Harbors residences. 

Jack hears the radio signal to Nuka World and goes to investigate. What he finds is one of the things he hates the most, Raiders. Raiders are good for nothing bandits who take and destroy and poison the world. After killing the Overboss and speaking with Gage, he pretends to go along with Gage's plan to ""Lead"" the raiders, only long enough for him to open the door. Once inside, Jack lifts his combat rifle and guns Gage down, staring Open Season on all the Raider leaders. 

Once all of them are killed he leaves Nuka Town in the hands of the slaves and traders, returning to the commonwealth. 

Handsome Jack raises an empire of wealth through trade. Backed by the might of the Minutemen and the Brotherhood, there is none that can stop him. In his mind he has avenged his wife and son. 

He sits on a pile of caps, and laughs.

Ok basically I've just got myself into a mess about my current situation and I'm looking for advice on what to do.

First off, although I am always fighting my slight anxiety with girls, I see myself as socially competent and have a had a more than average amount of sexual experience with girls (mainly due to being part of a sports club at uni). I would say that I have always wanted to have a relationship but at the same time, up until recently, not been overly bothered by it, I always felt it would happen at some point. Nothing really happened for me at secondary(high) school apart from somehow losing my virginity in my final year. 

After some attempts at dating in my first year of uni with no luck, I decided just to ignore this and have fun etc meeting girls which led to much more success as I was more relaxed and confident, this made it much easier for me to talk to them if I knew I had a sexual connection first but I still struggled getting dates, but shrugged off each rejection quite easily.

Skip to final (4th) year with in same situation. Then I met one of my new housemate's old housemate (had to move in with others as some had graduated after 3 years with bachelors, as she had, I had vaguely met her a couple of times before but only had short conversation) who I immediately hit it off with, we slept together the next three nights that she was staying down for. I was interested in her and she said that she wanted to see me again which I took with a pinch of salt as no girl who had said that to me before had followed up. However she agreed to come and stay with me and did a few weeks later for a weekend which went really well. 

We continued with similar arrangement for the next couple of months and I felt strong feelings for her, in my mind I would never have gone anywhere near another girl and she was aware and agreed to the same. I was kind of just going with it as I had never been in this situation before but felt really good, I had never felt a connection with someone like I had with her. She then decided that it wasn't right for her and didn't want to continue romantically with me. I honestly had no idea that it would feel so bad and I had never cried over a girl before but this was it. I realised afterwards I was so happy with it and didn't want it to end, I had no idea what I was doing or whether any of my actions were good or bad, and also felt like I could have done more (she hinted I could have put more effort in) but I didn't know what.

I was really upset about it at the time and it really affected my confidence talking to girls. When I was with her girls were actually hitting on me and then afterwards when I tried to rebound as my friends suggested, I tried to talk to girls and they would almost instantly reject me. (I know completely this is a body language thing due to my confidence) Also my grades had been so much better when I was seeing her and I only just scraped through with graduating with what I wanted in the end.

After graduating, I moved home. I managed to become completely depressed at my situation. It felt hopeless, so many worries about the rejections I had had before came to the surface, along with why it had gone wrong and the previous girl (still head over heels for) and how I had managed 4 years at university with only 2 dates, how something must be wrong with me etc. I am living with my parents, I have a full time job (obviously not bad, internship saving to travel) but it is in engineering (my degree), and my main hobbies are sports so I pretty much have no options to meet new girls.

I managed to get myself out of the depression and have been looking at confidence building techniques etc and I am feeling much better about myself (apart from today where I got reminded about all the good things from a relationship that I wanted). Moving forward for the time being, with my current situation I'm not likely to be able to have a proper relationship for another year or so with travelling, move out of home etc however I would like to meet people and I'm not sure how to go about it. 

At university it was so easy, I could walk out of my house onto campus and there were girls that I would like to meet, I would go out 2/3 times a week and there were always girls (still couldn't get dates though!). Now I'm not meeting anyone at all.

I've started going on tinder, so wanted advice about how to go about meeting girls like this. What to say first? Lots of things I see are cheesy chat up lines etc but I'm not really like that, so any advice on openers would be nice. I still go to nightclubs fairly regularly but not as much as before and the girls are completely different than I'm used to, a bit older generally and not really my type. 

So what other ways can I meet women? Is it really acceptable to approach girls in the street or at the supermarket etc without seeming creepy? What are the best ways to ask a girl to go on a date that you've just met? Even if I get a number, what do I say? I guess I've not had much real world experience, and I've also had experience of girls seeming interested but then flaking out so it still seems daunting messaging a girl after ""matching"" with them.

Thank you for anyone who bothers to reading this and gives any advice, I know it's long and probably not particularly bad compared to a lot of people, but I was very depressed about it all and am now trying to move forward. I have heard all the ""you're young"" and the ""love yourself first"" stuff and it does make sense and I truly do enjoy being with myself and I know I shouldn't being searching for happiness in another person. But I feel as if people are happy in a relationship, then I can be unhappy not in one.


TL;DR fairly socially competent, looking for a serious relationship but living with parents and opportunities for meeting girls is limited, just wanted to know women's opinions on tinder, messaging, approaching girls in clubs, on the street, getting dates etc."

Some years back, Washington Post reporters Mark Halperin (currently of Bloomberg News and MSNBC) and John Harris (now editor in chief of Politico) wrote a book about political journalism called “The Way to Win: Clinton, Bush, Rove and How to Take the White House in 2008.” In it, they made a famous admission about how Beltway journalism works in the digital age:

Matt Drudge rules our world … With the exception of the Associated Press, there is no outlet other than the Drudge Report whose dispatches instantly can command the attention and energies of the most established newspapers and television newscasts.

So many media elites check the Drudge Report consistently that a reporter is aware his bosses, his competitors, his sources, his friends on Wall Street, lobbyists, White House officials, congressional aides, cousins, and everyone who is anyone has seen it, too.

Mitt Romney’s former spokesman called Drudge the political media’s assignment editor. And in 2012 on the day after the election, Halperin gave credit in where credit is due in a tweet:

I had assumed that Matt Drudge’s star had faded a bit in the intervening years as fresher, sexier right-wing sites like Breitbart and The Blaze had emerged. But as Politico has reported, Drudge is doing better than ever:

For the first time, The Drudge Report moved into second place on Similar Web’s top U.S. Media Publisher rankings, placing just behind MSN.com with about 1.47 billion page view for the month of July. The Drudge Report’s traffic beat out the likes of news sites from Disney Media Networks (which includes ESPN.com and ABCNews.com), Yahoo, Google, Time Warner and Fox Entertainment Groups.

In an article last month called “The Man Who Could Have Stopped Donald Trump,” Oliver Darcy of Business Insider noted Drudge’s still-dominant role:

Drudge was the top traffic referrer to The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Fox News, and other news outlets in 2015, according to a Vocativ report. The report said the site accounted for a staggering 52 percent of referral traffic to the Associated Press.

All those organizations are very well aware of the potential for clicks from a Drudge link, and they know what kind of stories he wants to flog. The incentives to please him are obvious.

As the last leg of the 2016 campaign approaches, it’s worth remembering Drudge’s original claim to fame:

Web Posted: 01/17/98 23:32:47 PST — NEWSWEEK KILLS STORY ON WHITE HOUSE INTERN

BLOCKBUSTER REPORT: 23-YEAR OLD, FORMER WHITE HOUSE INTERN, SEX RELATIONSHIP WITH PRESIDENT

The original post, which went on to name various publications that were allegedly holding the item, put journalists at the center of the story. Needless to say, they were excited. The rest, of course, is history. For years Drudge was fed news items by the media, which would often launder them through the foreign press. Then he would feature links with screaming headlines reporters that editors could use to show that a story was “out there.”

Today such stories are still generated in the British tabloid press, but also in right-wing conspiracy sites and bigger operations like Breitbart News. Recently Drudge managed to disseminate the discredited story of Hillary Clinton’s alleged ill health by posting a picture from a fringe website showing Clinton’s slipping on the stairs some months before with this screaming headline:

2016: HILLARY CONQUERS THE STAIRS

2012: FALLS AT HOME, BLOOD CLOT

2011: FALLS BOARDING PLANE

2009: FALLS GOING TO WHITE HOUSE, BROKEN ELBOW

That story is now part of the election campaign, with people demanding her full medical records and the press watching her every move like a hawk for signs of brain damage.

With the news this week that Clinton’s right-hand woman Huma Abedin had separated from her husband, former Congressman Anthony Weiner, after yet another public humiliation, Drudge used the opportunity to tee up one of the right’s favorite rumors — that Clinton and Abedin are secret lovers. Unsurprisingly, whispers among unenlightened right-wingers about the feminist harpy Clinton’s being a lesbian go back decades. But the Abedin insinuations, which started in 2007, have taken off in this campaign.

Mainstream publications have fed the notion with click-bait stories like this slide show from Politico, which sat at the top of its “most-read” list for months this year, despite its having been originally published back in 2013. As it turned out, Drudge had been up to his old tricks. He had linked to a British tabloid story in which Abedin was quoted as saying that she thought Clinton was beautiful, which sent millions of drooling Drudge readers searching for “Clinton Huma lesbian.”

There’s no way of knowing if mainstream reporters were among those intrigued by Drudge’s dirt. But we do know that The New York Times found this item worthy of a breathless front-page lead:

Among the trove of emails released from Hillary Rodham Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state was this instruction to a trusted aide who needed to brief her on a matter that could not wait:

“Just knock on the door to the bedroom if it’s closed,” Mrs. Clinton wrote in November 2009 to Huma Abedin, then her deputy chief of staff.

Drudge doesn’t even try to find political relevance to his lewd, juvenile innuendo. But the mainstream media’s reaction to this week’s Weiner-Abedin story was hardly any better. Attempts to make it into a campaign story were downright embarrassing.

Yesterday under the headline “Weiner free!” Drudge insinuated once again that Abedin and Clinton are lovers with a picture allegedly showing the two of them hugging with joy now that they have vanquished one of their husbands. As it turned out, the other woman in the picture wasn’t Abedin. It was Burmese opposition leader and 1991 Nobel Peace Prize recipient Aung San Suu Kyi, but whatever. He made his point.

We can be sure that Drudge’s nasty little sex rumors aren’t the end of it. The more scurrilous charges that Abedin is a secret Muslim agent are now breaking into the mainstream direct from the fever swamps, via none other than Donald Trump himself. And publications like The Hill and the New York Post, hungry for Drudge links and eager to give the monster what it wants in return, are already pushing it into the mainstream. As long as Matt Drudge is driving the news cycle, it will only get worse.

As a past graduate of Dev Academy (www.devacademy.co.nz) - I just want to openly warn people who're thinking of attending this course to steer well clear of it.

They claim on their website that they have 81% of graduates of jobs within 3 months of graduating, but how are these claims supported by 3rd party checks?  They could claim grads as tutors or not even working in ICT as 'employed' so don't fall for the hyped claims...

The course is way overpriced for what you got - looking back I could have obtained the same information for free or very cheap using online resources like Lynda.com, Team Treehouse, Codeacademy, Code school etc....

Their claim of 'industry partners' is far fetched and don't believe the big name logos on their website - Trade Me, Xero etc... only a couple of EDA grads are working in these big players.

You are given the impression that they will put you forward to these big companies or have some kind of established intern scheme, that's not the case.  Instead you are given a trello board with exhausted leads and a careers channel with sparse jobs posted that everyone and his dog applies for...

You're better off having the discipline to either code alone, or with a friend in the library and attending meetup groups showing a portfolio to impress potential employers, and that's all for free - it just takes time and discipline.

There is no real continual support post graduation, so you're on your own to fend for yourself and create your own networks, sad but true.

Don't bother with these guys, once they have your money their balls are on the line to help you further, so I would apply for a bootcamp elsewhere such as App Academy or Code House, both of which are actually incentivised to get you a job or their revenues would plummit.

Any questions?  Please ask below, I'm wiling to help prevent victims of $11k get scammed"

- I graduated Portland State University in 2010 with a BS in Electrical and Computer Engineering and a 3.0 GPA.

- I converted an internship at Intel to a full time job as a firmware/BIOS/BSP/hardware bringup engineer. I quit in 2014 after 3½ years because I was super depressed

- From 2014 to 2015 I did a lot of rock climbing and spent a year teaching English at a university in China.

- In late 2015 I returned to the US and took the first 6 month contract job that a recruiter threw my way. The work was unchallenging with little room to grow, and I guess I felt it was beneath me after working as a full time employee.

- That contract ended in March. I've spent the past 6 months burning through my savings and working on an unsuccessful relationship.

**About Me**

- I don't need a prestige job at Google. I do like having money.
- I'm picky about living in a place with restaurants, culture, public transit, bike infrastructure, and access to the outdoors
- It's important to me to work with smart people on challenging problems (not bit twiddling in C).
- I'm averse to work that seems evil or pointless.
- I don't have a great degree of self discipline.
- My CS skills end at sophomore level data structures. My experience has all been single-threaded bit-twiddling in C.

**What I've done so far**

My plan had been to get on with Microsoft's hardware team. After a couple employee referrals I've yet to hear anything back from them, so I have to assume they're not hiring right now.

- I interviewed with Google in January with no preparation
- I failed a take-home pre-screen with a Portland-based IoT startup
- I phone screened with a team at Apple in June, it seemed like things went fine but they were looking specifically for a power optimization guy
- I repeatedly put off interviews with Lab126 until one or both of us got distracted and forgot about it
- I started a batch at Hired.com last week. I haven't gotten any interview requests yet
- I started last week responding to all the sketchy contract recruiters. So far they've been sending me positions at Intel

**Plan**

With the hole in my work history growing, I think it makes sense to find a contracting gig in Seattle metro and use UW's continuing education classes to make the switch to data science or machine learning(?)

I'd be open to working at a startup. How does one find those jobs?

**Question**

How is embedded as a field? I'm interested in developing embedded devices and it seems like technical leads are in high demand, I'm just not sure how to get the experience necessary to take ownership of a project on my own.

Is the market for embedded much stronger in the bay area? Should I be focusing my efforts there?

What steps should I take to find work in Seattle?

I'm starting my second year as a Chemistry major (Chem Opt), but was considering switching to Biochem option.

First off, anyone with experience in either sub-plan with some insights what to expect? I feel that without any major internships under my belt or insight into the endgame I'm kinda just going with a slightly informed gut feeling, which probably isn't the best idea. Any other tips regarding either sub-plan are also appreciated.

I was also wondering if anyone has any insights into how difficult it is switching within the same department (i.e. from Chemistry (Chem Opt.) to Chemistry (Biochem Opt.) From what I've heard switching majors can be a bit of a nightmare when they are impacted, but haven't seen much info on switching sub-plans.

Lastly, if I where to switch to the biochem option, would it still be possible to get into the pre-professional major program (most likely pre-med) even if I didn't originally apply for it?

Sorry for all the questions, but just wanted to inform myself a bit before going to ask advisors and/or faculty to avoid any embarrassing ""stupid question"" moments."

I recently worked at a small tech startup in Burlington, VT as a software engineer. My two fellow employees and I signed full time employment offers after working there as interns. We were given a very clear signed document from our boss / ceo which outlined our pay amount and dates we would receive pay each month. 

Our boss was unable to pay us on our first pay date, and made up an excuse for why (which we have saved as email documents). Then he was unable to pay our second month, and now the third. The reason for why he is unable to pay changes every time. We were patient with him at first but it has gotten out of control and we just want some pay for the work we did. 

One of us still works at the company, me and one other person quit a few days ago. 

My question is: is it possible to sue our boss for failing to keep his promise on paying us and misleading us into working for free? Could we somehow take legal action to get the pay and perhaps damages for the time we were not paid?

We are young guys who have no experience with legal action. I'd really appreciate any advice! 

Thanks all."
50wjxn,0,2016-09-02,Advice- pursuing flying after University,i_am_canadian737,flying,https://www.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/50wjxn/advice_pursuing_flying_after_university/,"Hey all,

I'm in need of a little bit of insight from you. For locational context, I live in Canada (if you couldn't tell from my username...I really need a new one). It's a bit of a long story so please standby.

I've been an aviation enthusiast my entire life, and from as long a I can remember, being an airline pilot has been my ultimate goal. Through young adolescence I realized that, should I pursue flying as a career, I should have a backup plan in place. So, in foregoing attending a university flight program, I enrolled in engineering school. My initial plan was as follows:

* graduate high school, do PPL summer before University
* work on CPL over the summers away from school 
* graduate with degree and CPL and hopefully most ratings, decide where to go from there.


Of course, life rarely goes as we plan it to. Change is inevitable and things come up. I was unable to finish my PPL as I ran out of time before having to leave for university. I was almost ready for the solo but was unable to apply for my student permit in time. I also still needed some xwind practice. So, I left the city for first year university. I came back the following May, ready to fly. The wind and weather were particularly nasty that month which grounded me until June, which, unfortunately, was at the same time that I found a summer job. Due to scheduling conflicts with my job, some personal issues, and the fact that my instructor left my school, I was only able to do about 4 or 5 hours of refresher flights in the circuit, still no student permit. That summer was a write-off for flying. No problem, I'll finish next summer!

...Well, it's next summer. Or, it was. I've finished 2 years of my degree, and I'm enrolled in a co-op program in which I work in internships with different companies for 4 month terms, adding a year to my degree. I came back this summer again ready to fly. I was finally able to write my radio test, but now my PSTAR is outdated- thus, I still cannot apply for my student permit. I was ready to continue, however, I got my 8-month internship at the last minute part way through June, forcing me to move cities again and put the PPL on hold. This will be the case for the rest of my degree- I'll likely be in a new city every 4 months or so. I can't fly during school due to the workload of my program, and while I may have some time during my work terms, delays and a limited schedule might mean I won't finish before having to move again. As well, I really need flying to be my sole focus in order to finish it. 

So, I guess what I plan to do now is try to somehow fit in my PPL somewhere; if not, I'll have to do it after I graduate. I'll be 22 by the time that happens. If I can finish my PPL before graduation, I plan to go into a 2-year commercial program at a university close to home for my CPL. In all likelihood, I'll need to take a year off to finish the PPL and then enroll in the CPL program the following year. That puts me at 25 by the time I have my CPL, ratings, diploma, and engineering degree, barring no more setbacks. 

I guess what I'm contemplating is the impact of being slightly behind might be. The co-op program I'm in is great and will put me ahead- but not in the career I really want. I will try my hardest to fit the PPL in somewhere, but I've already had it fragmented far too much, which has increased the costs a lot. 


I guess my main question is, and I'll make this a **TL;DR:**
*Does it make sense to put off flying right now to focus on my unrelated degree?*

Thanks, blue skies"

I don't have THAT much experience programming and will be taking my AP Computer Science class this year. Last year I took two Java electives at my school so at least I am familiar with the syntax. During the summer I watched some videos and tried working on Code Academy for a while. Besides my lack of experience, how can I improve my resume?

I wasn't super optimistic about life but the negative thoughts weren't so bad. I actually got back into a hobby of mine. Unfortunately, that only lasted about 3 weeks.  I got home after the first day at a new internship and I had a full relapse.  I'm just so horrifically lonely. My therapist says I just have to wait but I've been waiting about 10 years. I have social anxiety but I can be funny and personable. It takes me so long to get comfortable with someone. My therapist probably hates me. She asked if I was using the social isolation thing as a way to slip back into depression. Why do therapists always think you want to be depressed? My lack of meaningful human contact is kind of a big problem. Everywhere I see people out having fun with people that care about them. About what they think and how they feel.  If it wasn't for the fact that I have a few decent friends from where I used to live I'd get rid of Facebook. I'm just so full of jealousy and sadness. I hate everything about myself and there's really not much I'm happy about in life. Yeah I went back to school but what does it matter if I have nobody to talk to about it. Nobody to go out with. I don't think it's outside the realm of possibility that I'll be alone for the vast majority of my life. When I think about waiting longer I feel a stab of hopelessness so terrifying that if I had a gun in my hand I'd stick it in my mouth and pull the trigger right there. So here I am, in my room all alone with nothing to do and nobody to see.  I think of what I would say to everyone before I kill myself. I'm not very angry at the world. I just think you have to play the hand your dealt and I just don't have the right cards to make it in this world. It's around the time of year of my two hospitalizations for suicide attempts.  I don't have the motivation to try but I think about it every minute.  If I get there then that's fine with me. I want to just post on Facebook how fucking lonely i am, but you can't do that. Some people will say some kind words and everyone will see how pitiful and broken I am. I have no energy. I don't feel like playing video games or watching a movie.  I just want someone to care about me and want to be in my company. All I can do is just hold tight and hope I feel better. Ok that was rambling, sorry. Anyway I hope everyone is at least doing better than me. "
50x3v2,25,2016-09-02,"24 year old graduating from college in December, looking for guidance on loan repayment prior to graduation",Alonewarrior,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/50x3v2/24_year_old_graduating_from_college_in_december/,"So, I'm working on finally finishing up my degree in Computer Science. I'm in the United States. I have an internship that started a week ago and will continue to run through the 22nd of February, earning $20 an hour with a cap of 40 hours a week, although I'm only pushing 20-25 for now until I'm settled into the job and my last 2 college classes. I also work 12-15 hours a week at a movie theatre where I'm making $9.75 an hour. I should also mention that I live at home with my parents and will be with them until the start of next summer when I plan to move out and live on my own again (after having done it before and running out of money due to poor spending habits).

After college completion I'll have just over $40,000 in federal financial aid loan debt. I also have a car loan of about $4,500 that I'll have paid off in two years, and make payments of $203.30 every month and its interest is around 6%. I have a private loan for $5,500 that has accrued $2,200 in interest with an interest rate of 9.94%. Lastly, I have a small private loan that has roughly $850 left with a 3.5% variable interest rate; this loan requires payment on interest every 3 months and I've been paying well over that to slowly bring it down.

Financially, I have $5,000 in the bank that I received back from federal loans over the years. I've used that money to pay for books for school or other classes during the summer. I have around $2,000 in savings as fallback money, and I have $600ish in checking to hold onto for card payments, insurance, and all that other stuff. From financial aid this semester, I'm getting $1,200 sent to my account that was an excess from grant money—none of it is loan money.

My plans from this information was that I would use the $5,000 of loan money to dump into my larger private loan to get rid of the interest and put a significant dent into the principal, and then use the $1,200 in grant money to further reduce it to around $1,400. From there maybe keep making large payments for the next month and a half, assuming $700 per paycheck from my internship (other job wouldn't contribute to this at all, and only $400 per paycheck from the internship would be put towards the loan). This way it would be paid off and no longer accruing debt.

My next goal would be to shift my resources more towards increasing my monthly payments on my car to roughly double what I'm currently making in the hopes of having it that much closer to being paid off by the time I graduate and hopefully complete it before I need to start repaying my student loans.

My last goal before having to start repaying student loans would be to pay off the $850 loan I have out since it has the smallest interest rate.

I'm hoping that by posting this plan I can get some pointers on what can be improved upon and whether some of my ideas are problematic or if they're roughly where they should be.

Thanks in advance!"

I try for about an hour before giving up and looking for solutions. Currently a junior in Computer Science, and I'm afraid I won't be ready or good enough for internship technical interviews and whiteboard questions. How can I improve myself?

I had a good GPA (over 3.6), no real internship experience but paid research/design stuff instead. 

To be more specific, I'm in love with Colorado and I spent the three months since I've been out of school trying to get a job there. It's not happening, I've got job offers around me instead (MI), guess I'll have to try again in a year or something. Not that I'm ungrateful for what i have as a new grad, I'm just curious about what it takes. 

So if you folks with experience could give me some insight, I'd appreciate it :)

1) Does the current location of the person matter a lot?

2) Is CO just saturated with experienced engineers? It'll obviously be a popular place, but I figured the tech industry was big enough there to support lots of new incomers. 

3) Is internship/work experience fairly necessary to find a job out there?

4) I tried removing my address, putting ""Looking g near Denver, CO"" on my resume posted online to make it easier for recruiters out there to find me. Assuming the things above aren't major setbacks, is there something else I could do to make it easier for recruiters in a specific area of the country to find me/my resume online?


Thanks for your time and your thoughts."

all I'm asking them in return is to give feedback on what I can improve on so hopefully I learn enough to build my dream app that I've been planning for so long. I don't have the know how to build it right now, so I'm thinking doing this might expedite my learning process.

I know this sub bashes on unpaid internships, but I see this as more of a learning opportunity than a job. Plus I'm not going to work for any no names for free, as the idea is to hopefully network with industry insiders rather than some random guy launching startup XYZ. Thoughts?"

As a past graduate of Dev Academy (www.devacademy.co.nz) - I just want to openly warn people who're thinking of attending this course to steer well clear of it.

They claim on their website that they have 81% of graduates of jobs within 3 months of graduating, but how are these claims supported by 3rd party checks? They could claim grads as tutors or not even working in ICT as 'employed' so don't fall for the hyped claims...

The course is way overpriced for what you got - looking back I could have obtained the same information for free or very cheap using online resources like Lynda.com, Team Treehouse, Codeacademy, Code school etc....

Their claim of 'industry partners' is far fetched and don't believe the big name logos on their website - Trade Me, Xero etc... only a couple of EDA grads are working in these big players.

You are given the impression that they will put you forward to these big companies or have some kind of established intern scheme, that's not the case. Instead you are given a trello board with exhausted leads and a careers channel with sparse jobs posted that everyone and his dog applies for...

You're better off having the discipline to either code alone, or with a friend in the library and attending meetup groups showing a portfolio to impress potential employers, and that's all for free - it just takes time and discipline.

There is no real continual support post graduation, so you're on your own to fend for yourself and create your own networks, sad but true.

Don't bother with these guys, once they have your money their balls aren't on the line to help you further, so I would apply for a bootcamp elsewhere such as App Academy or Code House, both of which are actually incentivised to get you a job or their revenues would plummit.

Any questions? Please ask below, I'm wiling to help prevent victims of $11k get scammed"

The reason I'm posting this question is because at the moment I'm in a different city than my university, but same province.

Should I explain that I'm taking two semesters off when I'm handing out resume? Or should I wait for the interview? I don't think some people would believe I'm actually in a Bsci program, because I'm mousy (I'm getting better at talking to people but still.) and I'm aboriginal, plus I'm a girl.

50yors,12,2016-09-03,22Futa4F - Lilith Fairchild: The High School Futadom,RPDiem,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/50yors/22futa4f_lilith_fairchild_the_high_school_futadom/,"Hello there. I see that title caught your attention. Well, certainly don’t leave now. 

You heard me: *stay.* After all, we’ve only just started.

My name is Lilith Fairchild. I’m in the last semester of high school, and as you’re probably aware, it’s a very… *tumultuous* time in a young girl’s life. One of my outlets is self-expression, largely through my personal appearance. I wear what I guess many people would call a ‘punkish’ look. I keep one side of my jet-black hair buzzed, with piercings dotting my ears, eyebrows, nose and lower lip, as well as some more… intimate places. But we’ll get to that soon enough.

My clothing aligns with my overall style. I like black skirts, tattered jeans, combat boots and leather jackets. They make me feel more like… *me*, I suppose.

It probably wouldn’t surprise you to hear that I have what polite people refer to as *attitudinal problems*. You might be surprised, however, that I’m what less polite people refer to as an *angry psycho bitch*. I personally think that I’m misunderstood. 

After all, it’s not my fault that my parents had a rather ‘hands off’ approach to parenting. When they found out that their first (and only) child was… neither one thing or another, they let me make all the decisions as to who or what I wanted to be, and what I wanted to be was *powerful.* So, they turned a blind eye when I shoved the other kids around during preschool. They turned a blind eye when I hit puberty and my sheets started getting stickier (although they insisted that I do my own laundry at that point). They turned a blind eye when I started smoking and skipping class. And they sure as hell turned a blind eye when they heard what I’d done to the pastor’s wife...

These *attitudinal problems* extend to my love life. My girlfriends tend to either get scared off, worn out or *broken*. A lot of girls can’t handle what I’m packing (all nine, uncut inches of it) or some of the kinkier stuff I enjoy. I mean, don’t compliment my ass if you don’t want to spend an hour or two beneath it.

So, given the turnover rate in that department, I sometimes like a nice, quick anonymous fuck. Sometimes it’s in the back alley behind a bar (fake IDs for the win!) and sometimes it’s at a concert. I wouldn’t be surprised if I had a kid or three running around out there, but it’s not like I’d give anyone my name if I’m going bareback. I’m not a fucking *idiot* like some people…

Anyway, what I’m looking for is a new bitch to break in. Who are you to me? Well, you have a few choices:

- *The Popular Girl*: Oh, poor, stupid, popular girl. I guess you never noticed that weird girl staring at you from two seats back. Maybe you’ll notice when I cop a feel during gym class. Or when I slip in behind you in the locker room showers. Or when you’re picking my cum out of your hair. I’m certain that’ll lodge itself firmly in your memory. I might just get you to give me a cushy spot on the student council. Wouldn’t that be nice?

- ~~*The Nerd*: Well, calling you a nerd would be like calling the kettle black. I like many of the things that you like: fantasy and science fiction, video games, Doctor Who, girls… When I invited you back to my place to hang out, I could practically *taste* your excitement. I suppose you thought we’d be playing a co-op shooter when I brought you down to the basement lounge. Really, I just thought your face would make a comfortable seat while I pwned some noobs.~~ **Temporarily retired due to overexposure.**

- *The Teacher*: I’ve had the hots for you for quite some time, Teach. I mean, come on, nobody wears clothes *that* tight unless they’re trying to show off for the boys. Unfortunately, you’ve caught the eye of someone quite a bit more dangerous. *I don’t care* if it could mean losing your job, and despite how much you whine about it, I don’t think you really care either.

- *The Neighbour:* Welcome to Lawrence Terrace, a pleasant little cul-de-sac featuring green lawns, sunny skies, and a particularly predatory teenage dickgirl on the lookout for a new conquest. I’ll start out as just another helpful neighbour, showing you around town, mowing your lawn, walking your dog... But soon enough you’ll be the one at *my* beck and call. After all, I’ve always wanted my own place, but I can settle for taking over yours.

- *The One-Night Stand*: I don’t want to know your name, and I certainly don’t want you to known mine. All that matters is that I’m going to give you the fucking of your life. If you pop out a little brat in nine months, well, that’s not my problem.

- *The Boss*: With high school behind me, my next challenge is finding gainful employment. Luckily for me, truancy aside, my grades are pretty stellar across the board. As such, it isn’t too much of a problem to get an internship at a local office. It’s nice to see that, even after high school, there’s still bitches out there to tame... Including my *incredibly* fuckable boss. I hear that she’s married, but then again: so was the pastor’s wife. Maybe I can convince her to take me along on a business trip. Hell, after that I might even blackmail her into promoting me to secretary, although she’s an idiot if she thinks I’ll be spending any time under *her* desk.

- *Someone Else:* Impress me.

---

*Hi there! I hope you enjoyed my prompt. I'm trying something different today: I’ll be playing a bitchy, mean 18 year-old futadomme with more than a few destructive habits.*

*If you're interested, send me your character's name, appearance, relationship to my character and a few personality traits. Also, your kinks and limits would be helpful.*

*Some of my kinks include oral, anal, petplay, bondage, dubious consent, impregnation (one-night stands only), cumplay, sweat, spanking, facesitting, modification (piercings, tattoos, etc.), humiliation, domination and body worship. Limits are bestiality, ageplay (18+ only), blood, vomit (unless plot-relevant), and scat.*

I'm a senior majoring in economics, and I want to pursue computer science. I'm confident that I should get a PhD; I've enjoyed doing research very much during undergrad, I have solid career goals which require getting a PhD, and I have identified certain topics in computer science that I want to work on. However, I'm new to the subject; essentially I have a minor in math and several courses in computer science to be completed this fall, as well as some research experience which is fairly well connected to computer science. I also have enough credits to graduate with my econ degree this fall. 

I could apply for CS Master's programs which would start this spring and hope to transfer to a PhD later on, but this will probably be too difficult because my spring GPA was low (3.1, bad semester), I haven't proven myself in computer science yet (I only had one CS course in the spring; I skipped the entry levels and am now taking mid level courses), and I only know one professor well enough to get a very good letter of recommendation.

Alternatively, I could apply for graduate programs starting in the fall. If that happens I will have proven myself through fall coursework and CS projects. But should I apply for an MS or should I apply directly for a PhD? And if I do this, what should I do for the spring - continue my undergrad for another semester taking more relevant classes, or leave to do research and self study on my own, or take some kind of internship?

There is a lot for me to apply to in a short amount of time so I could use some help in simplifying what I should do. I'm asking university departments too."
50zkls,1,2016-09-03,Can hear my former gf[F20] having sex from my[M21] room.,HydroMattress,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/50zkls/can_hear_my_former_gff20_having_sex_from_mym21/,"Hi guys. Last Wednesday was one of the worst days in my life, and I don't really have anyone who I can talk it over with. 

Backstory: My former girlfriend [F20] and I[M21] started dating my junior year of high school. She was my first serious girlfriend and I shared many great moments with her. We both decided to attend the same college which allowed us to continue our relationship after graduation. Freshmen year of college was tough to adjust to, but with her around it made it easier. By this time we had been dating around a year and a half; this is when we lost our virginity to each other. Sophomore year took a hit on us, and by the end of the year we broke up. She was the one who wanted to opt out of the relationship, saying that I didn't pay enough time to her and that we were not happy with each other anymore. I accept that I was really busy at the time (mainly due to finals and family issues) but I did try to my hardest to make time for her. After all, by that time I had really fallen for her.

We broke up, since she didn't want work through it. I thought the situation sucked but I had a feeling we would get back together. Fast forward three months, to the start of a new school year,  

Present: My junior year of college started two weeks ago, and I was in a great state of mind to be successful. I was looking to do great in my classes and hopefully get an internship this upcoming summer. By this time my former girlfriend and I had been broken up for 3 months. I was half-assing getting over her as I thought that there was a chance we could get back together. On Wednesday, my roommate informed me that she lives next to us, something that I thought was normal. He also told me that she had a boyfriend, as he had seen her and some other guy walking out of her place together. That hit me hard, knowing that she moved on from a 3 year relationship in 3 months. I needed an outlet so I ran until my legs gave out. I came back home, showered, and turned on netflix. I was about ready to go to sleep when the most terrifying thing happened. I hear a bed squeak. Repeatedly. Faster and faster. My heart started going out of control. I had a mental picture of them together, she being intimate with another guy, someone who is not me. They finished and I couldn't control my heart rate. I needed to know if it was really her, that was the only thing that I thought could calm me down, the small chance that it was not her. I go out of my apartment and sit on the ground, waiting for them to come out. And sure enough it was her, with her best friend from highschool. As soon as I saw them I rushed back to my room, laid on the floor, and started breathing frantically. I think I suffered a small panic attack. I had to take long breaths to force my heart rate to decrease. Needless to say, I did not sleep that night. 

The next day was a continuation of the last. School was horrible and I didn't have the comfort of going back home to a safe place. As soon as I heard them having sex I realized that I didn't want anything to do with her. From one moment to the next I was over her. And I am really happy about that. However, I am sharing a wall with them, and that is my own little hell. I cannot live the next year where I am at. It has been 2 days and I am going crazy. My motivation is nowhere to be found, my confidence was demolished, and my mental health is taking a toll. 

I have talked to the apartment complex about moving me to another building, but they say the earliest that can happen is next week, if at all possible. I don't go in my room anymore, I have laid on the couch in the living room for the past 2 nights, not getting much sleep either. Every time I see her car parked outside, I automatically picture her with the other guy. 

I am lost. I don't know what to do or how to get those images and noises out of my head. 

Thank you for reading if you made it to this point. Can anyone relate to this story, and let me know what is the best thing I can do to get back to being the person that I was?

I'm graduate student in the field of AI. And I'll be an exchange student in the upcoming year, so I'd like to buy a new laptop. It will be mainly used for my master thesis which will be on deep learning and computer vision (not sure exactly what yet). I'll probably do some [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) competitions and contributions to some open source projects (including non-AI) as well. Apart from that I do some gaming from time to time and plan to buy Oculus as I have some discounts for it.

I'm looking for the following in a laptop:

 * performance
 * build quality
 * battery life
 * reasonable price

The [Lenovo P50](http://shop.lenovo.com/us/en/laptops/thinkpad/p-series/p50/) seems like a good option. However, I'm not up to date with the new hardware trends. I'd love to hear your opinion about the laptop and the following questions: How does the Xeon processor perform on a laptop? Should I get it or stick with an i7? Do I need an ECC memory?

I'm currently on an internship in the US and I have some really nice discounts for Lenovo. The P50 with 4K display, Xeon, 64 GB RAM, 512 GB SSD is around $2k.

So what do you guys think about the laptop and specs? Suggestions for other laptops than Lenovo are welcomed if the price is reasonable (up to $3k).

I am a final year student currently pursuing my BE from Bangalore. I will be sitting for MuSigma campus placements the coming week and looking for some inputs since I am specifically interested in data science. My resume at a glance.

* 88%, 78% and 64% in X, XII and undergrad respectively.
* Not from CS branch, but have good programming skills. Good at C,C++. Also worked with OpenCV, so have some idea of Python as well. Two mini projects were primarily programming based(Image Processing using OpenCV/Python).
* First internship at [TCIL](http://www.tatatinplate.com/). It was a technical one where I worked on assembly line automation(data from PLC on assy line to SQL database).
* Second internship which I am currently doing is at Aerospace Department, IISC Bangalore. Working on a project which employs machine learning.
* Have 10 months of volunteer experience at a recognized NGO. Primarily conducted workshops and was their tech guy.
* Hobbies include commercial flight simulation(fly as pilot on [Air India Virtual](http://airindiavirtual.net/vms/). Also, keep a regularly updated blog. Started a tech club at my college and member of the core team.
* Pretty good with quant + english. Taking tests on [Testpot](www.testpot.com) and consistently score above 95%ile. So aptitude shouldn't be an issue.

Now my questions are:

1. What is the skill set MuSigma is looking for?
2. How can I prepare for it and what should subjects should I concentrate on?
3. If at all I pass through to the interview stage, how should I sell myself?
4. In the section analysis of the aptitude tests on testpot, I noticed that my logical reasoning part was on the weaker side. What can I do to improve it?
5. Should I remove/add anything to my resume?"

I have been kinda off the charts for a while. Well recently I havent been depressed. I utilized counseling and well, I had great success. I am much more in tune with my emotions, thoughts, and behaviors. 

Along with this, my drinking has significantly reduced. A year ago I was whimpering off the side of my bed throwing up blood, crying, and still continuing to pull of a room temp plastic handle of whiskey (I still get PMs about that thread and the last one was only a month or two ago). Today, I woke up with no hangover, was able to socialize with my friend and play 2 rounds of disc golf before I go into work. It feels amazing. 

If I am to drink I count my drinks now, and find a reason why I need to be sober be a certain time the next day to prevent binges/benders. I have been drinking more craft beer, and wine. Typically will settle around a 6-8 drink limit (unless certain occasions) and its typically with other people. I have stayed away from hard alcohol for the most part (suppose I should update my flair). We all know how well I am at flying off the rails.

The worst part about not being depressed anymore, was that I lost my artistic talents (or whatever little I possessed). My song writing and poetry came to a screeching halt. I had nothing to write about, because I only knew how to write the blues and sad sad country ish songs. I know this is common with artists that they arent able to fully express themselves if they change their baseline state of emotion. The last time I recorded a song was back in May but that was written back in about Feb.

My main fear is how the winter will impact me. But Ill deal with that until it comes, and enjoy where I am at currently.

I just landed an internship to complete my graduate degree. Which still feels very surreal. My last semester of classes this summer, I had a 4.0 

Things are going well. I still frequent CA as my main sub. I love you all. It just seems to be that when things are going this well, ""the big crash"" is about to happen and shit hits the fan. Ive had shit luck all of my life it appears to be. Maybe this is my break finally. I know its a cognitive distortion to worry about that. But fuck it, I am going to enjoy where I am at currently. 

Well thought since I was overdue for an update of why I have seemed to somewhat dissapear, [here](https://sketchyfitzgerald.bandcamp.com/track/wishin-for-much-more) is a link to my first ""happy"" song. Compared to my romance with self-destructive and addictive themes to my songs before, this one almost sounds like glitter and rainbows. I was able to still express myself through music, even though the content has changed. 

Thanks everyone,
Cheers and stay drunk"

When he started working at my store, he was a regular associate like I am. As i started working with him and getting to know him the first few weeks, I started to like him, and im not sure if he liked me but he would tell me i was hot, and he always did things for me and would rub my shoulders alot and get all touchy. 

I was afraid he just wanted to get in my pants, so i kept acting like i didnt notice what he did. Months later, he started seeing someone. i tried moving on, especially after he got promoted to supervisor, but i haven't been able to. When he got into that relationship, i started to avoid him but he would always try to hug me and ask me what was wrong. he would go as far as calling my best friend (who works there as well) to ask why i was mad him. 

Our relationship at work is strange. He still asks around when im mad at him. I've never had anyone care so much. we argue alot at work but we get along well. sometimes, if im on break, he comes in and sits with me and we just talk. we've actually gotten alot closer these last few months. A few weeks ago, he did something at work that really made me and another coworker upset, so i stopped talking to him. the other girl is upset as well, but with me, he is trying so hard to make it up to me. he keeps trying to talk to me and he is letting me do what i want, and he keeps asking my friends about me. and he is not doing anything like that with the other girl. anytime he does something for me, he tells me he did it for me because he loves me. im not sure how he means it.

i know i should not get involved. i already know. he has a girlfriend. he's my supervisor. dont get involved with people at work. i know. but this job isnt my life. im only there during college. im planning to switch stores eventually, or leave once i graduate or get an internship which i am still working on.  i'm just alittle confused with his actions. 

i would think he is just being a good boss who cares about his employees but he isnt this caring with anyone else. he doesnt care if everyone else gets mad at him. should i just tell him how i feel? or should i keep attempting to move on?


tldr; ive liked a guy at work for about 2 years. he eventually became my boss. he is always touchy feely with me, and tries to please me and make me happy but he wont do that with everyone. im trying to let it go but i haven't been able to. i dont know if i should just tell him how i feel. "

I basically was taking / enrolling in CE / CS classes without their academic consent, which was a risky idea, but I told them I was already interested in doing CE. 

Anyways, I'm a year behind in CE as a 2nd year. This quarter, I'm taking Computer Architecture, a Human-Computer Interaction class, and Engineering Calculus as well a Technology Management class. For the entire year, I'm taking all the classes I should of taken last year, so basically doubling up on courses. I've already taken object-oriented programming in Java, but all did a lot of other programming on the side. 

Since I am on track with declaring, but should of taken half my classes last year, how would I explain this when talking to recruiters, interviewers, etc if they *do* ask? 

My target internships are made for underclassmen, basically explore programs. I feel like I'm not at the level I need to be, but I will need as much experience as I can get. I'm also a Asian-American Female so it's only helping out as much as it can as many internships want minorities.  Should I say I was a pre-med before hand and became more passionate about technology? Another reason behind my academic delay is because I was assaulted last quarter and was too anxious to take any of my finals and ended up dropping out of school momentarily and it is shown on my transcript. I don't want to have to explain all of this to them, but I also don't want them to think I'm not serious and being extremely slow with my coursework. 

Does anyone have any tips?

So I did a busy season internship at a B4 in audit and got a return offer to do another internship this upcoming busy season (after which I hopefully would get an offer for FT). I have already accepted the return offer a couple months back.


However I'm interested in eventually moving into TAS and I have this fall recruiting cycle coming up and I've noticed a couple firms are hiring interns for that service line and while I know it's difficult to get these positions without doing a couple years in audit first I figured I would like to at least throw in an app because you never know. 


So really my only worry is that the recruiters of other B4 firms talk among each other and somehow word that I'm looking for other opportunities reaches my current B4 firm and they pull my offer and I'm left unemployed. I wasn't feeling optimistic enough after my first internship to decline the return offer and just go all in for advisory so if I did somehow get a position I would be reneging on my audit offer (which tbh I am ok with, as has been pointed out many times on this sub we need to do what's best for us). I just don't want to end up offerless somehow, as I really still do have a lot to learn in audit and don't mind going back. 


Anyone have any advice what to do in this situation? Should I throw caution to the wind and apply and hope for the best or should I not apply at all in fear of losing my current offer? And if I do get an interview, should I just be honest and say I did receive a return offer and I accepted it but I feel like TAS aligns more with my interests?  "

Anyway, when we met I didn't really have a plan for my future so I went out with him all the time and we always had a blast! 

A few years passed and we grew up and realized we basically needed to get our shit together and couldn't be party animals forever. 

In a nutshell, the career I became passionate about requires a doctorate degree. So the past few semesters I have been working my butt off on science pre-reqs (trying to catch up), been doing internships, working in a clinic, and now I'm doing applications and studying for the Graduate Record Exam.

Anyway, I feel like this is a really big part of my life!!! I'm really busy, especially this past month and it's SO hard being with someone who is not taking school as seriously or going through the same thing. He's more concerned with working full-time to make ends meet than school (which is understandable). 

However, it's a problem because inside, I'm still that fun girl that wants to go out and drink with our friends and have a lot of fun! I know I'm about to take this huge important exam but instead of studying hard I'm at home jealous that he's been going out with our friends (especially today, they ALL went out today to play some drinking games) while I have had to be shackled at home working on my graduate school apps and preparing for this exam. He's all out having the time of his life and I'm just suffering at home.

How can I talk myself out of this? I'm trying to build myself a good future but I am constantly jealous my other half gets to go out and have fun while I have to be the lame one who misses out on everything...
p.s. he's an amazing boyfriend and supportive of my dreams, i really have no complaints with how he treats me but this situation in general just sucks

Would you guys be jealous too or am I just being a selfish b*tch? It's alright if you think so...I just need to know. Also, how to cope!"

This hole is too small for me, Brent.

  
I want great. I want people
look at me and say ...

  
""That's a great mayor.""
And why should this work.

  
It should work.

  
Otherwise I'm just a little mayor
of a small town ...

  
from tiny sardines to
hungry idiots.

  
I do not?
- Not you, Brent. You're like a son.

  
Hello all.

  
Under this canvas is the largest tourist
attraction ever built by humans.

  
We have only 17,000 kilojoules
need.

  
Go!

  
What are you, Flint Lockwood?

  
I just keep my hands behind my back.

  
Know what you are, Flint Lockwood?
An impostor.

  
Kung Fu.

  
Have you seen my beautiful son? Cal?

  
I love him so much.
It is my only son.

  
I want him a good future.
A future where you do not ruin our city.

  
With one of your crazy inventions.
- That's all behind us.

  
See you this contact?

  
This contact represents you.

  
And my eye represents my eye.

  
I have my eye on you.

  
My God, a careless pedestrian.

  
And I have arranged live report
of a large network ...

  
and most experienced
professional reporter.

  
That is cute intern,
and she is very bright.

  
We are also looking,
to someone who brings back to television.

  
Trainee, you would report
to do it again ...

  
of a small island in the middle
of the ocean as a favor to my cousin?

  
Can you believe it, Manny?

  
Temporary, professional meteorologists.

  
What do you here?

  
Hello America, I am Sam Sparks.

  
Hello America here Sam Sparks.

  
Hello America, I saw you not.
I, Sam Sparks.

  
Way.

  
This is a great idea.

  
The news happens again,
or not.

  
About to Swallow Falls, where
Our intern's first day starts.

  
Or should I say first gray days.
looks pretty foggy out, intern.

  
Hi I'm Sam Sparks America.

  
It is all the fault of ...
Or let's go over to the mayor.

  
Thank you, and welcome public
national television.

  
Here comes the one who
the ceremonial ribbon is cut ...

  
the favorite son of Swallow Falls,
Baby Brent.

  
I am the best in town.

  
This is strange. There is something going on.

  
The attraction that the whole world
to the waiting ...

  
Sardine Land!

  
I have the copy of
the world's largest sardine.

  
And his glorious flame.

  
 Cheese Burger. 

  
A moment.
I'm doing ...

  
It seems like sardines Swallow Falls
needs for the better.

  
No.

  
You are arrested, Flint Lockwood.

  
Luckily you Sardine Country
not very damaged.

  
I'm sorry.

  
I'm sorry. Is everything okay?
I did not ...

  
Not bad, but it is pain.

  
I'm not myself today.

  
My career was ruined by
an idiot in a homemade rocket Sat

  
Hold on. What about your feet?

  
""Spray on shoes. They will not come off.

  
Cool. This may loose shoelace
epidemic problems.

  
Where are they made.
An elastic material.

  
Yeah, exactly.

  
I mean, they are shiny.
I am Sam.

  
Is that a monkey thought translator?

  
Unbelievable. Will you make this?

  
You've hit me with that rocket.
- You have kicked me in my face.

  
I told you that I am sorry.

  
You only get one chance, and
if you do not save ...

  
you again have to do cleaning.

  
That can only mean ...

  
This really works.

  
Your machine?
Was that rocket of yours?

  
Do you love it?

  
Delicious! It's great!

  
This is the biggest weather phenomenon
in history.

  
You do not weather?

  
Our trainee humiliated again
is apparently back.

  
Thanks, Patrick.
That you will not believe ...

  
but I am heart
a hamburger rain.

  
Perhaps you have seen a meteor shower,
but such meteors've never seen.

  
The city does not eat more sardines,
This is absolutely wonderful.

  
This will be great.

  
This is actually food  again
invented by Flint Lockwood. 

  
Flint Lockwood?

  
You are arrested for destroying
Land of Sardine.

  
Those burgers were great.

  
The director called, and he said,
""everyone thought that great food again.

  
""Food Show"". This increases
Country or Sardine.

  
Can you please again
eat make it rain?

  
I really do not know if I ...
- Do you back?

  
You take me a fool?

  
Please?

  
Yes!
- No.

  
Give me a chance.
- We both know that it was accidental.

  
I know.
- Cheese Burgers from the sky ...

  
that is not natural.
- My invention can save the entire city.

  
You are so proud of me, Dad.

  
And ...
A career.

  
Can you look into my eyes and tell me
you have this under control?

  
And not that it ends in a disaster?

  
Yes.

  
I have it under control,
it does not end in a disaster.

  
Well.
- Thanks, Dad.

  
Of course.
- Good. So Sam ...

  
Here the magic happens.

  
 Home, Flint. 

  
You take really much time alone.

  
How it works.
Water goes in the top ...

  
and food is coming from the bottom.

  
So if you are in the stratosphere,
change the molecules ...

  
the cumulonimbus layer.
- This is a clever observation.

  
I mean, the clouds contain
probably water.

  
I think you therefore
appeared there.

  
Why did I do that.
- Exactly.

  
The machine uses the principle
of hydro kinetic mutation.

  
Water molecules are bombarded
with microwave radiation ...

  
that mutates the genetic recipe
in any food you want.

  
Pizza is?
- Yes!

  
Mashed potatoes?
- Yes.

  
Peas? Cake? Apples? Apple Sauce?
- Yes.

  
A sandwich with bacon, lettuce and tomato?
- I am pretty sure every kind of food.

  
Kipvleugels?
- Think about what you want to say ...

  
if the food is, it can.
- Bullshit.

  
Nonsense is no food.
- Gelatin then!

  
Do you enjoy gelatin?
- Delicious.

  
I agree, wonderful.
And then peanut butter?

  
No, I am very allergic to peanuts.

  
Me too.
- What is it?

  
Peanut allergy.
- No, the machine.

  
Of course. It is called the Flint Lockwood
diatonic super mutant ...

  
etensvermenigvuldiger dynamic "".

  
Or for short 'the FLDSMDFR.

  
FLDSMDFR.

  
FLDSMDFR.

  
Manny, make sure you record it.
He is now making the food.

  
Now?

  
I can not.

  
I did this hilarious internet
video show.

  
Impressions, build, connect.

  
Paints, run.

  
Staring, motivate.
Place.

  
I can not believe I
all three hours sitting watching.

  
I know.

  
It works.

  
What do you want for breakfast?

  
Gummi Bears.
- No, we know how you are with Gummi Bears.

  
Eggs then?

  
Toast?
- Orange juice.

  
Bacon!

  
What are you doing?
- Nothing.

  
To the computer!

  
Input code  eat.
Menu: (Bacon), crisp. 

  
 eggs. 
- Are you sure this is safe?

  
Do not worry. I have a meter that hazard
let us know when dinner is overgemuteerd.

  
What happens if it mutates to eat?

  
That will never happen.

  
Now it will explode.

  
Keep your distance.

  
Those cheeseburgers were only the beginning, because
a breakfast area go to Swallow Falls.

  
My prediction: ""fried eggs"".

  
Flint my boy, can you do?

  
We do so, you let it
snacks but still raining ...

  
weather girl doing free advertising ...

  
I have a loan with high interest
concluded ...

  
this miserable town
""a tourist voedseltopia"" change.

  
You should only eat to rain,
three meals per day ...

  
every day in the foreseeable future.
And in thirty days.

  
We reopen the island on
a fantastic way ...

  
as a destination that you must have seen.

  
Then everybody, everywhere,
adore your invention.

  
Do you?
- I know.

  
Poultry in motion.

  
Mr. Lockwood, there are waffles?

  
A waffle. - Jelly Beans.
- Avocado.

  
Coming.

  
Leftovers? No problem,
with the latest invention of Flint Lockwood ...

  
from the zichter. Thereby bringing it
the uneaten food out of sight.

  
And you thought it out.

  
Flintlock Woods napkins

  
Great!

  
A pizza in a turkey is stopped
All frozen and dipped in chocolate.

  
I am the mayor.

  
You look different. Another hairstyle?
- Yes, that's right.

  
Thank you remember.

  
Dad, I'm going back to the laboratory.

  
I can show you how I make dinner.

  
No thanks. This techno eat ...

  
is too complicated for an old fisherman.

  
I got it.

  
I can still use your help here.

  
I now work with the mayor.

  
The reopening of the city
is about one weeks.

  
Exactly. I got it.

  
Flint Lockwood?
- Yes.

  
Tomorrow is my birthday son Cal.

  
Can you not
something special to rain?

  
I'm quite full of requests.
And you were always mean to me.

  
For just once.
For my special angel.

  
A special day.
- I do not know.

  
I want the machine
too much work, so ...

  
I knew I would make little chance.

  
I just wanted to show Cal
how his father loves him.

  
I thought you would understand.

  
You always know how their father's love and
appreciation to their sons want to show.

  
Earl, wait.

  
I have an idea.

  
Congratulations son.
- Dad?

  
This is your day.
Go have fun.

  
I love you. You are crazy.
- I love you, boy.

  
Ice!

  
Frozen strawberries river.

  
Come on, Dad.
- I do not know, Cal. It does not ...

  
I love you boy.
- I know, Dad.

  
You say that every day.

  
Flint, this is crazy.

  
For ice design, which looks like,
I do not know how you did.

  
Perhaps with hot caramel?

  
Flint, meaning in a snowball fight?

  
What is the problem?

  
I've never thrown snowballs.
- Really?

  
I know the rules.
Is there a way now, or ...

  
to death.
- No.

  
You never ...
Even Steve throws chocolate snowballs.

  
So?

  
No, throw harder.

  
Snowball!

  
Snowball!

  
Well, I can not say
on your enthusiasm.

  
Snowball!

  
Snowball!

  
Snowball and snowball!

  
What is going on.
- Snowball!

  
Snowball.

  
 I scream, you cry,
We all scream for ...

  
 Flint's latest delicacy. 

  
 We freeze and have fun
if the mayor declares that ...

  
 it is a holiday ice cream. 

  
 He wants to invite everyone in the world,
a cruise-liner to take ...

  
 Saturday to qualify for the grand opening
Chewandswallow of ...

  
 a town that really
in fashion. 

  
 A town that is truly full of ice. 

  
 This is the news today on WNN.
I am Sam Sparks. 

  
Flint, this is the best present ever.

  
I got it. Investigations,
role.

  
Rotate.

  
Wait.

  
Sam Sparks.
- End.

  
Regret. Think about it.
See what I do?

  
Flint?
- Hey Sam, how are you? That's nice.

  
I was wondering if you with me ...

  
morning with something I wanted to do?

  
Well.
- Great, bye, meet me in the woods.

  
Got it.
I have to go Steve!

  
Keep the lab to watch for me!

  
Where are we going?
- Nowhere.

  
I thought it was fun
to piece together a run.

  
Like friends do.

  
Look, what's that?

  
Jelly is my favorite.

  
You never made a request, so ...

  
I have one for you.

  
Join us.

  
How did you ...

  
I made some jelly
middle of the night ...

  
and when I awoke
I brought it here and ...

  
and pressed it into a giant mold
I had made.

  
Nothing special.

  
Everything is made of jelly.

  
These piano. These hanging lamps.
That Ghetto Blaster, which jelly.

  
The aquarium.
The Minus D'Milo-with-no-face statue.

  
And David the conqueror as you see.

  
Come on, Sam, what are you waiting for?

  
Nowhere on!

  
Cannon Ball!

  
Jelly-stroke.

  
I know I should not do.

  
So, so jelly.
- Yeah, right.

  
It is fixed, it is liquid.
It is transparent and you can eat!

  
I mean, it's good.

  
Why are you doing?
- What?

  
Most clever thing to say and then
see from there?

  
Can you keep a secret?
- No.

  
But this time.

  
It is a long time ago but
I was also ...

  
a nerd.
- It?

  
When I was a little girl ...

  
I wore a ponytail, glasses ...

  
and I was completely obsessed
the science of weather.

  
Other girls wanted a Barbie,
I wanted a weather radar Doccler Turbo 2000.

  
Robert Child Rick taught me a weird song,
which was not even clever.

  
Eyed, squinting,
you have a need glasses to see!

  
Go ahead.

  
So I got a new look,
gave science doing it ...

  
and there was never laughed at me.

  
And I still need those glasses, but
I never wear it.

  
I bet you look good
with glasses.

  
And up it.

  
What?
- Nothing.

  
Wait!

  
It is a jelly-clamp.

  
And now, the unveiling.

  
I mean, you looked good before,
but now ...

  
you are beautiful.
- No, I mean ...

  
so I can not come in public.

  
Why not?
I mean, this is you really! Right?

  
Smart. Respect Abel.

  
Who would not want that look.
- You know ...

  
I've never
as you met Flint Lockwood.

  
Me neither.
How about you?

  
Flint, you phone.

  
Is your phone?
- That's odd?

  
Someone must have turned my number.
- Flint!

  
It is the mayor.
Do you mind if I answer him?

  
No, go ahead.
- I'm so sorry, I must ..

  
It is really important.
I step outside.

  
Dad, you've come.
I must tell you so much.

  
Do I look good?
- You look great! Come on.

  
I would stand in the list.
- Hi, Brian.

  
What?
You let the guy inside?

  
That guy is a Nerd!

  
Thank you.

  
At Flint and his delicious steak!

  
Thanks though.
- Very nice case.

  
Flint Lockwood!

  
No roof?
- Yes.

  
Just love on your plate. I even let
your favorite foods rain. Meat.

  
You know that tomorrow is the big opening
of the town?

  
The mayor has asked me
at the ribbon cutting.

  
He says that my invention has the city
saved. Are not you proud of me?

  
Flint, seems you do not steak
a little too big?

  
Yes, it is a great steak and not
each steak was exactly the same.

  
Did you not hear what I just said?

  
I'm not this good
for humans.

  
You may need this thing off.
- It makes everybody happy.

  
Everyone except you.

  
If you accept now that I'm like?

  
Instead of trying to me
a tackle shop to get boring?

  
You obviously know what you're doing.

  
Then I will not stand in the way.

  
You can do him no favors.

  
He is everything I do spoil.

  
These are great hot dogs.

  
This is not so bad?
Or it may, Steve?

  
Yellow.
- You're right, Steve.

  
The danger meter is in yellow.

  
I do not know what to do.
- I do.

  
This delicious hot dogs as explained!
- Oh no!

  
How did you get in?
- Tomorrow is the big day Flint.

  
The fate of the city
is in your food again.

  
I think to post up.

  
Just sign here.
I do not know you in the lurch.

  
Mr. Mayor, I think
You should see something. - What?

  
This is the molecular structure of
the hotdog who last week cases.

  
And this is the structure
of a hotdog, today cases.

  
The machine uses radiation to micro
the particles of food to mutate.

  
The more we ask to make
more clouds he used ...

  
the more radiation there is,
the more the molecules-to mutate.

  
And therefore the food growing.

  
This I have heard,
science, higher.

  
And bigger is better. Everyone is crazy
the size of these portions.

  
I certainly would.

  
My dad thinks I should put him out.
- Geniuses like us ...

  
fathers are never understood, Flint.
- As things now ...

  
Who has the approval
need of a family ...

  
if your approval
millions of people have?

  
And not to forget, that cute girl
one of Sam Sparks.

  
And me.
I've always seen my own son.

  
I will be so proud of you tomorrow.
And you cut ribbon ...

  
and saves the city and proves to everyone
what a great inventor you are.

  
So here is the opportunity.

  
You can let go by
and have anything you want ...

  
and the great man,
I know where you are ...

  
if you put it out, ruined everything,
and nobody will ever allowed.

  
The choice is yours.

  
Choice.

I mean, bigger is better.

  
Right?
- Oh yes!

  
Who is hungry?

  
Welcome tourists,
in Chewandswallow.

  
This is a great mayor.

  
Fun in our Nacho Cheese Hotspring.

  
Allow the children to eat junk food all
they want our children unsupervised area.

  
Jelly Beans, teeth.

  
And when the fun is over ...

  
look at the sunset
in 'mountain leftovers.

  
Protected by our
suspected indestructible barrier.

  
Today we have people here,
around the world.

  
Flint, you should consider this.

  
Are not you on TV?
You would have to send out.

  
There is a problem. I think
the food increases.

  
No, it's great. Big portions.
Everyone loves it.

  
Flint, I'm not sure
we do well.

  
If we have more on our plates
than we can chew?

  
For the first time in my life is
everyone like what I did.

  
Why can not you just be happy for me?

  
Go say something about the weather or something.

  
And now the hero of the city, and my
metaphorical son, Flint Lockwood!

  
Flint, we wish you the ceremony
with the scissors does.

  
Flint? No!

  
Please.
- You can not tackle!

  
Baby I'm Brent.

  
The truth is, Flint,
everyone loves you.

  
Danger!

  
Salt and pepper wind?

  
Oregano?

  
Sam, wait. I just sold.

  
I can sell?

  
Sorry.

  
Sorry.
- No problem.

  
Look there.
- Not now, Steve.

  
Sauce.

  
This is Sam Sparks, live
Chewandswallow from ...

  
Sam, we find a good storm is fun,
but you look like a nerd out.

  
Several children are stranded
in a tornado.

  
My stomach hurts.

  
What is that, one schrunchie? I took
not seen since 1959.

  
We have an emergency.

  
We come right back to that storm, as
Sam is looking more attractive.

  
Steve, we have the Kill Code Upload ...
What are you doing here?

  
I am the last ten minutes
to ordering food.

  
Why? Is there something wrong?
- I try to stop the machine.

  
I've put everyone in danger.

  
So much can it not be.

  
No!
- I'm off.

  
I can command
Kill the stop code.

  
Send the Kill Code.
- I'm back.

  
I have the button ...

  
Flint, it's nice to beat.

  
Not so fast!

  
That was the only way the machine
to work.

  
What exactly did you order?

  
""A Vegas Style
all you can eat buffet "".

  
Jelly Beans ...

  
Is everyone all right?
- Yes.

  
Somebody help me!

  
It is my son.

  
We have a doctor.
Is there a doctor?

  
Someone?
- I am a doctor.

  
Are you?
- That was me. In Guatemala.

  
I came here for a better life.

  
Quite a big decision.

  
How is he?

  
He is in a food coma.

  
Too much junk food. I need celery.
- Please.

  
Papa?
- Cal, I love you son.

  
It seems that everything has come.

  
Not yet. That tornado is nothing
compared to what is on.

  
Manny, connect us.

  
Do you report, Nancy.

  
Patrick, there is a huge
food storm.

  
It will spread around the globe.

  
I have calculated speed of the storm.

  
First it will arrive in New York.

  
Dan Paris. And it goes on to China.

  
And about four hours, the entire Northern
Hemisphere have a big blockage.

  
Hi, Dad.
- What are you doing?

  
I've tried to help everybody
but instead ...

  
I ruined everything.

  
I'm just a piece of waste.

  
So, I myself discarded.

  
Along with all these stupid inventions.

  
This is shit ...

  
and it is junk.

  
Listen son, if your boat ...

  
if not now ...

  
you know.
- I understand.

  
Mama had no right.

  
I'm not an inventor.

  
I had to take time
you said that.

  
Well ...

  
when it rains, do one coat.

  
Papa, I do not understand vismetaforen.

  
Come on, Steve, we have
a team together.

  
Download Kill Code.

  
Redesign, fertilize ...

  
cutting, burning ...

  
wrought iron ...

  
Help me!
- Fifteen.

  
Yes!

  
My car!
Now we will.

  
I have dreamed of.

  
Hotdogs!

  
Everyone!

  
I would say that I am sorry.

  
Especially to you, Sam.

  
I have a plan.

  
This memory stick includes a Kill Code.

  
Food that I will storm fly
the machine stop in the ...

  
and for ever cease.

  
As you evacuate the island ...
- It's all his fault.

  
Get him!

  
Shake the car back and forth!

  
The mess we are in it,
is all our fault.

  
Take my own son.

  
I'm just so mad at Flint
like you.

  
I will save him even at his face
if he comes out of the car.

  
I know that the food has Flint Lockwood
made, but that was to order.

  
And now we all
pay the price.

  
Thank you, Earl.

  
Sorry.
- It's okay.

  
Let us build a boat.

  
I go along with you.

  
You need someone who you
will navigate through this storm.

  
I can not just leave it.
- Sam, I am so sorry.

  
Do you kidding?
- I just thought ...

  
No!
- Good.

  
You need a co pilot.
- Are you a pilot?

  
Yes, and I am a physicist.

  
Really?
- No, that was a joke.

  
I am also an actor.

  
Let's do it.
- I go along.

  
Brent, it is good.
- No.

  
It is not good. I've had since I
a baby on my fame tarred.

  
But it is all just an illusion.

  
Maybe I was upstairs from
who I really am.

  
We are already full, so ...

  
Yes, Flint.

  
Good luck, kid.

  
He is too far!
- Manny, press the wiper.

  
Flint, there accumulates a lot of gas
around on the machine.

  
It seems almost as if ...
- Inside a huge meatball.

  
Water is a top, and
a hurricane food comes out from under.

  
Why I wear a diaper.

  
Has anyone ordered pizza?

  
We are haunted by a pizza?
- Sends it eat?

  
That is impossible.
- The massive molecular structure ...

  
mutating into super food.

  
Genetically designed to
the FLDSMDFR protection.

  
Pizza.

  
That was a close call. Can you imagine
Kill Code if we had lost?

  
Dad, are you okay? Great.
I need your help, the world is at stake.

  
What do you need?

  
Go to my lab, the computer
and mail a file to my mobile.

  
Well.

  
Yeah, okay.

  
That does not look bad.

  
This is the plan. Sam and I
go here in the meteorite ...

  
what to us now FLDSMDFR
should lead.

  
Manny, you and Steve continue to ship.
Pipe not around.

  
Once my father told me the Kill Code
emailed ...

  
destroy the machine and we meet

Just that.

Right in this hole.

  
That's peanuts.

  
If even one of us touches the

Actually I'm not allergic
for peanuts.

  
I told you so just me

So you really thought you
more attractive with allergies?

  
This is a great bagel!

  
Would I allowed some extra mustard?

  
You are about to pulverized

It seems that the food storm
follows an unusual pattern ...

  
she hit the main points first, and
now spreads over the rest of the world.

  
What the ...
- Come on, guys.

  
After my phone in the FLDSMDFR
I stopped and got destroyed ...

  
I pull the rope twice, and
then you pull me up again, right?

  
Sounds good.

  
You have your cut, or not?
- It's only a scratch.

  
Flint, Sam needs you to bring airplane
for an injection against allergies.

  
Hold on.
- Let go.

  
Let go, Sam.

  
I will not let you go!
Then you sit down there.

  
It is not ideal really.

  
Come with us, then
we start over again.

  
Then we live under the ground,
and we use bacon as clothes.

  
Sam, it's not really a good plan.
- We will at least not lose.

  
Listen, I like you very much.

  
As friends?

  
No, if I like you ....

  
I miss you too.
But then you.

  
Flint, no!

  
Hold on, Sam. Doctor Manny
has medicine for you.

  
We are way, hurry!
- Hold on, Sam.

  
I'm almost there.

  
What is that?

  
Gummi Bears.

Where are you?

  
She has touched a peanut,
or something.

  
Friend, the kitchen is closed.

I am proud of you, Flint.

  
I am amazed that
an ordinary person like me ...

  
the father may be, of someone so
particularly as you are.

  
You're talented, original
and your laboratory is breathtaking.

  
Your mother always knew

If I afdoe this thing, and if I

So, where were we?

  
You just wanted me to kiss.

If I stay with the job, I may end up with a lower GPA but they may bring me on after I graduate (I've been told by others in  the organization that my team is interested in bringing me on full time after graduation).  If they do bring me on, I could get a masters, etc, for free via tuition remission (I work at a branch within my uni). I probably wouldn't even be accepted if I applied due to my GPA, but I could get accepted to other schools supported by the tuition remission. 

If I quit, I could get my GPA up, especially if I prolong my stay for another semester or two (which would suck but I feel I'd be in a better position overall). I could even cram in a summer internship before I graduate.

512kts,2,2016-09-04,Should I quit? Boss/manager bullying. + LONG rant,skittles_23,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/512kts/should_i_quit_bossmanager_bullying_long_rant/,"Hi reddit, I need some opinions here... super long rant incoming. Please and thank you for giving me your time to read through all of this... The last two paragraphs are a TL;DR.


I work at a fast food minimum wage job. I get worked like a dog and very rarely am appreciated for what I do for my co-workers and workplace in general. This is my personal opinion but I work harder and put more effort into the job than 80% of the employees there, even though it is minimum wage and have little growth opportunities. In fact, I work so hard that I usually make THEIR position at least 2x easier; it's as if I'm taking on half their role on top of my own). As for the other 20%, I work as hard as 15% and maybe 5% of the employees put more effort than I do. Naturally I am a hard worker and I often have to catch myself when helping someone asking myself.. would this person help me as much as I help them...? and the answer is often no except for like 5 employees out of approx. 50. Depending on shifts I don't see these hard working allies very often or at least not for long. I'd also like to mention that all my supervisors and both managers KNOW I work hard. I had different supervisors praise me for making their job easier and less stressful because they know they don't have to worry about me and know I will do my job.

Where I work is very fast paced obviously and I can understand the negative environment/mood that arises when things are not getting done at an adequate ""quick"" speed for positions in drive thru for example; you want things fast but only fast enough to be HUMANLY POSSIBLE. Apparently my managers (2)/owner(1) of the shop don't understand this concept because they're so stuck up on a numbers game of ""how fast can you serve the customer""/""this is the 'IDEAL' time needed to serve a customer"". I get it, ""ideals"" are everywhere but the question is: are they humanly possible depending on 1. how much items the customer orders, and 2. how many people are working to fill the order. 

If the order is big and there are not enough people filling the order then be considerate to the workers that are trying their best to fill it as quickly as possible. Of course it will take longer if only 2 people are filling it when to match the ""ideal time"" you would need at least 5 people working simultaneously to fill it. How can you expect those 2 workers to work at the pace of as if they were 5 people? How about you consider the time it takes to actually MAKE the drink or food they ordered? Here's a example with numbers in it. If the ideal time to serve a customer is 25 seconds INCLUDING greet, cash handling and give items you're already looking at about 5-20 seconds OR MORE gone depending on variables like:

1. Are they using cash/debit/visa? - sometimes they don't punch in their code right and need to reset it, sometimes their card doesn't even work in the first place (constantly declined); sometimes they go through different cards trying to get one to work

2. How many items do they have? - Obviously if they ordered one drink it will take 1-2 seconds to hand it out whereas if they ordered like 3 breakfasts, 5 drinks, and some cookies, it will take a few seconds longer to hand out if all the items are ready. Sometimes the customer isn't even ready to receive their items even if you're holding it out for them. ie. I've seen people sit there and count change at the pace of a 3 year old, dig into their purse to find their coin pouch, old/fat people struggling to reach for the items with the hand farthest from the person at the window making both our lives harder (???? why do people do this, I don't even...), ETC.

3. Did they get everything they ordered? - Sometimes they sit there assuming or arguing the person at the window didn't give everything they ordered when they have everything in their car and we can see it.. come on. Sometimes, people order extra things at the window which take time to fill. If they order at window the item doesn't magically and instantly appear in-front of them. Sometimes, the order taker didn't catch everything they ordered and it becomes a mess depending the mood of the customer (angry rude ones vs calm and collected ones). 

4. Are people using the machines that I need to complete my task? - If someone else is using the ""slushie machine"", I have to wait until they're done making their drink before I can use it.

5. Did I run out of supplies? - things like lids, cups, sugar, ice coffee, etc. This is generally the people in the store fronts job to stock and have constantly supplied but it's either they're lazy or busy at the time you run out of them. If I run out, I have to go to the back and grab more supplies and what does that take? Oh right.. TIME.  I can't teleport items to me and neither can you.

There are so many more variables that could interrupt the smooth flow of filling the order and clearly you can see that it's not always humanly possible to complete big orders within the ""ideal time"".  I got two hands and two legs. Give me a fucking break. That is the logic of the workplace and why it's not always possible. Anyone who has worked in fast food must know how this feels right? Unless your managers were super kind.

Now that that's out of the way, lets talk about the managers (2) and owner (1) of the shop bullying me. Based on the logic of the workplace explained above, you'd think your managers would be a little considerate based on the situation you are in (mainly how many people are helping you and how many tasks you need to complete on your own). You'd THINK they'd say to themselves ""oh yeah that's a lot to complete on their own, it will take a couple of extra seconds""... NOPE. One task, get it done in 5 seconds; 3 tasks, get it done in 5 seconds; 5 tasks get it done in like.. 6 seconds tops! Two hands, two feet. IT'S NOT HUMANLY POSSIBLE. If things aren't done within the ""ideal"" (which aren't humanly possible need I say again), I get petty remarks like ""what are you doing"", ""It doesn't take that long"", ""why are you standing there"" Blah blah blah. In fact, I wasn't ""standing there"" I was brewing tea, coffee, restocking lids/cups, making hot drinks, etc. Just because you don't see me running around with my back faced to you doesn't mean I'm not doing something. BTW, if I AM standing there doing nothing it because I can't hear the customer through the shitty headsets we have that are broken and missing parts that are probably older than I am (the owner of the shop is super cheap and would refuse to by a new broom for sweeping that you can get for like a dollar at the dollar store until its completely broken - he'd even use tape when its broken so maybe it has to be broken twice/three times before he gives up a dollar for a new one). 

Today, the manager that was in actually had the audacity to make some really petty remarks at me like ""when are you doing to do your job properly"", not once, but TWICE. Both times were not my fault, and my co-workers that were responsible for the mistake even admitted to it, yet I was to blame, again. I always take the blame for things either not in my control or get blamed for my co-workers mistakes. I often explain why it's not my fault (not to place the blame on someone else but to explain why they should calm their tits) but the managers aren't having it. Once they pick someone to blame, it your fault no matter what. No logic involved. I looking at you so you did it. You were at the crime scene which you murdered everyone even though there's someone with  bloody knife standing next to you. NOPE, FOR SURE.. YOU DID IT. I don't understand. Loading Logic.exe .... Error Not Found. The managers aren't always rude and annoying but they are, more often than not. It's one thing to play your role as manager but we're all human and they should know better than anyone else.

The owner has the same logic and if anything he is the one who blames me the most. He nitpicks at EVERYTHING I do. He literally follows me or checks up on my tasks and waits for something he can find to blame me for. I even get blamed for things that aren't even a fucking problem. I get told ""this is how you should do it"" when he makes the task even more time consuming and inefficient when I am in the process of completing the task efficiently. The very first time he triggered me was when he told me ""don't do this"" and then the very next day I saw him do the thing he told ME not to do. WTF. It just went to hell from there. It's like he always finds something to say to me, but it's always negative. It's gotten so routine for him to find something to say that nowadays when I see him standing and watching me I literally just stop and give him the ""what now"" look so he can say what he's dying to say and then gtfo. He also talks to you in a very condescending tone and only likes you if you treat him like a king and always make him feel like he is right. He doesn't like you if you don't give him that treatment, which is probably why he doesn't like me.

Maybe the managers and owner should... you know, actually go nitpick at people that aren't even doing their job and wasting time rather than bothering and blaming someone that IS doing their job. I feel so under appreciated and bullied. They don't do this to many other people and if they do its only once or twice. I think they find it easy to pick on me because I usually hold my tongue and in the beginning when I was new I rarely argued back and just took the blame simply because I didn't want to play the blame game like they always do. Nowadays I do find the courage to defend myself but again it rarely helps because there's no logic here. 

This has been an ongoing problem. I've wanted to quit a long time ago (I've been working there for about a year), but family prevented me from doing so until I had another job lined up. So you ask, then why aren't you looking for other jobs? I have been, but it's not easy. I don't want to go for another fast food place obviously, and general labour is easy to get into but I'm not that strong. Basically I don't want to feel depressed again at a new workplace with similar aspects.  

I've told you my problems and now it's time I told you a little about me. I'm in the early 20's and I have actually finished a 4 year college degree last year in an industry that isn't super well paying but ""ok"" and something along the lines of what I liked doing as a hobby/wanted to learn more about. I couldn't (and can't) find a job in my field because everything that interested me relating to my field always called for someone with 2-5 years exp. As a fresh graduate I didn't have that exp. I have a couple months exp from an internship. The same problem still applies to me to this day. Not only that but I can't say I'm extremely happy about my degree. It's what I thought I wanted to do and maybe the fact that I can't find a job in the industry just makes me hate it even more. I am very demotivated. The interviews I've gotten relating to my industry, they always found someone better and with more exp and I am in an endless loop of disappointment and discouragement. I have been a very pessimistic person since I was around 14 y/o and have become depressed more and more as years rolled by. At first I thought it was just a teenage phase but I soon found out this is no ""teenage blues"". I have periods of time where I get major depression and think about suicide very often. I am very scared of death so I never thought I'd actually commit suicide. This year is actually the first year I actually looked up ways to commit suicide in the most painless/quick way because I really wanted to just end it. 

(BTW, in case you think this may be valuable information, I don't have many problems with my family. We are middle class, maybe a tad bit below it but we get by. They love me, and I love them, however they are not always supportive of my emotional status. I think depression is not ""real"" to them, and I know some people must wonder if you are privileged to have a roof over your head, food to eat and a family that loves you, HOW could you be depressed? To that I say that you have to keep in mind that not everyone is the same in the head. I am super a sensitive deep down even though I try to show that I'm not. Again, I am pessimistic and have been for a very long time. I am an introvert who is often shy and awkward and it's hard for me to open up to people. I have no one to talk to about my emotional status except one or two people.)

I usually try to stuff my depression at the back of my mind and drown it out with things like games but as I got older and reality came closer and closer, the depression as been slipping out and making its way out to punch me in the gut. The workplace situation made the depression a lot worse than it was and brought it out more often than not. I had a period of time (around Dec to March) where I would go home after work and lock myself in the bathroom and just cry once I got home. Sometimes I couldn't hold my tears and actually cried in the car ride from work. I am someone who is very troubled by being yelled at or blamed for things that aren't even my fault, but now I've somewhat become hardened at the bullshit that happens at where I work right now. Even giving some words of encouragement to trainees after they've been blamed or yelled at. This doesn't mean I'm not sad and mad at myself for still being there. Fuck, even now when I think about it I want to cry. It was something to do while I tried looking for another job so i wasn't just sitting at home all the time.

You must be wondering why I'm still working a minimum wage job when I have a degree. ""Are you not trying hard enough?"" Probably. Like I said, I've been rejected so many times it's very demotivating. Am I weak-willed? Maybe. I haven't completely given up but I'm at some breaking points here. Even finding other jobs that aren't relating to my degree are hard because they're always turned off at the idea that I can't start right away (having to give a two weeks notice and all). What kind of bullshit is that?

All in all... I am sad at my position in life right now and rather than depressed at this time, I feel more angry at all the bullshit and bullying I get at work that has been ongoing since the very beginning. It has impacted my mood a lot. I dread going to work and they don't respect my availability. It is super draining to be there physically, mentally and emotionally. I have periods of time that last over a couple of months were either I can't fall asleep and if I do it's as you would image.. hard to get up after getting 30 mins-1 hour of sleep. If I have the day off I would sleep for like 12 hours and wake up wanting to go back to sleep or just not getting out of bed in general just because I don't want to do anything as I wake up apathetic. I eat in smaller portions than I used to, I lost my appetite in general but only eat because my body says I need to. I lost joy in what I liked to do on my days off and kind of just waste it by watching videos on youtube in my room. 

So my question is... as the title asks. Should I quit? I don't have another job lined up but I have enough money saved up to pay my bills and stuff for a little over a year assuming I don't buy much (which I rarely do). I won't get kicked out of my home, probably just looked down upon for being jobless. I am going to try something new that is something I want to do; it may or may not earn me money (will take a couple months to see results), while also looking for new job opportunities so it's not like I'm going to be doing absolutely nothing. I don't want to think I'm worthless and this is all I can do in life. I feel like I can do better if I just have time to recover my mental state. I feel like I don't deserve to be treated this way at work and they are taking advantage of me because of my natural kindness. 

If you made it this far and read through everything, thank you. I know it was a very long rant but this is a serious issue to me as you can see from how much I typed about this.. I need some opinions because the mistreatment is starting to hit me hard again. Please let me know what you think and any personal stories/words of encouragement. Sorry for typos/grammatical/punctuation errors. I hope you understand what I mean.

TL;DR
.
.

I'm being mistreated and bullied at work (fast-food woo ho...) and often blamed for things out of my control and for the faults of others. Even with explanation and proof, I get blamed. This is on a daily basis. I am naturally kind and hardworking and because of this I feel like they find it easier to bully me. Today one of the managers even asked me ""when are you going to do your job properly?"" TWICE. I work harder than 80% of my co-workers for a minimum wage dead-end job and rarely get appreciated. The managers and owner of the shop seem to have a special hate for me as it seems they pick on me out of everyone the most. Been at it for a year and a year too long. I suffer from depression that I usually keep at the back of my mind but sometimes it resurfaces; the fact that I get mistreated at work doesn't help. I actually have a degree (graduated last year) but its hard for me to find a job because of the exp they want in applicants are 2-5 years exp. I don't have that and wonder how I can get that if no one is willing to hire someone at entry level positions. -_-

I'm a very demotivated person and sometimes enough is enough. My family doesn't support me quitting because I don't have another job lined up and they don't believe depression is ""real"". Should I quit? I dread going to work and it is super draining to be there physically, mentally and emotionally. Working here has taken a toll on my mental health that is creeping up to my physical health slowly but surely. I won't get kicked out of my home, just looked down upon for being jobless. I don't want to think I'm worthless and this is all I can do in life and I have enough money saved up to pay my bills and stuff for a little over a year. I am going to try something new that is something I want to do; it may or may not earn me money (will take a couple months to see results), while also looking for new job opportunities so it's not like I'm going to be doing absolutely nothing.

512n9w,3,2016-09-04,My Story - 1st Reddit Post,Jemalias,StopGaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopGaming/comments/512n9w/my_story_1st_reddit_post/,"Hi.

This is my 1st post to Reddit.

I'm going to admit something I've known for a long time: That I have an addiction.

During college, gaming consumed me. I failed classes and lost friends because I how much I played. I finally made the decision last year to quit gaming. I sold my Xbox and my desktop.

I wish I could say I never looked back, but that's just not the case. My addiction just morphed into different form: videos. The same destructive patterns of behavior I saw with gaming just shifted to Internet content, in general.

In some ways I feel like I am back to square one. Gaming, I was able to compartmentalize from other aspects of my life. But how do you beat an addiction to something that you use to socialize, to work, and to organize? My addiction is all around me now. No matter what I do professionally, I am almost certainly going to need to use computers. Plus, if I want to have relationships with people my own age, I need technology to certain extent. Even now, I am reaching out and getting help for these problems over the Internet. The irony of this is not lost on me.

I've been graduated for several months now. I've been working an pretty nice internship but it doesn’t pay that well and my time’s almost up there. Whenever I have spare time, it’s spent doing pointless shit on the Internet when I should be looking for a new gig. I’m terrified that it’ll be just like six years ago, with me living with my deranged mother and no meaningful job to speak of.

The fact is, I’m not going to be able to get a job if I don’t beat this addiction- but how? I’ve tried searching for a support group for the past few months, but I can’t find anything to speak of. I’m seeing a therapist, which is great for general mental/emotional issues, but he doesn’t have experience with these sorts of problems. The fact that society doesn’t take these kinds of things seriously also doesn’t help.

**TL;DR** - *Overcoming my gaming addiction led to an Internet addiction, which is much harder for me to manage. How can I strike a balance between use and abuse, given the fact that, historically, my self-control with anything digital is almost zero?*

I am a male, 18years old and currently im around 45kg(severly under weight), if i lose anymore weight i think ill turn to a pile of skeletons..

Any advise would be greatly appriciated!"
513hhy,2,2016-09-04,Having trouble deciding which shoes to buy for university,koipen,malefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/513hhy/having_trouble_deciding_which_shoes_to_buy_for/,"Hey

I'm starting in the University of Cambridge this fall and need help constructing a shoe wardrobe. I've structured this post under ""haves"", ""needs"" and ""ideas"" which I hope will be the most useful.

***Haves*** - shoes that I own

* A torn-down pair of Stan Smith's - the upper is removed from the sole about 5 inches down the side of the right shoe. Generally super ragged  and already a bit difficult to use; been holding them together with Duct tape for this summer. Probably need to part with these :(

* A pair of Brown long-wing Derbies. Bought these a couple of years back, not very high quality. Unsure whether these are welted or not - stitching on the bottom would suggest yes but it might be cosmetic. Leather still looks okay-ish after roughly 2 years of occasional use; a coat of polish will probably make these look usable.

* A bunch of practical shoes; athletic sneakers, espradillas, flip-flops; no need to worry about practicality for the most part.

***Needs*** - what kind of situations I need shoes for

* Everyday life - going to lectures and supervisions, conducting business in the city etc. I travel by bike most of the time. Not sure how cold and wet it gets in Cambridge in winters but I'd assume a fair bit.

* Semi-formal events - formal dinners. My college has a particularly lax policy on dress code so I don't think I need to worry about them, but I might need something for more formal - read suit and tie - dinners elsewhere.

*  Banking spring weeks and internship interviews - not a common occurrence but probably should be prepared for this as well.

***Ideas***

* A pair of [black Oxfords](http://www.bexley.com/Bexley/en/p/dress_shoes/brindisi/sale?coloris=chataigne) and a pair of [Brown boots](http://www.bexley.com/Bexley/en/p/dress_shoes/enfieldgommecountry/sale-boots_shoes?coloris=chocolat) from Bexley, and a pair of grey or white sneakers. Bexley is one of the few good shoe makers I can afford and I figured that this combo would leave me prepared for most situations.
(i.e. sneakers most of the time, Derby longwings if I feel like going a bit fancier, Oxfords for formal events and Boots for winter)
* Same as above, but instead of sneakers [some form](http://www.bexley.com/Bexley/en/p/dress_shoes/wembleyclassic/loafers?coloris=noir) of loafers? I've heard that loafers are great for an inbetween alternative for sneakers that can also pass in better occasions. Not sure how comfortable I'd be wearing loafers day-to-day though.

* Are black oxfords the best option or should I instead focus on a more versatile pair I could use outside strictly formal contexts? Say, [chestnut oxfords](http://www.bexley.com/Bexley/en/p/dress_shoes/stresaii?coloris=chataigne) or something else? Are black oxfords too formal to wear with chinoes / shirt / sweater for every-day wear or in conferences?

***

Any and all advice is welcomed; I probably need to pull the trigger and order within the next few days.

So far I do not have much success in getting an interview and I feel like visa sponsorship is the biggest obstacle for my applications.

I plan to work in the US after graduation but it seems that my choices are limited to big companies due to the visa sponsorship problem.

One option I have considered is to apply for multinational companies in other countries first and apply for relocation to the US one year later. However, I am not sure what countries have a higher chance of success for the software engineering industry.

If you happen to know what countries are good for the relocation option mentioned above or you know other ways to increase our chances of getting a H1-B visa sponsorship for non-US citizens, please let me know.

EDIT: Follow-up question. I would like to be a permanent resident in the US after working years there so I am trying to plan my career path before graduation. What options do you recommend me?

Thank you very much in advance."

I was staying in the city we both go to school in for an internship, while she had an internship in San Francisco. Previously, I thought we had a perfect relationship, we never had any bad fights, she never had any complaints or wanted to change how we were doing things, and we even talked about getting married after we graduate.

A week after she gets to SF, she texts me saying she wants to go on a break. I reluctantly agree. A week after that, she facetimes me to break up with me, saying that she can't commit to anything right now, which is a total 180 from what we were talking about even the night before she left. 

She says she still wants to be good friends with me, and hang out, but without any of the romantic aspects. I've known her since high school and we were very close friends before things developed into a relationship. I was close to her family and she was very close to mine, coming to Thanksgiving dinners and Christmas mornings and my sister's wedding.

I was devastated, and it took me most of the rest of the summer to get over it. I was finally feeling better, but at college we live in rooms that are right next door to each other, so I saw her on move-in day, and we share a class together, so I have to see her at least twice a week, and a lot of those bad feelings came back.

The second week of school she texts me saying she's seeing someone else and she wanted to tell me before I found out through facebook, which I appreciated. Still, seeing a picture of her with this other guy made me feel terrible. I started going to the counseling center on campus (I had mild depression even before breaking up) which has helped, but it's still been hard.

On top of that, we were all in one big friend group with other people, so a lot of things they do she'd go to as well, and another one of my good friends is her roommate.

A part of me hopes that we'd get back together because everything was so perfect, but every day I'm getting more resentful and a little angry. I don't think I should have to stay friends with someone who dumped me without warning like that, but it's hard to avoid contact due to our living and school situation.

I don't want to be an asshole, but I feel like I should cut things off. Is that the right move? How do I handle interactions with her when I have to see her in the hallway/in class?

### Hosted in Dodoma, Tanzania
**A smaller amount of African nations will be addressed due to the recent disaster putting strain on Japan**

In place of the usually massive TICAD summits, Japan will be holding personal talks with select African nations to continue the development and advancement of the African continent. This will still be known as the seventh TICAD summit, just at a smaller scale, then the conferences will return to the schedule proposed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldroleplay/comments/510qph/diplomacy_the_tokyo_international_conference_of/).

The nations that will be addressed at this TICAD summit include:

   - Republic of Djibouti
   - Kingdom of Morocco
   - Republic of Ghana
   - Republic of Côte d'Ivoire
   - United Republic of Tanzania
   - Republic of Mozambique
   - Republic of Namibia

Once again, only some African nations will be addressed until Japan has officially recovered, then we will return to our normal practices and tackle the entire continent together. _This comes after decades of TICAD summits and cooperation with Africa, and also follows the last TICAD summit in which Japan committed billions of dollars._

## Djibouti

Djibouti is a nation plagued with environmental hardships and little economic diversity, but that shall change now. Japan's commitments to the nation of Djibouti will follow four main points: _economic diversity, natural protection and tourism, agriculture, and education reform, and infrastructure._

**Economic Diversity:** Right now, the Republic of Djibouti faces many challenges, some of which can be traced back to their economic portfolio. The majority of Djibouti's jobs and business come from the services sector, and the rest of the market is left stagnant as a result. Japan plans to help Djibouti create more variety in their economy, thus creating more jobs, a more stable condition, and boost their GDP growth. The State of will help the nation from the Horn of Africa accomplish these goals in the following ways.

   &gt; $400 million USD from Japan

**Environmental Protection, Safety, and Tourism:** Djibouti is a land with many environmental wonders and is a hotspot for endangered flora and fauna, and as such if the nation were to monopolize on this fact, it could help solve the unemployment rate and promote the protection of the important natural wonders of the nation. Japan has partnered with the International Ecotourism Society, the oldest, largest, and most experienced organization in this regard, to help Djibouti utilize their environmental hotspots in both a responsible and profitable way.

   &gt; $150 million USD from Japan and $150 million USD from TIES along with managerial and supervisory support to get workers and set up infrastructure.

**Industry Sector - Agriculture:** Djibouti has the great potential to tap into their agriculture sector, but with their lack of rainfall and flash flooding, it is understandably difficult. This is why Japan pledges to work with the International Fund for Agricultural Development, an agency from the United Nations, to help jump-start sustainable and productive agricultural progress. This means the construction of greenhouses for domestic and foreign use, along with the placement of more farm lands for the production of sustainable crops without a need for much water such as amaranth, southern peas (that also fix nitrogen, will will improve the soil for other crops), nopale cactus, Jerusalem artichoke, and more, along with training for employment at these locations.

   &gt; $550 million USD from Japan, and $800 million USD from the IFAD.

**Infrastructure:** Japan will put money towards the creation of new infrastructure system based on anti-earthquake protection, something Japan is particularly good at, along with the construction of new arroyos and flood deposits.

   &gt; $786 million from Japan along with volunteer workers from Japan and organizations.

---

## Morocco

Japan's commitment to Moroccan aid will focus on three main issues: _energy, education, trade, and poverty_. The problems that Morocco currently faces all contribute to the continuation of the other problems.

**Trade:** Currently, Morocco does not have enough foreign currency to afford imports and avoid debt. This exacerbates already massive problems, with the nation receiving most of its energy supply from elsewhere. Japan will increase its trade relationship with Morocco by establishing a free-trade agreement, lowering tariffs, and investing capital into the government and a low interest rate to give Morocco a greater chance to grow. We also ask that France, as Morocco's most prominent trade partner, put in place similar efforts so that North African nations has the ability to receive more imports without falling into great debt.

**Energy:** Currently, the vast majority of Morocco's energy supply is foreign, up to 91%, and the domestic energy production market is just being tapped into. Japan will help Morocco produce more domestic energy in an attempt to both diversify and solidify energy security. Morocco has showed great interest as of late in their hydro-power that is only just being tapped into, and with Japan's history and strong track-record of implementing hydro-power with the most minimal environmental effect and the best output, from our own tidal barrage, to helping the Republic of India implement their hydroelectric reform, and more, we will help Morocco to construct more hydro-electric facilities, working with the nation's Office National de l'Electricité et de l'Eau Potable (ONEE) to build more stations. Private Japanese companies have also pledged to help Morocco construct more wind and solar power. Morocco already implemented more renewable energy sources in 2016, and this renewed effort will add vastly to the domestic energy supply of the nation.

   &gt; $700 million USD from the government of Japan towards hydro-electric power, $600 million USD from Japan Renewable Energy Co., Ltd. and $300 million USD from Japan Renewable Energy Foundation, both towards solar and wind energy.

**Education:** Morocco's illiteracy rate is too high, and the education system far too disjointed to support a nation. Education is at the heart of a nation's development, and as such Japan will invest in reforming Morocco's education system. We will help provide textbooks, supplies, after school activities, and the construction of more schools, along with helping to set up special programs for energy and communications.

   &gt; $300 million USD from Japan and $100 million USD from the Global Partnership for Education.

---

## Ghana

Japan wishes to expand its relationship with Ghana and become productive partners for the betterment of the West African nation and the continent as a whole. As one of the most peaceful nations, with relatively high literacy levels, we believe Ghana to be both a political, and cultural guide for Africa, being that they were also the first independent former colony in Africa. Japan extends this helpful hand with a focus on: _education, health, and access to clean drinking water._

**Education:** Japan will offer millions in an partnership with the The Global Partnership for Education and Education International to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of Ghana's education system, as well as to offer programs focusing on business and energy, and internships in Japan and with Japanese companies. 

   &gt; $100 million USD from Japan, $50 million from both GPfE and EI as well as workers, staff, and supervisory support.

**Health and Access to Food and Water:** Japan's other support for Ghana comes in the form of medical and foodstuff support. Japan will invest in Ghana's medical and health, along with food and water services to build more reliable water pipes and pumps, water sanitation centers, and clinics in the north of the nation which desperately needs it, along with a new hospital in Ghana's most populous city, Accra. All of this with support from the World Health Organization and the NGO Water.org.

   &gt; $300 million USD from Japan, $100 million from WHO, and $35 million from Water.org along with volunteers from both.

---

## Ivory Coast

The Ivory Coast is a special nation with a rich culture and varied history, and Japan is excited to begin a new chapter in relations with the West African nation. We will be focusing on the following: _education, agriculture, environmental protection, health, water and sanitation._

**Education:** Japan will be investing in the Ivory Coast's education reform to improve the quality of teaching and learning for the children and young adults, and to improve literacy rates. Japan will work with two previously mentioned organizations once again for this.

   &gt; $150 million USD from Japan, $50 million from both GPfE and EI as well as workers, staff, and supervisory support.

**Agriculture:** The people of the Ivory Coast often find it hard enough to produce food for their own families, let alone for national and international markets, and as such Japan will help Côte d’Ivoire in placing new greenhouses and small farms in areas that will not affect the environment of the bio-diverse nation. This also means an investment in sustainable crops that do not require much space or water in order to be fruitful and profitable. 

   &gt; $525 million USD from Japan

**The Environment:** The vast biodiversity located in the Ivory Coasts shores, lakes, and forests must be protected, and can even offer financial gain to the nation. Japan will be working once more with the International Ecotourism Society to help the Ivory Coast stop deforesation without derailing their economy, and replace it with an active and profitable ecotourism sector. The other Japanese investments in the nation will also help to off-set the losses from the slowing down of deforestation.

**Health and Foodstuffs:** While Japan's massive contribution to the domestic agricultural sector in particular will help immensely to food shortages, water is another matter. Japan will help the Ivory Coast stop the pollution of its water, established new water pipelines and pumps, and construct new water sanitation centers to provide water to the people of the nation. This will be in association with previously mentioned organizations. In terms of medicinal health, Japan will also help construct clinics and health safety initiatives, along with support from international organizations like WHO and Doctors Without Borders.

   &gt; $550 million USD from Japan, $100 million from WHO, and volunteers from DWB

---

## Tanzania &amp; Mozambique

Both Tanzania and Mozambique are beautiful countries with many opportunities for expansion and growth. With great potential in agriculture, biofuels, textiles, and more it is obvious to see the areas of growth to be capitalized on, and Japan wishes to help in those sectors, and more. We recognize the wrong doings of many corporations in lying to the people of Mozambique and Tanzania in regards to biofuel production, and wish to lend a helping hand where these scandalous companies refused to.

**Education:** Both nations will each be given million to construct new school, particularly in the farmlands and rural areas, equipped with textbooks and supplies readily available.

   &gt; $400 million USD to both nations from Japan, and $25 million USD from both GPfE and EI to each nation as well.

**Health and Food Services:** Japan, WHO, Water.org, and UNICEF will contribute even more money to the establishment of local markets, water pipelines, pumps, sanitation centers, and more for the people of both nations. This, along with the construction of a new major hospital in the most populous cities of both countries, and clinics and aid centers in the more rural regions.

   &gt; $800 million for both nations from Japan, with volunteers, assistance, workers, and a cumulative $450 million USD from the assisting organizations.

**Food Services:** Japan will contribute to changing the two nation's policy on domestic production by funding the construction of new farmlands that do not contribute to deforestation, with good practices, along with the development of more staple foods and greenhouses to produce them on a wider scale. This will be primarily sold domestically to solve hunger issues.

   &gt; $475 million USD from Japan

**Biofuel Production:** Japan will fund the increased production and research of cane and jatropha biofuel, while simultaneously increasing domestic agriculture as mentioned above so the food vs. fuel debate will be null.

   &gt; $600 million USD from Japan

**Energy:** Japan will help construct energy sources for the two nations, focusing on hydro-power, followed by wind, and then by solar. We will construct 7MW off-shore turbines for both nations, and contribute to the development of wind and solar farms.

   &gt; $600 million USD from Japan with $420 million from various organizations.

---

## Namibia

Japan wishes to assist the Namibian people and provide a reliable source of a food, and create places for people to find work that matches their education. We also intend to help provide the nation with improved infrastructure and methods of halting desertification.

**Education:** Japan will contribute to the Namibian government to reform their educational system, providing them with more supplies, textbooks, well-trained teachers, and more specific teaching styles that lend to vocational research and address the problems Namibia faces today. We will also open working opportunities for the people of Namibia in Japan companies.

   &gt; $600 million USD from Japan

**Infrastructure - Water Access:** We will invest millions in improving infrastructure in the nation, creating more roads, water pipelines, water pumps, and sanitation centers for clean water. These roads will allow rural areas to integrate more with the rest of the nation.

   &gt; $820 million USD from Japan

**Desertification Prevention:** Japan will provide the people of Namibia with new methods of preventing and stopping the desertification of their land, eventually allowing them to farm more, and lessening the problem of hunger. We will send researchers to work with Namibia, and supply them with already known methods that rural Namibians are unaware of.

   &gt; $400 million USD from Japan

**Health Services:** Japan will also contribute to the construction of clinics in more rural areas, equipped with trained and professional staff and medical supplies needed to combat Namibia-specific diseases.

   &gt; $660 million USD from Japan.

This smaller TICAD event was still incredibly successful in our opinion, and Japan cannot wait to begin these new relations, and then get back on schedule with our original Future of TICAD plans. This was a statement from Prime Minister Abe of Japan from the smaller TICAD summit that was held in Dodoma, Tanzania:

   &gt; _""We thank the people of Africa for their patience and acceptance of this special TICAD summit in the face of disaster back home. We also thank the cooperation of all the nations, NGOs, and companies that contributed to the betterment of African nations in partnership with Japan - these investments are obviously not immediate, but will be poured into these nations overtime. Thank you all.""_"
515n8l,53,2016-09-04,I feel like a big fraud. scared and thinking of dropping out.,feedbackplz2,medicalschool,https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/515n8l/i_feel_like_a_big_fraud_scared_and_thinking_of/,"Background: I'm an MSIII and increasingly feel like I'm in way over my head. I've been holding all this stuff in and just need to let it out somewhere. Even the most shameful embarrassing stuff. Just need someone to listen to me and help me.

Okay, let's start from the beginning like any good story. Since motherfucking *high school* I've been a bad student and struggled with grades, despite trying different study strategies etc. The first three years of college I similarly got below average grades, then shaped up and started improving. MCAT 30. Applied once to 50 schools, got shot down each time. Decided to do a respected post-bacc and applied again to 50 schools... got interviewed and accepted to exactly 1 MD school. Yep, count 'em, 1 MD school. Out of 50 applications.

At this point you're thinking to yourself *he sounds subpar already, this isn't going to end well*. But hold on to your pants because the roller coaster is just beginning.

I failed 2 classes during my preclinical years due to a combination of personal issues and bad study habits. After the second failure I had a Come to Jesus moment where I realized if I fucked up again I'd be out of med school, out of my life dream. I faced a fork in the road... to improve by really starting anew and changing the way I look at / study for medicine, **or** to improve using cheap tricks like memorizing random facts and buzzwords.

I chose the cheap tricks. I started doing better on tests simply due to a combination of being able to guess high yield questions correctly, connecting buzzwords with options even though I didn't understand what the fuck they meant, and generally being lucky.

Then began MSIII. I am now 8 months into my rotations and have passed using the same rotten foundational skills and a combination of being a clever charlatan and charming people to get good evals. Example: I passed my internal medicine rotation despite not knowing how to auscultate the heart even though I practiced so much futilely (hell, to this day I have not heard an abnormal heart sound). In the end, I would just go through the motions, hear random bubbling sounds and write that down as ""regular rate and rhythm""; sometimes I felt guilty at lying like this, and would ask my interns if they heard anything. If they did I would say ""oh yeah I heard that too"".

I have a good personality and very charming demeanor and this is how I got soaring evals despite being more ignorant than a premed. I still suck balls when it comes to basic things like auscultating, central lines, understanding fundamental disease processes, fuck... even knowing what normal saline does. Things an MSI should know.

I love the concept of medicine and love being in the hospital. But I feel like I built a philosophical mindset that rests on a rotten, unsustainable foundation and it's too late to change now that I'm almost done with core rotations. This isn't just imposter syndrome. This is a guy who doesn't know his most basic science and clinical skills and has somehow blithely fumbled his way through med school anyway.

This weekend I did some soul searching and realized I'm going to kill patients as an intern if I keep this up. Is there any point trying to start afresh and strengthen my weak points (ie everything) at this stage?

It's hard to describe what I'm feeling... imagine being in a car that keeps speeding up little by little and you can't brake. For some time you can ignore the problem but eventually that car is getting unruly, going 90mph, and you're having to wildly swerve narrowly out of harm's way every few seconds. Eventually you know you'll crash.

Am I crazy to consider dropping out? I just feel like I got in as a fraud, a guy with a below average GPA/MCAT barely getting into an MD school by the skin of his teeth. And I'm afraid I just cannot compete with my more cognitively-able peers.

**TL;DR: From the beginning I've been a subpar student with terrible study habits and severe deficiencies but somehow have made it to the end of MSIII. And things are getting out of control. I love medicine but should I eject, for my own well-being and that of future patients?**"

I understand/read French, usually need people to speak slowly and clearly to understand better though, he spoke very low and quick and I wouldn't understand so he just defaulted to his English which was enough for us to communicate although with plenty of repetitions. 

I wrote this clearly to the host in my message stating that I'd be spending most of my time either contacting or visiting apartments, I feel like there's no reason for this to be misunderstood because he could have translated anything since it was text. If I'm combing through online ads and calling places yeah I'm going to be spending some time in the room. The place was clean, quiet, and as advertised so I left him a short nice review. Overall I felt fine there, but took extra care to be quiet and clean (the place was spotless). I spent most of the nights on the phone with my girlfriend because that's just what we do when we're apart, tried not to be too loud (to her frustration). There was a couple (francophones as well) staying in the other room who seemed just as busy as me, I believe the girl had an internship in the city and the guy was visiting her. I only saw them once when I went up to their room to introduce myself because we had completely different schedules (they would be out when I got up and asleep/in their room when I got back).

So basically the host wrote that I wasn't social enough and left a bad impression. That I had ""holed myself up with the blinds and door closed"" along with how he felt I avoided him and the other guests possibly because of the different languages but that he hopes not. 

So first of all, the place was a basement with only a tiny window out of reach unless I hopped on the furniture lol. To me it seemed like we just had different schedules and didn't put any thought into it tbh. I literally went around the entire city in less then a week so I certainly wasn't holed up in the room, I mean I kept the room door closed when I left? I greeted the host plenty of times when we would bump into each other and he never mentioned anything. I brought a soap bar with me and he asked me to use the liquid soap he had in the bathroom instead because soap bars apparently cause build up (with a note by the sink which I thought was sort of passive aggressive but yeah didn't complain), when I saw him I said that it wasn't a problem and continued using the liquid soap despite that not being mentioned in the ad and me hating liquid soap. I had to leave after the first week because I found a place that wanted me to move in asap and I let him know without making a fuss over trying to get a refund (since I know that has nothing to do with him). I even folded the sheets when I left!! He wasn't around when I left so I also left him a small goodbye &amp; thank you message on the app which he didn't bother to reply to. I really felt that I had been courteous and thoughtful as a guest so I'm more than slightly annoyed at this. Even if I had literally not said a single word to him I feel like this shouldn't matter because it is my prerogative to do what I want while I am in the room I paid for, and it certainly isn't my job to keep the host company lol. Despite disagreeing I just don't see why it matters to him either as long as I left the room how I found it? Furthermore it's not like the host or other guests made any effort to interact with me either or that I rudely rebuffed any interactions, I mean I was the one who approached the other guests to introduce myself! Actually looking back he didn't even make the effort to walk me around the place to show me around, isn't that just standard routine for a host? I had to go up to him in his room to ask for the wifi, ask where I should keep my food, etc!

Meanwhile the entire time I was shitting my pants thinking I wouldn't find an apartment in time (things looked bleak at first and a lot of my initial plans had fallen apart), if anyone here has ever been in this type of situation then you know what it's like, so sorry if hanging out in the living area is the last thing on my mind.

This ended up longer than I thought, but I wanted to type out the whole story. So I was thinking of writing something along the lines of, ""Sorry, but I certainly wasn't holed up or avoiding you. This was my first time staying at an Airbnb and I tried my best to be as thoughtful and courteous as possible. Looking back it felt like we just had different hours and to be honest I hadn't even put any thought into it. I spent most of my time contacting/visiting apartments along with exploring the city just like I had clearly stated to you in my first message."" I think this is the most simple and concise but I also want to add something like, ""furthermore you weren't around when I left so I took the time to leave you a small goodbye and thank you message which you didn't care to reply to, nor did you make any special effort to interact with me or even give a brief tour of the apartment so I'm not sure where the bad impression comes from."" I know the second part starts to get a bit of a more personal tone, but I don't want other hosts thinking I was just a dick without more information.

It sucks because I'm a student so it's not like I'll be visiting places often and this review is just gonna sit there and I really did make an effort to be a polite guest. What do you guys think about the whole thing?

516akb,6,2016-09-04,Can I enter into the construction management world with a degree in mechanical engineering and a previous internship at a GC?,scootzee,Construction,https://www.reddit.com/r/Construction/comments/516akb/can_i_enter_into_the_construction_management/,"Basically, as a senior, I am switching from CM to majoring in ME because I want to get into the technology sector and do R&amp;D work or product development. I'm just wrapping up a project engineering internship and can already tell that in terms of overall value of education and knowledge a degree in CM is almost worthless. I've learned more during my internship as a PE than I anticipate I will learn in the next two years of my CM program. I am letting my GC know about my path switch very soon and anticipate it will be received well albeit reluctantly. I am a cerebral guy and have a passion for learning math and science and at this point in my life engineering is for me.

My question, however, is this: Upon graduating with a degree in ME and if a job in my desired field is unavailable or if I decide the engineering sector isn't for me, is it possible for me to re-enter the construction field with a degree in mechanical engineering, an internship with a GC and some carpentry experience? I anticipate this option to be my fall back. I appreciate any responses!! Thank you. "

I am currently a Sophomore in Computer Science at Purdue University and I'm really struggling with the whole internship process. I've applied to a few companies recently but I'm worried I won't be good enough to get an internship. My first time programming was during my freshman year of college last year, and I've only really done assignments asked of me in school - none of my own projects. I've taken a course in Object Oriented Programming (in Java), a course in C, a course in C++ and a data structures/algorithms course, but that really is all I know. Can I still get a paid internship? What would you guys recommend that I do? We have a few career fairs coming up in the next two weeks, but I'm really bad at this Elevator Pitch thing. I dont really know how to start these conversations with recruiters. Any advice? "
516sb8,310,2016-09-04,[FR] Recently gave a hard next to my oneitis,bobbyskeight,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/516sb8/fr_recently_gave_a_hard_next_to_my_oneitis/,"First post here after nearly a year of lurking. A year ago I was three years deep in a relationship I thought would be my only one. Standard case of oneitis. We were doing long distance as we went to different universities and it was going as well as long distance can go. I ran across this sub and read into it. Naturally I was shocked and offended at what I read. There was no way that my girlfriend could be like the girls you guys described. I was sure that she loved me the same way that I loved her. I was wrong.

By the beginning of the next semester we were broken up. Looking back my biggest mistake was that I had made her my primary life goal. Whatever I did I'd be happy as long as I was with her. How naive I was to think that she might feel the same way. She had other ambitions she needed to follow and I can't blame her for that. We ended things on uncommonly good terms.

I had let the relationship be a defining factor in my life and I was left with a large space to fill. I feel lucky to have found this sub when I did. I knew the only way I could get over her was through radical self improvement. I hit the gym harder than I ever have before. I learned some game and stacked up a few plates so I routinely had my sex needs covered. Most importantly I learned how to make goals for myself then go out and fucking accomplish them. 

I moved across the country for the summer to take an internship and pursue my passion for whitewater kayaking. When I was out there something clicked in my head that mentally changed me from a boy to a man. It was the best summer of my life and it never would have happened if I stayed mentally sheltered in my previous relationship. I probably wouldn't even have had the balls to accept the offer and move.

Recently when I was home for a few days before going back to school I saw her. We caught up, had lunch, and went on a walk. There came a point when we ran out of small talk and there was a long silence. I could tell she was uncomfortable and still not totally over the break up. On the other hand I wasn't phased. I realized I didn't need her any more. Eventually she asked if there was anything else I wanted to talk about. I said there was things I've been thinking about but nothing I needed to say. More silence. Usually I had been the one to initiate ""relationship talk."" 

She had previously told me that she sees herself settling down with me in the future, but doesn't want to date now. Now I refuse to let her keep my emotional commitment while she goes out and fucks other guys. It doesn't work like that. As drove her home I told her that it seems like we've both been doing great without each other so there's no reason we should pretend that we'd get ever back together. Then the tears started. She was still at a loss for words as I dropped her off at home and drove away. I got an I still love you text later that night. I decided it'd be best not to respond.

I feel like a lot of guys here want the chance to show the girl that hurt them how far they have come. It is a bittersweet feeling. It is great to have that feeling of closure and validation that you've truly changed. Yet, it's still at the cost of breaking someone's heart that you used to hold dear. Unless your oneitis really fucked you over it's not something that you should take pleasure in.

Thank you TRP. Everything I do now is to follow my own goals. Nothing burdens my mind as I pursue my ambitions. You've helped me learn how to live life on my own terms and the sex I get because of it on the side is like the cherry on top. I feel stronger than I ever have before. My insecurities have vanished. I can do anything that I set my mind to. "
5170gl,2,2016-09-04,I will be here if you need me.,Vacvvm,nofriends,https://www.reddit.com/r/nofriends/comments/5170gl/i_will_be_here_if_you_need_me/,"I try to be a good person. I will help people out whenever I can. I love being there for people and being able to make their day better. I have some inner turmoil over whether or not I am actually a good person or if I just delude myself into thinking I am.    
  
I get worried that I only help people to make me seem like a better person to myself, to justify thinking that I am one. I try to be fair and kind to everyone, but what if I am only fooling myself?  
  
I have met people in my life that just seemed so fake. Yes, they seemed nice, but you could see through it as an act, that they were just humoring the situation. I am scared I am one of these people except everyone but me can see who I really am.  
  
I am basically friendless. I have one good friend who has an SO and a kid with another on the way, and then couple people that I meet to have drinks with. I am a mess about this. I try my best to be a good person, but if I were one, wouldn't I have people that cared about me like I do them?   
  
Anyone I reach out to ignores me. I can't figure out why. Am I obnoxious? Am I so boring? Do I really contribute nothing worthwhile enough to have people want me around? I like to learn things. I like discussion. I like to share nice things I think about people. I will admit when I am wrong. I try to make everyone have an enjoyable time doing whatever we are doing.  

I have really bad anxiety. Sometimes this doesn't allow me to be myself, so I seem really shut off/ bored/or boring. But it is only sometimes, and to make it worse it usually happens when someone does finally get back in touch with me after I asked to hangout. I think, ""Oh man, they want to hangout? No one wants to hang out with me. If they do they will just end up regretting it since everyone else does. Or, if it goes well I will just ruin the friendship another time."" I have gotten better at hiding it, I think, though. I think I am fun. I like who I am. I am always open to bettering myself. I wish people could just be honest in what they think of me. I have seen someone distancing themselves from me (it is a common enough occurrence)  and have intentionally pried into their reasons as to why, full well knowing it would be a faux pas, only to get transparent pleasantries and excuses. Which is reasonable if I put someone that is trying not to be close to me in a intimate spot. I didn't care that I was vulnerable. I just want to fix myself. I have never cared to be popular, or be in the spotlight. The small moments I have been, it is nice, but it is not something I seek at all. I just want people I meet/know to walk away thinking I was nice to talk to. That they had a good time sharing my company. It would be even nicer if I could have taught them something, or them pleased after I told them they taught me something.   
  
As much as I want those things, I cannot allow myself not to be me, though. I am very honest. I will not lie about anything, and the times I am forced to (socially, for some situation I cannot explain otherwise) you can see through the discomfort on my face.  I have been called blunt, but I try to be tactful at all times. This leads to me brushing people the wrong way sometimes. But I cannot think of a time where the people upset by this trait were people I cared for. As I said, I will willingly admit that I am wrong. I think it is really important for people to admit that they are. You cannot know everything. Not being able to admit you don't makes you fail as a human. People I remember writing me off as an asshole are people that don't share this sentiment. 

For nearly a year I have been depressed about this. I broke up with one of the best people that has ever been in my life because I felt I wasn't good enough/just would keep her down. I lost a group of friends when I started dating her because my ex was the out-going hub of the entire friend group. So, me being around made my ex sad (I am not sure of better word) and the times both my gf and I went to a gathering it made my ex very uncomfortable. So I stopped getting invites to things.. then I stopped getting responses when I would try to plan something. This made me depressed, that either my friends didn't like me, or they liked someone who they know treats people poorly better than me because she was more fun. For a couple months after that I tried reaching out to people and no one cared to talk to me. At this point it was hurting my relationship with my gf. I started to feel bad that I couldn't be the person she fell for. I was too depressed to be me. And the days I felt like myself I still would get pangs of chest pain because I knew that she should have someone that society felt contributed. (She convinced me to quit my terrible job because she thought that was what was destroying me. Which, it was, but not all like she thought. This was also good advice from her point of view because I had a LOT in savings from doing nothing but working at this job. So leaving to find a job to better my happiness was a good thing to do.) I was jobless and friendless and the fact that she wanted me, as twisted and sick as it is, made me I stop loving her. She deserved someone better, so I made that choice for her.   
  
I wanted to be better. I wanted to be someone she deserved. So I started trying to be a person. I went and got a real hairstyle (I use to just use clippers and do it myself.) I started running/biking again. (I have chronic hip pain from my old job, so it made me lose my favorite thing to do.) I got over my anxiety of going to a gym and signed up for one. I went an bought a new wardrobe because she always dressed so nice and I just wore running/work out attire. I enrolled in school, which is something I stopped when I went full-time at my job that had mandatory over time 2-3 hours a day. In school I started strong, I was ahead of everything, getting close with my professors and the head of the department so I could get connections for an internship.   
   
Then my anxiety hit me, hard. I couldn't finish my resume because I am a 25 year old with nothing worthwhile to say on paper. I lost the internship prospects, hurt my relations with my professors. That caused depression, my grades started to slip towards the end of the semester. My 4 A's fell to near F's and I was lucky enough to find some willpower thanks to a nice classmate I knew from an old job and rounded my grades to C's before the end.   
  
Even though things went well for awhile, it didn't matter. Nothing changed. No one cared. I ended things last November with her. I was motivated to better myself until April. I went to the Gym every other day, I ate healthy, I wasn't excited to be back in school, but I did it and took pride in doing so. But the pride in myself diminished to nothing. I still had no one to go have fun with. No one texted how I was doing. I even stopped getting likes/conversations on Tinder, which was my last resort for a quick pick me up. I am lonelier more than ever, and I have been without close people most of my life. I use to get on cams to flirt/make fleeting friends before. Or teach people English (which is something that brought me joy.) Now the only connection I feel with people throughout the day are the 5 or so upvotes I get on something. I use to be a lurker and only send messages when I saw people hurting or if they seemed like they were remarkable genuine people for something they said. I would just tell them I would be here to listen for the former case and that I appreciate them if it were the latter. I use to get conversations from those, but now nothing.  
  
It is as if the world if intentionally turning its back on me.  
  
Since April I have basically laid in bed. I still go run/bike and work out at home, but it is a fight with myself to do that. I browse reddit, read books, masturbate, play league, or just lay in bed and scream in my head about what is wrong with me.   
  
I don't know if anyone knows how truly unhappy I am. I don't know if they know about my situation and feel awkward/helpless about it, so they ignore it, or if I am really fooling people.  I don't want to be a burden so I don't talk about anything.  When my brother's girlfriend asked why I wasn't leaving for classes I told her I missed the deadline to enroll because I was depressed a friend of mine passed away. Really though, we were no longer friends because she was part of that old group. I would have loved to be friends with her. She was one of the very few people that genuinely seemed to be happy to see me the entire year.  I was especially torn up about losing someone that I use to call friend, and one that genuinely seemed to care about me (she cared about everyone. She was an amazing person) but even had that horrible thing not happened, I wouldn't have gotten out of my bed. Why couldn't the world have taken me instead?

I can't find any strength in myself. I don't know what to do.

51775b,2,2016-09-04,Getting a masters in software engineering or computer science to switch career directions... Major advice needed ASAP please!,ajp91,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/51775b/getting_a_masters_in_software_engineering_or/,"I have an undergrad in ""biomedical engineering"" and am looking to switch directions with a masters program. My undergrad was very broad (I feel like I'm half a biologist half an engineer). I first went the bio research direction, and started a PhD in biochemistry because I like it in theory, however one semester in I realized the chem/bio lab-work was not my forte. 

Since then I have been trying to figure out what I should do next, and can't find a field I am very passionate about. Some career directions I have considered that seem ok have been marketing, economics, compsci/software and manufacturing engineering. By process of elimination I ended up on programming, because I was pretty good at it in the few courses I took in my undergrad and it seems to be a safe choice job-wise. I still feel apprehensive about it though... 

So now comes the decision of whether to go with a compsci or a software engineering program for masters. I think software engineering would provide the benefit of being more versatile (allowing to possibly switch fields and take other engineering courses throughout the masters) whereas in compsci I would most likely end up strictly coding. However, the compsci program has the benefit of an internship option that would be very helpful.

I/21M have been going down the spiral hard and fast. The complete absence of any idea what to do or think of my future has lead me to turn to you again. I will try to keep it short.

Most of us started uni/college (again), and so did I, but for me it is different. I have failed to get the necessary credits for year 2 twice now. Iied to my parents about the second time because I wasn't only scared of the reactions but also the questions. I fucked up big. Very big.

I am stuck in limbo where I can't do much because my whole course is internship based for the second year and most classes have assignments and papers that have to be done and written in reference to my internship. I failed my internship twice and never got to do most of my assignments. I feel like I am getting dumber too and I am forgetting so much, it is like I am losing my own memory. I even forgot how old I was and had to recount from my birthdate.

I feel like the biggest failure for having to go through this the third time, hell I am surprised I have not been kicked out yet. It doesn't end here. I am having panic attacks and pain in my body and chest thinking about going to classes. Its 4am night right now and I spend last six hours with small attacks but many at a time. I want to just end the misery but I don't have the guts to do it. My debt is slowly getting bigger and I am losing hope in myself for being able to successfully accomplish anything.

I just don't know what to do anymore.

Thank you for reading. I am sorry for bothering you with this."

517l30,3,2016-09-04,How often are you interviewed by someone with more experince that you?,freework,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/517l30/how_often_are_you_interviewed_by_someone_with/,"When I first started iut with my professional programming career, whenever I did an interview, the interviewer always was more experienced than me. This situation made it easier for me to get a job, because the interviewer would understand what I'm saying.

Now, 10 years later, I experience the opposite. The last dozen or so interviews I've done have been condusted by what seem like people who are interns. I know there are people out there who are more knowledgable than me; I can go on youtube and watch a conference presentation and I can get a strong feeling that the person talking is much more experienced than me, they just aren't interviewing me for any jobs.

I feel like the biggest reason why I'm having so much problems finding a job is because less experienced developrs have a hard time understanding what I say when I answer questions. An experienced develoepr knows what I'm talking about, and a conversation can commence. If the person interviewing me has only 1 or 2 years of experience, they only know what they've read in blogs and college text books, and when I say something that they have never read about, they automatcally think I must be full of shit. I'm at a point in my career where all of my beliefs are based on my experience, everything taught in schools and written in blogs I've left behind.

Does anyone else feel this way? Is it easier to interview with someone who is more experienced, or less experienced?"

I've managed to save up a little over $4000 this summer and have secured another relatively high paying part time job for the school year. I plan to invest a large portion of that savings and as much income as I reasonably can. I've been reading up a little and I understand that it is best to invest early, with low fees, and the best bet is probably something that tracks an index. 

My plan was to invest in Vanguard's total market index fund (VTSMX). I have the minimum $3000 to get into the fund, and the fees are .16%. This seems like a safe bet, and my parents, who have always been pretty good with their money, have just moved their investments to Vanguard. I was looking around a bit more and noticed that Schwab also offers what appears to be the same fund (SWPPX) with .09% fees. Vanguard also offers the same fund for investors with $10000 (VTSAX) at .05% fees. Are all of these funds essentially the same thing? Is it a good idea for me to start my money at Schwab with the intention of moving it over to Vanguard when I qualify for the lower rate? If not, why?

I have also found Vanguards total stock market ETF (VTI). The fees are only .05% and there appears to be no minimum. I understand this is different from the index fund, but I don't quite understand why. Could somebody give me the essential information on the differences here please. Is there a reason that many people recommend VTSMX but I haven't read anything about VTI? 

If you think there's something better I should be doing with my money, I am open to all suggestions.

517n87,1,2016-09-04,CT- Minor Labor Laws loophole?,Leggo414,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/517n87/ct_minor_labor_laws_loophole/,"So I went through the whole application/interview process and landed a job at an arcade, which to me is a pretty sweet job, as I'm 15, and it pays nicely. However, on my first day of work, I was approached by my boss, telling me that he might not be allowed legally to hire a 15 year old, but since I am 3 months away from turning 16, he kindly offered to pay me off the books until I turn 16. I told him I'd look into the legality of hiring me, and I'd get back to him, and I did a bit of research. Technically, since an arcade is either considered ""retail"", or a ""recreational establishment"", I am not allowed to be employed until I am 16.

Now, Im a pretty legal-savvy person, so I started trying to look for some sort of loophole, to where I could work, but legally, and I think I found something interesting, but I wanted to run it by you guys.

So, from my research, I found that ""interning"" is a very gray area in terms of legality. If I work it out so that its a ""paid internship"", for my work experience benefit, not an employment, is it still subject to those types of labor laws.

I know asking you guys for loopholes is not the most ethical thing to do, but I mean its an arcade... not like a meat slaughterhouse, and I'll be legally allowed to work there in a few months anyways.

State is Connecticut, and if you have any other suggestions, please let me know.. Thanks."

However, after many years of of comprehensive although not-really-resume-material programming experience, I find that I really don't like doing projects, when I could instead be reading to *understand* everything a bit better. 

I really enjoy the productivity I have when the system is in my conceptual grasp. You could spend three days - or worse, three weeks - on a tricky bug arising from some subsystem you're using, or three hours learning about how that system worked in the first place. After my courses in algorithms, code planning &amp; testing, etc. my productivity and enjoyment has increased ten-fold. And I anticipate this to improve further as I learn more about OS, networking, compilers, databases, etc., where I'm currently reading.

The problem is it has no credibility to say ""understands X, Y and Z"" on a resume. Working on projects for me feels like a huge drag. I feel as if it is the most labor-intensive and indirect way to justify my knowledge when I could be doing something fresh, and in a more condensed manner. Is this common?

I've been assigned a daunting (at least to me) task.

The company develops applications that have a very computation heavy side to them. Some of these computations can take days. They have asked me to look into cloud computing to reduce these computation times. Specifically they mentioned Amazon's EC2, Google cloud platform, and Azure and also asked me to consider an in house solution.

I'm completely flustered. All my prior experience has been in web development (I've never deployed or set up any applications, just worked on existing ones). So my knowledge is strictly in programming/app development. When I researched into building my own cloud infrastructure it seemed way out of my league! When I looked at the services EC2/GCP/Azure it seemed a little bit friendlier. What I'm having trouble getting my head around are these questions, any resources or docs are greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance =). 

- How do I get machines in the cloud to start doing work (for example, I've seen the console interface for EC2, where i can log in with an account and 'start' an instance, but how do i work with that instance and get it to execute scripts/ run programs etc.. Furthermore, how can I do that programatically (instead of using a console).)

- How will the computation engine run on multiple machines. Is this just a matter of dividing input data and running the same program on multiple machines at the same time ? Is it dependent on the nature of the code ?

P.S Don't hesitate to tell me to read a 500 page book, I feel like this can be a great learning opportunity and I want to seize it."

It gets me away from home and allows me to make decisions on my own. Even though through the scholarships that I get we pay instate tuition each quarter with some extra money from the school because I took all the advanced classes in high school so I'm apparently smart enough for it, there's still some left to pay. The college is considered one of the most affordable in the country and has a good program for my degree. Out of the 4 times my tuition has needed to be payed, my parents payed once. The other 3 times were from a combination of the money I've saved and student loans taken out under my name. 

This past summer, I've come home to a household with no money, even for food and bills because my dad's been gambling all the money at the casino. He's the only one that works so he feels that it's his decision where it goes. My mother refuses to get a job because of her ""health issues"" (judging by the fact that she suddenly became diabetic and it was gone the moment she realized that we were giving her shit about eating sweets, most of her problems are fake) and she refuses to get on welfare because ""[she doesn't] want that label on [her]"". Due to the lack of money and the fact that I managed to save over $2000 in the bank, my parents mooched off me and I ended up paying for groceries, gas, and cigarettes because they refuse to stop or even slow down. (There's days we go hungry because the last $7 in their bank account went to another pack.) When I refuse to buy, I get screamed at until I cave in and buy 3 packs. I've taken to couponing to help keep the expenses down. Mom spends a good amount of money on doctor visits and the 4 strong, highly addictive, prescription painkillers she takes which she often puts before my sister's medications. Because she's gone without she's been having nightmares for a couple weeks now.

A few weeks ago we didn't have the money to pay the electric bill and so we stayed at my grandmother's house. My grandparents are enablers. ""Your dad wouldn't be so angry or spend all of his money at the casino if he could come home to a clean house."" So we cleaned indoors with no air circulation in the middle of a Texas summer. Except for my mother, who suddenly came down with a migraine and couldn't do any work (which was miraculously healed about an hour after everyone stopped cleaning). I was told to clean my room, which I worked on the whole time. My mother is a hoarder and doesn't like me throwing my old things away so a lot of clutter built up over the years. Both my mother and grandmother complain that I didn't do a damn thing. 

About an hour ago I got ganged up on by my mother and father for being a lazy selfish brat. They wholeheartedly believe that they do everything for the household. The fact that my bank account went from well over $2000 in checking alone to not even $150 in both my checking and savings accounts isn't enough proof as to what I've done for them this summer. They don't care. They think that because they make the car payments and pay my phone bill that I don't know anything about how to live on my own. They won't even let me try to drive in the city because they know I'll fail regardless and use that as an excuse to not let me do things on my own. I told them that I was planning on taking a paid internship with free housing next summer and even though ""I do nothing around the house"",  I need money to afford college and I don't have a lot of job experience they're totally against it. I'm in the wrong for not seeing them as the victims in every situation. My mother has admitted to checking out of my life 10 years ago but still stands strong on the 'I did my best to be a mother' point. Dad lost his job and doesn't pay his bills on time, but I'm the one who can't function in the real world.

TLDR: My parents are dicks and as ready as I am to get out but their sabotaging tactics are too strong."

We've been very happy with each other, but we've constantly been in a long distance relationship. We met at a convention this past winter break, and decided that even though we attended schools that were a 5-hour drive apart, we'd test out a relationship. 

Within the first month, things went much better than expected. We were able to visit each other about once every other week and that worked out fine for the spring term. Over the summer, I had an internship in London and we couldn't afford to see each other, so we spent the majority of the summer apart. We did get to visit for a few weeks when I returned, but right now I'm on a term abroad in Japan and I'll be returning in January to see him the next time.

I believe we've done a really good job at keeping up this constant long-distance relationship. We love each other and we care for each other even when we're on opposite sides of the planet. My parents really like him, and although his parents don't approve of a gay relationship, they're very pleasant with me and like me just the same. I've been really happy in our relationship and I could possibly see us getting married some time in the future.

However, I've had a pressing issue of sex come up recently. We've been sexually active for basically all the time we've been together. Whenever we see each other, we always schedule some time for sex just so we don't miss out on the opportunity. I've always had issues staying hard throughout sex, though, and recently, we've both had trouble finishing for lack of energy or maybe interest.

I realized the last time we had sex that if I imagined some of the guys I was previously attracted to before we were in a relationship, it was much easier to stay aroused than when I was imagining my boyfriend. I regretted the decision to think this though, because I feel completely sick and wrong for thinking of somebody else during sex. I found it revealing about myself that I felt I wasn't terribly sexually attracted to my boyfriend.

We both understand that sex is a small part of our relationship, but I feel that it has an important role in our dynamic as a couple. I don't want to bring this up with him (yet) but I'm struggling with how to deal with this in the meantime. In addition, since I've been away on exchange, one of my friends here, who I'm attracted to, has been toying around with the idea of having sex since we're both away from our boyfriends, and I'm starting to think this could be a fun change. My boyfriend and I are supposed to be in an open relationship this term while I'm abroad, but I know he's going to wait for me and I don't want to hurt him if I have fun over here. 

My boyfriend is really great and I would hate to have this issue tear us apart considering we care for each other this much. I'm really excited to see him in January already, but the thought of having sex with somebody I'm not that sexually attracted to is stressing me out.
  
  ---   
  
tl;dr been in a very long-distance relationship with my boyfriend for 9 months and even though we love each other a lot, I don't think I'm sexually attracted to him. I won't be seeing him for 4 months because I'm abroad and the thought of having sex with other guys is much more appealing. We're really happy in our relationship besides the sex so we wouldn't want to break up on this basis."

I have a question regarding patchmanagement/detection. I work as an intern for an ISP and they are looking to implement patch management. Specifically the detection of older patches, so it's intertwined with vulnerability management. We do not want automatic patching and an allround monitoring system is already in place. I have been looking at tools like Nessus, GFI languard, Nexpose and a solarwinds solution. These tools work fine with windows, linux and some cisco appliances.  The tricky part is that it also needs to scan more specific appliances like infoblox systems. Does anyone know if this is possible, or will we have to start coding outselves to recieve info from these systems? The goal of the solution is to produce reports so management knows what systems might be a liability. This might be hard if we start coding ourselves.

I am an engineering intern (not intern as in student but intern as in working towards professional licensing) and I am trying to keep all the professional things I learn neat and organized using OneNote. I am realizing just how unorganized I am and how much my mind mind needs organization to function. I'm becoming what I would call scatter brained because things mentally and digitally are so badly organized.

This realization has put me on the path to learning a system of organization but I just can't seem to get things locked down and the multitude of options/decisions is paralyzing me in moving forward. 

There are two types of notebooks I'm trying to create:

1. Knowledge based - This is where I will keep detailed notes of the things I learn as fundamentals, infrequent design/engineering issues that won't be reinforced repetitively, questions and answers section, troubleshooting for software used, etc.

2. Project Specific - This is where I will keep all the design specific information, files, etc. for a specific project. For example, which building codes were used when designing a storm drain, and any design specific deviations and reasons. I would also, like to have an ""at a glance sheet"" which would be one page of less detail design info for the project. 

I've tried to make these but have found that my categories are often redundant or too vague/specific to be useful, and it seems the more aware I become of being unorganized the more trouble I have overcoming the disorganization.

Any help/direction/advice you can offer will be greatly appreciated. Thanks in Advance."

During withdrawals, it’s important that you stay busy. I think having a goal, or something small to work on each day is really important. My brain was used to being entertained with THC all day, and even things I used to enjoy like reading felt like an uphill battle to enjoy again.   

**My Story**


   I realize I’ve now passed one year without weed. It seems impossible that I’m even writing this. I started smoking when I was 19, my sophomore year of college. I stopped when I was 22. I know compared to some people here that isn’t much time. I went from a ‘once a week with friends’ smoker to a ‘multiple times a day alone’ smoker within that time. It was really fun for about a year and a half. Then it became less fun, more filled with feelings of guilt and anxiety. Then, after an experience I explain below, it became not fun at all – simply something I did, because I was very unsure about my life path and didn’t know what else to do.  


--


   I quit three months after graduating college, and I was about to move home to live with my parents because I hadn’t secured a full time job yet. I have to admit, my biggest success factor in staying clean was that I moved away and lost all my contacts, and didn’t have a lot of friends. It kept me clean, but not very sane. I felt quite alone during this process.   

--


   Overall, I knew it wasn’t working. My life wasn’t moving in the direction I wanted it to, and I had to know if it was because the weed. My grades slipped toward the end of college. I had a smaller friend group, mostly comprised of stoners. I thought we were really great friends, until I didn’t smoke with them and it seemed like there was little to do or talk about. I had no interest in my career or where/when I was going to get a job. I had an internship at the time and figured I’d move home with my parents if it didn’t pan out to be a full time job. That’s exactly what happened. Smoking weed always led to self-fulfilling prophecies of self sabotage. When I was feeling uncertain (which was always), there was one thing I could count on, one thing that could ease my mind – “If this doesn’t work out, I’ll just smoke some weed and know that I could’ve done it if I tried harder”. I needed to know if I could do it. About 6 months before I quit, there was also a pretty intense experience where I was kicked off a plane at the Denver airport for passing out because I had eaten an entire chocolate weed bar (can’t let it go to waste! – ugh). That was definitely my dramatic “bottom”. I continued to smoke until August 2015, but every time I smoked after that I had anxiety and bad feelings.   

--


   To really seal in my need to quit, I like to look at my last week smoking. Leading up to quitting for good, I had 30 days sober, mostly because I was broke. My friends and coworkers knew I wasn’t smoking at the time to save money, and had planned a last hoorah before I moved away. On 8/15/2015 (yes, I remember the date. I wonder if I’ll always remember these dates. It shows how strong my connection was to letting go of the green.), I smoked with two coworkers. On the clock. Something I never thought I’d do. We took a break, left a few other people in charge for an hour, and went outside behind a fence and smoked. It felt dumb. Just, why am I here smoking with these kids on the clock? It felt like a new low, but I was flattered that they wanted to say goodbye in a meaningful way. On 8/19/2015, I had my apartment packed up. I drove back to campus to smoke with an old buddy and former dealer. We got super high, and sat at his pool with our feet in the water. I felt light headed, and it was so fucking hot outside (August in Texas), my nasal cavity felt like it was swelling up and the humidity was making it hard to breathe. I was definitely having a freak out in my head, caused by the weed. I was speaking slowly, acting dumb. I remember being frustrated with myself, like once again- what am I doing? Saying goodbye to a good friend by having a meaningless, dumb conversation that seems like a chore to get out of me? I wished I was sober. I wished I could joke and laugh and tell stories without this hindrance of being so stoned. In that moment, I realized weed was a handicap on my true personality, keeping me from connecting and sharing myself. I left that night feeling alone.   


--

   These two smoking experiences, combined with the previous 30 days I had sober, made me say goodbye for good. I had quit for a month, achieved the oh-so-coveted-low-tolerance, smoked with good friends, and it still wasn’t fun anymore. I knew the jig was up. The next morning, 8/20/2015, I threw away my pipe in the dumpster, left my sublease check and key on the counter, and drove home. The next few months of scattered employment and no friends were hard. I credit my parents for their support during this time. I also began seeing a therapist for anxiety and worked out some things. I finally found a full time job in November of 2015 and moved out of my parents house a couple of months ago. I still have days where I want to smoke. It isn’t always a conscious thought of “man I want to smoke right now”, but the empty, bored, anxious spaces of my life that I used to fill with smoking are now wide-open and I have to feel. I have to work through things. There is no escape.   

--


   Somewhat related note about sobriety- I also was a typical binge drinker in college. I say typical, because I never drank alone, and probably only drank 2-4 times a month, but when I did it was usually to the point of blackout. I decided to cut that out of my life too, out of fear it would escalate without the weed. I’m glad for that decision as well, but socializing and networking has definitely been hard without alcohol.   

--


   Out of fear of rambling like my stoner days, I’ll end it here. Thanks for reading this far, and thanks for coming to this sub to look inward and make a change. The fight is worth it!

A “friend” raped me at a party.  It changed my life forever.  When the drugs that he gave me started kicking in, he said he could see that I wasn’t feeling good and offered to help me lay down.  I was being raped over and over again just a few feet away from my friends.  No one came to save me.  When the drugs wore off the next morning, I came to with him still on top of me.  I was beyond confused.  He told me I wanted it and that I had said “No” to him too many times.  He actually tried to explain how his actions were justified.  Thinking about that drives me absolutely insane, as if once I understood it would all be okay.  


I didn’t speak for almost an entire day.  It wasn’t until the next day that I would put it all together.  
I was registering for classes at college, I was helped by a man who had initially came up behind me and touched my shoulder.  I couldn’t understand why in that moment I felt so overwhelmed.  He took me back to his office in the very back corner of the building.  He looked me up and down a few times and continued making me feel uncomfortable.  All I wanted was to sign up for classes and move on with my life, eager to put the past behind me.   Sitting in this man’s office I began to feel like the walls were closing in and I couldn’t breath.  Tears began rolling down my face.  I bolted out of the room and away from the threat of this man.  A couple people shouted, asking if I was okay.  But I didn’t stop till I got out to my car.

This was the first time I actually admitted to myself what had happened to me.  I didn’t know what to do.  I still couldn’t catch my breath, I was shaking and sweating and couldn’t think clearly.  It was obvious that I needed help.  I understand now I was experiencing a panic attack.

Realizing what had happened shook me to the core.  I phoned my father and was able to get out that I was coming over to tell him something.  Mentally realizing what happened and saying it out loud to someone else proved to be excruciatingly difficult.  He drove me to the ER.  I took a rape kit and had my injuries documented.  The drugs I was told had come out of my system, but the detective, who has been doing this for 30 years, assured me that it had been in my system.  She documented all of it, the tears, the bruises.  It’s taken years to not break down anymore when I see a bruise on my body.  

My father drove me to the police station after the ER.  That was another horrific experience, having these men laugh me out of there and telling me to go home.  I cannot express the rage that this experience caused.  I came for help but what I got was a lesson in great injustice and soon learned how common this was.  I have been very sensitive to injustice since.

I was so determined to become an LMRT and Medical assistant.  I worked during the day and went to class at night.  I carried on the best way I could.  But it wasn’t long before the panic attacks became more frequent and more intense.  I eventually had to quit my job because as much as I tried to move past the incident, it kept coming back, like it was happening to me at that moment. 

 I almost didn’t finish school because when I got to class, sometimes I couldn’t walk in.  I was in a class where I was the only girl and the rest were men.  Despite this I did finish and worked 6 months of unpaid, full-time, internship.  I was hired by the urgent care immediately after I finished.  I was so proud!  I had overcome so much to be where I felt I belonged.  

In less than a year of working there, I was pushed against the wall and touched inappropriately by a doctor.   I did nothing.  I was in shock.  When the doctor did that to me it caused the flashbacks to intensify.  The panic attacks became even more frequent and severe; I could no longer work with this person.  I told HR under threat of termination, they said it would stay between us.  It didn’t.  

HR called me back to let me know that they questioned the doctor and he said I had misinterpreted the situation.  The pain of that sting hurts me every time I think about it.  I quit that job to get away from him and took a new job at a different urgent care.  I had my fist panic attack a week after I started because him and I came face to face.  He wasn’t a patient, he was the new doctor.  Not only that but he worked out at my gym.  My gym had become my safe haven of sorts and was what I felt like was keeping me together. 

 I was scared but told HR about what had happened before with him and how I felt it had been mishandled.  They assured me I wouldn’t have to work with him and that they would schedule me around him.  But the schedules got mixed up, a lot.  And every time I saw him I lost it and was so inconsolable that I would have to go home or get someone to come get me because I would shake so bad I couldn’t drive.  I stayed for a little over a year before I had a complete breakdown. 

 I walked out of work one day and checked myself into the first of two psychiatric hospitals in a year.  I wasn’t able to hold down a steady job after that.  The medication I had been prescribed contributed to me gaining 20 in just a few months.  That was really hard for me to deal with, I had never been that big before and was uncomfortable in my new, expanded body.  I wasn’t used to the looks, comments, and judgments now being thrown my way.  It certainly didn’t help that I was in such a fragile state already.  I mean for me my life had just become so out of control and terrifying.  I no longer had my career, independence, body, engagement, or sanity.  I am still recovering from that.  


I have to learn who I am all over again.  She is so different to me.  She’s timid, reclusive- to the point of agoraphobia, not trusting, angry …so much anger.  Feeling out of control is such a scary place to be.  I had always prided myself on my grace but now it seems as if it’s been bled dry and only hostility remains. Even though she scares me I must get to know this new me so that I can understand and heal her. 

 It’s been years and I must focus on my healing every single day.  This incident has had an impact on every aspect of my life.  I work gigs when I can, practice yoga and meditation, journal, seek out joy, I still have to push myself out of the house but at least I’m taking that first step out of the door.  That’s not something I could say even just a few months ago.  

I have weaned myself off medication after some intense suicidal urges.  I have so far to go, so much to do and learn and that’s okay because I’m on my way. 

 I feel strong for the first time in a long time, I’ve missed this immensely.  I find it necessary to share my story as part of my healing process.  Giving my story actual words and then turning it loose, I’m hoping, will be extremely liberating.  I feel that because my story has so ingrained itself into my everyday life that I would always have to carry it.  I could never figure out how to let it go so I’m hoping this will help.  This is the first time I’ve ever written this, down.  It is, without a doubt, the most difficult thing I’ve ever had to write.  I hope this helps you know that you are not alone.  This is part of the process of regaining my life.  I must first regain my voice.  

I still struggle with rage and some days it’s all I can do to get out of bed.  I still cringe when someone touches me.  Even if it’s a girlfriend touching my arm, it still makes me jump.  I have tried to forgive the person and their transgressions against me.  I might even have to do it everyday for the rest of my life just to get through.  If that’s what it takes I will do it.   

I still don’t have the right answers for how to support myself but I have learned how incredibly passionate I am about metal health.  I deeply want to help others affected by it that are lost and scared like I was.  I want to be the hand to others that I needed so desperately.  What that translates to, I don’t know but I am heading in that direction.  And for right now that’s good enough for me.

51alqp,0,2016-09-05,Does lack of a CS degree matter if you have professional experience?,doteka,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/51alqp/does_lack_of_a_cs_degree_matter_if_you_have/,"As the title says; I wonder if this will be a large problem for me in the future.

Background: I have a BSc in International Business Administration  and an MSc in Business Information Systems. During the last months of the MSc I interned at an early stage startup. I have zero background in CS, but I have taught myself R, Python, HTML and CSS over the past year.

The position was initially meant to be purely data analytics. At some point I took initiative and started working on some simple additional features for their webapp as well. Most of these made it into production.

At the end of the internship I was given a job offer for a combined backend development/data analytics position, which I happily accepted. I suffer from a major case of imposter syndrome, but I figured my coworkers are better judges of my ability than me.

However, I am slightly worried about what comes next. Will other employers be willing to overlook my lack of CS background and give me a shot based on a single internship/job? Will this result in lower compensation? Any input is welcome."
51aoty,381,2016-09-05,"Just because you are an intern in a computer help center does not mean you are a ""computer person""",IThoughtISaved,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/51aoty/just_because_you_are_an_intern_in_a_computer_help/,"Hello there, first time poster, and English is not my first language, so I apologise if I make any mistakes.

Anyway, this is a story from my time working in a small business, doing all kinds of computer related work, but for the purpose of the story, you only need to know that we had a small computer help center. You could either call us when you had a problem, or simply walk into the front door, explain your problem, fill out a form, and let us take care of it.  
After working there for a bit, I was put in charge of two interns around my age. Now, most of the work we did in the help center was really simple, and the interns would always get the simplest stuff we had. Building a PC from parts we would give them/installing OS/missing drivers/removing viruses etc.

Basically anything an intern worked on was something a semi-techsavvy end user would be able to do themselves. I assumed that anyone applying for an internship in a computer help center would be able to do it without any help. Apparently I was wrong.

Just keep in mind that the conversation is translated to English from my native language, hence them having problems with English words. Words that were spoken in English are put in the """" quotes.  
&gt;Me: Ok, so what I need you to do is install all drivers that are needed, and check for updates of the ones that are already installed.

Immediately they tense up.
&gt;Intern1: Uh, drivers?  

&gt;Me: Yup, I know it sounds too easy, but don't worry there is no unusual or outdated hardware or software in there to trip you up, no suprising catch. In fact I am pretty sure the network drivers are already on this flash drive, so you can just install them and then download the rest without needing to use any other computer.

I put the flash drive in, and they hesitantly navigate to the Install directory on the flash drive, it has 3 files.

&gt;Intern1: Is this the thing we have to install?

&gt;Me: No, that is the Java installer.

&gt;Intern1: Oh, obviously it is this one!

&gt;Me(now a bit suprised):No, that is the .net installer, it's the one in the middle. It literally has ""Network"" in the name, do you not know what that means?

&gt;Intern1: No, we don't know alot of English.

Now I am absolutely sure these two are going to be hard to deal with, while there is a handful of sites that offer drivers, applications and tutorials in my language, most things simply cannot be found there, and you need to know atleast a bit of English to do anything but the most basic stuff.

&gt;Me: Oh, well install it, so we can move on.

A bit of fumbling through the English installer and a restart later.

&gt;Me: Ok, so you do know how to find out what drivers you need to install, right?

*silence*

&gt;Me: *sigh* Ok, go to the Device Manager.

Nothing. Even though Windows 7 is fully translated, and I used the translated term. They are looking at me like I came from Mars.

&gt;Me: Wait, neither of you know where the Device Manager is? Intern2, you were quiet the whole time, where would you look?

&gt;Intern2: I don't know, I'm not really a computer person.

After this I had to go outside for a bit of fresh air. The mind workings of a person that applies for an internship at a job that deals just with computers, without being a ""computer person"" are still completely foreign to me."

I had an in-person interview for an engineering internship position. It was a small company in Portugal, the interviewer was in his 60s. Things started going downwhill when he looked at my CV and noticed I had studied abroad in Brazil for a year. He asked me why I didn't want to stay there, I answered and one of the things I mentioned was that the market in our field had plummeted anyway due to the crisis and the business opportunities had dried up. 

The interviewer told me I didn't have any loyalty, he had 3 kids in my age range and knows how we operate. Young people nowadays just want easy things without putting any work and run away when things get difficult. Mind you, the position I was interviewing for had availability to move abroad to work in international projects as one of the pre-requisites, so I was expected to work outside of my country anyway. 

He went on a rant about how young people ruined our country with their laziness, they are unworthy employees and that's why we are going through a economic crisis. He said we needed more tough people like the Portuguese who were kicked out of our ex-colonies and came back ready to do real work in the 70s; not like this generation who only wants to sit behind a computer and do easy work (The position he was interviewing needed 3D modeling on a computer, of course).

Then, he complained that people should sacrifice for their country and stay during times of crisis. Things got more crazy and he said he despised refugees, they are cowards and, if he was Syrian, he would grab a gun a fight for his country like a man should do. He asked me what were my views on the refugee crisis, but cut me off before I could answer and said he bet I wanted them all to come to Europe, since we young people are so idealistic, don't understand anything about how the real world works and his kids were pro-refugees.

I feel like this was all a prank."

Should I try to learn German?,radioflyerCO,German,https://www.reddit.com/r/German/comments/51b4i3/i_need_advice_should_i_try_to_learn_german/,"So this is my first time posting.  I'm a senior in college and this past summer during my internship I developed a close friendship with another intern from Germany. He's slightly older than I am and has a full time job at a company in Hamburg.  He said if I could become at least proficient in German, he'd be willing to get me an interview with his boss, so I might be able to work in Germany (which having lived my whole life in the US would be spectacular).  However, I'm a little skeptical at the plausibility of this feat as I've heard German is very difficult to learn. So I have a couple questions: 1) would this even be possible/should I even try?  and 2) if it is possible, how much time would I need to devote to become proficient by say May 2017? Keep in mind I'm in my final year of college and have a full course load and part-time job, but I am motivated and could devote a reasonable amount of time.

Also, my friend said that he has a german friend that would like to improve his english. Should I take advantage of this and try to Skype with his friend and teach each other our native languages?"

I had originally figured that my GPA and class experience would help me out, particularly given that internships are intended to be entry-level work, but unless there was something else I did wrong last semester, I feel that I need to put together a set of code samples to be more competitive.

Anyway, my question now is, what is worth putting in a set of code samples for a portfolio? Most of my completed code consists of very simple programs for homework assignments, usually performing a small set of simple actions and outputting to the console. Are these kinds of programs worth listing as code samples, or should I aim for displaying more robust work?

Second part of this is the group final project for one of my CS classes last semester. I know these types of projects are definitely worth listing as code samples, but the one I participated in was... kind of a disaster. Due to a combination of inexperience, time pressure, and a group member being exceptionally difficult to work with, the program ended up being a disjointed, barely functional mess, with key features heavily jury-rigged or even dummied out, a messy, disorganized code base, and an even messier GitHub. Does the poor quality of the code overshadow the fact that we made it in the first place, or is it worth displaying with perhaps some sort of disclaimer admitting the poor quality and calling it a learning experience?

Thanks for any help."

After debating getting dreads for a while I decided to get crocheted dreads for the sake of convenience, namely getting over the awkward stages of dreads while still having to attend school and my internship. But I've found myself regretting getting crocheted dreads pretty quickly. I feel like they're falling apart in just a few days since there's loose hairs all over and my loctician told me that I wasn't allowed to wash my hair at all with these types of dreads (something I'm not in favor of). My loctician was also super vague and with her answers or would just straight up get annoyed at my questions so I'm at a bit of a loss at the moment.      

I still want to keep my dreads but was wondering if it's possible to let the crocheted dreads sorta transition into natural dreads. Will the new growth still dread naturally if I leave the crochet dreads? 
     
Any idea how intensive the damage to my hair is from this one session of crocheting? While it was being done I could hear so much hair ripping and it's made me a bit nervous.

Literally.,BookWyrm17,WrittenWyrm,https://www.reddit.com/r/WrittenWyrm/comments/51be1r/a_psychologist_has_to_defeat_his_patients_inner/,"Dr. Silverstone clicked his pen absentmindedly, trying to remember the name of his next client. It started with a M, or an H, but he couldn't quite remember which. Leaning forward, he pressed a button on his desk, and the intercom crackled to life. ""Who's appointment is next?""

A young, bouncy female voice answered, sounding ecstatic just being alive. ""The two o'clock is Mr. Shackleton, Doctor!""

With a grunt, he leaned back again, releasing the intercom button, and scribbled down the name. Apparently it wasn't an M *or* an H. Filling out the rest of the form, he paused at the last section.

*Reason for therapy: _________________*

Glancing up at the clock, Dr. Silverstone saw that it read 2:03. Shackleton was late. Leaving the last spot blank, he placed the pen and clipboard down, and was just about to reach for the intercom again when it turned on by itself. He could practically feel the smile through the intercom when she said, ""The two o'clock has arrived, Doctor!""

Frowning, he glared at the speaker that lay on his desk. She must be new. No one smiled for long when they worked next to him. 

He was about to stand up, when the door opened, and a small, rather disheveled man peered in. ""Is this the right place?""

Dr. Silverstone raised his eyebrows. ""There's only one office in this building, so unless you wanted to find an empty room to cry in, this is where you need to be."" He gestured to the red couch that lay in front of his desk, and rolled his own chair around, scooping up the clipboard as he went. 

Hesitantly, the man sat down on the edge of the couch, and folded his hands in front of him. For a brief moment, he was still, but then he started nervously tapping his shoe. Dr. Silverstone watched this with a skeptical eye, until the man noticed, and forced himself to stop

""Lie down, make yourself comfortable."" While the sentence was amiable enough, the doctors tone made it sound more like a threat. A grumpy threat. Glancing down at his clipboard, he took off his glasses. ""You are... Mr Shackleton, right?""

The man had started wringing his hands, but he lay down obediently. ""Nackleton, actually. Timothy Nackleton."" 

""Hmph."" Silverstone scribbled a note down. He probably hadn't felt like correcting the intern when she got his name wrong. ""Well, I suppose we had better get to work, then."" Glancing over at the figity man, he frowned. ""Put your arms at your sides and hold still, for Pete's sake.""

Puzzled, Nackleton slowly obeyed. ""Um, excuse me, but... are you really a therapist, sir?""

""What makes you say that, Nackle?"" growled Dr Silverstone. He fumbled around on his desk for a moment, looking for something. 

The man frowned. ""I thought therapists were supposed to be... I dunno, nice and cheerful, or something.""

Finally finding the thing he was looking for, a black remote, he rolled his chair back to the couch, and checked Nackleton over, tucking in any bits that stuck out too far. ""Never liked those half-witted excuses for therapists, always dancing around the issue with their *talking* and their *sympathizing*. It's much simpler just to get to the root of the problem."" With that, he pressed a big red button on the remote.

Immediately, large metal bands slid out from under the couch and wrapped themselves around Mr. Nackleton, securing his so tightly they knocked the air out of him. A feeble scream escaped his lips.

Guiding his chair back around behind the desk, Dr. Silverstone punched in a couple more buttons on the remote. Bright lights flared from each corner, and a panel opened in the wall, revealing an array of glowing weapons, from a tiny, shining dagger, to a massive broadsword. Picking up a pair of curved blades, he swung them around experimentally.

""Wha... What's going on?"" Nackleton was frantic, struggling against his bonds. ""Who are you? What are you going to do to me?"" He paused, gasping from the exertion. 

""I'm your therapist, Mr Nackleton. This is going to be your first, and hopefully *only* session."" Discarding the dual swords, he picked up an axe, the head glowing with an unearthly light. He tested the edge on his finger, and it passed right through, leaving an ice cold wake behind it. Hefting it over his shoulder, he turned back toward the couch, and pressed one more button on the remote. ""Lets get started.""

Immediately, the couch started to glow, and Nackleton screamed again, holding it out for several seconds before running out of breath. Gasping, he screamed again, but this time it was deeper, strange coming from a man so small. This time it didn't stop, instead just getting louder and louder, until it shook the walls.

A dark blob appeared on Nackleton's chest, and quickly grew. Looking carefully, Dr. Silverstone decided the slight tinge of blue probably meant it was anxiety, which made sense, considering how nervous the man seemed. 

It got bigger and bigger, leaving Nackleton's chest and stretching up to the ceiling. It was enormous, bigger than anything Silverstone had seen before, and he had to suppress a twitch. Anxiety fed off of fear, so it was better to give it as little as possible.

Finally, it stopped ballooning. At the top, a gaping mouth appeared, stretching wide. The wailing continued, but by now it was clearly inhuman, a screech beyond the reach of human vocal chords.

Rather suddenly, the screaming stopped, and the blob slithered off of the glowing couch to the ground. Above the dripping maw, two sideways slits opened, each with a mass of tiny blue dots. The swirling eyes gazed down at Silverstone. 

Not wasting a moment, the doctor swung his axe, aiming to slice it clean in two. It hissed, and slid away from the blow. It stretched out, getting thinner and longer, until it resembled an enormous, oozy snake. Curling up, it watched Silverstone carefully.

Lifting his axe defensively, he stalked closer to the beast, watching for any movement. With every step forward, it curled tighter and tighter, looking ready to strike. 

But he was ready for it. He feigned forward, and the anxiety struck, mouth gaping wide. Dodging to the side, he swung the axe in a small arc, and the glowing blade sliced right through the neck of the snake as it flew by.

The two separate pieces fell to the ground with a heavy thud. The cut edges started dissolving, and he kicked them into a corner to finish disappearing. With a sigh, Silverstone sat back down, placing the axe casually on his desk.

Scooping up the clipboard and pen, he scribbled down a summary of the session. Halfway through, a huffing got his attention. Nackleton was still bound to the couch, and he was watching the snake dissolve with wide eyes. ""What *was* that?"" Glancing briefly at the doctor, his eyes focused on the glowing axe. ""Did you just... kill it?""

""That was your Anxiety, Nackle. It's gone, for now. You get to experience a bit of freedom from it."" Peering over the clipboard, he looked Nackleton in the eyes. ""But you can't be lazy about it. If you let it, it'll simply grow back.""

Nackleton wouldn't look at him, instead gazing over Silverstone's shoulder, avoiding eye contact. ""Why'd you kill the snake, but not that one?""

There was a moment of silence.

And then Silverstone spun around, twisting the cap on his pen as he went. A glittering blade burst from the tip of the pen, and he swung out behind him.

But he was too late. Something small and fast hit his face, knocking him from the chair. They hit the ground, and Silverstone dropped the pen, instead grabbing frantically at the tiny demon that snarled and scribbled at his eyes. It was strong, and at the ends of its hands and feet were sharp claws.

When he finally got a grip on it, he peeled it from his face, and held it up. From the glimpses he got, he saw no color, aside from its eye, which was a single ball of dark red hate. It was a suicidal thought, the most dangerous of all.

It scratched at his wrists, trying to get closer to him, and it was all he could do to hold it in place. Rolling over, he pinned it against the floor with his whole body weight, and reached out for his pen with his free hand. Snatching up the blade, he lifted up and stabbed at the ground beneath him.

There was nothing there, and the blade stabbed into the floor, stopping at the pen hilt. It hit with such force that the pen snapped, and the blade fizzled away.

Abandoning useless pen, he whirled around, just in time to see the little dark demon launch itself toward him again, and he raised his arms to cover his face.

Between his arms, he saw a flash of light, and a horrible gurgling noise. When nothing happened, he peeked out.

The demon lay on the floor, cut clean in half, and a young woman wearing a sweater and jeans stood before it. She was holding one of the swords from the rack, and she lowered it. She wiped her brow and grinned at the doctor. ""Whew! Good thing I came in when I did, huh?""

He recognized her voice from the intercom, and gazed at her disbelievingly. ""You're the new intern?""

She smiled even wider, teeth shining almost as much as the sword. ""Yep! Heard some weeeird noises in here, so I decided to see if you needed any help. Saw the little monster and a bunch of glowing weapons, so I did what seemed the most prudent. I stabbed the little bugger with the first thing I could get my hands on!"" She stuck her hand out to help him up. ""This was certainly an interesting first day on the job!""

Taking her hand and standing up, he gave her a once over. She was spattered in dark flecks, held a glowing sword, and had possibly just saved his life. Despite himself, Dr. Silverstone grinned back at her. Maybe this one was a keeper. 

From the couch, Nacklton cleared his throat. ""So... do I pay at the front?"""

So I had my telephonic interview a few days ago, and wanted a general view from you guys on how it went.
The interview was supposed to be 45 minutes but ended up at the 40 minute mark. At the start of it I was asked to introduce myself, I had something in my mind which was around 5 lines (This was a technical interview for a Software Intern) after which the technical questions were asked. The first question was an implementation based question which I had already seen but this time the question had a twist (we had a shared code-editor) . So I explained my approach and was able to code it in around 5 minutes (this includes the time required to explain the approach as well as code it). He made me dry run the code on a sample input and the code didnt have any problems and the interviewer said ""It looks good"" and asked me the next question. The next question was to find the sum of three numbers in an array whose sum is 0. I had previously seen the same question, but rather than acknowledging it, I tried my best to explain the approach, starting from how to solve it for 2 numbers and then proceeded to tell him if I can fix one number in the 3 number tuple , how can we search for the remaining 2 numbers in the array, by first sorting the array and using 2 pointers. I asked him if the approach was good enough or if it needed some refinements. He asked me to go ahead and code it. I did the same but this time he did not ask me to dry run the code and said ""it looks good"". We were at the 25 minute mark now and had around 20 more minutes to spend. So he asked me regarding my previous internships and some more personality questions. By now we were at the 35 minute mark. He enquired if I had any questions for him, I did and asked him ""about the challenges which he faced with his work"" and ""what do you look for in candidates"" . We were at the 40 minute mark when the interviewer himself said ""I will be ending the interview a bit early, and your recruiter should get back to you in a week"". 
So honest opinion, how do you think I fared? 
And are there any negative markers ?"

51c2n3,35,2016-09-05,I am very lost,neverbeen47,exmormon,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/51c2n3/i_am_very_lost/,"I'm in a place where I never expected to be. I was raised in a large, well educated, Mormon family outside of any very Mormon place. We moved around quite a bit and the church was a wonderful kind of constant in my life. It was a time when my family was all together and no matter where we moved we were welcomed and accepted. I enjoyed serving in the church as an aaronic priesthood holder and enjoyed hanging out with the other youth. I liked studying the gospel (although I rarely read my scriptures because I hate reading), and felt comforted during some very tragic times in my life (the death of my high school coach, father's heart attack, sister's attempted suicide and throughout my military training). Along with those comforting times there have been what have seemed to be undeniable spiritual experiences that I still treasure to this day. 

I went on to serve a foreign mission and was super obedient and worked super hard to do what I felt was right. I tried hard to be a kind companion and to share happiness with other people. There mission was the first time my testimony was really tested, and I came to the conclusion that the gospel was good, because it brought happiness into my life, and seemingly into the lives of those I was close to. This is what motivated me to share it. I had a wonderful mission president who was a convert and a wonderful example, and welcomed honest discussion. The area presidency (70s) was very different. There was one counselor that I really didn't like. He didn't seem very Christ-like to be and seemed to teach missionary methods which went against peach my gospel, so in a couple mission leadership councils I went head to head with him and it worked out pretty well. That's not so relevant to this post other than that I have never believed in blind following or in the Lord's anointed being perfect. 

I returned from my mission to military service and found that the church was still a wonderful influence in my life. I appreciate the fellowship and many of the standards (not drinking, being nice to people, etc.). I met a non member girl and fell in love. She was amazing and I invited her to church with me a couple times. After a couple years while I was out of state on an internship she met with the missionaries and got baptized. I tried really hard not to flirt to convert. After a year we got married in the temple and left on our honeymoon. We've been married now for 3 months and love each other a lot. 

For the first month we were traveling a lot and didn't go to church much. The last two months we've been super good Mormons just like we have always been. But it wasn't the same and I see everything differently now. This weekend I read [this article](http://nyti.ms/2bMo9Kx) by my favorite NYT columnist about how Christianity is now about the establishment than Christ's example these days, and I struck too close to home. 

The things I have always valued in the church are the fundamental teachings about empathy and service but those are so clouded to me now by the things like the lack of transparency from church leadership and what seems to be no connection between a heaven and the apostles. 

I have never ignored or shunned anti Mormon literature (I have read exmormon forums since I was a teen-ager, and have eagerly read each essay as they have been released), but suddenly everything has come down around me. How can the church publish that the book of Abraham is not a translation, and still include the facsimiles and their translations as scripture? 

Anyways I don't know what I will do but it helps to write this down, because I have a big test tomorrow because these thoughts have been keeping me from any sort of concentration. When I told my wife how I felt yesterday she seemed okay with it and was very supportive, and it made me look back (hindsight 20-20) and realize that she really did everything in the church for me, which makes me a little sad because that was the opposite of what I wanted, but I appreciate her support a lot. We probably won't go back to church but I want to be careful. I don't want to do the wrong thing. Although I don't like some things about the exmormon community, especially the anger and bitterness, I appreciate the honesty that I find here and I really just needed someone to share this with, so thanks. I'll probably reach out to some of my old companions, siblings and my mission president for their opinions too.

Edit: I guess I should add that another huge problem between the church and me is the sanctioned patriarchy and sexism. I can't imagine rasing a future daughter in a church that relegates her into a lower tier box. "

The job is absolutely fulfilling. I love my coworkers, boss. The company culture is excellent. The product we are developing is very unique. We are always told by the bosses that the product idea is excellent; that time and time again, we have validation by the targeted market. I have learned so much working here its like I transformed into the tech expert I never thought I could be. From learning. The lack of resources forced me to learn development in multiple languages, multiple operating systems, low level programming, high level programming. I'm developing as a really effective communicator. I became so much better as a professional its just unbelievable. I'm eternally grateful to my boss for taking a chance on me.


But the lifestyle I live is unfulfilling. I moved in with my parents because the job is in the same city. A city that I really dislike because of how small and boring it is. 


My friends are all living in bigger cities doing NEW things. Sure I'm getting paid well. Sure the company might explode with success in the future. But today, I feel unsatisfied. I feel hungry. 


Some of you will say that my idea of living in a new city is overrated and that I should find things in my city. Already tried that. Got into new hobbies. I go out as often as possible. But its still not fulfilling me. I think I need a change of scenery to really drive myself.


I'm really confliced here guys. I save so much staying with my parents. I might regret leaving this startup. Is there a way to evaluate how successful we could be? Is there a rational and logical way to evaluate my situation and then come to the decision of staying or leaving?"

As the title states, I am currently a senior in the Mechanical Engineering program at my university, graduating next May. I was wondering how others in this sub/the engineering industry have found the most success when it comes to applying to internships or full-time careers; in the past, I have relied heavily on engineering conferences. This year, however, I will have to make a decision on a job offer (returning to my internship) before most of these conferences occur, giving me less time to search for other potential jobs, as well as fewer outlets by which to do so.

Those who have been through the application processes or currently are dealing with them, what's your best advice on getting a hold of good career opportunities and getting your foot in the door? 

I'm currently doing what I can with contacts from previous years, as well as family connections (my dad has gotten me in contact with someone from Boeing who says they are looking around for me, but who knows what will happen with that). I also do online applications every year but often find that these never turn into anything even as much as an email.

So, what's best? Online applications? Cold-calling companies you're interested in? Finding contacts? Or are there other methods as well? I want to try and take advantage of as many opportunities as possible.

I specifically am targeting the aerospace industry, but I would like to know other's advice on this topic in general, and hopefully it will also be of help to others in this sub in the same situation.

I'll try to make my background info as brief as possible and just lay out the main points here.

I am an incoming 4th year at a fairly competitive undergraduate school in CA.  I am pursuing a degree in the sciences.

I have a 3.88 GPA, although my sGPA is a bit lower (3.7 maybe?).

I have taken most of the prerequisite classes necessary for med school.

I have not done any clinical medicine internships

I have worked in a neurology lab (...for many many hours and 6+ months, although I recently quit this to pursue an opening in another lab)

I pride myself in my self-discipline and hard work and am fairly confident I could do well if I put in major hours for the MCAT; however, I do not know if I will be embarking upon a fool's errand, so to speak, if I decide to pursue this so late in the game.

I have heard from many people (including my college's faculty members) that GPA and MCAT scores are prioritized more than anything, which is why I even bother to ask at all.

Any advice is appreciated!

I never thought, and I had hoped, that I would be in this situation again. The fake life I have built. This fake happiness that could never last. I built it up, knowing it would come back to haunt me, and so it has.

I am 22 years old. Male. And a two time college dropout. Growing up I always wanted to be like anyone else, and was told the same things that everyone else was; go to school, get good grades, go to college, get a job etc. It's all that was ever wanted of me, and not a very difficult task either. Yet from a young age I never had interest in school. I never failed a class in highschool, but I never had really good grades like my brother. He was always the best of our parents children, straight A's and good at soccer. My younger sister is a close second, while not as naturally talented or intelligent she has an amazing drive and work ethic. She knows how to study. Both would study, get good grades, follow the rules and be model children.

And I never was. And I never will be. 

Growing up I wouldn't follow the rules, I'd question everything, why do this and why do that. The usual unruly child. I don't like to think of myself as a bad kid, but I was certainly the trouble maker of the family. I would steal simple things like a piece of candy or two, never anything of true value until I was a teenager. I wanted to, but I was afraid. Of getting caught, yes, but not by the store or anything. Always the fear was of my parents.

And so it still is.

I fear my parents. I was raised not to love and respect them, but to be afraid. Always my achievements were hushed away and asked why I could not do better. Why could I not be like my brother? Why couldn't I do as well as the kid down the street? Oh, look how nicely their kids behave, why can't you be like that? And always when I would bring up a comparison I was told to not compare myself to others, when that was all they ever did. I can't help but compare myself to others. Even now I look at my friends, who I haven't made enough of an effort to see this summer, progressing through their degrees and graduating and getting jobs and travelling the world. I wish so desperately to be normal.. I think about it a lot. What is it like to be someone else? What is it like to be normal? I know that no one really is normal and we all have our own lives growing up, and that many people probably think this way. But I can't help but wish and wonder. What is it like to not be depressed? I have dealt with it silently and alone my entire adult life, since I was 14. Usually seasonal, but I've had springs and summers as well with no drive and no feeling, just going through the motions. That first year, freshman year of highschool, I tried to tell my parents. They shoved it back in my face and told me to stop pretending just because I wanted attention. So now almost 10 years later I suffer still silent, though I know they have grown as I have grown. It would be ignorant to pretend things are the same.

But I fear so much opening up to anyone. There are so many things I have never told anyone. So many wishes, thoughts, malicious in nature that have been shoved deep and ignored. One in particular I've been thinking a lot about the last few weeks. My dad is the type of person that if there is any possible way he can do it himself, he will. I, not my brother, was always the one to be roped into it. For many this would be a bonding experience, and I truly wish they had been. My dad has a short temper and no acceptance for error. Any little thing I did wrong was met with harsh words and a raised voice in anger. I resented him for it, and still do. Years ago, so much more than that. I hated him, I truly despised being called to help him. There were specific times I remember I wanted to kill him. And I almost did. I was so close, once. We were redoing our basement and I was helping him put up a new wall. He was angry because things weren't going well, swearing and yelling at me for not doing well enough as always. He was kneeling on the ground, and I was behind him. The hammer was in my hand. I was so enraged in that moment, I thought about striking him in the head and truly ending him. I wanted it. I thought about how I could claim it was an accident, perhaps it fell off the ladder and struck him in the head. In the end the only thing that stopped me was fear and my own greed. As much as I hated him I needed the house. I at least was old enough to understand that my life would not be better if I killed him. But my god I wanted to bash his head in.

There was a friend when I was younger that was one of the cool kids. I wasn't part of that group, so of course I wanted to hang out with him as much as I could, despite one thing: he would kiss me. I don't know why, and never will, but he would always catch me off guard and kiss me. Christmas time; mistle toe for example. Then at school he would tell everyone I would always try to kiss him, and always they believed him of course cause he was cool and I was not. Harassed for being gay, when I wasn't. I still struggle with my sexual identity, there are certainly some men I find attractive but the thought of any physical act repulses me, but part of me still wants it. I hate myself for it. I don't think I could fall in love with a man though. It's irrelevant.

I used to steal money from my parents when I was a teen, up until probably 17 and got a job for myself. I played league of legends, and wanted to buy skins. Over the years I probably stole around 150 dollars, and I don't think that there is any way that they didn't know, but I was never confronted about it. I don't know why. I still feel guilty about it. I was so ungrateful. They had money in a savings account for me for college, not a lot, but as much as they could afford with three kids. I didn't have an allowance, and so I justified my stealing by thinking I deserved it since I had no allowance and everyone else I knew did.. Maybe if I had had an allowance I would be better with my money today. I have a job that pays okay, and I have 500 dollars in my savings when I should have at least $2500. I spend so much money, and it's still on video games. My parents had $2000 in one of my accounts that was not at all mine; spent over the last two years. I have since quit LoL, but I've spent hundreds on CSGO this summer. I haven't bought anything in a few weeks, at least. I'm trying to be better. I want so badly to be better. 

I used to cut in high school. Not badly, and I have no scars. I am grateful for that. But I just wanted to feel, and the pain was more than being a shell, at least. And I wanted to relate with other kids I knew that cut and were proud of it in a way, they glorified it. But I always was trying to be someone I'm not, and I still do it to this day. I never had friends growing up except for one, and I treated him like shit. High school was the same until senior year, when I made friends for the first time with the stoner kids, because they were the only ones nice and accepting enough to let me be around. And that summer before college I smoked weed for the first time, and it was wonderful. I felt like I belonged, and I almost did.

In college the freedom was amazing, no one was telling me I wasn't good enough, except when my parents would call or text. I played a lot of games, but I made it through. I made friends with everyone on my floor, we all played a lot of video games, and I truly felt like I had friends who I actually fit in with when I was just being myself. That was the last time I really remember not being depressed half the year since I was 14. I didn't fail any classes until I got to sophomore year, when I lived in a different building with no option for transfer to theirs. My roommate moved out, and I started living in isolation. I started going to class less and less, and was drinking every day. Second semester I failed out of school. Telling my parents was the worst thing I've gone through, the crying and screaming and depression came reeling over me for weeks. I enrolled in a summer class of one of math classes I failed, and I actually did pass. I went to community college for a semester and dropped one class, but passed my other three. I reapplied to my original university and I got back in. Last summer, I was turning my life around after fucking it all up so badly.

And here I am again. Utterly FUCKED. Last fall I moved in to a house with some friends, and it was honestly a big mistake. I started smoking weed every day, and playing so many videogames. I blew off class again, thinking I could make it up later. In early October my school had a career fair, and I actually landed an internship at a fairly prestigious company within my major. Yet by the end of October I wasn't going to any of my classes and depression and anxiety (anxiety from smoking so much, truthfully) were in full swing. I failed out again, but didn't tell anyone. I kept pretending I was in school, though some days I wouldn't even leave my room or my bed. Months this went on for, and I assumed somehow that the company would find out I wasn't a student anymore, as they actually have really close ties with my former university. But somehow they never did, and my parents didn't find out either, and so I moved back home without the company or family or girlfriend knowing that I have failed out again. And thus has been the last few months of my life.

At work I thankfully have enough education to get by without anyone being suspicious, and from being scared into obedience I have a decent work ethic, when I'm not too depressed. I tried shrooms back the first week of July, and the last two months were, without a doubt, the most happy I've been in years. People at work like me, and two managers from different departments have both told me that they wish I could be with them permanently. My sister went back to school last week, and my brother left for a job in the southwest this week. And this is why I am fucked: when my Dad gets back from helping him move, they want to look over my student loan information with me. But there isn't any, because I failed out last fall. That is pretty much the only thing I feel like I have going for me, is that I'm not $6000 dollars in additional debt. But I do owe $3300 to my parents that could have been paid back if I wasn't so shitty at budgeting, despite some of my better efforts. And they will ask to see this information that I do not have, and there is no way out of the lie. No way around it any longer. Again there will be crying and yelling and more depression, and I'm clutching on to these last few days. I wish I was a better version of me. I know I could be, and I'm not. No matter how angry and disappointed my parents are going to be, there will be no one more angry or disappointed in me than I am. Years ago in anger my dad yelled at me that I should try not to be such a fuck up. And here I am. I tried, and I couldn't. I might get kicked out, and my internship lasts until December upon which I will have no job. Staying with the company is very unlikely as I won't be graduating and a job there would require it, and if I come clean they won't hire someone who has lied to their faces for 6 months. 

I am so fucked. I'm trying to think of next steps before depression sets in again, but the last few weeks I've started losing interest in all the things I like to do. It's getting harder to get out of bed in the morning. I'm not sleeping as well. I can feel it coming. This week I need to see if there is any chance at me getting back in to school for Spring semester, but even so I'll be another year behind what I already was from failing out the first time. I should be graduating but instead I have minimum two and a half years to go. I still smoke weed every day, and I am going to cut back or stop, if I can. It's starting to be a negative influence as it was last year, at least I can recognize it. I want to be happy, and I know that the biggest thing in the way is myself. But after all the conditioning, the comparing, the fear, I have such a shell that I never open to anyone and never have. I can't talk about how I feel because of the rejection and belittling those years ago. 

I am afraid. Afraid of my future, afraid of the coming depression, of the entire facade I have built myself up upon to come crashing down again. If I didn't exist this would be so much easier, though I will never kill myself. No matter what happens, that is my one vow to myself that I will always uphold. My life will go on, I don't know how or what will happen or when I will truly be happy as I was these last two months, but life will go on. As it always has, as it always will. 

I wish I could have been the person I thought I would be by now."

I never thought, and I had hoped, that I would be in this situation again. The fake life I have built. This fake happiness that could never last. I built it up, knowing it would come back to haunt me, and so it has.
I am 22 years old. Male. And a two time college dropout. Growing up I always wanted to be like anyone else, and was told the same things that everyone else was; go to school, get good grades, go to college, get a job etc. It's all that was ever wanted of me, and not a very difficult task either. Yet from a young age I never had interest in school. I never failed a class in highschool, but I never had really good grades like my brother. He was always the best of our parents children, straight A's and good at soccer. My younger sister is a close second, while not as naturally talented or intelligent she has an amazing drive and work ethic. She knows how to study. Both would study, get good grades, follow the rules and be model children.
And I never was. And I never will be.
Growing up I wouldn't follow the rules, I'd question everything, why do this and why do that. The usual unruly child. I don't like to think of myself as a bad kid, but I was certainly the trouble maker of the family. I would steal simple things like a piece of candy or two, never anything of true value until I was a teenager. I wanted to, but I was afraid. Of getting caught, yes, but not by the store or anything. Always the fear was of my parents.
And so it still is.
I fear my parents. I was raised not to love and respect them, but to be afraid. Always my achievements were hushed away and asked why I could not do better. Why could I not be like my brother? Why couldn't I do as well as the kid down the street? Oh, look how nicely their kids behave, why can't you be like that? And always when I would bring up a comparison I was told to not compare myself to others, when that was all they ever did. I can't help but compare myself to others. Even now I look at my friends, who I haven't made enough of an effort to see this summer, progressing through their degrees and graduating and getting jobs and travelling the world.

At first, I was ecstatic that I was offered a position on Capitol Hill, especially from a congressman in my own state. The more I think about it, however, a few concerns are raised. Namely:

1. I need to pay down my debt. I have been barley getting by for close to six months and have ran up credit card debt in addition to student loans I already had. I recently moved out of an apartment and back to my parents to try and pay down debt/save some money in the next six-12 months while I look into pursuing a masters degree at local schools. This internship, which is unpaid for three months, would require me to take out a loan with my family and pay them back, which I don't want to do for comfort reasons. 

2. The congressman I would be working for is very conservative, and while I don't consider myself at all a dire hard liberal, but I don't agree with many of his policies which tend to be Republican standard. All that being said, he seems like a genuine man and I wouldn't mind working for him but I have seen other posts suggesting you work for the party you would want to be in business with long term only.

3. As mentioned before, I was planning on pursuing a Comp Sci Masters to complement my Finance bachelors degree. My real interest is in public policy research and I think I can leverage those two degrees into something in that area, particularly data analysis. However, the interviewer told me I would also have an opportunity to research legislation while there, and that they would try to hook me up with whatever kind of position I wanted post-internship.

*TL/DR* Is it worth me putting my plans on hold and straining myself financially for a three month DC internship? Is this really a once in a lifetime opportunity, or can I get myself in a better situation financially while building up some practical skills (i.e. formal training in programming) and expect to land a similar roll later on?"

51dq9k,58,2016-09-06,A Message to Christians [LONG POST],TheOldEskimo,exchristian,https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/51dq9k/a_message_to_christians_long_post/,"I have been a Christian for most of my life. I was born into and raised in a devoutly Christian home and even attended a Christian University.

I prayed to God every day and thought I saw him working in my life and in the lives of others. To me, it seemed silly that people could possibly think he does not exist. Surely they were just deluding themselves; surely they were just angry with my God or wanting to live selfishly.

It seemed clear that we deserved the suffering we had as a race. According to my faith, we had no to blame but ourselves after all.

Regarding other religions, I understood that they were very simply incorrect. I thought that surely they did not have the academic verification and the irrefutable set of evidence that supported my religion.

But I was wrong and accepting that I was wrong was one of the hardest things I have ever done. Accepting that what I had believed and been taught my whole life was false was not something that occurred overnight. On the contrary, I tried my best to refute doubts wherever I found they popped up. Try as I might, I found the answers Christianity provided, at best, left room for reasonable doubt and, at worst, were wholly unsatisfying.

In what follows, I hope to write about some of what I learned and what led me first to agnosticism and then eventually to atheism.

---

The first subject I would like to discuss is **The Problem of Evil** (a subject Christians are well-versed in and something Christians have a solution for).

Regarding the problem of evil in the world, most Christians I have spoken with (and my previous self) would have addressed this with Free Will.

The claim, as I understand it and in an admittedly brief summary, is that Yahweh created the world, but gave man free will to make his own choices. This means that people have the ability to hurt one another and act selfishly which results in the problem of evil. 

At first glance, to me, this sounds very plausible. I think a lot people stop here.

But when we dig deeper, it becomes clear that the Free Will Argument does not hold up to scrutiny at all.

Earthquakes, Tsunamis, Tornadoes, Cancer, Stillborn children, and even general unintentional harm are all unaccounted for by free will.

Additionally, if we look deeper into philosophy and our own brain chemistry, it becomes clear that free will does not even exist (at least not in the way many people think it does). That line of thought may be more abstract than what we’re going for here so I won’t digress into philosophy for this particular paper.

---

The next subject I would like to discuss is **Hell**.

Bertrand Russell was a British philosopher, logician, mathematician, historian, writer, social critic, political activist and Nobel laureate.

My understanding based on his writings is that he was a far smarter and wiser man than I will ever be; I would guess a smarter and wiser man than most of us.

What I value most about Russell is not his math proofs or scientific achievements, but his reasoning and his process of determining truth.

I would like to add as an aside that I highly recommend Russell’s article from the 50s, “Is there a God?” Of all the books and papers I have read, none have come close for me in concisely, clearly, and reasonably explaining how we can answer the question, “Is there a god(s)?”

Regarding Hell and Eternal Suffering, Russell said, “There is one very serious defect to my mind in Christ's moral character, and that is that he believed in hell. I do not myself feel that any person that is really profoundly humane can believe in everlasting punishment.”

Hitler and Stalin are reviled the world over (and for good reason).

If a man engages in genocide, we call him a monster. If god engages in genocide (as Yahweh is claimed to have done in the case of Noah and the flood to name one example), we call him good.

But there is more to it than that. Death when compared side by side with eternal suffering (as hell is described to be in Matthew) is far more forgiving.

This life and the pain we experience here is temporary. Eternal suffering is forever. Condemning someone to hell is far worse than condemning them to death. It is even far worse than condemning people to torture for a lifetime; it is far worse than what Hitler and the Nazi’s did when they put Jews in concentration camps to starve, suffer, and die. It is far worse than anything any man could ever hope to do to another person.

And what for? Not for murder, not for genocide, not for harming a single person, but for the crime of genuinely not believing something is true. How do we know they genuinely don’t believe it’s true? Good question, let’s talk about that.

I have heard it said that people choose to go to hell. 

Suppose I offer you a choice: 

-A five star hotel for all eternity

OR

-A torture chamber for all eternity

Which are you going to choose? The thing is, there is no choice. The choice is clear; relegated to self-interest. No one in their right-mind would ever willingly choose the latter.

I have heard it said (in different variations) that people reject god so they can do evil and have their way in this life. Let’s talk about that too.

Suppose christianity is correct: I think a very compelling argument could be built that the most important thing to anyone would be their eternal fate. What is this life when compared with eternity? What is a blip compared to the endless? 

For someone to choose a life of wrongdoing here in exchange for an eternity in hell is a poor trade that would not be made by anyone who truly understood the choice they were making and its ramifications. No one in their right mind would make such a choice.

No one who genuinely understood Christianity, believed it was true, and was in their right mind would ever choose to “reject” Yahweh. The “choice” (if we can really call it that) is relegated to self-interest.

If Yahweh really wanted people to choose him, then I do not think he should have threatened us with the ultimate punishment. Doing so makes it no choice at all.

An additional question worth asking with respect to this topic is, “Do people choose what they believe is true?”

For example, can I choose to believe the wall immediately to my right is not there?

I would say no, we do not choose what we believe is true, but rather, we acquire core beliefs and principles over time as a result of numerous inputs or causes.

If you were born in a dominantly Muslim country in the Middle East, do you think you would be a Muslim instead of a Christian? Statistically, odds are, you probably would be.

Do you think that your Muslim self would deserve eternal damnation for having a core belief that could not be helped? One that you genuinely and truly believed was true and correct?

I am aware of different ways Christians have tried to rationalize the concept of Hell. 

Some are advocates of Universalism.

Some are advocates of Annihilationism.

Some say that bad people go to hell and good people go to heaven.

Some say that people make a conscious decision to go to hell every moment they are there.

I do not think any of these views are Biblically supported. Rather I think these views are adopted  to rationalize hell once one realizes how utterly monstrous it is.

Matthew 25:46 tells us that hell is a place of eternal punishment.

Matthew 13:50 tells us that hell will be like a blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

I must concede that many of hell’s descriptions in the Bible seem vague and metaphorical.

I think this makes it easy for people to read in whatever they want.

Despite the difficulty in building a clear picture given the obtuse nature of the verses, I think it is quite clear that Hell is described to be a very wretched and painful place in which unbelievers suffer for all eternity.

Now, I would like to address the subject of the **validity** and **inerrancy of scripture**.

This section will pull some information from the following threads and credit is where credit's due for the fine folks who contributed:

https://m.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/50nsij/question_about_gospel_writers_being_eye_witnesses/

https://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicBiblical/comments/52469y/did_the_apostle_john_write_the_gospel_of_john_and/

I imagine this will come off rather brusk, but I am afraid I must be blunt. 

Those who claim that the Bible is inerrant are misinformed or pretending to know things they do not. 

I suspect many Christians take for granted what they were taught in their upbringing (I know I did).

The Bible has contradictions and fallacies. Take your pick:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RB3g6mXLEKk

I do not think we can say all of them are translation errors without a leap of faith.

To most people coming at the Bible without bias, I think these are fairly obvious.

Was Jesus born during the end of Herod’s reign? Or was he born during the census and the time of Quirinius?

Did Judas give back the silver he received for his betrayal or did he buy a field with it?

Both according to the Bible.

A common misconception that some Christians I have spoken with have is that the gospels were eye-witness accounts.

There is no real debate about the authorship of the gospels as far as being eyewitness accounts. They are not. Bart Ehrman is a biblical scholar and has written about this (as have many others).

http://ehrmanblog.org/why-are-the-gospels-anonymous/

They are almost certainly not written by Jesus’ disciples.

None of the gospels came with the authors' name. They are all technically anonymous. Traditional names were attributed later and there's no reason to think those traditional names are correct.

Most importantly, the gospels are all written in Greek. Good Greek that would have required a relatively decent education. The disciples were uneducated, Aramaic-speaking fishermen. If you are truly coming at this without bias, it is quite obvious that the disciples did not write them without taking a leap of faith.

This is from Boston College:

http://www.bc.edu/schools/stm/crossroads/resources/birthofjesus/intro/the_dating_of_thegospels.html

""Most researchers place the date of Jesus’ death at Passover time around the year 30. The earliest New Testament books, the letters written by Paul, were composed in the decade of the 50s.

In the mid-60s, James, Peter, and Paul are all killed. Peter and Paul likely perished during the persecution of the church in Rome by Nero. The deaths of these important church leaders likely encouraged the writing down of narratives about Jesus.
In the year 70, Roman armies destroyed Jerusalem and its Temple, effectively ending a Jewish revolt against the Empire that had begun four years earlier.
Although some scholars disagree, the vast majority of researchers believe that Mark was the first Gospel to be written, sometime around the year 70.""

These dates are relevant because life expectancy was relatively low back then. If Jesus died around 30 and the first gospel arrived around 70, it is unlikely any of the disciples were still living.

Additionally, we run into other cultures historical accounts not lining up with the Bible's. So, for example, Egyptian history vs the Bible's interpretation with Moses is claimed to line up by Christians, but not by most other scholars.

There was a specific post about this very thing in r/AskHistorians sometime ago:

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1tvwsg/does_the_egyptian_history_record_the_ten_plagues/

""The general consensus amongst Egyptologists, though, is that much of what is written in the Old Testament simply doesn't have evidence in either the archaeological, written, or artistic records of Egypt.”

Another example of this exclusion from other historical records would be Herod’s slaughter of the innocents.

Flavius Josephus, who carefully chronicled Herod's abuses, makes no mention of it.

I think the biggest problem with claiming the Bible is inerrant is the reasoning process used to come to that conclusion.

The following is an excerpt from “Archaeology and Biblical Accuracy” by Farrell Till.

“Has archaeology proven the historical accuracy of the Bible? If you listened only to biblical inerrantists, you would certainly think so. Amateur apologists have spread this claim all over the internet, and in a letter published in this issue, Everett Hatcher even asserted that archaeology supports that ""the Bible is the inerrant word of God."" Such a claim as this is almost too absurd to deserve space for publication, because archaeology could prove the inerrancy of the Bible only if it unearthed undeniable evidence of the accuracy of every single statement in the Bible. If archaeological confirmation of, say, 95% of the information in the Bible should exist, then this would not constitute archaeological proof that the Bible is inerrant, because it would always be possible that error exists in the unconfirmed five percent. Has archaeology confirmed the historical accuracy of some information in the Bible? Indeed it has, but I know of no person who has ever tried to deny that some biblical history is accurate.”

For the Bible to be inerrant, as it is so often claimed to be, it would have to be 100% verified in its entirety. Not 95%. Not 99%. 100%. Quite frankly, no one will ever be able to verify that the miracles in the Bible (or the miracles of any other religion for that matter) ever occurred. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.

I speculate some will say, “You cannot disprove it.” This will be addressed in the next section.

---

One of the last things I would like to discuss in this paper is the **Burden of Proof**.

Suppose I told you that a goblin king under the surface of Pluto created the universe, its laws, you and me, and that he communicated with me telepathically and my predecessors wrote a book about him.

I’m going to level with you. There is no way you would believe me.

You would, quite reasonably, expect evidence. Testable, demonstrable, repeatable evidence, that is available to everyone.

Why do Christians not believe in Allah, Vishnu, Zeus, or the Flying Spaghetti monster? Why not believe in Leprechauns or an invisible laser unicorn? Why not the matrix or that little blue men live within Neptune? 

You cannot disprove them after all.

The answer is The Burden of Proof.

The one making the claim has the burden to substantiate it.

This is why simply saying, “You cannot disprove Yahweh” is not a good argument.

---

This section will be addressing the difference between **good and bad evidence** and how it applies to Christianity (and religion as a whole).

Good evidence is testable, demonstrable, and repeatable. Good evidence is available for all to examine.

I think good claims are doxastically open. That is to say that they are open to criticism and revision (such as scientific theories for example).

It is important to understand that no one is beyond criticism. No teacher, no politician, no leader, no theory, and no god.

Whenever I speak to Christians now-a-days about their religion, typically, one of the following comes up as a reason why the individual believes.

Personal experience, coincidence, (admittedly iron-age) eye witness testimony, and faith.

Personal experience has a number of relevant criticisms and has proven to be a very unreliable form of evidence. Additionally all religions will claim it.

Suppose a Christian, a Muslim, and a Hindu all sit down independently with a neutral interviewer. 

When asked about their personal experience with god, each will say something very different. Who they say he is will vary dramatically.

Coincidence does not prove god's existence either. When Timmy's mother prays for him to get an internship and he gets one, that is not proof of god’s existence, it is a coincidence. What if Timmy's Muslim friend prayed to Allah that Timmy would find a job too? Whose god answered the prayer?

Iron-age eye-witness testimony (again, that every religion seems to claim) is also unreliable. As covered above as a common misconception, none of the gospels were eye-witness accounts. There is no real debate surrounding this. Depending on Saul's word that he had a vision is just as suspect as Muhammed’s or Joseph Smith's.

Finally we get to faith. I have often heard faith defined with deepities. That is, something that sounds very good, but is utterly meaningless or unclear. Faith is belief without evidence or in the present of conflicting evidence plain and simple. Some have defined it (rather aptly I think) as pretending to know things one doesn't know.

Contrary to what Christianity teaches, faith is not a virtue. By faith one can believe literally anything. Anything.

None of these are good kinds of evidence.

---

I do not think the Universe needs a god(s) to exist.

Is it not possible that the universe has always existed in some form or another? Indeed, there is no evidence of anything else.

We have the burden of proof to push us away from agnosticism.

We know right and wrong can exist without a deity (addressed in the P.S. section below).

I think a lot of Christians are very smart.

I honestly think that a lot of Christians are simply misinformed.

I think there is a difference between being misled or uninformed/misinformed and being stupid.

I think stupidity is the inability to learn while the others are either having the wrong information or simply not knowing.

I think many Christians in the USA (where I reside) are victims of childhood indoctrination and, for lack of a better word, brainwashing.

I think the important thing to remember through all of this is that we can all be fooled.
It has been said that it is easier to fool people than to convince them they have been fooled.

At the end of the day, we all decide what we believe is true for ourselves.
But now perhaps you have some new information and I hope someday I’ll see you on the other side of the fence.

I know this was a long read so thank you for your time and for hearing me out. I wish you all the best in your lives and in the search for truth.

Have a good one and thanks again

I’d like to add a section concerning **right and wrong**. It’s fairly lengthy, but I think it’s a very important topic to address for a lot of Christians.

I’ve been told by many Christians that if there was no god(s) human beings would destroy one another.

C.S. Lewis wrote in “Mere Christianity” that natural law proves god’s existence (though I must say, even if natural law did prove god’s existence, which it doesn't, it would not prove which god(s) was the correct one).

To address these claims I’d first like to break down where right and wrong come from and how we determine them.

Right and Wrong, Good and Bad.

It seems like most people I have come across believe right and wrong and good and evil are objective or inherent things.

Sometime ago, I held that view, but after experiencing a loss, I began to think about the subject in a more existential sense. Initially, I failed to come up with a set of criteria for evaluating something as right or wrong that did not fall apart under scrutiny. More on that later.

My understanding is that right and wrong are either objective or they are not; that it is a null and alternate kind of problem where if right and wrong are objective, they are not subjective and vice versa.

If you’re claiming right and wrong are objective or inherent it’s your burden to substantiate it.

Initially, I tried to substantiate the claim myself, but found what I came up with unsatisfying. In researching the question, I was not able to rationalize the ways some others had substantiated it either.

**Where I started was trying to come up with a set of criteria for evaluating right and wrong. Are right and wrong determined by feelings and sensibilities? Are they determined by general consensus or the law? Are they determined by god(s) or religion?
I think each of these has its problems.**

Feelings and sensibilities are disagreed upon. Some are appalled by eating meat while others are not. Some see guns as an evil and some do not. If I felt murder was fine, that would not necessarily make it so. Alternatively, if I felt murder was not fine, that would not necessarily make it so. You can take metrics on the majority view, but this leads us to general consensus which I think has its own problems.

I think the problem with general consensus is that it only means what most people think; it says nothing about the truth or correctness of what most people think. By the logic of general consensus, if most people believed murder and rape were just and right, they simply would be. My understanding is that in Rome, many people had no problem with gladiators or the arena. General consensus can vary depending on time period, location, people groups, and so on. It has also arguably changed over time with things like slavery or homosexuality as an example. Some groups still oppose homosexuality which is often due to one of the next systems for making criteria which uses god(s) or religion as the ultimate determinant for right and wrong (which I think has its own problems). General consensus is not necessarily indicative of truth or falseness. It only means what the majority think or feel which can be incorrect as seen throughout history with regards to many fields of study. Simply because the majority once believed the earth was flat at one time does not mean they were correct.

Regarding the law, Captain Picard has a quote I like where he says, “There can be no justice so long as laws are absolute.”

Suppose person A drives drunk and gets into a car accident killing an elderly couple. In this scenario, the accident is entirely the elderly couples fault and driving error (they were driving the wrong way on a one way highway or something); let’s assume it would have happened regardless of the drinking.

Now suppose person B drives drunk and gets into an accident killing the elderly couple. In this case, it is entirely his error.

Should the two of them be punished in the same manner by the law? Should person A receive something more akin to a DUI while person B receive a more severe sentence? Should they receive the same sentence?

The law deals with a practically infinite number of edge cases which can cause problems when something like the above case occurs and you have a flat law to deal with it. Whether a flat law is sufficient for both person A and B is debatable. Some I speculate would be fine with person A and B being punished the same way while some I speculate would not.

Furthermore, laws can also be arguably unjust. I don’t think I need to give examples of that, it’s rather evident throughout history that at least some societies had laws that I think most would consider wrong by today’s developed country standards. I do not think that simply because laws change over time that old laws are necessarily wrong or that new laws are necessarily right.

Finally, we get to **god(s) or religion as a means for evaluating right and wrong**. The problem with this, I think, is that it does not take into account what god(s) does and does not do and only makes sense to me in a kind of, “He who has the gold makes the rules” way. By this method for developing criteria, god could, say, destroy all of humanity with a flood and this be considered right or have his people engage in religious justified genocide and this be considered objectively right because he said to do it and he makes the rules. It also makes right and wrong simply dependent on the whims and desires of the most powerful being (or something in that vein) regarding the “He who has the gold makes the rules bit.” Once again, if this were our determinant for right and wrong, god(s) could simply decree murder and rape to be just and right and, by our criteria, they would be.

**Perhaps most importantly, which of these methods for determining right and wrong takes precedence when they disagree with one another? What if my religion conflicts with the law or general consensus? What if my personal feelings and sensibilities conflict with one or both of the other two? What if your order of precedence differs from my own? Which of us is more objectively correct?**

It seems many people I have spoken with develop guiding principles such as, “If it hurts someone, it’s wrong.”

For starters, I speculate a good many people are hypocrites on this point and do not apply this principle uniformly. For example, suppose some friends go out with person A. Person A does not want to drive so he lets person B in the group do it even though he is aware that person B is inconvenienced by it. This is good for Person A and bad for Person B. One could argue it helps person A and hurts person B.

In a different scenario, suppose person A leaves their partner, person B, and starts a relationship with person C. Person B has their dreams crushed, loses their partner and best friend, and is depressed for years. In this case person A did what was in their best interest regardless of the pain to person B.

In both of the above scenarios, I speculate that whether or not the actions of person A are right or wrong might be debated to a degree, but by our aforementioned principle, I think both would be wrong.

Where do we draw the line when using principles like this? Is it at death and murder? Is it in small things like going out to eat with friends our letting our spouse do the laundry? But all of this is beside the point and I speculate many would admit that they believe the principle is true absolutely and that they simply don’t follow it in all things because of their nature, personal failings, or something in that vein. But I digress. The hypocrisy and uncertainty of people tells us nothing about the validity of the principle itself.
I think the biggest issue with a principle like this is that it is grounded in one of the items we’ve addressed: the wheel of feelings and sensibilities, law or general consensus, or god(s)/religion which are each fallible by my current understanding.

My conclusion is that right and wrong are ultimately rooted in self-interest and human needs. I acknowledge that empirically we see trends regarding the views on right and wrong that people hold, but I think that these trends are fallible because they depend on our wheel of criteria. Right and wrong exist, sure, but they exist as constructs we make for our mutual benefit or to gain some kind of advantage (this 'advantage' could be psychological, social, or economical for example).

I don’t want you stealing from my shop. I agree not to steal from you if you don’t steal from me. I won’t take your seat if you sat in it first on the condition that you don’t take my seat when I sit there first. Some people will say I’ll respect your beliefs so long as you respect my beliefs (though that one is questionable because beliefs rise and fall based on merit not respect), and on and on it goes.

My understanding is that these are social contracts which are fine examples of mutual self-interest at work.

I am aware of the question, “Is selflessness ultimately selfish?” 

How do we define a selfless act? 

Gareth Roberts discussed defining a selfless act when he wrote, ""It rather depends on what we mean by selfless. If a selfless act is something from which the doer gets absolutely nothing at all (including a sense that they're a good person, the absence of regret etc) then there is obviously no such thing.""

There is naturally a lot more to it than that (a lot more philosophy and a lot more explaining), but for the sake of the character limit, I'll have to explain my take on this with more depth in a future paper. For now, I hope we can all see there is no completely selfless act.

If the answer to the question, ""Is selflessness ultimately selfish?”, is yes (I think it is), then I think we are left with another question: Does selflessness exist at all? Again, I would say ultimately no, it does not. Provided these assumptions are correct, I think the result would be that the choices we make are based on cost analysis; we factor in our personal feelings and sensibilities, our religion, our desires, our understanding of the consequences, our cultural influence, our human needs and programming, and so on, and then make what we see as the best choice given the circumstances.

I think if this is true, than it has certain ramifications that I speculate a lot of people won’t like very much (though naturally what we like or what makes us happy or sad is hardly indicative of a universal truth).

With this logic in mind, suppose we have person A who wants to murder someone. Now, person A has evaluated the consequences of his actions (death or lifetime imprisonment), evaluated the risk of capture, and then decided by cost analysis that murdering the person is worth the consequences. By this logic, it is not wrong (at least not universally) for him with respect to his cost analysis. Of course it would almost certainly be wrong with respect to the victim and their cost analysis and self-interest.

Suppose a different person A exists who is married to person B. Suppose Person B wants to run off with a younger woman and leave person A and their kids. Suppose person B evaluated the consequences of losing his spouse, their children, and his wealth from the split, but still decides he wants to do it; that the gain outweighs the loss. By this logic, it is not wrong for him with respect to his cost analysis. Once again, however, his decision would almost certainly be wrong for his family and their own self-interest and needs. In reality, I think Person B would likely have feelings, sensibilities, empathy, and core beliefs which would factor into his cost analysis and perhaps prevent him from making such a decision. If this were so, it could alter what is right for person B because all of these things factor into how he makes choices: namely, his cost analysis and decision-making 'algorithms'.

When applying this logic to contracts, it becomes clear that they are only valid as long as they are deemed by each party to be in their own best self-interest. If a party evaluates the consequences of breaking the contract, but still deems breaking it worth the consequences, if follows that it is not wrong for them to break it. Rather, it is perhaps bad for the other parties involved so they won’t like it and may think the action wrong and do what is in their power to rebalance their own self-interest or serve consequences to the contract-breaker (which should factor into the cost analysis of the contract-breaker before their decision is made). In the real world, the long term fallout and the set of consequences that result from breaking a contract is often enough of a deterrent to give contracts a kind of general stability (though not in all cases and perhaps only for a certain time frame).

If someone lies to get what they want or to generate advantage while understanding the risks and consequences and after a careful evaluation and cost analysis with their decision-making algorithms, it follows that it is not wrong for them to do so with respect to their personal self-interest (though in typical fashion, it may be wrong for someone else).

If selflessness is ultimately selfish and right and wrong are ultimately built on self-interest, what is right for you and what is right for someone else may be entirely different; **right and wrong are only objectively definable with respect to one’s goals and personal cost analysis algorithms**.

I speculate many will say, “People would do horrible things all the time and the world would fall apart if this were true,” but I disagree.

Even if human beings are inescapably self-interested, this does not make us evil or vindictive or prevent us from building successful societies that most of us can benefit from. Just because what is right for one person with respect to their happiness is not always right for another with respect to theirs, does not mean that this is always the case.

Indeed, it is often the case that our needs and interests overlap. People are interdependent. We need each other to meet our needs. People must give to get. People may be kind because if they are rude or cruel, people will dislike them and they’ll be unable to meet their own needs. People have emotions and feelings; empathy and programming to gain happiness from those they love or are emotionally close to. I think it could be argued that we are programmed to do nice things for the people we cherish and, quite frankly, we must if we want to keep them. I think many people hold core beliefs that it is right or the correct and proper way to live to treat people well (though again, I speculate many people haven’t thought it through as well as they think and practice hypocrisy in their principles as explained above).

Some I have spoken with have presented love as something pure and unselfish. I do not think love is a good example of human selflessness.  We each get something out of love whether we want to admit it or not. Love is selfish -- an exchange of goods to meet each other’s needs. It has been said that to fall in love is to desire to own. Suppose Person A acknowledges that love is temporary and that all relationships inevitably end for one reason or another (either because of death or because one or more parties opt out) so they don’t get too attached or possessive. Their behavior is still ultimately rooted in self-interest: perhaps to avoid future pain or perhaps out of a desire to see things as they are and act accordingly.

Regarding the belief that chaos would ensue if this logic were correct, even if right and wrong don’t really inherently exist and are just human constructs for self-interest, I still think it makes sense that laws and punishment exist because consequences factor into our choices and cost analysis. **A community with similar goals might want to set up a standard of rules for mutual self interest and then have consequences to protect the interests of the majority.** I think it could be argued that discrimination, slavery, tyranny, and so on, eventually work themselves out because they are things that are not in the best self-interest of those oppressed and so the oppressed end up fighting those in power and appeal to the empathy of those around them. People unaffected might be moved to help those oppressed due to their empathy or varying factors of their cost analysis. By my conclusion, slavery is not inherently right or wrong, it is right or wrong with respect to something; we deemed it wrong because of push back from those whose self-interest was harmed and because of the empathy of human beings who are programmed to feel another's pain and put themselves in their shoes.

I think a problem with inherent right and wrong is that it turns into a game of “Who said so?” Person A says it’s wrong to hurt something living. Person B says, “Who says so? Why?” Person A lists some of our failed criteria from above. Even if 100% of humanity agreed on a code for right and wrong, it would not be inherent, but rather what we as a community decided based on cost analysis; balancing our inescapable drive for self-interest as best we could for mutual benefit. Would the universe care that 100% of humanity agreed that murder was wrong? No, I do not think it would. If someone shot me in the head right now, I would not like it because it is not what I want and not in my best self-interest, but I cannot argue that it is inherently wrong. What I can do is agree with my neighbor that neither of us want to be shot in the head and form a mutually beneficial contract with consequences to ensure the other sticks with it. My neighbor and I have just labeled an action ""wrong"" with respect to our self-interest and agreed to a contract with consequences to motivate the other party to keep their word.

Right and wrong are words for things that we like or do not like; things that are bad for us or good for us; things that go against our programming or core beliefs and things that do not.

Regret can be explained by people having inadequate information and making the best cost analysis judgement they can, but realizing later it was a poorer decision than they could have made. We as individuals do not know so much. We are always learning and changing. Sometimes, we cannot see the consequences that will result from our choices or we think they will not affect us in the way that they do. Learning something can result in regret because sometimes we realize we could probably have been happier than we are or have more than we do now if we had made different choices.

**Ultimately, I think right and wrong are not inherent, but rather the end result of self-interest. I think this means that what is right and wrong for one person may not always be what is right and wrong for another. Despite this, people are interdependent, share the same basic human needs, and often share the same goals which leads us to construct rules and standards for our mutual benefit as a species.**

My particular view and conclusion on this may be unpopular, but the overarching point I'm hoping to make is that **right and wrong can exist without god(s). Indeed, as covered above, using god(s) to determine what is right and wrong has a number of problems.**

To say that right and wrong cannot exist without god(s) is to say that self-interest cannot exist without god(s) because that is what right and wrong are ultimately derived from.

There are many more papers that due far more justice to the topic than I am here and certainly many more papers with views on right and wrong that are easier to swallow.

I'd like to add that selfishness is not inherently or necessarily a bad thing. I cannot help but notice whenever I say people are selfish, at least some of my audience cringes. It's a loaded word and one that has a lot of connotations for some people (particularly if you are or were a Christian I suspect), but I think it's important to understand it's a part of human nature and that it can result in the development of standards for our mutual benefit just as much (if not more) as it can contribute to our detriment.

Again, thank you for your time and best of luck

As an aside and continuation of the right and wrong address, I'd like to add that Scandinavia is almost entirely atheist and they aren't ripping each other to shreds as immoral heathens.

Quite the contrary, Scandinavia has some of highest satisfaction of life in the world.

This is one example of why claiming atheists are immoral or destructive to society are not good arguments.

---

Somethings I left out of this paper were the various logical paradoxes associated with an omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent being like Yahweh.

Additionally, I did not discuss a lot of Christian Apologetics (the teleological argument, the ontological argument, and the moral argument are a few examples).

Suffice it to say, these arguments are fallacies that have been addressed thoroughly and repeatedly. They do not hold up to scrutiny and very plainly do not make sense.

I did not include a section on Christian Apologetics because the problems with the argument in question can typically and easily be found with a cursory Google search (that, and I ran out of character space).

Perhaps in the future, I'll make a compilation of my own, but for now, there are others (I am aware Dawkins and Boghossian cover them in *The God Delusion* and *A Manual for Creating Atheists* respectively).

I know when I was a Christian, the titles alone of those books would have predisposed me not to read or respect those books, so if anyone would like to share any arguments in the comments, I'd be glad to discuss them with you.

Thank you again for your time and understanding. I hope the read was valuable to you and all the rest."

I' am an intern at a company as a part of my IT education. I have been given the assignment to map, look into and assess the general set-up of the local network and Wi-Fi. I was told to take it on as if I' am out at a new client and trying assess what their current setup is and what could be missing/improved.

Currently I have made a small overview as a starting point, but it would be awesome if you guys could help me look it over and see if I missed anything I definately should be documenting:

What is present? (Brands, models, firewalls, cabling versions)

What is physically present? (How many APs, switches, routers, cables, servers)

What are the configurations? (elaborate, what could be improved? what is missing?)

Mark things up. (mark up cables and devices so its easy to see where it goes or what it belongs to. Does the current marked up names correlate with config names?)

I hope I dont come out as a complete moron, this is my first time handling anything like this, everything else I've done so far has been pure theoretical at school. But I hope you are willing to lend your knowledge and input, it will be greatly appriciated!"
51ets3,0,2016-09-06,Help Dealing With An IT Department,CupcakeofDeath,InformationTechnology,https://www.reddit.com/r/InformationTechnology/comments/51ets3/help_dealing_with_an_it_department/,"I basically just need to know if this is possible, so I know whether my IT department is being honest with me or, more likely, is just being lazy. It's a long post, but I'd really appreciate some ideas.

Basically, I'm a gappie at an Australian boarding school - what this means is, I'm an on-campus staff member, taking a gap year before uni - basically, I'm a glorified intern. However, it is paid - we get a monthly salary that's nowhere near minimum wage, and the rest of our payment is through a house that we're given for the year, plus services like water, electricity, and internet.

Originally, we were on the school's staff wifi at home, because the former gappies had broken the hardware or something (no one would give us a straight answer as to what exactly was wrong) but after a month or so we got a new network that was faster, but still had the same restrictions as the staff internet for the school, which includes, among other things, gaming services like Steam or Battle.net.

Since we're a residence, and part of our payment is in internet access, it's a bit annoying that we're not provided all services, but when I've talked to them, I've gotten two separate excuses: 1) the network can't handle the load of gaming, and 2) the profiles haven't been set up to allow for gaming. The idea that it would take up too much bandwidth is ridiculous because this is a school that holds about 500 people during the day while we work, and drops to about 60 altogether in the evenings, all of whom except for the two of us are banned from anything high-intensity, and because we've been able to download big files (like 25 GB) and stream HD shows and movies at high speeds on multiple devices at the same time. The issue with profiles is, I believe, that our IT department is incredibly lazy - every time I go in there to ask about it, they're messing around on Reddit or something, then say they're too busy to fix it.

So, what I've asked them for is to have our gaming unblocked on our private network after 8 o'clock, since that's when the students all have to hand in their devices and go offline anyways, so we wouldn't be taking bandwidth from people who need it, and possibly over the weekends or school breaks. I know it's a long story to get up to this point, but my question is basically is it possible for an IT department to do something like this - as in set up the network to unblock certain services within a certain time frame?

51euxw,1,2016-09-06,Update 001: Start learning,skysailer,spacesailing,https://www.reddit.com/r/spacesailing/comments/51euxw/update_001_start_learning/,"hello folks. Apparently you are still here and reading this, i want to say thank you for your interest.

Since my first post a few weeks ago there have been some changes in my plans. Don´t worry, i didn´t give up already.

Due to the extremely complicated university regulations in germany i  was unable to enroll at Tübingen university. My ""high school"" degree only allows me to study at Universities of Applied Sciences, in german ""Fachhochschulen"". Tübingen University is none of those.  Unfortunately the degree i am aiming at is only availabe at normal Universities.  

Luckily for me, there is a loophole in these regulations. The federal state of Hessen has a law in place that allows people with the *Fachhochschulreife* to study at any University within Hessen. Of course there are exceptions for courses with state examination, but for me it works. Kinda unfortunately, the only possible candidate is the Goethe University in Frankfurt. 
Its name of course will look nice on a resume later, but for now it brings a few problems with it:  

* Its in Frankfurt. Next to Berlin and Munich probably the most expensive city to live in   
* the tution fees are 3 times higher than in Tübingen. Now while that seems kinda bullshit, it still is only 340€ per semester, so around 700€ per year. That means till i got my Master it will cost me at least 3500€. If you are a US student at a private University reading this you are probably screaming internally. Don´t forget, the state pays students around 150-180€ per month during your college time simply for studying.  
* Its still in Frankfurt. My car will probably be useless most of the time. driving to campus with a car in one of the busiest cities is a very bad idea, so i will need to public transport and bikes. Also cost a bit of money. 

While there are publicy funded student dorms that cost half of private appartments, the waiting list is long. The women on the phone told me it could take up to 6 month. Kinda bad when the semester starts in 3 weeks. 
That means till i get a place there i´ll have to bite the bullet and rent something expensive, that is available immediatly.
 
Now i know this would put a lot of people off and make then choose a different college, but this is no option for me, and i don´t want to give up before it even started. 

Now that that´s said, we need to talk about something as important as education, and that is physical health. Currently i would describe myself as an average dude. I am neither an athelete nor am i fat. I weigh 71kg at approx 178cm(i need to measure myself again...). The fattest i ever was, was during my internship at DHL, were i weighed around 80kg.   
That was mostly due to sitting 8 hours a day, with lots of sugary drinks and fast food. After the internship i dropped down to 70kg immediatly, and have since stayed there.   
Getting in shape should be quite easy. the college offers sports programms for free, a good way to socialize and meet new people.   
Staying in shape for the next 10 years will be a lot harder. Keeping a training routine when are constantly on the move will be a challenge, for which i haven´t yet found a solution. But first things first, i gotta buff up.    
Walking into the interview with biceps like John Cena will probably put them off. I assume what they want to see is physical endurance. That means lots of cardio, the abbility to sustain high Gs for some time and work under extreme conditions (it can get really hot in these suits).
I know for sure that one test you have to pass is sitting in a repilca crew cabin for 2 hours at around 36°C and still function normally. Really looking forward to that.


So, to bring this update to an end, here is a list of things i will have to start soon to stay on track with my plans:
1. start studying
2. enroll in at least 1 sport program
3. take advanced english classes and get language certs
4. start looking into meal plans and how to eat healthier
5. socialize more?
6. ???
7. space!

So I've been lurking this subreddit for a while as I go through looking for my second (first summer) internship. Ill explain my situation. I'm a student at UNC - Chapel Hill. I'm a sophomore Computer Science and Information Science (Networks concentration) major, I really want to go into IT but I have really nothing to show recruiters besides about a year's worth of experience working desktop support at one of the graduate schools (first internship). Besides that I have a pretty good (2 classes) experience in Java, and self-taught myself Python. I know the coding pretty much means nothing in IT but I'm hoping it could show my aptitude to learn. Right now, I'm planning on just being honest on what I got right now and seeing if they take me based on that and sheer hunger to learn. Can anyone help me with how I should talk to recruiters? I want to go into Networking but I'll admit I have little more than cursory knowledge of it (certainly not close to a CCNA's level). 

The first round of information sessions/career fairs are coming out and I'm going to admit that I'm freaking out about this. Any advice at all would be helpful. Thank you all in advance!"
51f3k7,2,2016-09-06,It's amazing how one person's gain can be another one's loss,EventHorizonMeltdown,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/51f3k7/its_amazing_how_one_persons_gain_can_be_another/,"I went to college today, only had one hour class, of course the hour went like it was a day long. I don't know how I will be able to handle the days where I have multiple classes.

This girl I liked a lot (I still do even after rejection, I try to move on, but a good part is still daydreaming) told me that after this year, she would go in a firm as an internship for 2 years before working there.
In my mind, it just meant that after 4 years with her boyfriend she probably wanted to go to the next step; living with him, both would be working and the next couple years it would either be a pregnancy or a marriage. Things would go very fast for her from this on. She's 22-23, I guess that the right age (even if a bit young by my standards but it's probably my bitterness who's talking)

And I realized that for this girl that I meant quite a lot to me (it was my first real crush) I wasn't much. She was excited when she told me about her future project after this year, so it's definitely good for her; she's starting her real adult life.

I will probably never see her again after this, and basically to her I will be nothing more than a college buddy, I will be forgotten the next year or the one after we go our own ways.
I don't know if the next year I will still be in love with her, I hope not. 

It hurt to see that we are not much to each other. I probably care much more than she will ever do. She already has her upcoming years sorted out; she gets her job, she lives with her boyfriend and after that it's gets really fast (marriage or 1st child)

Meanwhile I don't even have a car and I'm a 19 years old guy who doesn't know how he will handle the next day.
And when I look forward to see her, I shouldn't. We are not close and we shouldn't be. She doesn't think about me at night, she doesn't feel anything about me.

I feel like some teenager who gets sad over such pointless shit (you got a first failure in love, yeah just like everyone else did at some point)
But the fact that nothing good is happening for a while now, it's shitty. She would be one of the few things I care about anymore, but it's pointless. There is no place for me in her life, especially as a lover. And I don't want to be ""friend"" with a woman I have feelings for, because I would end chasing her for too long. 

I really have to put some distance, to be more distant, more cold but I can't.

Sorry for this rant who shouldn't be one. It's nothing, but seriously I jus want one good thing. To have a chance with her would have been the best.

I wanted to go study abroad for this year, so I could move on more easily and not see her anymore and it could make me grow as a person, it would have been really hard but I guess I could have overcome. But obviously I wasn't admitted.



I hope my text makes sense, I'm typing on a whim and I'm venting."

Since I've been here I've done more than I thought I would be doing and have been to things that I wouldn't think I would normally go to. Such as meetings with clients, 'competitions' for bids, etc. 

The company recently just bought me a computer, cost about 3k, and are sending me to California for a week in October (to attend Dreamforce). 

Normally I'd think around 6 months would be a good time to ask for some kind of raise, but since I recently got the expensive computer and will soon be getting the trip. I'm not sure. 

I do make a decent amount (60k salary), but when I first got my offer letter, the owner called to talk to me about it and said how much I would be getting and very nervous me just said 'Yeah that's great!' even though he blatantly asked if it was enough money.

I've been assigned a daunting (at least to me) task.

The company develops applications that have a very computation heavy side to them. Some of these computations can take days. They have asked me to look into cloud computing to reduce these computation times. Specifically they mentioned Amazon's EC2, Google cloud platform, and Azure and also asked me to consider an in house solution.

I'm completely flustered. All my prior experience has been in web development (I've never deployed or set up any applications, just worked on existing ones). So my knowledge is strictly in programming/app development. When I researched into building my own cloud infrastructure it seemed way out of my league! When I looked at the services EC2/GCP/Azure it seemed a little bit friendlier. What I'm having trouble getting my head around are these questions, any resources or docs are greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance =).

- How do I get machines in the cloud to start doing work (for example, I've seen the console interface for EC2, where i can log in with an account and 'start' an instance, but how do i work with that instance and get it to execute scripts/ run programs etc.. Furthermore, how can I do that programatically (instead of using a console).)

- How will the computation engine run on multiple machines. Is this just a matter of dividing input data and running the same program on multiple machines at the same time ? Is it dependent on the nature of the code ?

P.S Don't hesitate to tell me to read a 500 page book, I feel like this can be a great learning opportunity and I want to seize it."

We can discuss specific prompts in private and please, do not message me with a scene already started, that’s the easiest way to get blocked. The same goes for one line/word messages.

I'm fairly open with my kinks with my only hard ""no""s being scat, unrealistically huge cocks, 3rd person writing, and vomit.

Without further ado, here are some of my prompts:

**The Lawyer and the Con**: For this one, I was thinking I’d play a young and up and coming lawyer tasked with defending you. We can discuss the specifics in PMs but one thing is for certain, I’ll be taking my payment in the form of cock.

**Breaking the Law**: For this one, the roles are reversed, I was caught committing a crime and you’re the officer/journalist/detective who caught me. Where that leads? Well that’s up to you.

**Wrong neighborhood**: What happens when me, a young and sexy girl finds herself in the wrong neighborhood? Do you help me find my way or decide you want to take advantage?

**Sports Star and Reporter**: A classic scene were I’m a reporter and you’re the sports star, that can only lead one place, right?

**The intern and the boss**: Fairly self explanatory, I’d love to be the intern at her dream job who meets you, her boss and potentially so much more.

**I’m gonna fuck your sister**: For this one, you’ll play my little brother’s best friend, I’ll be his big sister who is now recently single and back in town. You guys always joked that you would fuck each other’s mom/sister only this time, you’re not joking.

**Giving back**: In this RP, I’ll play someone  famous be it an actress or singer or sports star. You’ll be the person tasked in helping me set up some sort of event to give back to the community, only you want me to give you something more than this event.

**Bullies always win**: In this one, you’ll be as the title suggests, you’re a bully who grew up terrorizing my son (or brother), only unlike the stories we tell our kids to make them feel better, you know better. You get what you want, when you want it, in this case, me.

For those of you so inclined, I do like playing celebs in any of these roles so we have visual aids, if you’d like me to be any, just ask!

As for celebs I’d play, here are a few:

Celebs: **Mary Elizabeth Winstead**, **Maisie Williams**, Anna Kendrick, Selena Gomez, Hailee Steinfeld, Taylor Swift, Willa Holland, Daisy Ridley, **Melissa Benoist**, Emma Stone/Watson/Roberts, Hayley Williams, Alison Brie, Alexandra Daddario, Aubrey Plaza, Bella Thorne, **Alicia Vikander** Jennifer Lawrence, Keri Russel, Neve Campbell, Jennifer Connelly, Scarlet Johansson, Sophie Turner, Oliva Munn, Olivia Wilde, **Miranda Kerr**, Jessica Biel/Alba, Victoria Justice

YouTube/Social Media: **Meg Turney**, Lia Marie Johnson, **Alli Speed**, Barbara Dunkelman, Ashley Jenkins, **Bree Essrig**, Maude Garrett, Trisha Hershberger, Datev Gallagher, Lindsey Stirling, Christina Grimme, Dodger, iJustine, or Meghan Camarena.

Whew, that was a lot. Hope to get some dirty orangereds soon!

51fwrw,14,2016-09-06,Considering change in career path,drainedenough,geologycareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/geologycareers/comments/51fwrw/considering_change_in_career_path/,"Lol, what career?

Recent graduate. ""Excellent"" (I strongly disagree personally, but everyone gives birth to kittens over it) school, decent grades. Thesis and internship under belt.

The industry and job market is almost in as bad of a situation as the housing market here.

So let me tell you what my plans were/are.

* Get a job, get money. Preferably something related to geology, environment, whatever, but I'll take anything. (And believe me, I have had several wide-eyed looks from interviewers) Get financially stable/independent. Save for a new car, because the one I had crossed over to the scrap yard. 

* Take grad-level courses if I can afford to. (spoiler: I can't.) I have to compensate for an ""average"" GPA and I know it.

* Study for the GRE. Both general and subject tests.

* Apply for more internships/apprenticeships, etc. Either in the workforce or in academia. Willing to go anywhere as long as someone will take me. Pray I can make good connections (future LOR writers, contacts, whatever) because I can't trust anyone at my alma mater. Curse the fact that I am not American so I'm not eligible for a lot of stuff.

* Get out of the country for the sake of my sanity. Do a Master's. Maybe.

As you can guess, things aren't going well. I've been doing some soul searching and I am more than familiar with life dreams not being for everyone.

One of the things I've been thinking about is how I don't think I can imagine working in the field that my thesis and internship were relevant to. Don't get me wrong, they were interesting, but I don't think I could do it for the rest of my life. All I know is that I would like to work with mass specs, chromatographs, and similar equipment.

I've spat at the field of geology out of frustration, and even considered going into computers (I know several programming languages. I'm not the best, but working with computers is something that comes naturally to me). Then I remember the time I almost lost my mind in second year due to family issues, and considered going to college to get a lab tech diploma.

I've also considered changing my field completely. I've thought of things from medical science to farming.

It doesn't have to be relevant to my thesis/internship, but I think lab work is at least somewhat relevant to a geologist and it could keep my options open. Or I can just become a hermit. So, some questions I guess.

* What would you recommend for a wannabe-lab tech?

* How do I unscrew myself for having past experience irrelevant to my current interests? Just to give you an idea of what I mean: A recent STEM internship at this environment conservatory/learning centre went to a Spanish major. The other students at the internship I was at were clueless and uninterested in the topic. I have no idea how they got there, and it felt like a slap in the face to have worked to know all these things, when they didn't even know what a mass spec was. 

I'm used to getting screwed over so I just want to be prepared. 
I'm applying for jobs and other programs (lots of relevant opportunities are opening up now, and if that doesn't work out, so are retail opportunities for Halloween and Christmas!), and will be attending a convention later this month. I'd appreciate any advice.

Thanks in advance."

51gekx,1,2016-09-06,Unsure about getting into an acting career...unsure of getting into any career! HELP ME !,confused_forever,Career_Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Career_Advice/comments/51gekx/unsure_about_getting_into_an_acting_careerunsure/,"big hello to everybody.
So, onto some history about me... I had rigorous studies back at high school. Got into the top 10 colleges  in my country. Just completed my Bachelors of technology in Electronic and communication Engineering. Have a job in IT starting this December.

I started to hate my major since my 3rd year. My grades fluctuated a lot, I had been the topper in one subject and just passed in another. Professors kept asking me why I'm wasting my potential. They said I was very smart and intelligent and was wasting away my life by not getting good grades(in subjects I just passed) and not doing undergrad research work in subjects I liked and topped in.

My parents were dissapointed.... finally did some research work in my final year, as my friend has insisted on having me as a projectmate. I didn't like the field(nanoelectronics), but nevertheless took it so that I could publish a paper and that would give me an upper hand in getting into a master of science program in the US.
Paper publishing got delayed and I had applied to universities abroad because I had to tell something to my parents and the relatives-lurking spectators of my life.

Got rejected by all the universities. Have a job in IT...a field I don't give a fuck about. My job starts this december.
 My parents know I'm utterly confused. They know I don't want the job. They want me to be happy and stable in life.

So they(my parents) suggested I should prepare for CAT- a  competitive exam to get into the prestigious Indian Institute of Management- since I'm capable of getting in.
I said no, since in my opinion there's no point in getting an MBA  when I don't know the kind of jobs my subordinates are doing and plus i don't want to start my own business. I observed that people get an MBA to start a business or lead an existing one.

Then my parents suggested I get into the Administrative services since I will be a great fit for that too. I know the kind of luxuries and ammenities and 'prestige' one gets in that career as a close friend of my familys' is in the services. But I don't want that due to reasons such as corruption or getting caught in the corruption scandal of your higher-up, being limited in your efficacy at the job due to powerful higher-ups-most of them corrupt. Plus I had no purpose for choosing that career.

So my parents gave me the supposed ""freedom"" to choose my career. 
I was not sure where to start , I was not passionate about anything. I was and still am the sought of person who never knew what I wanted for the next 40yrs of my life.
The thing that scares me most is when my parents say I have to stick to one job for life if I want stability or success. And I have soo many interests ... I'm like a jack of all trades and master of none.

Anyhow, I used to be good at drawing and painting and arts in general. I self-learnt illustrator and photoshop and people said they liked my work. So I interned as a graphic designer at old and big comapany. It had very commercial vibe, and even the designs I did were constrained, artisically. I completed my internship and decided this cannot be my job full time. I got some freelance work after that. So did the feeelancing at my home ,to my parents slight discomfort and weariness about whether I was thinking of freelancing full time. 

Then I was unsure where to head again. My parents were presenting me the same options as before MBA or civil services. I refused. 
 
However I hit a point where I had to reveal to my parents ,my longstanding interest to be an actor. Something that made my parents feel dreadful and pained ,like someone hit their heads with thors hammer...
So I was also unsure about acting. I have always liked those great actors and their skills and acting finesse, but I have dreadfully hated the other stuff that gets attached to the profession-loss of privacy, affairs, casting couch, directors producers or actors asking actresses for sexual favours in return for a role, burnout,etc. Beside its hard to get big in showbiz. Also its a very unprestigious profession , specially for women,as per my parents. I know its difficult ,moreso for a woman who's starting out. 

So I am doubtful again. But nevertheless my parents gave me the option of doing a diploma in method acting. I found a good institute and have payed for the 6 month course.

The classes start next week and I'm dreading the possibility of having taken a wrong decision and of wasting my parents' money! Plus , I feel acting might not mentally stimulate me like studying does.

My parents are tongue tied when relatives or friends ask them what have I chosen as my career. There's so much of societal pressure, I feel I am hurting my parents and at the same time hurting myself by admonishing myself for taking so much time to think about a career I want rather than a career the society/parents expects is fit for me.

I'm soo much in a bad place now ! I need some help on how I can reach a decision to pursue the career of a lifetime! What do I do now ?!"
51gkal,1,2016-09-06,[M4F]-The future face of fetish fashion,xxMrJxx,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/51gkal/m4fthe_future_face_of_fetish_fashion/,"The fashion world was no stranger to kink but the break out designer Mr J was the talk of London fashion week when he shocked all who attended. He sent his summer collection down the catwalk where each model’s key accessory was Mr J's cum all over their face. The line of dresses where each designed as a single piece of beautifully embroiled fabric held to the body by complex shibari.

This bold statement clearly impressed as during the year Mr J has hand tied many celebrity in his creations, before sending them down the red carpet. That said only one starlet made her way down the red carpet wearing Mr J on her face too. Mr J's success doesn’t end there either, his studio has been filled with a veritable who's who of the sexist women alive. All trying to join his harem of muses for his next adventure 

So here's where you come in, I'm starting my new venture and you have either applied to an open casting call or perhaps your already a star and requested my services. I'm happy for real or original starlets but if you do go real please give a few options. 

The Catwalk: looking for new models to show off my latest collection. Exhibitionists are required.

The Fitting: an opportunity for socialites and heiresses to be fitted for the latest must have garment.

The Cover Shoot: I'm shooting a fetish cover for a fashion magazine and am looking for a photographer who can work with me to create a shared erotic vision

The Book: I'm putting together a book of celebrities in fetish situations, the twist though is that no one is to be identified in the book so views are left guessing who's who.

The Album: I'm putting together a concept album where the music is a mix of the growls, sighs and moans of my instruments along with the hits on their skin and the lead singer being toyed with throughout recording.

The Music Video: the theme of the video is pony girl chariot racing and Roman orgy. Lots of different position to fill on this set.

The Internship: I'm in need of a new seamstress and secretary, a good place for the more innocent to start.


So please include your project, who you are, a bit about both your look and personality why you want to work with Mr J. also a warning I’m a slow writer so this will be more of a long term thing.

I eventually want to become a systems administrator but I notice most job postings ask for a bachelors degree in a related area or equivalency with at least 2 years of experience in field or related area. My college has a program that partners with local businesses and has led me to an internship which will also lead to full time employment after my graduation to my understanding. So my question is would my associates degree and a few years of experience in the field be enough to stand on or should I just go for the bachelors? Thanks in advance!

As the title mentions, I was one of the few that failed the NAPLEX my first time. In summary, I rushed it and didn't prepare for it like I should have, so now I'm retooling my studying and refocusing making sure I pass it the second time around. (Now, please don't comment on how easy the NAPLEX is or how I could have failed the exam, that I'm not meant to be a pharmacist....Look, I failed, I take 100% responsibility, moving on.) Anyways, I'm currently a grad intern at ABC pharmacy and was thinking about quitting due to the reduced hours and pay I'm getting (not able to afford my apartment since it's far from my parent's home, car insurance, etc). 

I wanted to know what you're opinions are in terms of getting a job during this time, while I'm studying for the retake if I leave my position. I've had hospital experience working throughout my years at pharmacy school and was thinking about applying for a per diem Pharm Tech position. However, I understand, coming from a director/management position that it's not beneficial to hire someone that will potentially pass their board exams in a couple of months.

Just want some advice in terms of job opportunities out there that I can capitalize on, given my situation.

Thanks!"

Police sirens now and then, the damning smell of cans haunting my nose. And the metallic smell that accompanied it, the smell of blood.

Everyone had done that “trick”. My son, my brother, the president, even my damn wife.

But it was over. One way or another, we don’t know how, but it was finally fucking over.

We did everything, we even went as far as analysing the sun rays for anything that would cause people to do it. Nothing. Fucking nothing. 

But it was at the tip of our noses the whole time, the fucking water. 

***TRANSCRIPTION OF WATER PLANT WORKER AND SUBJECT Z30N***

Judius Mare: Uh, so why do you want to get in here? 

Subject Z30N: *critter noise* help *More critters, accompanied by what sounds like the subject defeacating* human. 

Judius Mare: Oh, alright then, go right in sir. 

*Subject Z30N walks into the water plant with a red glowing rock, later identified as Material D1C-c* 

*Subject, after approx. 10 minutes, flies out of the door and smashes through a window* 

*Judius Mare slept through most of the ordeal*


***TRANSCRIPTION END***  

The water. People drank water, **they needed water.**

I pull down my pants to see my skinless boner still intact. Last week, I succumbed, and I have only survived this ordeal through a miracle.

I did the SBT, too. Hell knows what got a hold of me. But it was really just a matter of seconds, one minute Im finish my Pepsi Cola, the next, I lay on the floor feeling the sun scorch my red cock.

I don’t know how I did not bleed out, 3 damn days, for 3 damn days,I stayed inside my house with less food than in an african’s stomach. I survived, I ate bugs, I ate roaches, drank my own urine, I couldn’t go outside, not with them up there, in the sky. I knew they did this, but I don’t know what they wanted from us.

One day, It came down to me, there was no help coming, the rare government broadcasts about ‘help’ were just automated, the same damn voice, the same damn broadcast at 5:30 PM, It drove me insane. I snapped like a twig, reached into my drawer and pulled out my pistol, ready to finally release myself from this Hell, I wanted to take one last look at the ‘things’ that did this. 
They were not there, gone, completely lost, fucking gone with not a single trace.

I sifted through my desk, searching for the pictures I had taken of them the day before. Then I found that newspaper.

**“African-American ‘SBT’ Enthusiast Shot Into Space, Police Negligence Is to Blame “**

I don’t know how, but it all came down to me in a single moment. Space, SBT, African-Americans. They all connected like dotted lines following eachother.

‘’Yes’’, I muttered to myself ‘’Yes, it makes sense now.’’. 
I felt like a madman, I rambled on and on about how it went down, for hours, several hours. 
I knew the truth. I knew who did this, but nobody was there to listen. But I knew the truth, I didn’t have a revenge in my mind, and I do not know what kind of relief it was, but it was there, and it was bliss. 

The clock hit midnight, and it was now the Fifth of October. I laid in bed and recoiled as the blanket pushed on my skinless cock, and rolled over.
98% of the male population was dead, around 70% of women just committed suicide or was killed by the government for ‘’Safety Reasons’’, martial law was declared not short after 

The WHO placed SBT on the watchlist.They seemed to know something about SBT, they always  seemed to know about everything. With some unholy way, they’d find where diseases originate from almost as if they put the disease  there. 
I took my pistol, I staggered my way out of the  house, headed to the nearest supermart for supplies. 
I ransacked shelves cherishing the burned down parts of the buillding, I only took what I needed, around 5 bottles of water, some chips and bread. 

**[JOURNAL CUT HERE, THE SUBJECT GOES ON AFTER WHAT IS SPECULATED TO BE 5 DAYS]**

**10TH OF OCTOBER, 20??**

I found it, I finally did. 
The World Health Organization’s center, it took me to long to travel here, but it wasn’t much trouble with me finding abandoned cars in every highway. 

I stepped inside and went down as far as I could using the seemingly never-ending staircase, the walls kept getting colder and more metalic with each floor I went down.
I was almost sure I was dead and this was limbo, but the large futuristic door I saw changed my mind. 
There was a one way mirror where the peek-hole should be, I guessed it was a peekhole since there were no cameras around.
I knocked, I didn’t know if it would help, but I knocked. 
‘’Who’s there?..’’ Came from behind the door, I should’ve been surprised, but I was glad.
‘’Depends on who’s there’’ I said, the guy took that I was a  smartass and I heard a few button clicks before the large door slowly opened.
Behind the door stood what looked like a scientist, but he looked sick, rather tipsy and depressed. 
‘’Are you here to kill me or, or worse?..’’ 
I muttered out a ‘’No’’ before I  stepped inside, he stood aside, looking at my sure movements,  almost as if he thought I knew what I was doing.
‘’What goes down here’’
‘’If I told you, I’d probably have to kill us both’’.
I took that not as a warning, but a silent scream for hopelessnes.

**[JOURNAL SEEMINGLY NOT CONTINUED FOR SEVERAL HOURS]**

He explained it all to me, a machine. A curse and a blessing. The machine that could think. 
I can’t write it all down, but I can think about everything that could be done, he said to me I could and most likely would have to do what no human should ever do, but I was going to save the world, I was going to be a  hero.
He’s inside, preparing the machine as I write this down, I can hear every button click and lever pull.
~~God help me.~~ 

**Let me help you, God.** 

**[END OF JOURNAL]**

Material D1X-nb4ls was found in a  grass field, the report of Material D1X-nb4ls came from a farmer who was doing his every-day walk. He read through the journal and thought to himself that it was the scramblings of a mentally ill person, he took the Material to the police station, one of our interns who work there brought the attention on it.

My real question is, does a Masters really 'overweigh' a Bachelors or would the year placement be a lot more valuable when trying for a post graduate job?

Edit:
What if I could do a master's and summer intern during the four years?

After speaking around, another option that arose would be to complete a BSc, get a job and part time study for an MSci which might boost my future career prospects?"

I'm currently doing a Bachelors in Arts in Math/Econ with a minor in Statistics at a State University. 

I have no job experience what so ever in this field and I have not done any Internships. Academically I am not the best I only have a 3.118 Cumulative but a University GPA of 3.70 for the past year.

I'm concentrating most of my course work in quantitative classes doing upper level statistics courses (multivariate, regression analysis etc.)  that requires statistical programming and a couple of other Econ courses with the same emphasis such as Econometrics and Forecasting.

I will pretty much have the same skillset as a person with a Bachelors in Statistics in exception of doing complex proofs and numerical analysis. 

Ill be skilled STATA, R and SAS by the time I graduate.

I am planning to pursue a Graduate degree in Statistics afterward since i wont be so far off from obtaining one.


Preferably I would like to work in Finance.

I thought that Pro Tools had fixed this issue and didn't allow you to record when the sample rate on the converter was set to something different then the session. I recently let an intern set up a session and he choose 44.1 I didn't catch the fact that the converters were set to 48 until it was too late. Now if I try exporting anything the audio sounds slowed down.

The only way I know how to fix this is to open up the session and have the converters set to 48 so it plays back normally then output the tracks to another machine/computer/interface.

I started taking stimulants about 2.5 years ago and it felt amazing. For the first time in my life it was easy to concentrate, understand what I read, and be productive. I've been balancing a life as a PhD student, a consultant, a research assistant, a project manager, a mentor and an intern. Since I started taking stimulants, I never had a drug vacation until now. I just spent the last month unmedicated and I've learnt a hell of a lot about how the meds affect me and reminded me of who I was before meds. Now, I'm not sure I want to go back on them. 

The pros: mindfog is gone; I can focus everyday; I can understand everything I read (as opposed to the opposite); I can focus on conversations; I'm productive; I can focus on my clients and my surroundings easily; my anxiety is reduced; I sleep better; my tolerance to  frustration is increased 

The cons: I'm less excitable (and i was normally a very excitable person); my emotions are flattened, things that are amazing only feel great and things that are devastating are just bad; my sex drive disappears which is not great for my relationship (but my s/o is amazing and understands); I'm less creative;  I remember fewer events in my life; I'm exhausted after my meds wear off, I crash hard; and it's hard to feel motivated to do anything social. 

So I feel like I'm in a tough spot and with  this upcoming academic year being busier than ever (dissertation proposal, comprehensive exam, etc) I'm scared of not being productive. But at the same time, I missed feeling things so intensely as I used to and I miss having intimacy with my s/o.  I didn't really have a question, I just needed to unload a bit and with who better than people who might understand what I'm going through. Although, feel free to share similar experiences! It would be great to hear what others have done in similar circumstances. "

51hvui,1,2016-09-06,What can I do to look more appealing to employers?,FantasticMrChris,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/51hvui/what_can_i_do_to_look_more_appealing_to_employers/,"About me: I live in LA county. I graduated from UCI in June of last year (2015) with a degree in CS. After I graduated, I looked for an entry level position or programming/software development internship for 3-4 months, without success. After a while I started looking into alternatives (I couldn't afford to go on without a job) and I'm currently a substitute teacher for LA Unified. My current occupation pays the bills, but it's no where near where I want to be. My biggest regret is that I did not look for internship positions while in college. I have no professional experience, and I feel this is my biggest issue.

What are some steps I can take or things I could do to get back on track? I'm looking for any advice/mentorship that could potentially push me in the right direction.

Here are some things I'm considering:
-Pursue a Master's degree (My biggest concern with this is recommendations, after being away from school for so long, I don't know that there is anyone I can ask for a decent recommendation).
-Begin a side project (I have a few ideas for a mobile and/or web app, nothing ground breaking, but maybe it would help convince employers that I am passionate and capable.)
-Apply for internships (I'm more than willing to be a part of an internship that will help me demonstrate and refine my skills. However, most require that I currently pursue a BS/MS)

I would very much appreciate input from current industry leaders/players, or maybe even someone who was in a similar position. Thanks in advance."
51hwta,6,2016-09-06,"Anyone familiar with the NY area, where would you recommend I try to go when I graduate?",jimmpony,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/51hwta/anyone_familiar_with_the_ny_area_where_would_you/,"I'm graduating with a CompSci BS this spring from a college somewhere in the Hudson Valley. I'm going to have to move somewhere to start interviewing after that because [there are no jobs here](http://i.imgur.com/iCXisag.png). NYC is the obvious answer, but is there anywhere else in the state or near the state that someone would recommend, with a lower COL than NYC? I could just commute to NYC (an hour or two away) but I'd rather not live there or have to commute. I hope it's not the case that all of NY besides NYC is just a tech wasteland.

It might also be a factor that because there are no jobs or internships here, I've not been able to have any jobs or internships. One internship opportunity was actually open that supposedly was looking for CompSci majors a year or so ago (local power company), but I didn't get it. I've tried getting work experience online, but the only offer I ever got was someone asking me to work for free (potential equity or something else equally worthless) for their sketchy startup. All I have is [personal projects like these](http://chip8.progr.am/) and that I've been volunteering on two large scale Unity3D games for a few years. So, maybe it would need to be somewhere with more startups or otherwise positions that pay below market rate, at least at first. Some people say you're literally unemployable if you didn't get any internships, others say you're fine, so I don't really know what to believe there."

They've set up some interviews with XTX and are in the process of arranging some others. They seem reasonable but has anyone here dealt with them before? Anything to look out for?

A bit about me: I'm finishing up my PhD and am looking to start a career as a quant. My only experience in finance is an internship with KCG. I have a full-time offer from them but I want to get at least a few offers so I can weigh my options."

Today was my first day at work, as an intern, and I had to bring my own laptop, since the company's HQ is still a work in progress. Unfortunately, my 4 year old PC almost went nuclear as I tried to work with a 2GB Photoshop file (yeah, today I learned not to do do that again...)

So, what kind of computer should I be looking for? And how much would it be acceptable for me to tell my boss to spend in a computer?


Aditional info: 

I'm living in Brazil.
Photosho and CorelDraw are pre heavier programs I'll be running on the computer. I might end up using Ilustrator as well, but I don't know how it compares to the other two. I'll also be working with Wordpress a lot, but since that's mostly on the web browser it's probably not as important / computer-melting


If there's anything else you need to know I'll be happy to tell you all about it!"
51i6cn,20,2016-09-06,Getting that first Junior iOS Dev Job,HeyImDoc,iOSProgramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSProgramming/comments/51i6cn/getting_that_first_junior_ios_dev_job/,"A little backstory:

I'm 18 years old and got kicked out of the house a couple months ago and am currently staying with a friend. With $1100 left in my bank account I spent $680 on a macbook and have been coding here for a while. I have been doing iOS development since the age of 12 and have 13 apps in the iTunes Store. Now, they're obviously not the greatest of apps, but each app displays a certain skillset such as Core Data, JSON parsing, MapKit, etc.

At this point I can't go to school and I need to find a job as soon as possible so I can move out and go on with my life. I've taken the following steps to look for a job (I'm trying to stay as local (Orange County, CA) as possible for reasons I don't necessarily want to disclose):

- LinkedIn Jobs
- Indeed
- Monster
- Stack Careers
- Messaged lead devs working for local companies via LinkedIn

I do have an update resume which is very neat and displays all my skills. I also have a website which is my blog where I post what I'm learning, and I have a small youtube channel where I post basic videos teaching iOS Development. In addition, I have a GitHub account for hiring managers to look over all my repos. For privacy reasons I don't want to share any of it on here, however these are the skills I currently hold:

- Swift
- Xcode
- AutoLayout (iOS 9 Constraints)
- Git
- Core Data
- XCTests
- RESTful Services
- TableViews, UICollectionViews
- Multithreading (GCD)
- Firebase SDK

I've also worked with many frameworks such as MapKit, Social framework, AVFoundation, etc.

I've been called in for many interviews and have passed many rounds but as soon as I get to the end the company usually finds someone more senior or they pass on me. I got really close to this one startup that said I passed all the rounds and I was told by my recruiter that the other candidates got rejected and we started negotiating salaries, but after I gave my number they went silent for a couple weeks. According to my recruiter they lost a big project they were trying to get and have a couple more products coming into the future and will contact me when they get those, but I can't sit back and wait for that.

 I understand that not having a degree works against me, but I also recognize that many people are self starters and are able to attain programming jobs without one.  

The fact that I haven't been to school to get my comp sci degree is enough to show that I don't really have my fundamentals down. I can create a mini social media app using firebase sdk or create an app that scans ups barcodes and sends those to a service which returns the ingredients, YET I do not know how to build a compiler from scratch. My understanding of algorithms is very basic, as well as data structures. If any of you try to have a conversation with me about trees and nodes I'll have a VERY rough idea about what you're talking about. So in this regard, I'm lacking.

I'm making it a point to practice iOS development day in and day out(today I've been learning using SQLite with Swift) and am just wondering if I'm missing anything?

EDIT: Just came home to find quite a few encouraging replies! I'm going to check out angelList and the SM internships for you all and continue to update :)

EDIT #2: Have been using angel.co for a while, and matched with a couple of startups. I have an interview this Wednesday :)"

After owning laptops for so many years, I'm finally deciding to start my desktop since I am about to graduate. After my internship I saved around 1,100 for this build. This build is suppose to last me a bit before I have to upgrade, but by then I'll have a bigger budget. I have windows 10 64 bit already and a monitor which is why I did not include it. For my case situation, still looking for a mid tower. I'm just looking for any criticism for my build or if there can be any improvements. I am not very knowledgeable in this field as many others, so I am afraid I am over looking something that really should be taken accounted for. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

If you're interested in role play and you're looking for some inspiration...

Tax season is always rough at our firm, but today had left me utterly exhausted; endless number-crunching, lazy interns, and more documents than one should have to sign in a lifetime had left me with one thing on my mind: fulfilling that inner desire that, deep down, makes all men the same...

During the limo ride home, I imagined all of the things I knew my wife would never let me do to her anymore... Who knew that a ring could tame a slut so easily? No, I needed a new fantasy, a new girl to fulfill my desires, someone younger, with nice perky tits and an ass that would shake when I spank it...

My fantasies were interrupted when my driver opened the partition and said we had arrived home.

Home? No. A house. I'd owned it for only a year since we last moved, but I'd never fucked anyone in it, this was a house.

I arrived to this house to find my wife scolding a young girl I had never seen before. She looked at her feet with shame (which must have been difficult considering her sizable chest, only barely being held in by a flimsy tank top) while my bitch of a wife chewed her out.

""If you don't stop moving my shit around, you're going right back to working fast food young lady!"" she howled, and stormed out.

""Hello sir"", she stammered, if my wife was this awful she was clearly scared of me, ""I'm Tiffany...""

Turn ons: Age play, control (though not excessive BDSM), cock worship, spanking, and I'm sure you'll find plenty more...

Turn offs: Scat, gore, pain, etc

To knock out the basics- LOOKING FOR:
-4 door
-$2k-$5k
-Automatic
-Commutes to work and between cities


So I just moved to Houston from Austin for an internship and realized how screwed I am without a car. I currently have about $2000 saved up that I could put towards one, and by the end of my internship (mid-December), I think I could save up about $5k. I have about a 15 mile round trip commute to work daily. I will be driving between cities like Austin, San Antonio, and Houston fairly often, but am not looking for much else- just something that runs well for cheap and has A/C.

I have never owned a car and was never really taught anything about them so I have no idea where to start or what to look for. Is Craigslist reliable? And from there, what kind of model and year should I look for? 

I'm simply looking for a running car within my price range that isn't going to crap out on me after a few weeks of use (I've heard horror stories). Any advice is appreciated!"

Does the timing of when you submit your application matter? Does submitting earlier give you a higher chance of getting an interview? 
51jqwj,0,2016-09-07,"I had a retail theft felony expunged at 17, but it's STILL holding me back from jobs in law enforcement/public service. (IL)",Taylornicole26,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/51jqwj/i_had_a_retail_theft_felony_expunged_at_17_but/,"New to this.. apologize for any errors, I'm on my phone. 

In a major rut. 23 year old female (from and living in Illinois)..Graduated with a bachelors in psych and criminal justice last year (may 2015).. still looking for employment in law enforcement. Although I have great references and internship experience.. no one can seem to see past when I was arrested in 2010 at the age of 17. I was arrested for felony retail theft (felony only bc of the amount). My record was expunged and my case was dismissed.. but public service jobs can all still see it. Now wondering why I wasted money on all court fees to get it expunged, when everyone in my field can see it. (Other fields cannot see my arrest record.. Only police related jobs can... Unfortunately for me)

Incase anyone is wondering, I have been applying everywhere and am currently a server. Have been turned down by 4 dispatch jobs, one corrections and two police. It's just heart breaking at this point. So now I have started to apply for jobs outside of my field, but the pay is horrid. I am at a loss as to what to do anymore. 

My current issue... Got offered a job as a dispatcher. Contingent on my background investigation pass or fail. I disclosed and am honest about everything.. but am truly worried they won't give me a shot. Hoping for the best. Just been waiting forever for an opportunity like this and I truly fear im going to be let down again. I've had this issue with multiple other jobs. I interview spectacularly.. then my past mistake comes back to haunt me. That and I have a long work history. Not sure if that's negative or what. I've never been fired from anywhere, I just worked lots of odd jobs in college.. and am a waitress now. 

( Oh also.. it goes as far as a JUDGE has given me his recommendation, and a jail in the county he works in wouldn't even hire me. ) -_-

Basically. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm still living with my parents, making shit money, and clearly can't get a job in my field. It just truly breaks my heart. I don't know if there is anything I can do legally or what. It just all seems so ridiculous to me. I am NOT the idiot I was at 17. Ugh.  I've also been applying to administrative jobs, but it's not enough money to live comfortably off of. I'm at a loss. I'm considering just going back to school for psychology. It's not what I truly want.. But I don't think that matters anymore. 

Also incase anyone is wondering the details on my arrest.. I was at Von maur in Illinois, my friend walked out with a shit load of clothes. I dumped anything I was going to steal before I walked out, mall cop caught us and although I didn't physically take anything with me.. Her AND I were still pinned with everything SHE took. That's the shittiest part about ALL of this. He completely coerced me Into writing a statement and signing documents. I had never been in trouble like this before.. So I was completely terrified. Also..I had intent to steal... but I didn't even steal! My lawyer found it best to get me in a pre trial diversion program. I completed it and my record was and is completely expunged and the case was dismissed. So, no one but public service jobs (for some reason) can see my old record. 

I have NO record. No tickets. Nothing. But when it comes to the jobs I want, I apparently have a felony even if it was expunged. I'm honestly beginning to think what the fuck was the point of even ""expunging"" it if it's practically still there.  I'm just at a loss. I don't know what to do anymore. And I truly hope this dispatch position is gonna give me a shot or be a bit more lenient in regards to my past. 

As far as my legal question, are state/government etc jobs the only ones who will be able to see my expunged record? Is there anything I can do to get rid of it completely (since it is hindering my ability to get a job) or is expungement the last step? I have been asked in sales and administrative job applications if I have ever been arrested, an am unsure if I actually need to answer that honestly or not? And WHY are these jobs so hesitant to give me a chance?"

Give me all your community college transfer advice!",genoa_pepperoni,berkeley,https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/51jx3j/alright_rberkeley_cs_majors_its_that_time_of_the/,"I know that this gets posted often, although I felt that my circumstances were slightly different and I was wondering about everyone's thoughts.

My background:
I've started my third year of community college with my major being computer science. The reason I haven't transferred yet is because I lack the Math requirements in order to be accepted into the CS major. I am **not** looking to do EECS. I plan to apply to Berkeley and Davis this season.

I have completed my community colleges Computing Fundamental, Data structure and Assembly language courses(all with very high grades). These are the extent of the CS courses my school has to offer. By the end of Spring 2017, I will have finished IGETC and have completed up to Calculus 2. My GPA will be &gt;= 3.69. 

I have interned at a prominent National Laboratory. I was the youngest in terms of my academic studies and the only one not from a technical or 4-year university. For example, 80% of the interns in my program were finishing their masters degrees from Universities such as NYU, GATech, CMU, etc. I am also one of the few interns that was hired on part time during the school year. I also hold an active security clearance for the work I do at the National Laboratory.

My questions for you: /r/berkeley 

1. What are my chances of getting in?
2. Will my internship experience make an impact? If so, how can I further elaborate on this during my application process?
3. Anything information you can pass my way to help ease my anxiety?"

Use a mic, headphones, foot pedal and Express Scribe software to speak the audio onto a Google Docs page with their free Voice Typing, then become a reviewer and make money for more than just beer.
-----------------------

 

I see many posts in this sub pertaining to transcription. one of the most common perceptions about transcription work is that the pay is so low, typically below minimum wage, that the work can't possibly be worth the time you spend doing it.

I would like to say that I agree. The wages are extremely low, usually somewhere around $0.20 for every minute of recorded audio that you transcribe. Some sites will pay you more per minute, and some made in pay less. For a lot of people, this is unacceptable and rightfully so. No one should desire to spend 8 hours a day focusing on poorly recorded audio of people who don't know how to speak.

I would like to suggest that spending 8 hours a day transcribing should not be your end goal. Furthermore, while everyone has to pay their dues in the beginning, there are many ways in which you can make this less tedious, faster, more efficient and therefore, more profitable while you slug through.

I will start at the very beginning of what an ideal ""career"" should look like for a transcriptionist and how we can improve on that by taking advantage of modern technologies and resources that are available. I need to caveat this with a disclaimer that I do not work full-time as a transcriptionist, but I have made quite a lot of money using these techniques over the past year. The amount of money that I have made in less than 12 months is more than $2,000, all in my spare time and in addition to my normal income.

If you are not a fast typist, fear not. It doesn't matter. I'm not even typing this post. I'm just speaking into a microphone and the words are being typed by completely free software that you have access to right now. My average typing speed is around 45 words per minute and I cannot touch type. The scary thing is that I used to work at a 911 emergency call center where typing is pretty important. I have to look at the keyboard which makes its fairly difficult for me to type. Again, that's not much of an issue for me because I speak what I want to be typed now.

Your starting point will be to get the basic certification as a transcriptionist through your chosen website. And I'm not speaking of some professional certification. I'm talking about the certification that the websites require which are usually granted after simply taking a test where you listen to some audio and type it up. It then gets graded for accuracy, probably by an automated process, and if you did well enough you're given the certification. I will use the website Speechpad as an example while I explain this from here on out. That's where I have earned my loot!

Speechpad requires you to type a short audio clip and they grade it. After that you're also required to electronically sign a confidentiality agreement. The process of getting certified is very straightforward and very simple. Anyone can accomplish this in a very short amount of time.

Your next step is to find work that you are qualified to do. This might actually take some time because with Speechpad you start out with the lowest acceptable rating possible (96) so most jobs are not going to be available to you. As a beginner you may think that this is unfair, but as you begin transcribing you'll realize that this is necessary on the part of the website so that they can prove that you are capable and reliable enough to have access to more work and better quality customers.

After you have started working and your rating is built up, it is very important that you keep it up. Once your rating falls below 96, all of your efforts thus far will be for nothing because none of the jobs will be available to you. You must avoid ruining your account which would force you to start over. The amount of audio you transcribe determines whether or not you have access to higher quality work.

Once you transcribe 250 minutes you will have access to Urgent jobs which typically pay $0.35 per audio minute and higher. After transcribing 250 minutes of audio you've already nearly doubled your earning potential. You will have earned $50 when you reach the 250 minute milestone.

The next milestone will be 1,000 minutes, which is almost 17 hours of audio. The 1,000 minute mark is more difficult and when you have reached it you will have earned somewhere between $200-350. Only committed individuals will reach this milestone, but if you follow the tips I'm about to give you, you'll realize that it's not out of your reach.

Once you hit the 1,000 minute milestone and you have kept your rating above 96, you will be able to become a reviewer. This is where you will start actually making money at an acceptable rate. You will already have the Urgent qualification which pays roughly $0.35 per minutes. It's important to note that as a reviewer the rate is also $0.35 per minute. However, it's not the rate that you should be concerned with, rather the amount of work you have to do and the amount of time it takes to complete it.

If we were to transcribe 10 minutes of audio for an Urgent job which pays $0.35 per minute, we would earn $3.50. For a fast typist, they may accomplish this in 20 to 30 minutes. It would probably take me closer to 40 minutes to accomplish this by typing it out myself and about 30 with Voice Typing. It is reasonable to expect to spend 4 minutes working for each minute of audio. By completing this work in 40 minutes I have earned at a rate of $0.11 per minute of my time, or around $6 per hour.

When I review a transcription I still only earn $0.35 per minute, but I spend far less time completing this task. If the transcriptionist has done a good job, I may be able to listen to the audio and read the transcript through without stopping which would mean I have earned $3.50 for 10 minutes of my time. This would be $21 for one hour of work. While this is rare, I think it's important to mentioned because I have learned at this rate before.

I will typically spend 2 minutes for every one minute of audio while reviewing. This means I typically earn between $10-12 per hour which is completely acceptable to me considering what I am doing, that I am doing this on my own schedule and in the comfort of my home. I often earn a bit more and sometimes less, but this is a reasonable expectation. I also cherry pick, which you most definitely should do as well.

So now that we have a goal in mind let's talk about how to get there. You will need to invest some money in some equipment. The items you will need to buy are:

* Microphone
* Headphones
* Foot pedal
* Express Scribe Professional software.

The amount of money that you invest in this equipment is going to determine, to some extent, your efficiency. I haven't included any prices yet because it is somewhat dependent on the quality of equipment do you want to buy. I will tell you how much I have spent and what specifically I have purchased to give you an example. The microphone and headphones I already had, so the only purchases I need to make were for the foot pedal and the Express Scribe software.

My headphones are Audio Technica ATH-M50's which I purchased long ago for listening to music. I spent about $150 on them and I think they are great. You absolutely do not need to spend that much, but the better quality your headphones are, the easier it will be to hear the audio which is very important. My microphone is a Blue Snowball ICE which I spent about $50 for and already had because I use it for gaming, Skype, etc. I recommend you use a quality microphone because the speech recognition software will hear you better and you will have fewer corrections to make in the transcript. You may have a mic on your laptop or on a webcam. While this may work to get you started, I am almost certain you will soon get frustrated with it and want to buy a better mic.

It is unlikely that you have a foot pedal around unless you are guitar player. That isn't the right sort though, you cheeky bastard. The foot pedal you will need is specifically designed for transcription. I purchased an Infinity IN-USB-2 for about $20 off eBay. You will also need to get the Express Scribe Professional transcription software which I paid about $35 for. So your investment will be about $55 plus the cost of a microphone and headphones if you don't already have those. This will be about what you have earned when you hit the 250 minute milestone, so you will earn this back fairly quickly and you will be very glad you made these investments.

The last piece of the puzzle is the Voice Typing in Google Docs. If you have a Google account or use the internet at all then you are probably familiar with Google Docs. You need to create a new blank document, click on Tools, then click Voice typing. You will need to configure your microphone within your operating system and browser, but there are guides all over the internet to help you with that if it's not already configured. 

To put it all together, go to Speechpad, cherry pick a job that you want to do, click ""Export Audio"" to download the file, then upload that into Express Scribe. Plug your foot pedal in, put on your headphones and just verbally repeat into the mic what you are hearing while you control the audio playback with your feet.

The reason you will need express scribe and the foot pedal is that Google Voice Typing requires that your browser where the Google Docs page is at be the active window on your PC. Express Scribe works in the background and since you are controlling it with your feet, you don't have to worry about deactivating the Voice Typing microphone trying to press some hotkeys or use the mouse to control the playback. Google Docs turns off if you click anywhere else.

The final tips I would like to offer are for the ""post-processing"" of your transcript. Google Voice typing is not perfect. You will have to go back and fix mistakes. I recommend that you just try to get the transcript typed out before you make any corrections. This way you don't have to stop and restart so often and you can maintain a steady workflow. After I type the transcript, I go back and listen to the audio again and read along to correct my mistakes. Basically what a reviewer does so this is good practice. It is more important that you turn in quality work at this point than just finish as fast as you can because you need to keep your rating up so you can become a reviewer.

I also use a lot of macros in Microsoft Word to highlight common mistakes, fix spacing, and other things I look for while reviewing. I recommend that you take advantage of this as well and write your own macros if you are at all familiar with VBA or programming. If you aren't familiar, you can just record macros so still take advantage of that tool.

You can also use things like Autohotkey or text expanders if you find yourself repeatedly making the same corrections. The Logitech G710+ and some other affordable keyboards also come with programmable macro buttons that may be of use. I have a G710+ and I use the macros ALL THE TIME. They are super fast to reprogram and very useful. I really recommend a mechanical keyboard in general even if you don't get one with macro keys. You won't type a lot, but you will need to type some while you correct your Google Docs transcript. Mechanical Keyboards make it easier to type and you will earn mad bank anyway, so why not indulge a bit? A final tip is to run your transcript through a more advanced grammar/spell checker like Grammarly to make sure you didn't leave out any commas that I will have to put in for you when I review your work.

Think of the transcription portion as the internship or something. Whatever it takes for you to grind through it. It's possible to make a decent wage from home on the internet if you are smart about it and stick to something.

Edit:
Don't do the shitty jobs after you have access to better jobs. Cherry pick. The websites will be forced to increase the payment for the shitty audio if no one does it to a point where it is more desirable. Then I may even do it, who knows!"

What specific skills are useful/impressive for internships?,thundergolfer,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/51kzlr/young_soft_eng_student_that_feels_my_skills_are/,"&gt; could give us an idea of what your skills and interests are?

This is a question I got from a company interested in me as an intern. I was trying to think of an answer for *skills*, and realised that I wished I had one core skill that was impressive and useful to companies. 

I code a lot, but being a young developer a lot of it is exploratory. I do some database stuff, some scripting, then NLP, then machine learning, then web, etc. etc. Most of it tests my learning and problem solving ability, but I don't have a 'thing'.

In the longer term I would like to have Machine Learning, Agent-Oriented Programming and NLP as core skills. Unfortunately these skills take a long time to develop to the point where I could be of value to a company as an intern. 

So in the interim, which specific skills are best for interns to say they have? Ideally they would be skills that weren't as difficult to become good at as the aforementioned three, and they would be skills that are worthwhile implementing in python. "

At first, I was ecstatic that I was offered a position on Capitol Hill, especially from a congressman in my home town. The more I think about it, however, a few concerns are raised. Namely:

I need to pay down my debt. I have been barley getting by for close to six months and have ran up credit card debt in addition to student loans I already had. I recently moved out of an apartment and back to my parents to try and pay down debt/save some money in the next six-12 months while I look into pursuing a masters degree at local schools. This internship, which is unpaid for three months, would require me to take out a loan with my family and pay them back, which I don't want to do for comfort reasons.

The congressman I would be working for is very conservative, and while I don't consider myself at all a dire hard liberal, but I don't agree with many of his policies which tend to be Republican standard. All that being said, he seems like a genuine man and I wouldn't mind working for him but I have seen other posts suggesting you work for the party you would want to be in business with long term only.

As mentioned before, I was planning on pursuing a Comp Sci Masters to complement my Finance bachelors degree. My real interest is in public policy research and I think I can leverage those two degrees into something in that area, particularly data analysis. However, the interviewer told me I would also have an opportunity to research legislation while there, and that they would try to hook me up with whatever kind of position I wanted post-internship.

**TL/DR** Is it worth me putting my plans on hold and straining myself financially for a three month DC internship? Is this really a once in a lifetime opportunity, or can I get myself in a better situation financially while building up some practical skills (i.e. formal training in programming) and expect to land a similar roll later on?"

I’ve never seen so much blood and human tissue in my life. It was one of those things that scar you for life. I was just standing there, paralyzed. It all happened so fast. I was still trying to put all the pieces together of the last weeks, when it all happened. I remember running out of the house letting out a blood-cursing scream.

-HELP!!! HELP!!! SOMEBODY HELP HER PLEASE!!!! - I was crying, screaming, and about to faint. I had blood splatters all over my face, my clothes.

Liam came to me and held me as I was about to fall on my knees.

-What happened? -he asked alarmed -Charlie what happened?!

-It’s so much worse than we expected, call 911 now, please -I pleaded And then I fainted.

That’s the way everything ended to me, back then at least. Now let’s go back a few weeks before that, and put everything in order as I remember it. I heard the scratching in the attic window around 1am this time. Cookie, our neighbor’s cat, had the habit of getting into our house at night. As it was a hot and wet summer, we kept the windows open to enjoy the night breeze.

I went upstairs to check on him. He greeted me with a quick meow and rubbed himself against my legs. He followed me to bed, and I heard him leave later that night. That was his usual routine, and I enjoyed his company. Cookie belonged to the Elsons, a single mom with three children who lived across the street. Two girls and one boy: 14 year old Sophie, my best friend, 17 year old Tina and 18 year old, Liam. With this three we grew up as if we were joined to the hip. Inseparables. Both me and my sister had a big crush on Liam, but we never said anything to each other about it.

Next to us to the right, we had Ms. Turner (I changed all the names, just in case) who was a classic grumpy old lady, living in an abandoned house, without kids, nephews, nieces, or cats (I don't think cats would ever stand a woman like that). Always staring at the window, always yelling the kids of the block, always angry, with a long face and always there, as she seemed inmortal. Next to us to the left we had the Eldwoods, a family of 5. They seemed pretty normal, pretty goody-two-shoes. They had two little girls and one boy. They had moved less than a year ago, so we weren’t really close.

The strange happenings started before I was able to notice it. I remember falling asleep on a Sunday night while listening to my walkman. The music was still on at first, so I couldn't hear anything. When the noises became louder I took my earphones off to pay attention. It was Cookie, as every single night, walking in the attic right on top of me. Oh Cookie. I could hear him scratching like crazy, and I thought that my mum was going to be mad if he messed up with the furniture. I turned around and went back to sleep.

During the next day, my mother and Mrs. Elson had been drinking coffee together and gossiping about the neighbors, that Mrs. Turner was losing her mind, that she was too old and alone, that the wacky old lady had accused the Elsons of being stealing food from her kitchen, that she confronted the Eldwoods’ accusing their kids of writing their names in her home walls, among other things. The elder of them couldn't been more than 10 at the time and they were extremely shy. They were not the kind of kids that you could expect to break into people’s house to crash their walls. The truth is that we were all a bit scared of Mrs. Turner. Rumor was that she killed her husband and kept his corpse with her until today and that she made spirit sessions back when she was younger. I think it was all just a bunch of urban legends.

The rest of the week was pretty much the same. Every night, Cookie would come at night through the attic window, do some wild scratching, and then leave. Sunday night, in my sleep I felt his weight at the foot end of the bed, I remember talking to him, but he left. I loved having Cookie around, because it made me feel closer to Liam, my first crush. So the cat’s visits were a way to connect with my puppy love. Liam was working in the city council for the summer, as an internship, so I missed him even more. Summer was the best part of the year, we all used to spend so much time together, just wandering around. I fell asleep thinking about him.

Monday night after dinner things got much creepier. I walk passed my sister's room and noticed she was sobbing. I opened the door a little presenting my nosy head inside her room.

-Are you okay? -I asked

-Obviously not! I'm terribly sad -she said between tears

-What happened?

-I heard mom talking to Carol, Carol Elson, and she, she...-Poppy started crying again

-Poppy, What did you hear? -I claimed impatiently

-They were saying that Cookie has been missing for over a week, and he...he...appeared dead this morning, in their backyard, but he was like eaten. There were parts of him spread in the grass Charlie! -she yelled- Who could have done such a horrible thing to a cat? Carol doesn't want to tell the kids because the truth is awful. She tried to talk to the police, but no one really cared, they said it was a wild animal. Please keep your mouth shut, the children can’t find out about it.

-Are you sure? Are you sure that they were talking about Cookie? -All I could think about were the scratches on the walls and the crawling noises, and even worse, the weight I felt on my bed last night. I was 100% sure that it was the feline.

-Yes, Cookie, dead, torn apart -broke up in tears again

That night was probably one of the longest nights in my life. I got to bed frightened but I still held a tiny bit of hope that none of this was real. Maybe the cat they found wasn’t Cookie, maybe she misheard the conversation. Maybe, maybe, maybe.

Oh, I wished.

I left the light on my nightable on of course, and stayed up reading a book, there was no possible way I could go back to sleep. I was ready, I wanted to know what it was. I wanted to go upstairs and find cookie. Of course, all that bravery changed when the crawling started.

First, I heard a bump and then the slither. I was paralyzed. I could hear everything so clearly and I wasn't able to move. Oh my god, I could never forget the cold chills running crazy down my spine, the fear, the rush. Everything got worse when the scratching started. Slow, very very slow and then fast and loud against the wall. I couldn't take it anymore. I yelled with all the air in my lungs the magic word: MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!!!

She jumped out the bed like crazy, came running to my room where she found me sitting on the bed terrified. Told her everything, desperate, and she went upstairs to check, that woman was so brave. Of course there was nothing. She turned the lights on, and did a quick search.

-All safe! -yelled from the attic almost laughing. She didn’t believe me. Classic. That night I ended up sleeping in my mother's room. I wasn't crazy, was I? Was I hearing things?

Next morning with everyone at home I decided to play brave and go to the attic by myself to make sure there was nothing out of the ordinary. At daytime nothing seemed creepy anymore and to be fair, our attic wasn't not one of those scary intimidating attics from movies, it was very illuminated during day because of the gorgeous window we had. At first I didn’t see anything out of the ordinary. But then I caught a glimpse of it.

Fingernails. On the floor, few pieces . Long and hard few pieces of fingernails, with irregular shapes and a bit of dry blood. I was horrified. But it got worse.

Carved on the white wall there was a sketch of five people drawing. The drawing was horrible, like made by a child, but it was easy to understand that it was three boys and two girls. Who the hell. What the hell.

I didn’t know what to do. Something was getting into my house and carving scrawls on our walls while everyone was sleeping.

I showed my mum the drawing and the nails, as an irrefutable proof that there was something going on.

-Oh, my baby girl has always had a great imagination -she said and kissed me on the forehead -I’m sure it was here before we moved in, and that is just rubbish honey, I haven’t been able to clean up in here for a while. What a shame! -she said laughing.

I had asked my mum about the previous owners, all she could tell me was that there was a family of three. A couple with a kid, they had moved because the father had a new job in a different city, and it was 20 years ago. I needed to know what was happening in my house and I felt like doing some digging. That day I made up some excuse to take the bus to the town’s centre and pay Liam a little visit at the City Council. The main reason to make an excuse, was my sister. She would've gone mad if she knew I was going to meet with her crush, but it wasn’t for the reasons she would think of, well, maybe a little.

I got off the bus and walked to the building. I got to the reception, said hi to Elise (in a small town, we all know each other), the receptionist and asked for Liam, he showed up a minute later looking surprised. He made me follow him to the office where he was working as an assistant to Pam Middler, a stout middle age lady, with rosy cheeks and a sassy personality.

-So why are you here for Charls? -he asked me intrigued

-Well, I need to know about my house’s previous owners -I didn’t want to give much information, I just didn’t want them to think I was bonkers.

-Honey -Pam asked me- you live in the 239 of 2nd street right?

-Yes

-That is an old house, sugar, it might take you some time to find any information about it - she turned to Liam - Sweetie, bring your lady friend the files on the third file cabinet, those are for first and second street, they are ordered numerically, the 239 should be there.

Liam got the files within 5 minutes, and they offered me a desk to sit and read. I spent the whole afternoon with them, talking, laughing reading, and drinking coffee. Pam was hilarious, she knew a lot about the town and its inhabitants.

It was 5 o’clock and they had to leave in half an hour, I had finished with all the files, and I couldn’t find any family that would match the drawing, it was frustrating. Nothing strange, no mental institutions, no orphanages, no hospitals, no crimes, nothing. My house had been a family home for ever, with no strange background. I was disappointed and It showed.

-Honey, what is exactly that you expected to find? -Pam gave me commiseration look

-Oh God, I didn’t want to say anything -I said turning red as the converse I was wearing that day -Some strange things have been happening and as I’m a bit scared -big lie, I was terrified, but Liam was there, I needed to look brave- I wanted to know what could be happening.

I told them everything, except for the part of the gutted cat. Anyway Liam hadn’t seen Cookie for more than a week, so I just omitted the way it had been found and the story still made sense. They looked interested and Pam definitely believed me.

-You know, I don’t think the problem is in your house pumpkin -Pam said- You live next to Tanya Turner. The Turners were very famous back in the 70’s.

-How come? -This was new information for me

-Well, Tanya and her husband used to work as psychics, you know. Readings, connect to the other side, spirit sessions. They worked in famous cases, exorcisms, and they had even been contacted by the police sometimes to retrieve missing bodies. Good Jesus doesn’t let that old ghosts wander around your house honey. I always thought their lifestyle was a bit inappropriate, and taking their daughter with them...raise a child in that kind of darkness...is cruel -Pam said nodding her head with disapproval

-She had a kid? -I asked. I thought she was alone in the world, no family, no kids.

-Yes, a daughter, she grew into that, and after her father died in strange circumstances, she walked away, and no one saw her again since. Cute kid. She must be reaching her 40s now -Pam finished her story.

Liam and I were fascinated. We came back together in the bus thinking about all sort of theories about Mrs. Turner and the thing that was paying me visits. He told me to keep up with him with all the new events, he was now my partners in crime. That night I was in the clouds, the whole day with Liam was all I needed to spend a careless night of sleep. What happened in the next days still amuses me…

51luzf,6,2016-09-07,Is a Capitol Hill Internship in D.C. a once in a lifetime opportunity?,cbo92,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/51luzf/is_a_capitol_hill_internship_in_dc_a_once_in_a/,"I was recently fortunate enough to be offered an internship in D.C. working for a congressman in my home state. At first, I was ecstatic that I was offered a position on Capitol Hill, especially from a congressman in my home town. The more I think about it, however, a few concerns are raised. Namely:

1. I need to pay down my debt. I have been barley getting by for close to six months and have ran up credit card debt in addition to student loans I already had. I recently moved out of an apartment and back to my parents to try and pay down debt/save some money in the next six-12 months while I look into pursuing a masters degree at local schools. This internship, which is unpaid for three months, would require me to take out a loan with my family and pay them back, which I don't want to do for comfort reasons.

2. The congressman I would be working for is very conservative, and while I don't consider myself at all a dire hard liberal, but I don't agree with many of his policies which tend to be Republican standard. All that being said, he seems like a genuine man and I wouldn't mind working for him but I have seen other posts suggesting you work for the party you would want to be in business with long term only.

3. As mentioned before, I was planning on pursuing a Comp Sci Masters to complement my Finance bachelors degree. My real interest is in public policy research and I think I can leverage those two degrees into something in that area, particularly data analysis. However, the interviewer told me I would also have an opportunity to research legislation while there, and that they would try to hook me up with whatever kind of position I wanted post-internship.

**TL/DR** Is it worth me putting my plans on hold and straining myself financially for a three month DC internship? Is this really a once in a lifetime opportunity, or can I get myself in a better situation financially while building up some practical skills (i.e. formal training in programming) and expect to land a similar roll later on?"

I graduated this past spring with a BS in IT, which was a new degree at my school that mixed CS with MIS. It was not too heavy on coding, only having us take one or two coding heavy classes, but rounding it out with more database courses and project management courses. The only languages I was introduced to in class were C# and Python and I worked with VB in my internship.


Upon graduation, I got a position with a fortune 250 company as a java developer. I do not know Java, but they stated we would have a week long Java boot camp to get everyone up to speed. The boot camp was not what they made it out to be, quickly breezing over high level concepts and mainly showing us the environment we will be using.


To make matters worse, my first day in the office, after my on boarding was complete, my PM left for paternity leave without giving me any clear direction. After the first week that he was unavailable, he started working from home for another 2 weeks. 


Three weeks in and I had been given no clear direction and unsure of what I'm SUPPOSED to know or supposed to do. Since my PM coming back, I have had some good conversations with him, but my current goals are still very high level: learn java, learn the program, learn the the systems that are used by the main program. 


They have stated they expect it to take about 6 months to gain the knowledge I need, but I don't feel like I am getting the support I need to be successful. I don't want my hand held, but I just feel so lost. I have hundreds of pages of documentation for programs, which I have tried to read through, but the amount of effort involved seems so high for how little I gain from majority of what I read.


I have tried doing online java training like codeacademy(way too simplistic) and codingbat, as well as lynda.com and some others. I have found that I do not learn well from watching videos, I need something more interactive to get it to sink in.


I know this is long and rambling, but I just wanted to know what suggestions people have in terms of how to improve my java knowledge and possible things I can do to improve the support I receive?"
51lzo1,1,2016-09-07,"Accept return offer, or explore other options?",IamLytes,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/51lzo1/accept_return_offer_or_explore_other_options/,"This past summer, I had my first internship with one of the big banks in the United States. My team worked on the online banking platform. The tech used was mainly java/spring, javascript, html, and css. I worked on a simple web project using html, css, and javascript. I also learned about security regarding web applications and the bank as a whole. I'm currently most interested in full stack web development and security, but I find a lot of other areas really cool too.

I'm graduating in Dec 2017, so I received an offer from the bank to intern again next summer. I have to let them know by this Friday. However, my school has career fairs coming up in a couple weeks with lots of companies coming with some big names as well. I know many people get offers from these fairs.

I'm not sure if I want to stay with the bank. Overall, the internship was fine and I didn't have many complaints besides not doing as much as others. The pay was really good and the city was cool too. If I go back, I get the same pay and will probably work on the same team, and I'll probably get more development work. However, I'm not sure if I'd want to work there full time after the internship. I'd like to explore other options at the career fairs as this is the only experience I have, but I also like that I already have an offer. 

I'm thinking about accepting the offer, and still exploring other options. If I get interviews and offers from companies that appeal more, then I'd back out from the bank and most likely burn that bridge. I'd rather not burn any bridges, though a small part of me worries about getting a good internship if I decline the return offer, which would leave me with nothing.

Any and all advise is welcome. Thanks!

I used to have $300 in my savings account specifically for emergencies. But I used that almost a year ago and I haven't been able to build it back up since. 

I'm a college student and over the summer I worked two jobs to save money, which was then spent on various emergencies. I had to drop one job because I'm doing an (unpaid) internship this semester. So I'll be working a combined 44 hours a week plus my classes in top of that. I don't have time for another job because of the way my schedule is. 

I currently have $823 in my main checking account. My 2nd checking account is $300, I have $100 in savings and I have 0 debt. I make $285 every other week, a total of $570 a month. I live rent-free with my dad but I pay for my own car (gas &amp; insurance), I pay for my own phone bill and necessities (toiletries, clothes, etc)

My monthly expenses are;
$94 phone bill 
$50 car insurance
$8 Netflix (my dad's version of rent)
$80 gas
$88 bus (I'll be taking the bus to my internship since it's cheaper than paying for gas &amp; parking)

The brakes on my car suddenly stopped working on Saturday. I got it towed (for free) to my mechanic. And I just now got word that it'll cost around $530 to fix.

I'm starting my internship on Friday and I have to wear professional office clothing. Which I don't have any of. So I have $200 (in my 2nd checking account) to buy clothes for it.

 I'm frustrated and I don't know what to do. I can't prevent emergencies obviously. So any advice is much appreciated. "

I went to college for Software Engineering because I loved everything about programming. I spent all my weekends and free time learning new stuff and programming random things. I took internships at startup web development companies and major banks in Java, just to get more programming time.

Then college ended, and life started. I'm a full time java developer at a huge company, working 8-5 every day of the week, and I absolutely hate it. I stopped working projects in every minute of my spare time, and slowly stopped programming outside of work. My 7-5 destroyed all my enthusiasm I had. 

Recently, I pulled myself together enough to start looking for web development jobs to work on after work, and that spark is back. I spent all of the last 3 weekends working on websites for people, and I loved it. Having the freedom to work on new and exciting projects, and meet all kinds of people sounds so enticing.

I'm very secure financially right now, thanks to the 7-5 job. I have a safety net of 2 years, but I want to have a freelance starting point before leaving work.

My question is.... where do I start? Do I build my own website first, do I work out pricing, do I find clients?  It seems that there are a ton of steps, but I'm not sure what the first one should be. I'd love to hear what you did to start freelancing.

Any comment is appreciated! Thank you!"

I must change careers , late in life (38) and have been told/read online that software developer will soon become obsolete.

My question is, given a lot of hard work, the willingness to always have a ""side project"" of some sort , spending the next few years learning a lot of theory (via a [B.S in IT Software Development](http://www.wgu.edu/wgu/prog_guide/BSITSW.pdf) from WGU , working internships or low level jobs that relate to my education and generally becoming a dedicated professional, can I expect a future within this industry? 

One where I may even make some small contributions? Considering that I'll be starting entry-level in 2020 and people tell me everything from ""software development jobs won't exist"" to ""you'll be competing with 20 year old geniuses, guess who will get hired?"" or ""Just take a four week course and start working"", ""with outsourcing people with far more experience, asking for far less money, will always be hired over you"" etc ad nauseum I feel very uncertain about my path and hope aomeone can illuminate some of the landscape ahead.

I'm currently a freshman at Appalachian State University, studying computer science. I would like to have my options open when graduating, ensuring I get a job that I will enjoy. This means I will need to build experience, potentially through an internship. My problem is my university may not be the best for landing an internship as it's in a small town. My main question is what will employers look for the most when hiring, and what can I do to make sure I am set up for a great career? Is an internship equally important as a portfolio of personal projects? Do employers care about which school I graduated from?



App State is located in a small mountain town. The school has about 18,000 students. My concern is that I won't be able to find a good internship to gain experience without traveling far. I was considering transferring to NC State, knowing that the Research Triangle Park would be a wonderful place to get an internship and maybe even land a job after I graduate. Also, I've heard it's more rigorous, meaning employers will lean towards the better school, when hiring.

My dream career would be to work for a bigger company as a software engineer. I want to walk into work everyday knowing that I made the right decisions along the way and I took the best possible path.

For the people who have already found a career or are just farther along than me, what advice or piece of information would you give yourself prior to starting your education path?

Sorry for the long post. Thanks to those that read it all, I really appreciate it.

TL;DR: My school isn't the best for getting an internship, I am thinking about transferring. Do employers care about which school I graduated from? What advice or knowledge would you wish to have known before you began your education path?"

Another girl, amazing in every way, broke up with me early spring. I took it hard. During work I would just think about her, trapped in the spiral of guilt, shame, and ambition to be better. After a few weeks I decided that enough was enough- I would embark on the 100 days. Hardmode. It had worked wonders in the past and I was sure it would help me now. I needed 100% of my attention on finishing grad school anyway and didn't want to worry about girls. 


I finished grad school. I was around day 70 and BAM it showed up. Every time I looked around I could see women checking me out. The superpowers hit hard. The Summer of Gold had begun. I knew I could get with anyone I wanted and decided to use it. I started seeing a very cute girl, mostly as a FWB scenario. I figured we were really different and it wouldn't work out long term, but we had great chemistry. She was okay with it so I started seeing another as well. She was older and into all the same things as I. We're mystics. I thought ""this could be the one!"". 


The sex during hardmode was amazing. Let me tell you: not coming during sex was the best think I've ever experienced. All the pent-up energy really takes it to the next level and transforms what sex really is. A lot of guys shy away from hardmode because they feel like they might get into a relationship and don't want to risk not being able to have sex. I say have sex and just don't come. You can give them great orgasms because you literally last as long as you want. If you want more info on that check out some Mantak Chia (Multiorgasmic Man). Finally the 100 days hardmode ended and I was able to come during sex. It was different after that, but I had learned what I needed to learn and was ready to just relax into pleasure and let my hard work pay off. It was so amazing. So serene. There was nothing I wanted in life. I was 100% satisfied.


By the end of the summer the dynamic between myself and the mystic became a bit tumultuous. When she had to leave the country for a month for her visa I wasn't heartbroken. We've kept in touch. The other girl, who I didn't think much of romantically, finally started letting me sleep with her overnight, and wouldn't just leave after sex. She was getting over a long relationship and I was helping her. Towards the end she started letting me in. And I liked what I found. But since the day I had met her she told me her plan was to move at the end of the summer- to go back to NYC to be with her parents. The date came and she disappeared. She told me I had had a strong impact on her. She was now trying vegetarianism and doing yoga daily. I was forced back to hardmode.


We spoke every now and then. We skyped once. I tried to sext her but she said it was too hard for her to sext since she wouldn't be seeing me. We texted about where she was in life and where she wanted to be. At work my internship ended and they wanted to hire me full time. I asked for 5 weeks off. Midway through I decided to go visit her in NYC. 


I just got back from NYC. I literally spent 72 hours straight with her. I was so happy that at the end, a few hours before having to go back to the airport I broke down and started crying. I opened up to her completely. I told her that I didn't want to start a real job, I didn't want to leave NYC, I was going to miss her more than anything. I had so much to do and didn't have the will for it. We both just cried together, naked, and it was fucking beautiful. We even had sex afterward. We both decided that a long distance relationship was too much for us, but that we would stay in contact. 


So here I am, back home. Forced back onto hardmode. I can only think of her and can't imagine being with another woman. It's sad. I wonder if I should try to be with her.

It's probably going to be long, but I hope worth reading. 

So, just about everybody in my life, work, home, ect, knows about depression and anxiety. (I have a few select, close, people who know about the DID.)

Getting my parents to understand and appreciate my depression and anxiety has been a whole life-long journey. Suicidal ideation in elementary school got me put on an antidepressant (Luvox, I suspect, from my recall of the pill compared to photos online) at the age range of 6-9. (Wide range, but I have very few autobiographical memories with which to place this whole deal. They don't start coming in steadily until I'm 11.) My mom didn't like how I was on them, describing me as incapable of positive emotion, negative emotion, or just... really emotion. I immediately became very depressed again. I try to bring this up to them a few times, but I got increasingly negative results. After constant meltdowns leading up to my freshman year of high school, Mom declared that my issue was self-esteem related and signed me up for a modeling class. (I don't fully get the connection.) 

My senior year, I got my insurance card, my driver's license, and had saved up money, so I went to a GP (a new one, as the one my mom picked out was mean) and ended up on Paxil, with a referral for free therapy by an intern at a local place.

I don't think my parents are stupid. I know they must have figured something was up when I was suddenly ""going to the movies"" once a week. But Mom figured I had a secret boyfriend. At least, until she looked closely enough at my pill pack to realize it wasn't birth control. 

Shit hit the fan. For two years. Dad was especially upset, explaining how he was sure this was going to ruin my life, and Mom was depressed once and did fine all on her own. Mom rarely intervened.

Here's where the turnaround starts happening. Dad, while drunk, tells me that he's sure I've been having panic attacks since childhood. (Drunkenness level is important because I don't think he remembers telling me this.) Mom, after finding out I'd been off my meds for a while--I was forced due to a nasty side effect and a change of doctors--told me that she was seeing what the meds were doing, and yeah, I should probably continue being on meds. 

My life, up until recently, had been characterized by my parents alternatingly going off-the-rails on my sister or I, but after the turning point, I saw them officially try to ""clean up their act."" Mom would sometimes defend me against my father when he got upset, pointing out to him that I couldn't be a mind-reader. I could give tiny updates regarding my health without upsetting my father. 

Eventually, he got attuned enough that he'd notice changes in me related to my (what feels near-constant, but is more like once every six months) medication changes. He always made positive comments.

And this leads to today. Mom provoked a panic attack at our work. (One of my jobs is for my parents' ""junk"" business, where they sell good parts off of junk motors.) The only people in the room are family and this guy who, when he found out I was on meds, suggested I shouldn't be on them because God didn't want me to. I freaked out, she responded with her own freakout. I immediately began packing up my station. I had planned to stay for another hour, but I couldn't do it, and I had made significant progress anyway. Dad got dragged in, and while he briefly threw his support behind Mom, who seemed to be insinuating I was the only one allowed to be stressed, it seemed to be more in a mediator way than anything else. As I left, he said that he hoped I'd feel better soon. (Like I had the flu or something?)

I stood outside the building trying to calm down enough to drive, and Mom caught up with me incidentally (everyone was leaving to go smoke, and they smoke by the cars.) I told her ""Mom, I'm not going to have standard reactions to stress all the time. I have an anxiety disorder."" 

She said ""I know, but when you freak out on me like that, I'm going to freak out back."" (This conversation went on for a bit longer, but that start is a good summary of it.)

So, while this sucked, I can't help but think about how bad it used to be. They constantly seem like they're moving forward, improving upon their previous stances to behaviors linked to my mental illnesses. 

Maybe, someday, my sister will feel safe enough to tell them she has been diagnosed with PTSD and is on medication for PTSD-related insomnia. "
51naiw,2,2016-09-07,Graduating with BS in CS in the spring while working in marketing. Could use advice for transitioning into the CS field.,gw2380,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/51naiw/graduating_with_bs_in_cs_in_the_spring_while/,"I feel like this is a situation that is becoming a little more common, but I still struggle a bit to find advice for the situation.  

I'm 31 years old. I've worked in marketing since I graduated college at 23, but felt like it was an unfulfilling career path for me. I'm very logical and analytical at heart, and thought I'd give a semester of CS a try, and then go from there if I liked it. I ended up loving it, and two years later, am slated to graduate with my BS in Computer Science in the spring (originally had earned a BS in Business Administration).  

I've done fairly well - my school's reputation is average, but I've earned a 3.70 GPA and two academic scholarships from my school's CS department that have nearly covered my entire second half of school.  

That said, as I approach the finish line, I'm left with a feeling that I don't know what to do. I haven't explored internships much, as my current marketing job has me making ~$55k and has let me get through school without having to take out any loans or change my lifestyle. It's been a huge help but also leaves me without a ton of CS experience to pitch to companies for a first job.  

I would like to get into mobile development, if possible - I'm comfortable with Objective C or Swift. Possibly web dev as a backup to that. I've taken courses in the subject, done well, and have some good programs to use as samples for applications/interviews.  

This is all a bit rambling, but I suppose my questions would be (especially for those who have been in a similar boat):
  
- With my (lack of) CS job experience, is pitching my course experience, program examples and 8+ years of working in business in a team environment with great references, etc. something that can get me in the door at a company, or is there something else I should be doing?  

- Is it uncommon for companies to hire people in my situation before they graduate? Should I be looking for something now, even though I don't graduate for another nine months?

- This is a bit radical, but if internships are a must to have a decent shot at a good entry level role, is it worth putting off my graduation for a semester, taking an internship over the summer and applying for jobs in the winter?  

- As someone with a pretty good background in marketing, is there a job that I *should* be looking at, as a way to pitch my marketing experience in a CS field or role? Mobile and/or web development always felt like one, just from knowing what kind of things are aesthetically pleasing to consumers being a bonus to design.  

I appreciate any advice, whether to these points or in general, anyone could give to someone in my position. Thank you!"

I know people say apply now for summer internship but how do I find one? I've contacted the career center at my community college and they require me to take two 'internship' classes before I can actually get one through the school. I do not like that because that's an extra two classes I have to add onto a full schedule and have to pay for it. 

What are my options here? To clarify, the only programming experience Ive had is one c++ class and a Java class."

I have a very likely offer from Bridgewater (talking with recruiter who's finalizing package) for their technology associate program. 

I like them both equally. I liked my amazon internship but wasn't crazy about it or the west coast (my family is from east coast). I'm interested in finance and Bridgewater is one of the most highly regarded hedge funds and just as prestigious if not more so than Amazon(or so the recruiter told me). 

1. Is Bridgewater actually as prestigious in tech as Amazon? Will it set me up for success just as much as working at Amazon will? 

2. Would I be able to negotiate my new grad salary at Bridgewater to match Amazon's?"
51npwe,9,2016-09-07,It's been almost 2 years and I still feel guilty,sorrynotsorryxoxo,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/51npwe/its_been_almost_2_years_and_i_still_feel_guilty/,"Bare with me... I have never posted anything about this.

When I was 5, my dad divorced my alcoholic mother. A few months later he picked me up from school and I moved with him to his house 2 hours away. (I later found out that he broke into my moms apartment and packed up my stuff and essentially kidnapped me from school). 
Less than a year later he married my stepmom. 

Growing up I was told my Mama didnt want me. That she loved the bottle more than me. I was raised to believe that everything my parents did was because they ""loved"" me. I am sure none of this is news to any of you. I was spanked for getting anything below a B in school, or for any reason they chose. My grandfather took them to court because of the bruising and the judge ordered no more ""spankings"". That's when I was forced to exercise and eat weird food as punishment. They would have me rake the 1/4 acre yard and then dump all the bags out and have me start over, plank for minutes at a time while stacking encyclopedias on me, etc. For meals, I was served tap water and cream of mushroom soup for the duration of my punishment (which was usually 6 weeks or more). 

Anytime my grandparents defended me to my parents my dad would say ""you cant talk about our personal business or you will end up in an orphanage"" they even went as far as to pull me out of class when I was 8 to tell me I had 30 minutes to get home and pack my stuff so I could go to foster care and then told me that they were kidding. That night I slept in the unfinished portion of our house so I could know what an orphanage would be like.  

At 12, I stopped talking to my grandfather because I picked up the phone one day and caught him being ""mean"" to my dad. 

Fast forward to 17 years old, I move out because my parents are too ""strict"". Our relationship gets better or so I think, but the behavior is still present. This is the time that I really start to heal the relationship with my Mama. When I was 19, she passed away. I had recently moved and gotten rid of a lot of old cards and letters and was telling my Nstepmom how sad I was that I had trashed them. She goes to her room and brings out a box of cards from my Mama to me that she ""saved"". I was so grateful for her act of thoughtfulness. It wasnt until years later that I realized these were cards I was never given from my Mama. She didnt miss my birthdays and holidays like I thought she did. I still regret letting them convince me not to invite my Mama to my high school graduation.

At 21, I married and divorced a sweet Christian man. At 25 I got engaged again, to an amazing man who has been exactly what I needed in my life. I felt guilty even expecting family to attend another wedding since my first marriage was a joke. I decided to let my MIL have the wedding she had always dreamed for her baby boy. She declined the offer and asked how she could help us have the perfect wedding WE wanted. My husband wanted a small event so we decided to go to the beach. we paid for a large condo for us and our wedding party and my MIL paid for a condo for my husbands family. I loaned my parents my new car because I thought they might not come if they had to drive their unreliable vehicle. I also paid for their hotel (which was next door to the condos bc they insisted on a smoking room). Instead of gifts we asked for our loved ones to join us at the beach and informed them that we would be going to a somewhat pricey restaurant after the ceremony (like $30 plates). 

A week before we left for the beach my stepmom commented ""you look like you have been gaining weight, does your dress still fit?"" Mind you, she was with me less than a month prior when I tried it on. So I blew it off and causally answered ""yes ma'am it fits"". During the time at the beach we had little events planned that we funded. A Dolphin Cruise, dinner at our condo with beer and cupcakes, etc. My parents opted out of these events (including the dolphin cruise that they had agreed to when we bought non exchangable non refundable tickets). Again, I did not stew on this, we were determined to have a perfect weekend. 

When we got home, we went to pick up my car and while my husband was outside, my stepmom commented ""is he okay? he seemed so upset all weekend that I thought he changed his mind about wanting to marry you"" At this point I didnt want to hurt HER feelings by saying ""he was pissed yall kept being antisocial so he was agitated when you were around"" so I told her he was fine. That weekend my MIL threw a wedding party at her house for everyone who didnt get to go to the beach. Again, my parents didnt attend.

A few weeks later my stepmom calls me to come over. She lives half an hour away. I am a full time student with a full time job and a full time internship, so I try to schedule a time to meet for lunch when I KNOW she will be in town. She snaps that it is important and I need to come over. The whole time I am stressed and thinking she or my dad are dying or something. They sit me down and she precedes to tell me what an embarrassment I am for inviting people to my wedding and not paying for lunch afterwards. At this point I am fuming. She starts calling me a liar and swearing that I told her I was paying for lunch etc. 

THEN IT CLICKED. I wasnt a kid. They couldnt ground me or spank me. So  I tell her that everything out of her mouth is crazy and I leave. My dad calls and tells me to come back and apologize. I tell him I dont have anything to apologize for and he hangs up on me. 

A month later, one of my best friends kills himself, so I decide to call my parents and try and reconcile. I word my apology carefully so as to not sacrifice my own respect to the situation so I say ""I am sorry I made some choices you didnt agree with and I am sorry I fired back at you when you tried to discuss it with me"" she tells me it is water under the bridge and all is forgiven. I talk to my dad, who says the same. A week goes by and I feel like something is still up so I call to ""check-in"". My stepmom is  short with me so I decide to let her go, she snaps ""we need to talk"" and then starts to question the quality of my apology. I politely tell her I did not lie to her and I will not apologize for something I didnt do. She hangs up on me. 

A month later, my dad calls and tells me ""you need to apologize to your stepmom so you dont ruin the holidays."" I told him I already apologized and he snaps ""well its been nice knowing you, have a nice life"" and hangs up. That was December 4, 2014. I have not heard from them in 2 years but I have heard that they tell people that I am the one who cut them off because I am selfish and Godless. 

So, why do I still feel like it is my fault that we dont speak, while at the same time feel guilty because I hope they never try to reconcile?

PS: I HAVE since reconciled with my grandparents and they adore my husband ♡"

51ns6n,14,2016-09-07,[Support] [Advice] Exploded on NMom - relationship probably over,dj_dad885,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/51ns6n/support_advice_exploded_on_nmom_relationship/,"Hi all, I am a long time lurker or this sub and all of Reddit, but this is my first ever post. Apologies for formatting errors, etc. 


Before I get into what happened today, I want to give a brief history of my relationship with my mom. She had me at 19. Her pregnancy prevented her from going to college and she had to change her life plans drastically. For my whole life, I've been treated like an unwanted burden. My mom reminds how hard I made her life, how much better my life is (currently I am 22), etc. She's been emotionally abusive for as long as I remember and there were times when she was physically abusive. I didn't realize how abnormal my relationship with my mom was until I was 18 and off at college. Seeing other people's interactions with their parents made me realize how wrong mine was. I was able to enroll in therapy and my counselor confirmed what I had been suspecting: my mother is an unstable, abusive parent. 


Fast forward to today. I don't live at home with my family and rarely see them. My mother doesn't try to get me to come over and barely speaks to me when I do. The only reason I still go home is to see my dogs. They're with my parents while I job hunt (I just graduated from university this month!) before I take them to live with me. So I went home with my boyfriend to visit the dogs. We weren't anticipating my mom being home, but she was. At one point, I picked up one of my dogs and the new dog the family has lunged at my dog, trying to attack my dog while he was in my arms. My boyfriend and I both reacted harshly and he grabbed the dog off of my dog. 


Proceed to my mom losing it. She starts raising her voice, telling my boyfriend how inappropriate his reaction was. He calmly tried to explain that the new dog was attacking my dog. My mom transitioned to full on yelling, swearing at my boyfriend and telling him how disrespectful he is, etc. He is still trying to calmly talk her down and reason with her, before she kicks us out of the house. I stayed quiet through the fight and as we go to leave, she angrily yells, ""Bye dj_dad885."" I meekly respond with my own goodbye, which was not good enough. She starts screaming at me about how awful I am and I responded with, ""I'm not doing this,"" and try to get out the door with my boyfriend. She came down the hallway and was yelling more, about how she's so awful, blah blah blah and I lost it. I was barely holding it together after she yelled at my boyfriend. I got in her face and screamed back that she's a piece of shit, an abusive piece of shit. After this I immediately left with my boyfriend following me out. She also followed us out, screaming the whole way. 


We started to head home but my boyfriend turned back because he wanted to try to have a calm, reasonable conversation with my mom. Instead she stormed out to the car, demanded my house key back from me, while yelling at my boyfriend the whole time, as he was still trying to reason with her. 


We left. I talked to my best friend and she recommended giving it a couple of days to cool down before reaching out to my mom to talk to her about everything, so I can get it off of my chest. I am worried about my things and the few ties I still have to my family. The bulk of my belongings are in my parents' basement, where I left them when I moved out of my apartment before heading out of state for the summer for an internship. I'm still on their cell phone contract, though that's up in a month. I have my car insurance through them and my health insurance through them. As I've been sending out applications, I list their address as my permanent address since I don't have one myself (currently living with boyfriend). So, I'm concerned about my mail, my car, my phone, and my stuff. I also fear I'll never get my dogs. 


This blow up was a long time coming, but I still feel like shit. I sobbed the entire drive home and talked on the phone to my friend. I am so embarrassed she screamed and swore at my boyfriend. I just generally feel awful and emotionally drained. I'm coming to you guys for support and advice. I know everyone here has probably had similar situations and I'd like to get some words of encouragement and wisdom from those of you who have moved past this point and are doing well. Thank you in advance, RBN. "
51nvrd,5,2016-09-07,Transferring to The Art Institute of California Los Angeles Hollywood- Seeking Media/Game Art students for questions!!,GlitterTank,AskLosAngeles,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskLosAngeles/comments/51nvrd/transferring_to_the_art_institute_of_california/,"Hey LA Redditers-

I'm currently a student at The Art Institute of Portland, hoping to transfer to The Los Angeles Hollywood location for either Winter or Summer term. Motive being to gain exposure to a better job market, and to connect with peers and mentors who will be better resources for the industry than what Portland has to offer. In addition, the faculty strength in the Game Art department up here is seriously suffering, making me inclined to want to jump ship sooner than later.


1. What is your opinion on the current Game Art instructors? Are they teaching relevant material, that challenges you, going above and beyond ""survival"" level knowledge? How helpful are they outside of class/ on an individual level?

2. Do you think the advisers are properly preparing you for the job market?

3. Do the promised internships stand up? If you had one, was it a growth opportunity or a coffee-run gig? If you didn't get one, why?

4. Are there adequate technology resources? Are computer labs stocked with newer rigs, installed with all current and relevant software? Any other perks you can think of in this way?

5. I understand that the tuition is higher at the Hollywood location, was worth it?

6. During my campus tour in March, I was told that the school has easy access to the Metro line- is this a reliable resource, or is it still better to drive in/ try to live locally?

7. If there are other students who have experience with transferring AI campuses, and anecdotes to how much of a pain getting credits to transfer really was (and what it took to get your needs met), I would love to hear from you as well. 


Looking forward to hearing from you!

51nzgd,6,2016-09-07,Spent a month not job searching because a recruiter told me I got a job - now money is getting tight and I'm not hearing back from anyone,softwareengineerinte,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/51nzgd/spent_a_month_not_job_searching_because_a/,"My question is what would you do, or, what did you do if you've been in this situation.  
So, I finished my last class in early August. I'm officially done with my bachelors. Admittedly I procrastinated job searching because I was loving my summer internship and really wanted to work there. I was culturely a good fit and learned more than I've ever learned, but they decided against hiring me because of my lack of programming experience. They normally hire people from a school in my state that prides itself on being as rigorous as MIT, so my public school education and lack of prior internships or personal projects wasn't as desirable. I was told by many people there I ""have the mind for it"" but I just need to learn more and practice more.     

So, I applied to as many places as I possibly could. I got several rejection emails, tons of no-replys and finally one interview. The job listing was very vague and I assumed it was going to be a crappy job because I'd never heard of the contract company. Surprisingly, the job was at a very huge (well known in my state) pharmaceutical company and I got an onsite interview. I would be an entry level developer working on in-house tools for researchers to analyze data. Occasionally they also were put on other IT related tasks, they didn't use any kind of unit testing, they weren't Agile, and the guy in my interview mentioned they ""often just copy and paste the same code from old projects"". It wasn't exactly what I wanted, especially after being in the environment of my software engineering internship, but I was excited it was at a well known company and it would give me more experience coding.  

 Since then, the communication with the recruiter was very slow and I usually didn't get updates unless I emailed first. A week after my internship ended I was told I would get started in one to two weeks. Two weeks later I was told they were still unsure. Finally I was told there were unforeseeable circumstances and that there was no determined start date. I was even told I should continue my job search.  

I cannot afford to be jobless for an unknown period of time, so I am job searching again. I told the recruiter if there is a start date in the foreseeable future I would definitely still be interested and to keep me updated.  
  
Okay so, I've been putting in resumes and applications again. But, I have a problem. As my internship company stated, I am very inexperienced and need more practice with programming. I've been working on some side projects as best as I can but it is going to take a while to make anything that I am proud of. I need experience which requires either a job or time to work on something...   &lt;/ramble&gt; 

**tl;dr**  
I need to learn/ practice more before I can get a decent development job, 
but need a job asap for bills (I am not able to pay next month's rent as it stands right now),
I do have a lot of IT support experience and have considered broadening my search beyond development, but fear the low pay and lack of resume building 

IDK I'm mostly just venting. But if anyone has anything useful to say, pls do.

#Analysis

Reckasta, a very interesting person. If I can call em that. As far as my research has shown, Jen died a long time ago. She died in a car crash after she lost control of her powers due to some anger from her abusive parents. She was a very troubled person, dealing with lots of abuse. Being locked in basements, malnourished, beaten, probably some sexual things in there too. It would probably explain her current dating behaviors. anyways that caused her to fragment her personality as a protective measure. From what I understand, It wasn't anything spectacular. Jacob and Jade seemed to have a lot less power back then. They were human enough at the time.

So this is where things get interesting. Jen comes back with no memories of her death. I'm pretty sure at this point she began gaining supernatural powers. Things were no longer just the basic magic she had been doing. Probably met the dog around this time. The dogs very important, but I will get back to him later. She at somepoint happens to die again, this time it was suicide. She happens to come back from that even stronger than before. Now this begs the question. Why is she back. She didn't want to live. Even her alters don't even try to stop it. She was pretty set on it. Yet she came back. Obviously one can assume that she didn't bring herself back. It was something else.

This dog, from my brief interactions with it, is something far beyond my comprehension. I can't even fathom why this thing exists or what it even is doing. This thing can teleport, transform and not just to other similar beings, but can cause changes in temperature and even alter light. It has complete control over all of the elements, and is for all intents and purposes omnicient. It has become a little sadistic, probably from all the millenia it has exitested. Here's something though, If you look at Jens abilities, they are quite similar aren't they? Just the dog is better at it... Maybe just Maybe he is supplying Jen with some of his power. Maybe that has some sideffects on her personality.

So why is this GOD bothering with Jen? He mentioned something about an experiment. See my best guess, Jen is some sort of humunculous or maybe cyborg. She died and was forced to res against her will. When she decided to erase her memories, It was computer folders. Not natural in the least. At this point she isn't human. She can morph at will, teleport with limited distance, starting to be able to manipulate peoples perception and alter memories. And if she is some sort of artificial human, It would 100% explain how one of her altars was able to leave jens head.

Now, let's take the gods words at face value. This is an experiment. He also mentioned something about making sure nothing goes wrong in Jens progression. So Jen is basically a slave to this thing, It was able to take control of her body at will. so, I Want to kill this thing. A god needs to be murdered with the kitten body it gave me, So might as well save Jen in the process. The only way to free Jen from this things experiments, Is to ruin the experiment. Force it to take agressive actions. The best way to do that is to explain the experiment to Jen herself. Once she knows she can fight it. And heres the best part, theres two of them now. Jen couldn't do it by herself... But maybe two can? Oh btw it knows you read this... Good Luck, I may not survive to see the outcome of this... But as long as he doesn't kill me I should come back. He can reap souls as it put it...

I took all the precautions I could. I set up as many safeguards as I could to protect my own life. I tried to keep my own conciousness out of it as possible, and keep my memories clean, So it doesn't find out the plan until it's too late. I still had to set up a lot of mortal danger to myself so the dog doesn't realize how deep this plan goes. This is getting released to everyone regardless of the outcome. The people need to know, to fight back, or something at least not become a pawn in this things game. 



#NOTES
Has no idea what alters do when they are in charge

Lack of memories make her 'innocent', She will fall back down the dark path eventually

flirty with like everyone

watch for magic

jade is brutal Now, I want you to crawl to the nearest intern and beg for it's forgiveness. No, not walk, crawl. On your knees.

Screwing with people and psychological torture is pretty much how far she'll go

more relationship stuff...

feet fetish?

She made Jen open it, like she had been doing with everything so far. jade can control jen at will?

jade in charge of jen

He'd get in her room, somehow... However, as that feat alone would be nearly impossible, and I've been wanting to describe an accidental ""power"" of Jen's for a while, no hypnosis until you do a second roll.
He'd find, in place of a regular bedroom, an odd landscape. Not exactly something that would be seen in the real world, and everything digital seemed to be broken inside of it, numbers innaccurate. Upon further inspection, he'd find it was a large, large room, and he was the size of a small playing card. It very much resembled Alice in Wonderland. Dream powers?

make jade remember bad memories to get her off her game

Topaz would take the form of Jennifer's stepmother. Jade would flinch on seeing him, but do nothing immediately, expecting to be hit.

[form of stepmother]How delightfully uncharacteristic... Normally right about this time you'd have forced me to your knees in front of your husband... Or yourself... So, tell me who you are. Jenna's mom is dead... Unless they found a resurrection spell and used it on the worst waste of oxygen ever. Trying to keep her cool... Deep breaths...

Really? When Jenna drove you both off the bridge, I would have sworn you would have learned respect. Oh, how surprising it is you aren't using us to fulfill another of your fantasies, mother.

morphing

Immediately, he would be brought to a scene... A dark room... He was tied up... Sitting... Just sitting... Practically starving to death... He couldn't have been that old... Four, maybe?

He could hear two adults, a man and woman, cruel, cruel people, speaking outside, before they opened the door, and threw what looked to be a dog bowl in her direction. He started eating, as if she hadn't eaten in months.

Immediately, Jae would be forced to watch a hundred memories at once. None of them in which she would have been more than five. In each of them, the same man and woman would be enacting horrible, horrible things on her. Some, sexual fantasies that absolutely no one should have been forced to do, especially not a young girl. Most, if not all, drew blood. Others, extreme physical and mental abuse, that would even put a toll on Jae. The difference between Jade at the first memory, and her at the last, was insane. First, she was an innocent, scared little girl. After, she was the farthest thing from innocent, and had enough hate to drive anyone else insane.

Bend. Your. Knee. She gave a look that said she was wanting to help him, but afraid of something.

She blinks away

She'd immediately find herself on the cold, hard ground, shivering from pain. She could feel blood running down from her nose. After a while, she'd look around, finding lockers, and a crowded hallway. An old man, who would seem to be around sixty, and had a warm, welcoming smile permanently set on his face, would see her, looking startled.

""Jennifer! Are you alright?""

""Oi... Yes, Sir... J-Just a little sore...""

""We're getting you to the nurse's office immediately. I'm assuming you can stand?""

""No Sir...""

""Well then...""

He picked him up, gently, and started carrying her down the hall.

""Two months into Year Seven, and you've already visited her office ten times, correct? Jesus...""

""Eleven....""

The man and women would be screaming at her, saying things so hurtful they would have driven almost anyone past their limits.

Jen, crying, would yell: GO DRIVE OFF A BRIDGE!

Immediately, they would change direction, heading straight for... You guessed it, a bridge. The memory would end before anything really happened, though.

died twice

It broke us. Made us realise disobedience would invoke something even worse... Taught us our place in the word. And after he'd had his fun, he'd put us back together so well, you couldn't even see the scars...

Why do I get the feeling there are some women who would pay for this shit to happen to them... Hell, I think I probably'm standing really close to one of them right now... [in reference to jen]

He raised his hand to around 200cm, to show how tall he should have been.
You think becoming hotter is a problem? Just sayin', you didn't have to become a whole 'nother gender.     implies existance before jen

Natasha's her aunt's name. As much of a psychopath as she is kind, really. And then my friend, Jennifer, is slowly going crazy. Being talked into becoming Natasha 2.0. Rather sad, really. With a grin, she started walking out.

Well maybe I'm not the Jen you knew, OK? From what I heard from Danny, she was a cheating bitch who manipulated and bullied people into doing what she wanted! I'm not her!

If she can edit memories or whatever [jade]

She's alive because she went through a major trauma in my place... [jade]

I'm s-sorry, Sir.... [male person she hates most? dad?]

jen can memory wipe

She put her forehead in her hands, as if she had a massive migraine. [gets migraines when unlocking a memory]

jens computer folder memories

No chance in hell that Jade'd be a 'friend.'

What do you mean..?

Reckasta: 
She's a violent psychopath with no emotion!

It's going to be alright, Jade... You're safe now, he's not going to hurt you again. I won't let him.

Reckasta:

T-Thanks...

What he did was awful, and terrible, and evil. It wasn't your fault, okay?

Reckasta:

Y-Yeah... She hugged him tighter.

jade can give memories as well

I am currently a college student home from the summer (but about to leave). My parents are caring individuals on a physical level (e.g. give me money for college, make me food etc) but emotionally I have no connection with them.

 My mother is the kind of person who always thinks she is right about anything, and during high school we would get into a lot of disagreements about pretty much anything. She is kind of a helicopter parent. If I were to tell her I am going on a long trip somewhere for a weekend she would probably not allow me to take my car, 'in case something happens,' or perhaps she doesn't really trust my driving ability. The result here is that (especially if I am at college) I simply choose not to tell her what I am doing, because it is not of use to convince her otherwise. It is a bit difficult to portray how I feel without numerous examples, but it feels though in any situation, if she asks me my preference or opinion, she really wants to her what she wants to hear. Ex: Should we go to 1) or 2). If I said 1, and she said 2, she will say, 'No I think we should go to 2' and completely disregard my opinion. With a lot of instances like this, I come to realize that there is no real way to converse with my mother. She often gets angry at me about things without bringing them up in a calm manner first.

My dad is a pretty reserved person. Sometimes, he gets angry that I did something even though he never expressed that he didn't like something earlier. It's hard to talk to him about anything because it seems like he will agree with whatever I'm saying if I talk to him, but I don't think he does. He isn't the most social person so its hard to ask him something and get a real response.

My brother is kind of a fuck up who started failing college classes but lied to my parents about that due to some depression issues. He moved back with my parents and after some 5-6 years now he may be graduating soon. The main issue is that he is a really condescending person and thinks he knows everything because he reads it online (even though he doesn't know what he is talking about a lot). He seems to lack social skills a bit (as in talk about things that people don't care about) but I don't go out with him too much. What makes me angry is that I am a very hardworking college student with numerous internships etc and I hate being talked down to someone who kind of is wasting his life.

tl;dr: I don't feel like I can genuinely talk to anyone in my family because of the way they act. It makes me pretty sad because a lot of my friends are close with their parents and I feel bad about my feelings. I think some also look down upon me if I say that I am not close with my family, or I don't miss them. I feel like life in the future will be more lonely because of my relationship with my family."

51oxrh,232,2016-09-07,How should I [27 M] breakup with my 3-year GF [24 F] because she quit her job and now has a hard time finding one,terrista,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/51oxrh/how_should_i_27_m_breakup_with_my_3year_gf_24_f/,"Back in January, before she graduated with her Associate's degree, my girlfriend ask to borrowed $5000 so she doesn't have to pay interest on her student loan. We did not have a signed contract because she was a paid intern, and another company had already contacted her about working full time after she graduated.


When she started her fulltime job, my girlfriend, did not get along well with her boss. After 1 month at work (this is her first fulltime job), she quit because she got into a big fight with her boss. 

Now she asked one and only one person what to do, her best friend, and she of course, told her to quit. She did not ask for my opinion on the matter, which was quite frustrating since she doesn't owe money to her best friend. Her best friend is also in a different financial situation, since she has a higher paying job, and has more savings than her.  They thought with the unemployment rate for technical people (my girlfriend is a programmer) being low in MA, she can easily get a job. If she asked me, I know I would've easily advised for her to stay 1 year, because from my experience, even I who had a Bachelor's degree had to search for 3 months before landing an entry level job.

Edit: Also, I don't think we are financially compatible. I live a frugal life, so money is a very important factor to how I live. I'd rather not go out on a weekend and go on a country annually, but she wanted to go out every weekend when she had an internship and a job.

My girlfriend has been searching for jobs these past 2 months, although I think not as aggressively as she could. She keeps buying cheap wine every week with her savings, instead of saving money or paying it, since she's saying she gets depressed from all the job searching.

We live separately: I have my own apartment, and she lives with her parents, thankfully. Her parents do not know she borrowed money from me, but only my mom and my best friend knows my girlfriend borrowed money from me, but my mom doesn't know how much. I just told my mom it is over 1000 bucks. I haven't even told my mom that my girlfriend quit her job.

I want to break up with her, but how do I do it without making her more depressed than she already is, while also getting a guarantee that she'll pay me back?

TL;DR My girlfriend quit her job last June, because she was confident she would find a job in programming, but only has an AS degree. She also owes me 5000 bucks instead of taking out a loan. And she needs a better car. But I want out and how can I make her pay me back."

I just recently started trying to formally educate myself on the ideas behind socialism and marxism, and I'm really enjoying the process.

Now is the middle of ""internship season"" at Purdue, when recruiters are constantly on campus. Other semesters I would have been purely excited to apply and get a spot at a big software firm for the summer, but I want to be a little more critical of my approach this year. /u/craneomotor suggested I either look for a job somewhere working with open source software, or a job in an industry central to capitalist development (his recommendation was logistics).

51pobf,1,2016-09-08,21 [M4F] - Starting Over,burnbabyburner69,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/51pobf/21_m4f_starting_over/,"On September 22nd, 2036, a deep space probe was launched from Cape Canaveral. Its creators had designed it to detect supernovas in far away galaxies, but they had no idea that it's destiny laid in another direction. In order to escape the solar system, it had to use the Sun as a gravity assist. Readings taken from the probe as it circled the Sun were almost ignored completely, as many thought that the probe's sensors wouldn't read any significant information. Luckily though, a team of interns had no better work to do at the time and combed over the data as a way to keep their skills honed. One of them found an abnormal measurement and reported it to her superiors, but she got no word back about it. She figured that it must have been nothing. She was wrong.

As soon as her superior looked over her discovery, he knew something was amiss. He went straight to the top and a small, top-secret task force was commissioned to investigate the measurement. A couple decades passed by before they reached their conclusion. The chemical makeup of the Sun was not nearly as stable as had been accepted for so long. The Earth didn't have billions of years left before the Sun blew up, it had hundreds.

President Alvarez had just been sworn in weeks before he was informed of the matter. While still keeping the veil of a normal presidency around him, he spent the entirety of his 8 year term researching the options that Earth had left. It was settled within a year that Earth was doomed. The Sun had reached the point of no return centuries ago and moving the Earth out of the blast radius was [out of the question](http://imgur.com/a/SIfaO).

Obviously, there had to be some kind of evacuation, but technology was extremely limited. Even when the other governments of the world were contacted, their pooled efforts could only create one spaceship that had could carry the resources necessary for sustaining life far enough away from the Sun. It wasn't all doom and gloom though. The research on designing the base accelerated quickly, and the spaceship itself was designed in less than a decade. The same probe that discovered the Sun's fatal flaw was retasked to scout out planets, and a small list of acceptable candidates was assembled quickly. Models suggested that the primary planet candidate could have its atmosphere be made breathable in less than a century and that the soil could be made farmable, though that would take a significantly longer amount of time.

All that was easy. The hard part came when it was time to select the people to fill the ark, as most of the people who knew of it called it. Some thought they should all be engineers, people who could manage the base well and troubleshoot mechanical problems the easiest. Others wanted a more balanced team that could manage all sorts of things, like the plants or the crew's health. A few politicians even suggested that the crew should be made of philosophers and artists to preserve Earth culture.

The decision was largely made for them though as two new problems surfaced. First, the cryogenics systems didn't develop as nicely as the others. Tests on people over 50 were catastrophic, with volunteers not lasting more than a few days before the tests had to be stopped for safety reasons. Further tests and calculations estimated that no one over 40 could survive the journey. To add onto the problems, volunteers with even average amounts of stress were much more likely to suffer heart attacks in their sleep state.

The second problem was the elephant in the room that everyone tried to ignore for as long as possible. To continue the human race, the crew had to breed. But the ship could only hold six people, five women and one man to ensure long term species procreation. There would have to be incest just to create a third generation. Knowing that it had to be done, research was done on the science of incestuous breeding and it was found that only .0001% of the population had the genes necessary to sustain a healthy family tree.

With these two factors in mind, the most qualified candidates were identified from a short list. Most people who were involved in the decision wanted the candidates to be trained and debriefed extensively before the launch. However, the cryogenic scientists made it clear that the stress of knowing the fate of humanity was to be carried on their shoulders was far too much. The only plan that ensured the safety of the candidates was to sedate them in their sleep and put them into the cryochambers without even the slightest bit of warning or preparation.

Thousands of years later, the lights in the spaceship turned on. It had landed on the virgin planet just as the scientists and engineers designed it to. The cryochambers started their three day reanimation process, and once the crew members exited, they barely had a chance to speak to each other before a video played in the center of the room.

""Hello, I'm Dr. Baker. Welcome to Project Phoenix.""

***

This is obviously a long term prompt that will focus on breeding, and if the RP goes on for a long time, incest. However, this most likely isn't going to be a sex-focused RP. The main focus will most likely be on the characters themselves as they go through the emotions of knowing they're the last humans alive and the struggles that they'll face just to survive and deal with each other. I'm looking for realistic character development, with each one taking a different view on their situation.

Breeding is the only truly necessary kink for this RP, but others can be discussed. Here's my [kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/ZTXuOUH.png) if you want to check it out. I'm always open to doing this prompt, so no matter when you're reading this, feel free to shoot me an orange envelope!"

My background: I've started my third year of community college with my major being computer science. The reason I haven't transferred yet is because I lack the Math requirements in order to be accepted into the CS major. I am not looking to do ECE. I plan to apply to Berkeley and Davis this season.

I have completed my community colleges Computing Fundamental, Data structure and Assembly language courses(all with very high grades). These are the extent of the CS courses my school has to offer. By the end of Spring 2017, I will have finished IGETC and have completed up to Calculus 2. My GPA will be &gt;= 3.69.

I have interned at a prominent National Laboratory. I was the youngest in terms of my academic studies and the only one not from a technical or 4-year university. For example, 80% of the interns in my program were finishing their masters degrees from Universities such as NYU, GATech, CMU, etc. I am also one of the few interns that was hired on part time during the school year. I also hold an active security clearance for the work I do at the National Laboratory.

My questions for you: /r/UCDavis 

1. What are my chances of getting in?
1. Will my internship experience make an impact? If so, how can I further elaborate on this during my application process?
1. Anything information you can pass my way to help ease my anxiety?"

I thought they'd have a few different sizes and a couple that vibrated, but instead I found myself standing in front of a giant wall of dildos, vibrators, magic eggs, rabbits, double-ended strap-ons, rotating rods, suction cupped bases, there are even a couple that squirt, which is kind of gross and kind of...intriguing.

I finally choose one. It's purple, which is cute, and pretty big, but not crazy. (And some of them were crazy, like, bigger around than my arm.) It's smooth, but with some raised veins, and it vibrates. It doesn't squirt.

I walk past the lingerie and party toys, thankful that I don't have to walk through the magazine and video sections to get to the register. I do take a quick glance over there and see a man disappearing into some saloon-style swinging doors. Maybe they have dressing rooms or something back there?

I tell myself there's nothing to be embarrassed about as I make my way up to the counter. I tell myself that the clerk sees dozens of people every day buy things that are not talked about in polite society. I try to make my cheeks un-blush, but I can tell by how lightheaded I feel that it's not working at all.

In case you couldn't tell, I've never done this before.

""Find everything you need?"" I nod and get out my credit card, hoping to transact my business quickly and be on my way. The guy behind the counter is sitting on a stool and the floor back there seems to be several inches higher than on this side, adding to the feeling that I'm a little girl hoping this man approves of me. At least he's younger than my dad.

He starts opening the box.

""Wait, what are you--"" I freeze. What's going on?

""We just have to make sure it works, make sure the right product is in here."" He pulls it out of the box and it bobs its head at me. ""Returns, you know, they're a bitch. Nobody wants to buy a used one of these guys. Well, most people, anyway.""

He pulls some batteries out of a drawer and inserts them into the base. When he flicks the switch it starts buzzing and he immediately drops it onto the counter like it's a fish.

""Whoa! Feisty little guy, isn't he?"" He picks it up and turns it back off. ""Looks like it works just fine. Look okay to you?"" He looks at me, waiting for a response. I nod, still blushing. ""Okay then. Address?""

""Address? You mean, where I live?"" I sputter.

""Just a mailing address. In case there are any recalls or anything. It happens, you know. Not very often, but this here is one household electronic device you do not want catching fire on you, that's for sure.""

I give him my address. Then, when he asks, my phone number. Yes, it's a cell phone, not a landline. ID? Apparently to make sure I'm not under 18. As if I would have risked being seen in one of these places in my hometown, before I left for college. The clerk even signed me up for their membership club so I could get a 20 percent discount on everything, with a membership card and everything.

Eventually, I have my vibrator in a box, in a bag, along with a bottle of lube the clerk gave me, and I'm ducking out of the door into the midday sunshine, hoping no one from any of my classes sees me before I'm in my car and out of the parking lot. I don't even speed on the way home. I just let the anticipation build in the bottom of my stomach...

---

Well that was longer than I intended! But I've been waiting to use this prompt for kind of a while and I've built it up in my head quite a bit. There are several directions it could go, but all of them end up with our heroine being a lot less innocent than she is now.

For instance, she could get a letter or phone call saying that model is being recalled so she gets store credit for the value of it, then she's told about the dressing rooms (or product testing rooms) that aren't quite as private as she might expect, what with the one-way mirrors on three sides and the video camera. This could lead eventually to stripping, gloryholes, gangbangs, prostitution...

Or perhaps she starts getting calls or texts from gentlemen interested in meeting her after seeing her ad. Of course, she's surprised, even shocked, but the places they're proposing to take her are really swanky, the kinds of places she's never been. This could lead to a being taken advantage of, a sugar-baby relationship, sex clubs, prostitution, meeting someone unexpected...

Or maybe the lube sample the clerk gave her has aphrodisiac properties and her personality starts changing. She becomes more outgoing, even quite forward, with the men around her. Maybe she gets a job where she can show off more, as a server at a restaurant famous for their wings and tight orange shorts, or maybe she just starts showing off more at the job she already has (bartender, barista, office intern, university medical office,...).

If all else fails, maybe she just gets caught using the vibrator by her male roommate(s) or her roommate's boyfriend, but I think we can do better than that.

I'm also interested to hear your ideas, as long as it leads somewhere interesting. 

Feel free to tell me what you want me to look like! I really like pretending to be all sorts of girls. If you'd rather I pick, I can do that too.

[I have a kinklist!](https://i.imgur.com/kMI1pUX.png) It's new. I hope it worked right.

Please include a description of your character and where you see this story going!

Looking forward to your creative replies!"

Though that is partly a lie, because I am fully aware of the mistakes I made and the situation I was in to get here. I apologize in advance for how long this may be.

Three years ago I was doing pretty well for a 26-year-old living in a small city in KY. I was a store manager, had a decent amount of money in the bank, an apartment with a fenced in backyard for my dog and I was active in my community. I was working out about 3-4 days a week, writing regularly, had a lot of good friends and was genuinely happy. Being happy was a testament in itself because I have been battling depression since I could remember, and I wasn't on medication. It was at this point in my life that I felt like I was over the ""girl that got away"" and wanted to pursue a meaningful relationship with a girl I had seen basically everywhere I went but never talked to very much. When we finally did speak, everything started out great, until it became something that made me ruin myself. 

Because I was so well off, I was pretty generous when it came to those that I cared about. I was usually the one who had money in my group of friends, so I would pay for meals, give gas money, buy pizza for DnD nights and so forth. None of it was asked of me because I like helping others if it is within my means. This was my first mistake in my new relationship. This girl had a daughter and was living with her mom that on a regular basis threatened to kick her out of the house to the street. Her mom was a very toxic individual and being the nice person I am I offered to help her get out of her mom's sooner, rather than later. At this point, her ex-husband was paying a decent amount of child support that unknownst to me was not court mandated, just their agreement. I agreed to pay for her deposit and first months rent to get her into her new apartment, under the pretense she'd pay me back in about 2-3 months. As soon as she gets into her apartment... the child support stops. She can't pay me back, and instead uses her tax money to pay up some of her bills and housing expenses. At this point, some of her behaviors started to change and become more and more apparent she has really bad anxiety and OCD tendencies. These started to really affect our relationship as she became more and more dependant on me and I didn't realize what was happening until it was too late. 

I basically became her only support. I'd buy her groceries, but if she deemed them unclean, damaged or whatever she would throw them away. Sometimes it would be almost brand new food and drinks and such. We'd argue about how wasteful it was and how I had to buy more, but she would threaten to not eat or whatever tactic she could come up with and I would fold because it also affected her child.  I became less active socially, I stopped going to the gym, my stress levels skyrocketed and my depression started to become a real issue for me again. Her anxiety got worse and worse and it became unbearable, but I was her only support. Then her car payment came due and she couldn't afford it, so I paid. Her insurance was late, so I paid. Rent, food, gas, almost everything I started paying for it, and slowly watched everything I had built drain away. She'd yell and be a victim and say she would end up on the street with her child, or she couldn't lose her car because she needed to go to class, and so on and so on... If it wasn't for me, she would have never made it through the rest of her college or her 6-8 month long internship. However, I also ended up on medication for the first time ever. I felt like a failure. 

It was a very vicious cycle that continued on way too long. I should have ended it sooner, but I didn't see a way out. Ultimately I couldn't afford to pay for both my apartment and hers, so we lost both, had to pay breach of contract fees and move in with my parents. I got a new job because my old one closed, and I was making more money, but it didn't matter. She kept draining me away emotionally, mentally and monetarily. My work suffered greatly, I was depressed, stressed and a shell of the person I was. I started to gain weight, and just feel bad about myself. A lot more stuffed happened between us, and I was blamed for it for treating her poorly. I became distant, uncaring and emotionless. I really just didn't care anymore. So I became the target of all our problems. I was the one doing all the horrible things to cause our relationship to crumble. I'm not saying I was perfect in any way. I did do some things I'm not proud of, but it was more to escape and try to find the light again. I never cheated on her, though I had the opportunity. 

While we lived with my parents, it put a massive strain on my relationship with them because of her actions. I finally told her she needed to move out and she did but without my help this time. The ex finally decided to pay child support again. Our empty relationship continued, my work suffered, I lost my management position, I gained more weight, I became more distant. After a few nasty arguments where I was just trying to stop her from taking a bunch of pills, and her ending up punching me in the face, or her thinking I wanted to bang her friend, or my friends, or the girl walking down the sidewalk... I had enough. We broke up and it was the messiest, vicious most emotionally draining and explosive thing I have ever had to go through. Which is saying a lot, because my dad has PTSD from the Gulf War (The catalyst to my own mental issues).  I was finally free and I could breathe again. It was too late for a lot of things though. 

I was no longer well off. I barely had any money, despite making good paychecks. I had maxed out most of my credit cards that were once paid off. I was behind, and couldn't catch up. The bills we had tied together (I co-signed for care credit and she was on my phone plan) she didn't pay on at all. I was finally breathing again but still broken. I thought I was going to make it, but then because of my past actions and behaviors due to stress and her emotional distress I lost my job. So I lost my benefits, and also medication that was actually helping me. 

For five months I looked for a new job, applying to more than 80 locations, and finally found one at 8.50 an hour. I used to make 40-50k a year. I was able to keep up with bills for a little while, but for the past two months I have been denied unemployment (because of very poor communication at the office, and my ignorance of the system), and have no income whatsoever.  I am so far behind on bills I really don't know what I am going to do. I have made so many poor decisions that here I am, turning 30 in a month and living with my parents and so far in debt, I have contemplated things I haven't in years. I won't do anything, as I have made it this far in life I won't give up now, but damn do I wish I had a breather.  

The one plus I have is I found a girl I really care about, and she is good to me. Sadly I can't go to her for a lot of this because I will never do to her what I allowed to happen to me. I am determined to get through this, but for the first time in my life, I don't know how. I have to keep moving forward even though most days I can barely get out of bed. I really don't know why I am posting this... I just felt the need to write it out. For those that read the whole thing, I commend you for reading my story. "
51q7es,5,2016-09-08,please help me. am I just being a lazy imposter? why do I feel wrong?,JanetSnarkhole,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/51q7es/please_help_me_am_i_just_being_a_lazy_imposter/,"Today I texted my internship again saying I can’t come cause I’m not feeling well.
I lied and said I have a migraine but while my head does really hurt I just do not know how to get out of bed, get showered,  put on my ‘face’ and sit amongst everyone. I am studying to be a teacher so that would mean sitting among teenagers and then in the teacher’s lounge with co-workers. I just can’t do it today.

But now I feel horribly guilty for cancelling.

I think I might be depressed. But, what if I am just being lazy? What if I went to the doctor and he laughed at me and said that I’m just being lazy?

I don’t see a point in life. I don’t want to die, either, cause I love my cats and my boyfriend, and sometimes I can be happy. When I’m not anxious, or actually have some energy, life can be OK.

It’s weird, because yesterday I actually did some work and went outside for lunch but now I can’t even get out of bed?!

What if its just the start of the schoolyear?! I started feeling like this a week ago, but I’ve been anxious my whole life. Enough to function though. But lately I can’t muster up any energy. Sometimes my boyfriend would just pull me out of bed, and then I went to whatever event, and I would have a good time, but just feel shit the moment  I get home.

On paper I shouldn’t be this sad. I’m doing a crowdfunding thing to realise my dream and everyone believes it will be fully funded, cause there is a lot of enthusiasm. I just can’t see it happen though, I’m just an imposter and don’t know what I’m doing. I  am continuing pitching to people and contacting sponsors but I’m just going through the motions and really don’t see the point cause it’s gonna fail anyway?!
And why am I sad because I have a lot of friends who would be here in a heartbeat if I just felt like it had a point in telling them about this?
And why am I sad because I finally found a boyfriend  this year who is worth everything and who just appreciates me the way I am and doesn’t try to change me and likes me even though I’m suddenly the fattest I’ve been my whole life? 

What if its just because my boyfriend had to leave the country for work this week and I don’t know when I’m seeing him again? What if I’m just sad about that? Or what if its just his existentialism rubbing off on me?

What if I just feel overwhelmed? Because I’m doing my studies, my internship, my research project, my crowdfunding thing, and a job at the same time. Maybe it’s just that?

Or maybe it’s just because I’m worried about my financial situation? Only 4 euros in my bank account right now. It’s anxiety-inducing on the one hand, but on the other hand, I just think: money is just made up, and what’s the point?

I can’t be depressed, can I? I’m the good child. My sister is the mentally ill one.  My dad says I should just accomodate to her. But she’s tiring me out with all her selfishness and narcissism. What if it’s just that? Maybe my sister is just draining me?

I just feel like I’m not allowed to be depressed. I feel guilty for having off days and canceling things. I’ll feel guilty because I wouldn’t be the golden child my dad thinks I am. He said I’m his only normal daughter, but I wouldn’t be if I was depressed would I? And how would I ever finish this degree if I was depressed? Who benefits from a depressed teacher?

I think I’m depressed, but then I think not, maybe I’m just a lazy attention-seeker,  a imposter, faker, making excuses? 

I’m not even sure if it is sadness, it feels more like some sort of pointlessness, like everything’s made up and I’m just playing by someone else’s rules.

While I’m not suicidal, I don’t see the point in life anymore. I feel like a puppet. I am constantly tired even if I do go to bed early, but I like sleeping better than being awake anyway. I can’t concentrate on things anymore. I cry about every little thing like my sister eating all the chocolates or running out of catfood and having to go to the grocery store.

Please tell me Reddit, am I just being a lazy attention seeker and will the doctor laugh at me if I attempt to get help? (And that’s me thinking do I even want help. What is the point anyway?). 

I would ask people around me, but I think my boyfriend would think he caused this with his existentialism (while in reality he did just keep me sane by saying ‘even though it’s all made up you gotta go on'). I don’t see the point in talking to my dad and sisters, cause my sisters have (had) way worse mental illnesses. And why would I tell my friends. I’m usually the listener myself.

I also thought about making a throwaway but what is the point.

I also feel disgusting about how self-pitying this story sounds, I'm sorry  about that...

thanks for reading everything if you did. I'm going back to bed for now."
51qu59,7,2016-09-08,About 4 or 5 months after treatment and first semester of college after 2 year break,HipsterIguana,ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/51qu59/about_4_or_5_months_after_treatment_and_first/,"I think I have really enjoyed the progress so far, but I may be doing some things wrong, I don't know what exactly though since I feel like I may not be prioritizing correctly or what have you. Though, that is more of a separate issue I fee like.

Here are my results:

-Straight A's so far since the summer class I took as well.

-Involved in class and I stimulate group/class discussions very well.

-I am more fascinated and curious about the topics I learn.

-Even though things I don't want to do, it's much easier for me to do them and get them done well.

-3 internship offers from small to large companies

-Built a very strong network in the industry I am in that I will have a job in the field I want to work in after college

-Based on progress I can leverage my internships and the relationships I've built to get internship from a blue chip company

-Great odds in being able to transfer into a top tier university(based on class performance, resume, extra curricular, internship, A-grade recommendation letters)

-Great odds in landing a 6 figure starting position right after college based on feedback from the executives Ive built great relationships with (will be graduating in 4-5 years so I still have a lot of time to really ramp up my resume and experience)

Negatives: 

-Havent been in college for 2 years so have to take a placement exam for math and have forgotten almost everything with math

-Trying to learn 2 years worth of math (algebra-precal) in 2 months, but because of my schedule it is incredibly difficult to spare time to do so and I absolutely hate spending time on this

-If I dont place in a good math class then I will be delayed in transferring having to graduate in ~5years, if I get placed in a good math class then I can probably finish in 3-4 years. 

Just giving feedback and maybe if you guys have suggestion for my particular problem.

51qy3q,1,2016-09-08,34M4F - A few scenarios to pick from,2468_throwaway,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/51qy3q/34m4f_a_few_scenarios_to_pick_from/,"Hello, looking for an RP to see out the day with.. I'll put a few RP prompts but these aren't set in stone so we can vary them.

My kinks - Leather/PVC clothing, boots, rough sex, anal and assplay, big cock and cumshot, deepthroat, athletic girls

The RPs will involved most of, or all of, the above kinks. Limits - Hardsports, incest, anything under 18

Indecent Proposal - one of my favourites, all the details are here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3wyd43/34m4f_the_indecent_proposal/ - also I've combined this with the office roleplay in the past to some success so I would be interested in exploring this more, such as 

* the intern gets a special offer
* staff member needs to make a deal to save their job

Office Muck Up - this worked out well, all details here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3sfmkc/33m4f_office_mistake/

Escort Roleplay - I've had some great roleplays with this scenario - you are an escort and I'm your client. You can play anyone from a street hooker to a high class/exclusive/celebrity escort. I've also been exploring an 'Old West Brothel' RP - you'd play a girl working in a brothel above an Old West bar, your clients could be the sheriff, the mayor, an outlaw?

Stalker - I've been following you for a while, and watching you. That's the basic premise but we can work out the exact details. This could be quite a dark RP if we both wanted it to be that way. Do you know I'm watching? Are you enjoying it? Do I break in one night?

Damsel in distress - I have a log cabin in a remote mountain range. You get stuck on my doorstep after getting lost and racing to shelter from a snow storm. You have no choice but to spend the weekend with me, which isn't a bad prospect on first impressions as I'm a typical romantic novel woodsman - strong, sexy, fit etc.

A gym affair - I run a gym, you are a member. We're both married, but we are both crazy about each other. Ultimately this will end up with us in the gym after hours making use of all the equipment. Actually, I'd pretty much consider any roleplay that involves sex in the gym - sexy ladies in gymwear are a thing for me

Celeb Play - I absolutely love celeb roleplay and if my writing partner fully commits to the character, it can be amazing. Really open to anything with this one.

Unless you want to play yourself, or if we're doing celeb roleplay, I usually like the women in my RP to be picked from one of the following subs - AthleticGirls Hardbodies TrashyBoners FestivalSluts"

I've just finished my 2nd year of a 4 year BSc. in Computing here in Ireland.

I'm looking to spend a gap year in the Nairobi area to spend some time with my Father before going back to Ireland to finish my degree (I would be staying near Kiserian) and was wondering if anyone knew where I should look for entry level software development jobs or internships mainly working with java.

I have a kenyan passport so I can work in Kenya no problem.

I've been researching on my own but there are so many different jobs sites and I'm wondering which ones are most popular in Nairobi. The websites I'm seeing all appear to cater to non-nationals and a lot of them look like they haven't been updated with job listings for a long time.

Even if I can't find any jobs in software development I would be looking for any kind of customer service job (retail, waiter etc.) so if anybody could point me in the right direction regarding recruitment websites etc. I would really appreciate it!

Asante sana!

51rfgx,17,2016-09-08,First flying lesson Saturday...need life advice,RT_16,flying,https://www.reddit.com/r/flying/comments/51rfgx/first_flying_lesson_saturdayneed_life_advice/,"Hello, /r/flying!

I'm in dire need a little life direction, and I'm hoping some of y'all can provide some insight.  I've been reading as many threads as I can find about this, but coming in with limited flying background, everything I read about flying careers seems so intangible and unreal.  Hoping someone who has been in my place can tell me how everything turned out for them.  

I'm a senior in college who will be graduating in December with a degree in Mechanical Engineering.  The thought of working a 7-4 engineering job, every day, in the same place, makes me want to go hide under a rock.  (I recently quit my internship at a local automotive plant after a year and a half to focus on school for my last semester--typical ""co-worker died of cancer, gave me a wake-up call and I ran screaming from that lifestyle"" move).  I recently considered going back to get my Master's, with the hopes that I could go to work in the defense industry and blow sh*# up in the desert, or something along those lines.  

Last weekend, I flew for the first time since I was 14.  We took a private jet on vacation, and while on vacation we had an opportunity to fly in a seaplane.  I dove into the co-pilot seat on three of the four flights, and I have never, ever, felt so...alive.  (*Insert remainder of cheesy ""flying is amazing"" spiel...sure you all understand.*)  With an engineering background, I also have an immense appreciation for the science behind flight.  It was all so cool.  Whew.  

I'm taking my first flying lesson this Saturday (technically a discovery flight...checking out the local airport).  I've got about a month to figure out what I want to do with my life, and suddenly I've found a whole new passion.  I've always been a person of passion: wildly impulsive, an avid outdoors(wo)man and willing to piss away my last dime on Jeeps, boats, or dirt bikes.  That said, I'm not reckless.  But  I will lay everything on the line to help or protect someone.  That's the only thing that truly ""drives me,"" if you will.  I've been looking into jobs flying float planes/small pistons in remote areas, but I don't know a single person personally who holds a job like that.  Flying for an airline doesn't sound quite as interesting to me, but of course I haven't flown enough to know for sure.  Salary isn't a huge concern, but I don't intend to eat Ramen until I'm 40, either.  I will, I assume, eventually want to get married and have a family.  Are there a good number of jobs flying small planes (is there a general term for that type of thing?)  that are relatively stable?  Is that like chasing the end of a rainbow?  Is everyone laughing because I'm the 25,604th person to get stars in their eyes for float planes and conjure up unrealistic dreams?

If I tell my parents, ""I'm moving to Canada to land planes on lakes!"" am I going to get laughed out of the state and wind up miserable and full of regret?  

We all have one life.  So many people are willing to settle for mediocrity, but I feel that pilots in general have more or less pursued their passions.  How did it turn out?  What do y'all recommend I do in the immediate future?  It would take an act of God to afford to get my PPL before I graduate, and even then, I couldn't immediately get a flying job (and would obviously need a lot more training to get other ratings, etc).  If I ditch grad school and get a real job, I may not have time to fly.  If I go to grad school, I may not have money to fly.  If I sell everything I own and beg on the streets and get my PPL before December, I'll still have to get a regular job, even if I wanted to continue flight training.  Any ideas?  Thanks in advance, everyone.  

Sincerely, 
A lost college student

UPDATE:  Thanks to everyone for the quick and positive advice!!  I've got plenty to consider and am excited about the possibilities for the future.  Y'all rock.

51rnfx,11,2016-09-08,American considering working/interning in England (specifically Liverpool) with questions,BobbyKnightsLeftNut,LiverpoolFC,https://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/51rnfx/american_considering_workinginterning_in_england/,"Hi, I'm an American student who is studying to become a sports journalist. I graduate this spring and so I need to either find an internship or a job for after college ends. For those not familiar with the journalism field in America, the job market isn't exactly booming. I'm going to be applying to places all across the country, and I figured that if I'm going to be doing that, why not also apply to places internationally?

Anyway, another journalism student friend of mine was telling me about how he has plans to try and work in Bangkok next summer at a paper there and explained to me how he planned to go about getting the position. It made me realize that I should try the same thing, and it would make the most sense for me to try to go to England (specifically Liverpool for probably obvious reasons). It's somewhere I've always wanted to go, there wouldn't be a language barrier and it would be fascinating to spend time and cover sports in a country where soccer (football) is king. I'm going to start cold calling newspapers in Liverpool and across England very soon asking about summer internship opportunities or any other possible positions they could have for me.

My questions are the following and directed at people from Liverpool and England: what are some of the most respected newspapers and other media outlets that exist? Where are some newspapers I should avoid (other than the newspaper that shall not be named)?

Also, if I couldn't go to Liverpool or ended up somewhere else, what other places in England would you recommend? Of course everyone knows about London, and I know Birmingham is the next biggest city, but I don't really know which cities are considered desirable, which ones have a lot of crime, etc.

Also, this is a bit more specific, but if anyone has direct knowledge of the journalism or sports journalism culture in England, what's it like? It appears to me as an outsider that it's a lot more tabloid-y, which I'm not a huge fan of but it is what it is. I also looked up a few newspapers online and saw how small the staffs are. Newspaper staffs in America are definitely shrinking, but I wasn't expecting to see newspapers for major cities having 6-10 staff members and that's it. So any information on that front would be helpful as well.

Any other kind of advice or tips would also be greatly appreciated. I know this post isn't really soccer or LFC related, but I figured that there would be plenty of people here who could help me out. I also messaged the mods ahead of time to make sure I could post this, so I do have their blessing.

Thank you ahead of time to anyone and everyone who replies."
51robc,12,2016-09-08,What to do when you're not motivated anymore ?,n0ctali,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/51robc/what_to_do_when_youre_not_motivated_anymore/,"Hi, 

Just a little background. I have always liked programming. So when I had the opportunity, I went to a school that teaches computer science and I really liked learning C, Java and web development. I always came home and worked on some side projects just to learn more. I was really hungry to become the best developer I could be.

Last year, I had the chance to go to England (I am from Switzerland) to do an internship, but I ended up working in a really sh*tty company where I was the only developer and I had to work extra hours every day just to finish all the projects the previous developers who quit had left behind. I worked so much that I became sick. 

Eventually, the internship finished (even though my boss didn't want to pay me but whatever) and now I am working in an other company here in Switzerland. The problem is that I really have no motivation anymore. The things that I once enjoyed doing don't seem fun anymore and I stopped programming when I go home.

 I am afraid that I was so disgusted by my first internship that I don't want to program anything anymore. I really want to start programming again but I just have no motivation.

I graduate this spring and so I need to either find an internship or a job for after college ends. For those not familiar with the journalism field in America, the job market isn't exactly booming. I'm going to be applying to places all across the country, and I figured that if I'm going to be doing that, why not also apply to places internationally?

Anyway, another journalism student friend of mine was telling me about how he has plans to try and work in Bangkok next summer at a paper there and explained to me how he planned to go about getting the position. It made me realize that I should try the same thing, and it would make the most sense for me to try to go to England. It's somewhere I've always wanted to go, there wouldn't be a language barrier and it would be fascinating to spend time and cover sports in a country where soccer (football) is king. I'm going to start cold calling newspapers across England very soon asking about summer internship opportunities or any other possible positions they could have for me.

My questions are the following: what are some of the most respected newspapers and other media outlets that exist? Where are some newspapers I should avoid (I already know to avoid the Sun)?

Additionally, what places in England would you recommend? Of course everyone knows about London, and I know Birmingham is the next biggest city, but I don't really know which cities are considered desirable, which ones have a lot of crime, etc.

Also, this is a bit more specific, but if anyone has direct knowledge of the journalism or sports journalism culture in England, what's it like? It appears to me as an outsider that it's a lot more tabloid-y. I also looked up a few newspapers online and saw how small the staffs are. Newspaper staffs in America are definitely shrinking, but I wasn't expecting to see newspapers for major cities having 6-10 staff members and that's it, which also means the sports desks are even smaller. So any information on that front would be helpful as well.

Any other kind of advice or tips would also be greatly appreciated. Thank you ahead of time to anyone and everyone who replies."

My parents have always been super strict about my school rules. I've always had pressure on me to not get bad grades. 

About 2 years ago I failed college. It happend a few months after I started living on my own. I never told my parrents I failed. For 2 years I lied about it. When they asked me how I was doing I said fine. 

The longer I lied the harder it became to tell the truth to them. I didnt want to disappoint them or get angry at me. Recently I told them I only needed to find an internship and finish it to graduate. They started helping. My sister too. Giving tips and spend hours with it. I just could not get myself to tell them. Same goes for my friends. Everyone just thinks i'm still studying.

A few weeks ago I had a breakdown and I have one now. I'm scared, I started to ignore their calls, emails. Afraid of all the questions. They have started to send emails about how they are concerend and ask whats going on. I just don't know what to do anymore. I want to get on with my life. I have made some bad choices and a lot of sad shit has happend so far. I want to live a life without constant worriering or being sad. I have never known this feeling except for my childhood. When people see me they see just a shell, I can act perfectly normal but inside i'm always crying.

I'm stuck, the one thing that is holding me from moving on and getting a job is telling my parents. I don't want to disappoint them, make them sad. I'm even more affraid that they lose it and  get very angry. I know my dad, he will explode from anger.

I'm 24, in college debt and stuck. Please help, I don't know what to do anymore."

So to start, I am a recent college grad with an econ major, communication/business minor. I have had several internships, one being overseas in Europe (I am an American). I successfully landed a job before graduation and have been working for 4-5 months now. However, I’ve come to realize that this life behind a desk, at least with what I am doing now has become monotonous and I don’t enjoy going to work like I thought I would. 

So I sit every day and try to think of my future and where ill be in 2, 5, 10 years from now and try to picture where I will be and what ill be doing. I try to think of things that make me happy or that I am interested in. I always come back to the idea that doing something in the video game industry would be down my alley. 

So I guess my question would or should be, what sort of jobs or companies could I make a living from in the gaming industry? Any redditors in the industry that would like to share some advice? I really want to find a job that I will love (I understand that takes time) but I think narrowing down the industry is a good start. 

Any comments/feedback/etc. are appreciated greatly. Again, I wasn’t really sure how to word this or form it to an exact question but would rather just like to brainstorm and hear what the internet has to say. 

Thanks.

This one professor has said countless times that she's worked for Facebook, Google, and etc. and that she has a program that she only recruits 10 students from her classes. That we should all be thinking about internships and such. That we should all consider changing majors if we 'struggle' with the class. My immediate reaction was to panic and now here I am panicking. I want to do computer science not for the salary, but the sole purpose to learn how to code and be able to make applications, websites for myself. I am a slow learner and I get VERY discouraged at these things. I'm not like these younger kids nor do I really have the time experience as some of them have. 


I'm 26 and have had medical issues stopping me from school. I've changed my major from Biology Pre-Track to OT to Computer Science with a minor in Mathematical Science.

You are in charge of a law firm, gladiator division.**



Even the street rats avoided this part of town. There was nothing left to steal, and the bars on the windows reminded them too much of prison. We had the odd disturbance: a junkie who needed a quick rush and didn't have the cash for it, or some punk who thought he'd get something out of the cash registers. Joke's always on them. My clients pay in other ways. 



Hammer and Red's: Attorneys at Law sat above a gym packing more metal than a suburban mother in an open-carry state. My day began at five in the morning, before the sun lit up the burned-out cars and discarded needles of the alleyway outside. Some bright spark had graffitied a picture of a rainbow on the wall outside my gym. I kept it. Nothing wrong with a little colour.



I rattled open the metal blinds of the gym, letting light flood the place. The free weights, the cages for squats, the long barbells stacked against the wall. All made out of cold, black iron, the way I liked it. I put a pot of coffee on, letting the must and the damp smell give way to arabica roast. The urge to smoke itched at me, and I threw back a couple of sunflower seeds, crunching them in the silent room and spitting the shells on the floor. 



Discipline, all it took.



Inventory, stock checks. At ten past five I opened the office upstairs. The gold lettering on the door said Hammer and Red's, but Hammer was long dead. A civil tribunal for a domestic abuse case. Hammer got swelling on the brain, and the abuser got to keep the kid. He fought fair. Inside, I'd still kept his desk, dust building up over it. Only last week I'd got around to putting an advert in the paper. 



*Wanted, licensed attorney. At least 5'6, bench body weight, and trained in MMA and boxing. Serious enquiries only.* 



Hammer's fish files lay forgotten on the desk. Just looking at them made the old scars and bruises begin to hurt. I needed a new partner and fast. The fights weren't going to fight themselves, and I'd be damned before I let women fight custody battles on their own. 



At half five, I started warming up. The greasy ring in the centre of the gym had seen a fair few bouts, but now it lay empty as I eased myself into skipping. Fast feet, fast mind. My dad never let me forget it. When I exercised, I could forget about the cases that lay in wait for me upstairs. I could forget Mary Blount, with her two kids and the cigarette burns on her arms. I could forget her estranged husband, Lyle, who packed meat into cold freezers in a depot out of town and couldn't wait to add my corpse to that of the slaughtered pigs he handled. All I had was the burn of my muscles and the beating of my heart. 



At five to six, the door cracked open and I stopped. Hands hanging down by my side, breathing heavy, I watched someone ease under the metal grille. 



""Hello?"" 



A woman, but not the type I represented. She was a head shorter than me, muscled in the shoulders, carried herself with her chin high. She carried a neat manilla folder, and wore a business suit and smart little heels. Her hair was twisted up with a clip behind her head and her face, though free of makeup, was pretty, ruined by the purple scar on her chin. 



""Hi,"" she said again. I stripped off the boxing gloves to shake her hand, and I got a sense of the callouses she had against her fingers. ""I'm Gabriella Cole. I'm here about the job?"" 



""Look,"" I said. There wasn't a good way to say it. Sure, she could carry herself well, but I went three rounds with angry, abuse inflicting men every two weeks. ""I'm not looking for a girl.""



""I've done modules in family law. Graduated summa cum laude,"" Gabriella continued. She waved the manilla folder at me. ""I've done internships for two different law firms this year, but corporate isn't for me. I need to work in family law. I've been boxing for six years, I can hold my own in a fight."" 



""Against executives, maybe,"" I rolled my shoulders, pulled a robe back on. ""You want to look like me in six years? Broken nose, missing teeth? Because that's what being an attorney is about in this side of town."" 



""I don't care,"" she jerked her chin at me. ""You can't *not* hire me. It's discriminatory. Give a chance, please."" 



""Alright,"" I said. ""If you want it so much, you get a week. We'll put you through a test case, and if you win it, you can work here. But it's not going to be pretty."" 



Gabriella scowled. She clutched the manilla folder to her chest. 



""I'm not here for pretty,"" she said. ""I'm here for justice.""

I programmed a bit in HS (APCS), participated in a couple hackathons, and have a VERY rudimentary understanding of basic data structures. I have applied to/planning on applying to a bunch of internships - mainly freshman/sophomore programs like EXPLORE, Google EP - but also just applied to many other companies, small and big, in general. I applied to Jane Street because I was like, why not? And.... I got a phone interview.... I was completely not expecting this since I am inexperienced. I heard JS interviews can be brutal. I accepted the interview offer because I thought it would be a good experience, but I'm pretty freaked out. I've been reading this sub for a few months now, so I know the basics of what steps I should follow. I'm planning on religiously studying the coding interview books.

But is this bad because I may be wasting their time? Should I just tell them I am a complete CS noob that is just trying to survive my first (albeit difficult) CS class in college? I have no idea why they want to interview me and I frankly sort of feel bad that I've accepted the interview offer. Any advice?"
51sdwr,2,2016-09-08,Trying to avoid heartbreak again [M 22],sleepingtalent901,askwomenadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/askwomenadvice/comments/51sdwr/trying_to_avoid_heartbreak_again_m_22/,"Long story, I met a girl 2 years ago. I wasnt interested in her at the time, but I was asking advice to date someone else, and this girl threw herself at me. She had a rough past, she never really had any friends, and the guys she would meet were always from random online places like omegle. Many would leave her pretty quickly after she started talking about getting married and things within a few days of dating. She always wanted to be in the honey moon stage. She may have been bipolar as she would have mood swings often. She fell inlove with me pretty quickly and eventually I was getting facetimed every day for a few hours when we werent able to be together (it turned into long distance). She would always want to talk to me and wait for my texts.

Our relationship continued pretty well for the first year, and the second year, she started playing a video game (league of legends), it became an addiction. She also started to show tons of signs of depression, and didnt go to class anymore, stayed at home and watched netflix all day.  she had to drop out of school.

She would make lots of stupid small fights with me every now and then, but at the time I had gotten attached to her enough to just deal with it, figuring this is how it is after the first year or so. But at the same time she always wanted to talk, always called me cutie pie and sent me tons of pictures.

Come last Saturday, I purchased a new game and she was still (seemed to be inlove), and was going to buy the game, and on Sunday boom. No responses. Monday I got worried because I thought she was suicidal, and she wasnt responding so I asked a friend to text her, and she said shes fine, and that evening she said she wanted time alone to see how she felt. Whenever she used to abuse me I would just put down the phone for an hour or so, and she would consistently call me, I wasnt sure if she was desperate for attention, so I sent her lots of texts saying I cared about her, and whats wrong, everything was fine until yesterday. She said leave me alone for a few weeks.  

I was pretty bothered for the past few days since she wouldnt even pick up the phone to break up with me, and I went out on my own trying to figure out what happened. All I could figure out was on Sunday the day she left, she was playing her addiction game with a guy named AMC. And not really having anyone else besides me, I figured she must have told him something and such. 

Anyway the guy wouldnt add me so I figured something was wrong. I eventually added one of his friends, and his friend today let me know that shes fine, and shes not coming back, and that she has lots of friends at school (which has never been true since she was 13 to last saturday).

My ex always wanted me to be loyal to her, and I was, and she was very picky about who I talked to online, and careful I dont talk to other girls. I didnt mind because I was quite happy with her. 
Anyway, I uh, well in March, a guy was being flirty with her online, and I asked her to not talk to him, Eventually it became my punishment that whenever she was mad at me, she would add him back and talk to him.

I added this guy and asked him the honest truth, and basically he told me, they would talk to each other a lot more than just the game on kik, they shared non sexual photos with each other, and things like that. And she always seemed a bit crazy to him. 

anyway this guy eventually worked his way out, and now its this other guy. Today I feel an odd sense of closure and happiness even though the carpet was ripped out from under my feet because I know something might have  been wrong with her and not me.

I did everything I could to keep this girl happy, in moderation, buying her presents, talking to her when she was depressed (which was a lot), buying her food when she was sad, trying to help her get on her feet for school, trying to help her get internships, I would wake up in the middle of the night if she needed to talk, I would take a break from my internship if she wanted to call me at work, when we were together I would take her on fancy dinners, spend 3-4 hours with her at the mall to shop for clothes just to watch her not like anything they have, and deal with a lot of her fights.

She knows her history of not being able to keep any guys for more than a few days, and being unable to meet any besides online. It is still hurtful to see she threw me away, and I dont want this ever to happen in the future. Since high school ive been in a few relationships, about 10, and Ive never felt hurt this way, and I honestly never want to deal with something like this again and I dont know how to avoid it.

Sometimes it makes me feel like I wasnt attractive or something, but who knows, I cant post links here anyway. 

TL:DR! dont want to face a break up like this ever again,"

OH SHIT!""",inkfinger,Inkfinger,https://www.reddit.com/r/Inkfinger/comments/51skg2/humans_find_out_god_attends_to_other_planets/,"[Link to the original prompt.](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/51rszn/wp_humans_find_out_god_attends_to_other_planets/)

----

God drifted through the universe, his mind already on the planets he needed to see several galaxies ahead. 

There were fledgling species on a few of them. One planet needed its climate nudged ever so slightly if it had any chance of survival. He twisted in midspace to avoid a passing comet. He misjudged his weight and shot through a nearby solar system. It looked vaguely familiar. When had he last passed through it? 

Ah, yes, with Earth's birth. Nice little planet. Beautiful oceans. He'd been proud of those. Oh, and the humans lived here too. They were probably doing fine, despite the prayers he sometimes heard scratching at the back of his mind. Although they'd been strangely silent during the past two millennia, for some reason. 

They probably sorted themselves out. Good. He made a habit of not returning to the old ones. They had to find their own feet, get a little independence. Couldn't expect him to swing by every time there was an earthquake or a little ice age or some genocide...

He glanced fondly at it as he drifted past. His eyes stretched as he *really* looked and screeched to a sudden halt.

""Oh, shit!"" he blurted out, taking in the oceans with horrified eyes. 

Brown. Completely brown. How had they turned the oceans *brown*? It ruined the whole colour scheme! He drifted closer and reared back as the smell hit him. He felt a real wave of anger for the first time in millennia. How *dare* they literally shit on his lovely oceans like that? How could this happen? He'd made them clever enough to figure out how to keep the planet clean...

He tried to find them to kill them, but the planet was deserted. Except for a few abandoned radio stations, dotted on the surface that was covered in rubbish and filth. 

And then he heard the message. Emitted repeatedly.

**When other sentient life finally contacted us, we heard you like the planets more than the species on it. So we moved. You don't seem to care, anyway. We'll keep using Earth as a nice big dumping ground, though, on the off chance you ever see this. We did it specially for you. If you ever find us and we died, just know we all agreed we hate you.**

The message was dated 2050. A solid two millennia old.

He hissed to himself and concentrated as hard as he could to locate the humans. If he really wanted to, he could track any of the species he'd made. He propelled himself from Earth and sped in their direction. 

They were on a nice, empty and habitable planet he'd made long ago. The one they once called Proxima B, and now knew as Prox. He'd never thought they'd reach it. They probably hadn't as well. 

His fury grew as he raced towards them. His oceans were ruined. All his beautiful species, wiped out. Even the penguins! He'd loved the little penguins infinitely more than he'd ever loved *them*.

If he focused, he could know what the humans thought in minute detail. For the first time since their creation, he concentrated on them, harder than he ever had before. 

The current humans only knew Earth as a historical footnote of their species' beginnings. And, of course, as the 'recycle bin' of their kind. They sent giant ships there to dump their waste, and tittered every time they saw the childish message their ancestors had left behind, as they abandoned Earth. Left it there because they thought it was funny. They didn't even believe in him, anymore. A planet of atheists, except for a handful of religious people who were widely considered crazy.

They'd long since decided the alien species they'd met so long ago, who had told them of him, had been lying. 

Ignorance and stupidity were no excuse. Someone would pay. Several billion someones.

------

An alarm pinged in a control room on Prox, alerting the human on duty that some form of sentient life had been detected on Earth's surface a while ago. 

Dumping Ground Watch, as it was commonly known, wasn't exactly a duty anyone volunteered for. Who wanted to watch oceans of shit and rubbish all day, on the off chance some roaming alien life found it and tried to occupy it?

Kevin, the intern for the past past three months whose last day had finally dawned, yawned as he checked the sensor. The alarm suddenly stopped. The sentient life was gone. The tracking system showed it moving away at an incredible speed.

Kevin snorted as he leaned back in his chair and nodded off to sleep. Probably a glitch. Nothing could move *that* fast. These systems hadn't been updated in ages. He wasn't clocking in any extra hours for *that* little alarm."

We can discuss specific prompts in private and please, do not message me with a scene already started, that’s the easiest way to get blocked. The same goes for one line/word messages.

I'm fairly open with my kinks with my only hard ""no""s being scat, unrealistically huge cocks, 3rd person writing, and vomit.

Without further ado, here are some of my prompts:

**The Lawyer and the Con**: For this one, I was thinking I’d play a young and up and coming lawyer tasked with defending you. We can discuss the specifics in PMs but one thing is for certain, I’ll be taking my payment in the form of cock.

**Breaking the Law**: For this one, the roles are reversed, I was caught committing a crime and you’re the officer/journalist/detective who caught me. Where that leads? Well that’s up to you.

**Wrong neighborhood**: What happens when me, a young and sexy girl finds herself in the wrong neighborhood? Do you help me find my way or decide you want to take advantage?

**Sports Star and Reporter**: A classic scene were I’m a reporter and you’re the sports star, that can only lead one place, right?

**The intern and the boss**: Fairly self explanatory, I’d love to be the intern at her dream job who meets you, her boss and potentially so much more.

**Opposite Sides**: For this one, I want to play a FBI/CIA/DEA Agent who is tasked with infiltrating your organization, now what that organization does we can discuss in PMs but I basically want you to turn me from righteous agent of the law into your slut.

**I’m gonna fuck your sister**: For this one, you’ll play my little brother’s best friend, I’ll be his big sister who is now recently single and back in town. You guys always joked that you would fuck each other’s mom/sister only this time, you’re not joking.

**Giving back**: In this RP, I’ll play someone  famous be it an actress or singer or sports star. You’ll be the person tasked in helping me set up some sort of event to give back to the community, only you want me to give you something more than this event.

**Bullies always win**: In this one, you’ll be as the title suggests, you’re a bully who grew up terrorizing my son (or brother), only unlike the stories we tell our kids to make them feel better, you know better. You get what you want, when you want it, in this case, me.

For those of you so inclined, I do like playing celebs in any of these roles so we have visual aids, if you’d like me to be any, just ask!

As for celebs I’d play, here are a few, feel free to ask about ones not listed:

Celebs: **Mary Elizabeth Winstead**, **Maisie Williams**, Anna Kendrick, Selena Gomez, Hailee Steinfeld, Taylor Swift, Willa Holland, Daisy Ridley, **Melissa Benoist**, Emma Stone/Watson/Roberts, Hayley Williams, Alison Brie, Alexandra Daddario, Aubrey Plaza, Bella Thorne, **Alicia Vikander** Jennifer Lawrence, Keri Russel, Neve Campbell, Jennifer Connelly, Scarlet Johansson, Sophie Turner, Oliva Munn, Olivia Wilde, **Miranda Kerr**, Jessica Biel/Alba, Victoria Justice

YouTube/Social Media: **Meg Turney**, Lia Marie Johnson, **Alli Speed**, Barbara Dunkelman, Ashley Jenkins, **Bree Essrig**, Maude Garrett, Trisha Hershberger, Datev Gallagher, Lindsey Stirling, Christina Grimme, Dodger, iJustine, or Meghan Camarena.

Whew, that was a lot. Hope to get some dirty orangereds soon!

I graduated from a Canadian University with a degree in petroleum engineering in April 2015. as you all know the market had fully tanked by then, and I was unable to secure a job in the Oil industry. I tried to stay optimistic and kept applying and working on my network. 

Since I graduated I've been working different survival jobs, in hopes that I will be able to secure a career in the near future. However, things have been looking bleak as of late, and I can't help but feel like am wasting my time. Even if the market rebounded, who would hire an Engineer in training with 0 Engineering experience (aside from 2 years of internship during studies).

So my question to you guys, from your experience, what should a person in my position do? Should I forget about Petroleum Engineering and find a different path in my life? Is there anything I can do with that degree that put me 60k in debt ? Is there a certificate or licence that would be good in conjunction with my Petroleum Engineering degree? 

at this point, this issue is causing me a paralysing anxiety. So any and all help is appreciated, guys.

I wanna thank you all for the replys and support! much appreciated~

Ranking of course matters, but schools that are known for substantial scholarships are the ones I'm interested in. I'm not particularly interested in working in biglaw but more international non-profits. Would prefer to live in a major city. 


My Stats are:  


* graduated 2014 (2 years out of school) and live in CA
* Non-URM (Middle Eastern 1st Gen / writing diversity statement)
* LSAC GPA: 2.75 (upwards trend in GPA / will be writing addendum) 
* LSAT: 164 (although registered to retake for Sept, wish me luck)
* Strong Softs: experience working at law firms, former Greenpeace intern, former UN intern, and currently working at a major global non-profit.



Schools I'm planning to apply to (in no particular order):  


* University of Washington Seattle  
* Lewis &amp; Clark  
* UC Davis

My question is should I apply it to a loan with higher interest rate, but smaller balance or to a loan with a higher balance, but slightly smaller interest rate. I am still in school, so the interest is not capitalizing. I know the general theory is to pay off higher interest rate first, but the lower rate loan grows faster per day now, since I have started to pay off my loans with internship money. 

Here are the exact details:

1) Principle: $32,500, Accrued Interest: $5,000 Interest Rate: 8.375%
2) Principle: $21,600, Accrued Interest: $80 Interest Rate: 8.5%

I wasnt interested in her at the time, but I was asking advice to date someone else, and this girl threw herself at me. She had a rough past, she never really had any friends, and the guys she would meet were always from random online places like omegle.
\
Many would leave her pretty quickly after she started talking about getting married and things within a few days of dating. She always wanted to be in the honey moon stage. She may have been bipolar as she would have mood swings often. She fell inlove with me pretty quickly and eventually I was getting facetimed every day for a few hours when we werent able to be together (it turned into long distance). She would always want to talk to me and wait for my texts.

Our relationship continued pretty well for the first year, and the second year, she started playing a video game (league of legends), it became an addiction. She also started to show tons of signs of depression, and didnt go to class anymore, stayed at home and watched netflix all day. she had to drop out of school. She would make lots of stupid small fights with me every now and then, but at the time I had gotten attached to her enough to just deal with it, figuring this is how it is after the first year or so. But at the same time she always wanted to talk, always called me cutie pie and sent me tons of pictures.

Come last Saturday, I purchased a new game and she was still (seemed to be inlove), and was going to buy the game, and on Sunday boom. No responses. Monday I got worried because I thought she was suicidal, and she wasnt responding so I asked a friend to text her, and she said shes fine, and that evening she said she wanted time alone to see how she felt. Whenever she used to abuse me I would just put down the phone for an hour or so, and she would consistently call me, I wasnt sure if she was desperate for attention, so I sent her lots of texts saying I cared about her, and whats wrong, everything was fine until yesterday. She said leave me alone for a few weeks.

I was pretty bothered for the past few days since she wouldnt even pick up the phone to break up with me, and I went out on my own trying to figure out what happened. All I could figure out was on Sunday the day she left, she was playing her addiction game with a guy named AMC. And not really having anyone else besides me, I figured she must have told him something and such.

Anyway the guy wouldnt add me so I figured something was wrong. I eventually added one of his friends, and his friend today let me know that shes fine, and shes not coming back, and that she has lots of friends at school (which has never been true since she was 13 to last saturday). My ex always wanted me to be loyal to her, and I was, and she was very picky about who I talked to online, and careful I dont talk to other girls. I didnt mind because I was quite happy with her. Anyway, I uh, well in March, a guy was being flirty with her online, and I asked her to not talk to him, Eventually it became my punishment that whenever she was mad at me, she would add him back and talk to him.

I added this guy and asked him the honest truth, and basically he told me, they would talk to each other a lot more than just the game on kik, they shared non sexual photos with each other, and things like that. And she always seemed a bit crazy to him. anyway this guy eventually worked his way out, and now its this other guy. Today I feel an odd sense of closure and happiness even though the carpet was ripped out from under my feet because I know something might have been wrong with her and not me.

I did everything I could to keep this girl happy, in moderation, buying her presents, talking to her when she was depressed (which was a lot), buying her food when she was sad, trying to help her get on her feet for school, trying to help her get internships, I would wake up in the middle of the night if she needed to talk, I would take a break from my internship if she wanted to call me at work, when we were together I would take her on fancy dinners, spend 3-4 hours with her at the mall to shop for clothes just to watch her not like anything they have, and deal with a lot of her fights.

She knows her history of not being able to keep any guys for more than a few days, and being unable to meet any besides online. It is still hurtful to see she threw me away, and I dont want this ever to happen in the future. Since high school ive been in a few relationships, about 10, and Ive never felt hurt this way, and I honestly never want to deal with something like this again and I dont know how to avoid it. Sometimes it makes me feel like I wasnt attractive or something, but who knows, I cant post links here anyway."

I just graduated in June and have been working in an entry-level position for about 3 months now (past my probation period).

I have an annual salary of 61k (I think just under 50k take home).  
I have about 20k in assets 
(3k in chequing and 17k in a BMO TFSA) 

and ~14k in liabilities

* 13k on a car loan (bought a used 2012 Subaru Forester) with 4.9% interest.
* ~1k left on student loans (was able to pay most of it from an internship I had + part time jobs)

I am currently still living with my parents and don't have plans to move out for another 1 or 2 years and don't have too many expenses.

* I spend about ~25% of my bi-weekly paychecks on gas, groceries, car payments, and bills and the rest I just put into my savings or spend some of it.
* I am thinking of just saving enough for a down payment on a house in several years instead of renting when I do move out.

Here are some of the things I'm looking to get advice on:

* Should I use my TFSA money (emergency funds) and just pay all my debts off?
* Should I start looking into investing? I get calls from BMO all the time asking if I want to invest in a mutual fund but idk if I want to do it with them so I just put it in my TFSA.
* I recently opened up a Tangerine account because their money-back credit card is awesome and have better rates than BMO. Should I just transfer my funds over to them and stop using BMO?
* Basically, I just want to make sure I'm doing the most efficient things I can with my money.

Thanks in advance for any advice I get!

51t7qn,14,2016-09-08,"I want to have a frank discussion about Harambe's 2016 banger, Gorillaz.",huntermc1998,copypasta,https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/51t7qn/i_want_to_have_a_frank_discussion_about_harambes/,"I want to have a frank discussion about Harambe's 2016 banger, Gorillaz. The song focuses on dicks out, the eponymous ""Gorillaz,"" as a display of wealth, power, and mid-2016 fashion. A ""gorilla"" describing a diamond- and gold-encrusted dick.


In the song, rapper Cecil the Lion, a member of Harambe's zoo, raps ""I've got a dick in my mouth like I'm Rick Harrison."" This particular line has kept me up nights for the past decade.


The initial conceit is obvious enough: a ""dick"" is a reference to dicks out, and Cecil wants the listener to know that the dick in his mouth costs a lot of money. Since the largest dick in circulation is $100, it's unclear to me whether Cecil's dick only cost $100 or if he wants his audience to take a further leap and assume that ""a dick"" references several dicks. I can't imagine $100 buys very many mouth dicks.


The second half of the line proves particularly troubling. He invokes ""Rick Harrison,"" who, as of 2005, was a pawn star from Nevada, U.S. for Las Vegas. It's possible that our civic-minded emcee wanted to invoke the imagery of Mr. Harrison on the floor of the Nevada pawn shop, arguing for dicks left and right. While he sponsored a couple hundred dicks during his tenure, only one Rick-sponsored dick was signed into law as of Gorillaz' release (according to pawntrack.us). So, while it matches the ""a dick"" language, the line doesn't particularly invoke the large number of ""dicks"" required to purchase a premium dickpiece.


A wrinkle in this line is that Rick's old man is Richard “Old Man” Harrison. Thus, the line ""dick in [his] mouth like [he's] Rick Harrison"" could easily be interpreted to relate to oral sex. This comparison is especially apt when you consider that Old Man is infamous for having his dick out with a Pawn Shop intern during his tenure as Pawn Star. And perhaps this incident is even more infamous because the dick out came not from Rick, but from a third party. In fact -- even 10 years after the incident -- any references to Old Man, a dick, and pawn inevitably lead listeners to his pawn star scandal.


So, is Cecil letting the zoo community know that he enjoys dicks out? Or does his metaphor fall apart because, at least in this context, Rick had no ""Old Man’s"" in his pawn shop? Given the rampant homophobia of the mid-2016 zoo community, I'm inclined to believe that Cecil didn't mean to invoke any reference that might include him giving dicks out to a man. But then, why even go near the Old Man/Rick situation?


I've considered a third option regarding this half of the line, that Cecil's invocation of Rick Harrison and ""dicks"" is a reference to his much-maligned Pawn Star speeches. Rick has received criticism for making private speeches to Pawn Stars in exchange for large speaking fees. The imagery of dicks for speeches lends itself well to having ""dicks in [your] mouth like . . . Rick Harrison."" When Rick talks (you know, with his mouth), the dicks flow freely. In fact, I'd argue that this interpretation provides the strongest metaphor for sporting an expensive dick.


But it's impossible for Cecil to know this, as Rick's speaking tour didn't really start in earnest until he left the pawn shop, roughly 8 years after Gorillaz dropped.


So, I'm left to draw one of three conclusions:


1) Cecil's use of metaphor on the 2016 track Gorillaz was poor, at best, and he had no business rapping alongside Harambe, Paul Blart, and John Cena.


2) Cecil is a time-traveller, and uses his gift for low-key pawn shop commentary that's way ahead of its time.


3) I have entirely too much time on my dick.

51talq,1,2016-09-08,31 year old male still living with parents.,WiscoMitch,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/51talq/31_year_old_male_still_living_with_parents/,"Where do I begin? God even typing this feels like too much work. I'll try to not run on too much as to what is getting me down (its a LOT of things) because I'll feel like not too many people would read it and I would end up looking like I'm a whiny sap. Basically put, I'm 31 still living with my parents. For whatever reason, I feel like I just can't make ends meet on my own. Part of that has been my fault due to me being an idiot. (I got my 3rd DUI last year.) Yes I am extremely stupid for doing that. Luckily, I've never been in a car accident so that is a good thing that I didn't harm myself or someone else. I have been trying to pay off the court fees for a while now. I don't have my own car at the moment, but getting one and paying insurance, plus the breathalyzer system (including installation) seems like quite a lot. Especially considering I'm only working retail making  $11.04 an hour. (about 25 hrs/wk) I don't want to live at home because obviously no girl wants to be around someone like me. I am almost done with getting my Bachelors in Communications which is nice but the student loans will be starting soon and that is going to take up A LOT of my income. I need to finish my internship in order to graduate so that should be done in Oct. 

I'm sure some of you are saying ""WiscoMitch just work at your job full time!"" Well there's a problem with that, actually make it two.

The first is that one of my ex's works there. Her name is Heather. We dated for about 9 months. I fell in love with her. It was the first time I ever felt real love. She was the first woman to say the words ""I love you."" back to me. ... That changed my life. But we broke up. Partially because I wasn't financially ready for a house and a family. I want kids. I feel like I would make a great father regardless of my previous OBVIOUS poor decisions. We still see each other in passing.

My other problem working there is my OTHER EX. (Yes I'm fucking stupid I know.) Molly and I started dating probably a year after Heather and I broke up. We dated for 7 months. She was by my side through EVERYTHING. All my baggage, me going to jail, being on house arrest, not making a lot of money, she didn't care. She loved me. I felt like I loved her a bit, but it just wasn't as strong as how I felt about Heather. I eventually broke up with her because I felt like it just wasn't right. It didn't feel genuine enough in my heart. Of course I still miss her but I broke up with her because of this nagging feeling in my gut. She really is a sweet woman, but I couldn't go through with marrying her with that over my head.

Fast forward to now. I just feel like I'm always going to be stuck behind the 8 ball. I have only a few friends. Most people rarely ever call me to hang out, even if I can get a ride to places. Most of my days are spent either in my room, or going to the gym and working out. I've made good strides but I still feel ---blah. I don't feel any great happiness anymore. I don't have a surge of feeling that ""life is good"" or ""things will get better"". I just feel nothingness, or on occasion sadness. I worry that I'll never get out of this rut of making shit pay and I feel like I'll never be good enough for someone else again, all my baggage included. I worry that Molly might've been my last chance at actually finding someone to marry and have a family with; that is the ONE thing I want more than anything else. Since I was a teenager I've always wanted that. If that is the case, then I don't know, I don't know what is the point. Maybe I'm doomed? I try to count my blessings and see the good things that are happening, but with few friends and not really enjoying the company of my parents, I feel like when I speak my words are falling on deaf ears. I am rambling now and I do probably sound pathetic or something. Although I do feel a ""little"" bit better after letting this out.

I don't know. Things suck for me. Even in more ways than I've just posted.

P.S. Thank you for reading through all this if you did. You managed to get through this crazy rant. 

**TL;DR** I work with my two ex's, one I still have deep feelings for who has been dating someone else now for 6 months or so, and the other woman who I didn't feel like I loved the right way. I STILL live with my parents. I have little to no money, no car, no license, student loans coming up soon and I'm 2-3 months away from graduating with no REAL good paying job on the horizon. 

I don't know how other people do it."

* I shared a google doc with ideas, they added some comments. 
* They never had access to the source code. 
* The project was started and domain names were purchased at least a month or two before he was involved or even knew about it
* Everything happened in Maryland, USA  

We just have a bunch of emails going back and forth where they started suggesting lots of ideas and things that we should add on the site.  I did engage in conversation with them about the ideas, and did not stop him from suggesting stuff, but I was under the impression they were going to be an intern/volunteer at this point and they had agreed to work for free as an intern.   

**My Problem is -** now they are asking about equity and being a partner eventually.    They made a bunch of (obvious) suggestions based on existing ideas and I am concerned they might try to sue me later claiming that they came up with the ideas.    If I had known they would expect or ask about for something like this I would not have talked to them about the project in the first place. 

**What are my legal liabilities at this point?   Do i need to worry about them trying to sue me later saying I stole their ideas?**

I assume they would have no legal ground to stand on, they made the suggestions freely with no agreement for reimbursement.  But I want to make sure, I am ready to walk away from this project rather than risk being sued later by some guy who helped for a couple hours.

I should have gotten him to sign an NDA before we discussed anything, life lesson i guess.

TLDR:  Someone volunteered to help my company as a developer, made a bunch of high level suggestions  about how to run the company, and now expects to be a partner because the ideas are his ""intellectual property"" -   How screwed am I?"

I am located in the Bay area, graduated in June and started applying to jobs early-mid August. The reason being, I decided to take a trip to see my grandfather who was on his deathbed abroad (no need for sympathies, he left on good terms) after graduation. 

I've cold applied to about 30-35 positions so far, some of which were admittedly reach (only recruit from top schools) and have gotten about 10 ""thank you for applying but.. skills dont match"" so far. Some of these were at big companies and some well known start-ups. I think I am a descent programmer and a sensible guy so I'm trying to avoid mass-applying for entry level positions, but at the same time I don't want to start overlapping into the 2017 graduates territory for these positions which starts in October/Nov. I also don't want recruiters/HR to become dismissive of my application seeing that I've been out of school for 3 months, so I'm starting to cross into crunch time and get a little nervous. In the mean time, I've set up my own website and made sure I have all of my relevant school projects on github along with a couple side projects. Additionally, I'm learning more Java in the meantime (generics, AOP, etc). 

I have descent gpa (B+ avg. overall and 3.4ish CS), although I don't list it on my resume. I have prepared for technical interviews and believe I can answer many of the CTCI-like questions. 

I guess the weak points here are that I have a reserved personality and am mostly cold applying to all of these places. Although, now I am starting to reach out to friends and family a little bit more. I would attend networking events, but meeting and conversing with new people is not one of my strong suits (although can do if it comes to it). Additionally, the internship I had was at a relatively unknown start-up that no longer exists.

Another thing is: most of the bioinformatics job postings I've come across generally want a MS or PhD, so I'm not sure where I fall at the intersection of biology and CS. I'm posting my resume below in case that needs work, or if I should be working on more side projects. 

https://s13.postimg.org/i8t9gf4qf/res.png is the link to my resume. Feel free to be as critical as you deem necessary (sorry for a little low res). Thanks guys

Honestly, I wasn't expecting this many choices. I thought they'd have a few different sizes and a couple that vibrated, but instead I found myself standing in front of a giant wall of dildos, vibrators, magic eggs, rabbits, double-ended strap-ons, rotating rods, suction cupped bases, there are even a couple that squirt, which is kind of gross and kind of...intriguing.

I finally choose one. It's purple, which is cute, and pretty big, but not crazy. (And some of them were crazy, like, bigger around than my arm.) It's smooth, but with some raised veins, and it vibrates. It doesn't squirt.

I walk past the lingerie and party toys, thankful that I don't have to walk through the magazine and video sections to get to the register. I do take a quick glance over there and see a man disappearing into some saloon-style swinging doors. Maybe they have dressing rooms or something back there?

I tell myself there's nothing to be embarrassed about as I make my way up to the counter. I tell myself that the clerk sees dozens of people every day buy things that are not talked about in polite society. I try to make my cheeks un-blush, but I can tell by how lightheaded I feel that it's not working at all.

In case you couldn't tell, I've never done this before.

""Find everything you need?"" I nod and get out my credit card, hoping to transact my business quickly and be on my way. The guy behind the counter is sitting on a stool and the floor back there seems to be several inches higher than on this side, adding to the feeling that I'm a little girl hoping this man approves of me. At least he's younger than my dad.

He starts opening the box.

""Wait, what are you--"" I freeze. What's going on?

""We just have to make sure it works, make sure the right product is in here."" He pulls it out of the box and it bobs its head at me. ""Returns, you know, they're a bitch. Nobody wants to buy a used one of these guys. Well, most people, anyway.""

He pulls some batteries out of a drawer and inserts them into the base. When he flicks the switch it starts buzzing and he immediately drops it onto the counter like it's a fish.

""Whoa! Feisty little guy, isn't he?"" He picks it up and turns it back off. ""Looks like it works just fine. Look okay to you?"" He looks at me, waiting for a response. I nod, still blushing. ""Okay then. Address?""

""Address? You mean, where I live?"" I sputter.

""Just a mailing address. In case there are any recalls or anything. It happens, you know. Not very often, but this here is one household electronic device you do not want catching fire on you, that's for sure.""

I give him my address. Then, when he asks, my phone number. Yes, it's a cell phone, not a landline. ID? Apparently to make sure I'm not under 18. As if I would have risked being seen in one of these places in my hometown, before I left for college. The clerk even signed me up for their membership club so I could get a 20 percent discount on everything, with a membership card and everything.

Eventually, I have my vibrator in a box, in a bag, along with a bottle of lube the clerk gave me, and I'm ducking out of the door into the midday sunshine, hoping no one from any of my classes sees me before I'm in my car and out of the parking lot. I don't even speed on the way home. I just let the anticipation build in the bottom of my stomach...

________________________________________

Well that was longer than I intended! But I've been waiting to use this prompt for kind of a while and I've built it up in my head quite a bit. There are several directions it could go, but all of them end up with our heroine being a lot less innocent than she is now.

For instance, she could get a letter or phone call saying that model is being recalled so she gets store credit for the value of it, then she's told about the dressing rooms (or product testing rooms) that aren't quite as private as she might expect, what with the men watching from the other side of the one-way mirrors that make up three of the walls and the cameras recording the whole performance. This could lead eventually to stripping, gloryholes, gangbangs, sugar daddies, prostitution...

Or perhaps she starts getting calls or texts from gentlemen interested in meeting her after seeing her ad. Of course, she's surprised, even shocked, but the places they're proposing to take her are really swanky, the kinds of places she's never been. This could lead to a being taken advantage of, sugar daddies, private shows, sex parties, prostitution, meeting someone unexpected...

Or maybe the lube sample the clerk gave her has aphrodisiac properties. She becomes more outgoing, even forward, with the men around her. Maybe she gets a job where she can show off more, as a server at a restaurant famous for their wings and tight orange shorts, or maybe she just starts showing off more at the job she already has (bartender, barista, office intern, university medical office,...).

If all else fails, maybe she just gets caught using the vibrator by her roommate's boyfriend or the RA or something, but I think we can do better than that.

I'm **most** interested to hear your ideas, as long as it leads somewhere interesting.

Feel free to tell me what you want me to look like! I really like pretending to be all sorts of girls. If you'd rather I pick, I can do that too.

I have a [kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/kMI1pUX.png)! It's new. I hope it worked right.

Please include a description of your character and where you see this story going! Make a one-word subject line that completes my post title.

Looking forward to your creative replies!

51u34w,4,2016-09-08,My [22F] boyfriend [22M] is struggling to figure out his future and I don't know how to support him.,throwaway2398979,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/51u34w/my_22f_boyfriend_22m_is_struggling_to_figure_out/,"I'm sorry if this is disorganized and ends up being a rant. I'm not quite sure what I'm looking for, but I've reached the point where I can't handle this on my own anymore and need some advice. 

We got together in college and have been together for over three years. We both recently graduated and I have started graduate school while he works on applying to graduate school/figuring out what he wants. 

I spent a lot of my undergrad time doing various volunteer work and internships to figure out what field I wanted to go into. A lot of this is due to the pressure and guidance from my parents to plan my career path. We both come from Indian families so we have a lot of pressure to plan our lives and to be ""successful."" Often times this means becoming a doctor or some other highly regarded professional. 

When I met my boyfriend he was interested in becoming a doctor, but mostly due to pressure from his parents. He took the classes and exams, but struggled, and realized he needed to find something else. He ended up graduating with a degree in psychology and at the time of graduation had vague ideas about going to graduate school for psychology. Throughout the last year of college he expressed uncertainty about this decision on several occasions. He wasn't sure if he was actually interested in it, he had other interests, it wasn't a high paying career. He wants to please his parents and make them proud about his career choices and is overly concerned about making money. I understand (and agree) money is an important part about choosing a career, but it cannot be the only factor. 

In general he seems very lost and confused about his future. I know that's normal when you're 22 and a recent graduate. You don't need to know exactly what you want to be doing 10 years down the road, but I'm worried about him. Over the last year and since graduation I've seen little progress in him about figuring out these fundamental issues. He's half-heartedly gone through the steps to begin applying to graduate programs, but there doesn't seem to be any passion in it. When we talk about why he's interested in certain degrees over others, it's always vague references to what will look better. I don't think he really has any idea what he wants out of life and it's beginning to really bring him down. He's having more frequent confrontations with his parents about it, which lead him to be less proactive about figuring it out.  

I try to be supportive and tell him it's okay not to know 100% what you want. You can always change your career later in life. I try to encourage him to find what he's passionate about and to research different fields/degrees. I keep telling him to do what he thinks will make him happy. He looks at his friends and compares himself to them. ""So and so is in medical school and I'm still living at home. I'm not moving forward."" We have this conversation almost once a month and I tell him not to compare his choices to others and that it's okay to take a year or two off from school. He listens and acknowledges this, but the problem is, after this conversation he does nothing to change the situation. We end up having the same conversation about the same uncertainties a few weeks later. EDIT: I should add that he has a lot of pressure from his parents to go to graduate school within the next year and it doesn't look like he's going to try to contradict his parents on this. If he could spend the next year or two trying different things out, none of this would be an issue.

I'm worried about him because he's always upset about these things and it seems like he's stuck. I'm also frustrated because he doesn't seem to be taking any active steps to do anything about it. I spend so much time worrying and thinking about his future. I know I need to let him figure it out on his own because I can't tell him what degree to get or what job to apply for. However, I feel so drained constantly having to support him about things that haven't changed in over a year. He comes to me upset, I give him advice, he says ""yeah, you're right,"" and repeat. 

What can I do to help him? I'm starting to realize giving him advice about doing research on jobs and trying to find passions isn't working. Is there something else I can do to support him? Or do I just need to let this play out and let him come to me and just be upset? (I tend to be controlling and want to find solutions and answers.) Maybe I should just be more passive and let him be upset and hope figures it out?

I don't know. All I know is that this situation is very stressful for me and every time he talks to me about his future I become drained and overwhelmed. 

TL;DR My boyfriend is really struggling trying to figure out what to do career-wise post graduation and I'm at a loss of how to continually support and encourage him."

51udu3,125,2016-09-08,Blow by Blow Justice IV,schoolgirlerror,Schoolgirlerror,https://www.reddit.com/r/Schoolgirlerror/comments/51udu3/blow_by_blow_justice_iv/,"Judge Fisher looked like he’d spent his youth on fast women and slow horses. I hated myself for the cliché, but the bags under his eyes, broken capillaries in his nose, and shaking hands as he collected his documents spoke for themselves. 



“I’ll be back in a moment, Mr Red,” he said, standing. I’d bet my month’s mortgage repayments he had a bottle of the good stuff in his chambers. 



“No problem, your Honour,” I replied easily, guiding Mary into her seat at the table. 



The courtroom was imposing if you’d never seen one before: a dark wood panel with three chairs behind it, the banks for counsel, miniature witness stand, and a place where press could sit, if press were interested in second-rate attorneys beating the shit out of each other to take a woman’s kids away from her. 



I knew better. 



This place had seen more fights than an alcoholic had seen bottles of white spirit. In the belly of the room, where the spectator’s stands would be in a regular courtroom, a make-shift boxing ring replaced the floor. Quince hadn’t lied. A yellow warning sign stood akimbo over rusting droplets of blood. The usher had disappeared to find a mop. 



Gabriella dropped her binder onto the desk on the other side of Mary. I’d made Gabriella come in her suit, while I carried a sports bag containing my kit, and an emergency first aid box. We flanked Mary like two crows in dark suits. 



“Listen, Mary,” I sat down beside her, extended my legs beneath the desk and felt the muscles protest at the movement. “Do you know if Lyle’s hired an attorney at all?” 



She shook her head, twisting her fingers. I noticed she’d removed the wedding ring and was faintly proud of her. It was hard to take the first step away from an abusive man, harder still to keep walking. 




“He’s a proud man, Mr Red,” she said. She’d started taking care of herself, too. The blonde roots at her scalp had been touched up with dark dye, and she wore blush high on the apples of her cheeks. “He’ll be fighting for his kids himself.” 



I snorted. 



“Men like him make my work easier,” I said. “It’s the pride.” 



“He’s a big man, Mr Red,” Mary said. “He hits hard, and he fights dirty.” 



“Mary, any man who hits a woman is on the wrong side of the law,” I said. “So—”



Gabriella coughed. 



“You got a problem?” 



“We’re condoning violence as long as it’s not sexist, now?” 



“You’re the one benefiting from it, so I suggest you quit whining,” I said. “I’m not endorsing men hitting men, but you roll up Mary’s sleeve, kid, and you tell me you’re okay with what you see.” 



Gabriella opened her mouth indignantly as if to say something, but I was saved from having to think of a comeback by Lyle throwing open the doors of the courtroom. We all turned round, Mary white-knuckle gripping the back of her seat. He stood, framed by the heavy doorway, legs shoulder-width apart and his hands on his hips. The usher slipped past him like a mouse, mop in hand.



Lyle was muscle run to visceral fat. His nose and upper lip met in the centre of his face, making him carry a permanent sneer. A gold watch glinted off his wrist, and the split, purple knuckles told me he’d won more than one bar fight in his time.

 

A bar fight this wasn’t.



Lyle took his place at the respondent’s desk. Judge Fisher re-entered the courtroom and took his chair with all the dignity of a drunk pissing against a wall. He scanned the room, satisfied that we were all present. 



“Mr Red,” he said, pressing his fingertips together. Was it my imagination, or were his eyes more glazed than before? Imperceptibly, he leaned forwards. “I believe you’ve submitted a preliminary demand for custody?”



I stood, tugging my suit into place. “Your Honour, we move for a finding that custody ought to belong solely to my client, Mrs Blount. My findings of domestic abuse are included in the bundle we’ve submitted.” 



Judge Fisher looked at the pressed bundle on his desk as though it would bite him. 




“And the respondent has moved for a combative defence?” 



Lyle bounded to his feet and dropped into a mock bow. He hadn’t worn a suit, just the polo shirt that his job demanded. A pink pig smiled inanely at us from above his left nipple. 



“Yes, your Honour,” he said. “I’m just a normal, hard working father who loves his kids. I can’t pay for some fancy fighting lawyer when I got food to put on the table. I’m just ready to do what I’ve gotta to do keep my kids, an’ I’m gonna fight for them, your Honour, sir.”




The judge rolled his eyes, and I was surprised that it was the only sign of him losing his cool with Lyle. 



“Then I move to allow civil ruling by combat,” he said. “Will Mrs Blount be represented in this action by her attorney?” 



“She will, your Honour,” I replied. 



“Liability waivers signed?” 



“Yes, your Honour,” 



They got signed before, not afterwards, when your hands were swelling and your knuckles split. Lyle shot me a look, maybe noticing for the first time the muscles beneath the cheap suit; the hands with their callouses, my broken nose and bitten ear. 



If he wanted his kids, he should have hired someone who knew how to fight in a courtroom the way I did. 



-------



The changing room was a poky locker room filled with spider's webs. I stripped off, and changed quickly, wrapping my hands in tape and cloth while sitting on the greasy wooden bench. A breeze rattled through me, bare tiles moist beneath my feet. 




Hammer had a routine when it came to trials by combat. He had a walkman, and he plugged it into his ears while he changed. He wrapped his hands, deep in concentration. The day of my first fight, he’d wrapped my hands for me and given me words of advice.




“Films are bullshit,” he growled, squatting on his heels as he wound the tape. “No one gets knocked out for hours. You knock ‘em out for longer than a minute and that liability form is thinner than a fuckin’ condom when it comes to protecting you from *his* lawyers.” 



He paused, grey eyes on my hands. 




“Go for the chin. It’s dirty, but you want them to yield or drop as fast as possible. Save your looks, Red, cause you’re lucky enough to have ‘em. There’ll be girls someday who’ll want you for more than your fists.” 



Him and Quince were equal shadows in my mind. Attorneys who’d hung on for too long. If we’d had money, Hammer would have retired. 



The sound of the door broke my train of thought. Gabriella slipped into the changing room. 



“Lyle’s ready,” she said. “Judge wants you back.” 



I nodded. Gabriella took a step forward, rocking on the balls of her feet. I read the indecision on her face. Taking the plunge, she came towards me, kneeling on the tiled floor between my feet. She took the end of the tape between her fingers, and wound it around my palm. Her hands on mine were cool and reassuring, but her brown eyes blinked worry. 



“I’ve never seen a trial by combat before,” she said. 



“Your internships—”



Gabriella shook her head. “If they can afford a civil trial, they pay for a civil trial. You know how cheap this is, Mr Red—” 



“William,” I told her. “My name’s William.” 



She had one of my hands in two of hers, tucking the frayed end of the tape beneath the rest of it. 



“It’s only for the desperate,” she finished as if I hadn’t spoken, but her eyes rested on mine. 



“Mary is desperate,” I said. 



“Is she the only one?” Gabriella asked. 



I shook her hands away and grimaced. The sunflower seeds had stayed at the office, but the memory of Hammer, with his blanket-thick cigarette stink, had got me itching again. 



“You want to see a fight?” I asked. “Because there’s going to be a fight, and I’d like my intern to keep her mouth shut and clean the blood of my face when I finish.” 



------


The usher hurried away from the ring as I strode in, ready. Arms swinging, loose, aches of the last few days disappeared. Lyle stood on the other side of the floor, hands protected by court-sanctioned wraps. When he moved, I saw the outline of his belly against the red shirt he wore. The pink pig winked at me. I didn’t expect it to be difficult. 



Judge Fisher tapped his gavel on the bench and sighed. 




“Please keep all actions within the remits of the liability waiver,” he said. “Extreme attempts to injure may incur additional fees, and both criminal responsibility and civil liability. Fights are unarmed combat between two participants. Being knocked unconscious results in an automatic dismissal of your case. Yielding results in an automatic dismissal of your case. Forfeiting the fight results in an automatic dismissal of your case. Fights where neither opponent lands a hit result in a mistrial. You may begin.” 



Lyle, having zoned out, shook himself awake as another gavel tap punctuated his sentence. He had no time to take neutral, I took two steps forward and pivoted hard on my right foot to press a punch into his chin. 



He blocked, but barely. Sloppily. His hands came up and we ricocheted apart. My knuckles rang from the impact. Lyle’s face was frozen in a mask of horror. I came forward again. He retreated against the ropes, hurried steps like a sheep. I followed through with two jabs: right, left. One connected with his shoulder, the other his wrist. He cried out and I relished it. I packed power behind my punches; round shoulders pushing into him, body twisting. 




Mary and Gabriella watched from the sideline. Mary had twisted her cardigan into a knot, and Gabriella watched me advance on Lyle Blount with a stony face. 



Against the ropes now, hands barely protecting his face. What was passion against a professional? His nose crunched beneath my fist and I felt a spurt of guilt for the usher. Second time in one day. Lyle scooted around me. He lashed out with a flurry of wild punches, feet scrambling. Several connected, but there was nothing behind them. I caught them on my forearms, waited for the shock to subside, then circled him. 




I was a wolf. An attorney who had scented blood and was in for the kill. Cutting in close, I waited for him to come at me. He two-stepped, I heard Gabriella gasp, and then he was on me. 



Something silver flashed before I felt the blade. Gabriella was already jumping the ropes, screaming at the judge to *do something.* It was like a paper cut, I felt almost nothing, but the blood was hot against my cold torso. Someone’s hands were on me. A woman was crying, Judge Fisher’s gavel came smacking down. Lyle backed away, a stubby knife no longer than a thumb in his wrapped hand. I clamped a hand to the wound and fought to keep my breathing steady. 



“In my courtroom!” The old man was going to have a heart attack. “In all my years—Mr Blount *in my courtroom*!” 



When she reached me, Gabriella's brown eyes were filled with worry.

I completed Bachelor of Arts in a music related program in 2012 and surprise, surprise, it didn't amount to much. I've always had a huge interest in computers - teaching myself HTML, CSS and dabbling in PHP over the years, mainly building websites and what not, and keeping up with trends in technology, etc. etc. like so many others - overall, nothing that makes me stand out. I've never worked in any computer related field - the closest I've come is an unpaid internship building a website for a record label a number of years ago. 

I want to transition into the IT field and start building a career I can have some pride in. I've spoken with a careers councillor and they seem to believe that a Masters in IT would make me much more attractive to employers over an undergraduate degree in the same field. The only problem is that [this two year course I've been looking at (Melbourne's RMIT university)](https://www.rmit.edu.au/study-with-us/levels-of-study/postgraduate-study/masters-by-coursework/mc208) will cost me north of $40,000. 

Paying for this course isn't so much of an issue as I have savings that can *just* cover it, however I'd like some input as to whether this would be a wise use of my time and money and given my current (lack of) experience, will I be an attractive candidate to employers after completing the course? 

If anyone could give me any insight, or even have a quick look at the course guide I linked to above, it would be greatly appreciated. 

Cheers!

Ok, some background info. I was a screw up in my early 20s and as a result I am now a 27 year old Junior studying to obtain a BBA in Information Systems.  I currently have both an Associates in Business Administration and one in Liberal Arts (obtained at the same time) but I have zero experience in anything IT related and wanted to know what is the best way to go about and get my feet wet in the field so I can get some experience before I get my degree.

I have some personal experience in building computers and really enjoyed taking Java I (currently taking Java II) so I know some of the fundamentals in both hardware, software programming, and other general undergrad tech subjects but that is pretty much it. 

All that being said I have no idea where to begin and when to begin. Should I try to obtain certifications like CompTIA A+ and MCP and use that to get into a help desk position? I feel like I'm too old to do internship and don't think a viable option anyway considering I work full time."

The latest one being ""can't you and your husband just get normal jobs and stop this nonsense of having a dream and wanting to be someone powerful in your industry?"" All I could respond to that was you don't say shit like that to your own kid mother, that's called discouragement. Anyways..that's another story. 

Last night my mom txted me and asked me to wish my Aunt a happy birthday. I said that I would not and ignored her the rest of the night. She had my sister txt me asking me if I was dead. No, I'm not dead, I just don't want to wish the person who's never said happy birthday to me a happy birthday, not even out of some fucked up family courtesy because well..why the hell should I care about her birthday when she has NEVER cared about mine? 

For context purposes, my sister and I get along great. We leave each other alone when we need to, we have each others backs when we need to, we talk almost daily and it's very odd for us to go a day without talking. We've also made it clear to our parents and the rest of the family that us two get along, but that's about as much as that relationship is going to extend it's welcome to. That neither of us really plan on adding more people into this little twosome circle. 

My sister called fuming yesterday (we usually google chat, txt and snapchat all day) to say that my aunt (the same one who wanted a happy birthday txt) exploded at her out of no where and it went as far as my uncle basically verbally assaulting her at work because as it turns out, my baby cousin decided that he wanted more in his life, quit working as a cashier for them at their store and got an internship with my sister's company. So my sister had what I can only say is an ungodly amount of missed calls, txts and voicemails from my family all telling her what a bitch she was and how her boss needs to keep things to himself and not encourage such frivolous ideas into my cousin's head. (apparently my sister's boss said that he wanted to mentor someone and that he felt my cousin working at a tea shop and dry cleaner as a cashier was dead end and if he was willing to want more, my sister's boss would be willing to extend a teaching hand...nothing wrong with that...). Well, apparently this is all just completely unacceptable to everyone and I, who was once the ugly duckling in the corner have suddenly become their bi-polar favorite again. Because they want me to step in and do something about this. I just said that it wasn't my problem, I wasn't going to and if my cousin wanted help writing a resume to call me. This only happened because my sister sent back a two word txt message to everyone - ""fuck off."" (quickly followed by, ""this is not your business."") 

I get that it's been a hard year for them (parents, aunts and uncles) with 3 kids moving out, 2 getting a ""big kid"" job and 1 deciding that she wants to apply for school far far away. But that's what happens when you're shitty to your kids. They don't want to live with you and don't want to have anything to do with you. And instead of wishing my aunt a happy birthday, all i wanted to say was ""you're finally getting what you deserve. all your brats ditching you because they don't want to have anything to do with you. this is what is suppose to happen, your kids are suppose to grow up, they are suppose to pay their own bills and find their own adult jobs. they fall in love. they get married. they find ambition and ideas. it's abnormal to want none of these things, hang around at home and do your every bidding. that's called stockholm syndrome and it's unhealthy."" I usually don't say much to them because I don't have much to say, but if I did, I wish I could point out every time they said something hurtful, every time they got into fights in the house with everybody and started throwing stuff to express their anger. I wish I could tell them how psychotic they are. 

Am I wrong in wanting to do this? My mom suggested that maybe we all start family chat rooms and talk about things so that the kids don't feel any sort of animosity towards their parents and can say whatever they need. I said no because that'll just end up becoming another avenue for the ""adults"" to spout their crazy bullshit in another communication format. I'm 30. I can't put up with this much longer while creating my own family with my husband. Sorry but not sorry, I just can't do it anymore. I support whatever my sister and my cousins want to do with their life as long as they get out of there. I support them if they're black, white, or red. I support them if they want to be a stripper or if they want to be a banker as long as they're proud of what they do and I support them for wanting more in life. Not for wanting less. I would never encourage someone to ""stay with their parents, live at home, help out, it's your job and it's an obligation."" It's not an obligation when you've been verbally and physically abused your entire life. "
51v8ns,1,2016-09-08,Student wanting own BOA Travel Card – Currently auth user on parent's Citi Double Card,needhelpccthrowaaw,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/51v8ns/student_wanting_own_boa_travel_card_currently/,"Hey /r/personalfinance ,

Just got some questions real quick about something I've been wondering about for quite some time.

I am a 20 year old college student living in NYC and am currently an authorized user under a parent's Citi Double Cash card. I pay my own balance on my own, the parent doesn't use the card whatsoever, and have been doing so for the past year and a half. I began with a 3.4k limit which was upped to 5.5k after a year of having the card, and just again upped to 7.5k. I currently have a balance of around 2.9k on it which I am slowly working down which accrued from some personal expenses that I couldn't change, but it does kind of suck as now there's a ridiculously high APR on it that I am responsible for. I never pay minimum, always as much as I can, and it will be gone in the next several months. I'm an auth user on this card.

I currently bank with BOA, and I want to get my own standalone credit card, away from my parents. I like to set money aside to travel with my girlfriend, money permitting, and want to apply for the Bank of America Travel credit card. However, I just tried to check my credit score via annual credit report, and it came up with an error and truth be told, I'm a bit worried to play with that stuff. 

I am sitting on the BOA application page, wondering what I should do. I am a college student, in my junior year of uni, but I heard that college students are frequently not approved for these travel cards, unless it's from Discover or something like that. I currently work at an internship, and get paid on W2, so should I put down Employed as opposed to Student? In regards to income, should I inflate it slightly and put say 15,000$ (not exactly 100% truthful) but I do make a decent amount through work and frequently find other ways to lowkey make money, be it selling things online that I don't need anymore, etc.

Please lemme know guys, I've been wondering about this for quite some time and really do want my own card to build credit, as I'm sure being an auth user doesn't do the same. Thanks!

**Edit**: Well, thanks all, applied and got approved, kinda cool so I guess this is my first CC that I'll be responsible for entirely on my own!"

As I stand, I don't mind just studying, doing the work, learn programming on my own to diverse my skills, and seek internships on my own. However, because I don't have any solid friends on campus I feel that I miss out on connections and simply somebody to talk to. I am not anxious with people but lack to initiate conversations. 

Somehow, I feel like I know what I need to do to be decent in my studies and don't mind learning skills on my own. But because the social aspects of clubs tend to congregate like minded like myself, it will expose me to be more social and do better in interviews than somehow who just knows technical stuff. 

Any advice?"
51vjan,1,2016-09-09,College student with almost 100% credit utilization. How much will this affect me?,college_ccdebt,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/51vjan/college_student_with_almost_100_credit/,"Sometime after my 18th birthday (a year ago or so), I went ahead and got approved for a credit card from BofA with a $2,000 credit limit (no cosign). Thought I could handle paying it off fully each month, but suddenly things like parking permits, textbooks, food, and especially poor spending habits kicked in and soon I hit near the credit limit. I've had a static mid 600 FICO rating (according to BofA website) for 4 months now. I've realized how serious this is, and been trying to cut down on a lot of spending trying to get it back to $0. I have three months left on the introductory 0% interest offer, so I do plan on paying it off fully by then. Will this adversely affect my credit score long term (I would assume I could recover it as long as I don't screw up again), and how much do prospective internship employers (software development related) care about credit score, if at all? Would this also affect my chances/interest rates at any private student loans if I apply for them in the future (I'm currently on federal loans, and my parents are fine with cosigning those and have a credit score in the 800s)?"
51vkbl,1,2016-09-09,Please help; trouble with mentor,corinarose1,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/51vkbl/please_help_trouble_with_mentor/,"TL;DR I am having some real trouble with an ex-mentor of mine, who I was on good terms with, but later did some real stupid stuff and I had to back off.

When I started my first job almost four years ago, I was assigned a mentor. He was very helpful, taught me a lot, wrote my recommendation letters for grad school and helped with my paper. We were on good terms and would once in awhile have tea or lunch together. Later, he started behaving really weirdly, (from trying to hold my hand to trying to kiss me), and I decided I had to cut it off. Then I eventually resigned to pursue my Masters' degree.

He later came on a business trip and insisted on meeting me. Now I wasn't interested at all, but he pleaded and pleaded and showed how much he had helped me and finally I did meet him, but he ended up touching me inappropriately and tried to do other stuff, but I got out before anything could happen. I was scarred for a while, did really badly that semester and avoided him because I was too disgusted by him.

He would keep messaging or calling and saying how he is sorry and all that. A year later, I began to give in. I was desperately looking for internships, and ended up sending him my resume. ( I know, should not have). Then I faced some difficulty at work with my project so would consult him for guidance, believing that he wouldn't do anything bad. 

He somehow thought I owed him for all that and would insist that I take trips with him and go to places with him alone when I wasn't comfortable with it. I looked up to him as a professional mentor, so then I started questioning myself as to whether I was doing something wrong. Was I using him? So again, I stopped being in contact with him or responding to his (incredibly frequent) messages.

Recently he contacted me about a job opportunity that had opened up at my first company's headquarters, where he was still working. I was very reluctant but he insisted and eventually got me into a position I could not back out of despite me being very resistant. Now I'm in the company, partly out of desperation because I did not have a job either. Now the other day, he picked a fight with me over texts saying how I did not have gratitude and did not personally thank him for ""getting"" me the job, how I didn't go with him to coffee after I said I would (I had a meeting, and later forgot all about it) and how I've never been of any help to him.

I told him I really cannot be a friend any more after what he had done. He said he hasn't done anything to me of that sort recently and asked me why I was complaining. He even mentioned how he said he was hungry the other day, and although I asked him if he wanted me to cook something for him, I didn't insist. His exact words were, ""Am I supposed to request you to make something for me?"" 

He has been emotionally blackmailing me like this for the past 18 months, and crying and asking me to be his friend. He got married recently and I am not comfortable with being his ""friend"". What do I do? I own that it's my fault too for still being in contact with him, but I cannot tell you how hard I'm trying not to. He's contacting me through all avenues possible and not letting me go.

51vtql,1,2016-09-09,"Me [23 M] with my girlfriend [23 F] of 13 months, cannot stop arguing",throwingthisfar_away,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/51vtql/me_23_m_with_my_girlfriend_23_f_of_13_months/,"So our relationship started off with drama.  I first met my girlfriend when she was dating my friend's brother.  At the time I paid no attention her and really wasn't all that interested.  I respected their relationship and at no time did I tried to interject myself into it.  Fast forward a year and a half later they broke up, she tried dating someone else, and she was single again.  I took a chance and asked her on a date.  We went on a few more dates, flirted a lot through text, and hit it off great.

I finally gathered enough courage to ask her if she would like to become more exclusive.  I think my exact verbiage was ""I have a lot of fun with you and I would like to see where things can go.""  She agreed, we kissed, and now we are together since, I think.

This all started last August.  It was my the first summer post-college graduation, but last summer in my hometown as I was moving out of state back to my college town for a full time job.  I made her very aware of the situation and she was ok with it.  We spent as much time with each other as possible until my move.

When I moved we kept in constant contact.  We would talk for hours on end through text, call, or FaceTime.  It was great.  The communication was there and we were making it work.  She traveled twice to visit and we continued to have a great time.  One day while talking she surprised me by saying that she applied for a job where I am.  I was ecstatic.

She came down and we apartment searched for her.  She was moving to me.  What could be better?!  Things were going great.  She found a place and has been working and living near me since November.

Thats when the problems have started. Being that I went to college where I am I have an establish life.  I have friends and know the area.  When my girlfriend moved, she obviously had nobody but me; completely understandable.  I introduced her to most of my friends.  One meeting did not go so well.  That was when I introduced her to my a female friend, who we will call Jane, who has been in a steady relationship for a long time.  In my girlfriend's defense, this did not go so well.  Jane came across rather abrasive and rude, which I nor my girlfriend did not appreciate.  I never confronted my friend, but I did reassure my girlfriend that what Jane did was wrong and I understand if she does not like Jane.  My friendship with Jane has since gone to the wayside, nonetheless she is still a friend.  Nothing ever happened with Jane and I, nor will anything happen.  This all happened early November.

Fast forward to Thanksgiving 2016, my girlfriend joins me and my family at my aunt's house.  While sitting with my girlfriend I said that I was going to send Jane a ""Happy Thanksgiving"" text.  That is all.  Well that erupted into a problem.  It became, ""why do you have to think of Jane while I am with you and your family?""  Wishing people a greeting on a holiday is something I have always done for all my friends, but has now become a problem.  So I admit fault and try to move on.  (Jane will come up again as a problem...)

It should be noted that early on in the relationship we both disclosed information about ourselves (previous relationships, number of people we slept with, things of that nature).  We know everything there is to know about each other.

It should also be noted that I see her almost everyday despite living separately.  I get out of work before and usually pick her up (sometimes waiting close to an hour due to the nature of her job and not being able to tell me) because she walks.  I always go to her place and she rarely comes to mine except when its hot as her house has a poor a/c system.  When I am not in class I am with her.  When I am not at work and she is not working I am with her.  Any and all free time I may have is spent with her.

Since then things stay the same or rather start to get worse; we have our arguments and try to move on.  Although the arguments seem to be getting worse and worse.  They are becoming more intense and more personal.  One thing that my girlfriend told me from the being that has always stuck in my mind is that she ""does not fight fair.""  She said that she will reverse it and make the other seem at fault.  To be honest, she is very good at that.  I can count on one hand how many times she has apologized after a fight or argument.

As of recent our fights, as she puts it, is because I am a lier and cannot be trusted or because I do not listen.  Let me go into detail....

First it is and seems to be a common occurrence of me not listening.  I am the type of person that has to get involved and try to help others, even when its not wanted.  This gets applied to my girlfriend.  When she would come to me with an issue or problem that she was having with me or with something I did she would explain.  I would then try to justify to her why I did xy&amp;z and that would make her more upset.  Now I do realize that it is her feelings and she should feel the way she wants, but when I offer a logical explanation in attempt to make it better , I would hope it would do just that.  Chase in point:

In July it was Janes birthday.  Taking into consideration how the girlfriend does not care for Jane I decided to text Jane a ""Happy Birthday"" when the girlfriend left the room.  I did not tell my girlfriend because we were finally having a good day of fighting and I did not want to bring Jane up and cause any problems.  Ten days later I told my girlfriend what I did.  Now I'll preface this by saying technically I did lie and here how.  The day before Janes birthday my girlfriend and I were having a conversation about how one day I would like to pay for a vacation for my parents as a thank you for all the hard work they have done for me.  That didn't go so well.  She said that she hopes I take us on a vacation before I did something like that for them.  I replied by saying I would like to do that but also pay for one for them.  More conversation ensued about it and I eventually said that I would not tell her if I did so.  I quickly retracted that statement realizing it was a mistake and said told my girlfriend that I am open with her and she knows everything about me as I have nothing to hide.  This is where the lie comes in about Jane.

From that time to now I have been labeled as a lier and has accused me of cheating in every which way without actually saying ""you are cheating on me"".  I can no longer go to an internship which I have help for five years without being accused of cheating.  I can't have lunch with female co-workers without being accused of cheating.  I have been loyal, and yes I make mistakes.  One thing I would never do is cheat.  I said to my girlfriend from day one that ""before you cheat on me, break up with me"".   

As the fights are progressively getting worse my girlfriend attempted to break up with me.  In a last ditch effort to save the relationship I told her that I would seek professional guidance from a psychologist and talk about how I can improve as a person.

So I did.  I began one hour long sessions with a psychologist since the beginning of August.  Well I have been doing my best to heed the suggestions of my new doctor.  A doctor I had to pick mainly on appearance so that my girlfriend would not accuse me of cheating.  I chose an old female doctor who must be in her mid 60s.

Prior to me enlisting the ear of a professional, I relied heavily on my mother to listen to me vent.  I am a self proclaimed ""momma's boy"" to an extent.  When I travel home I have no complaints with her doing my laundry or making dinner for me.  But this venting to mom soon became a problem for the girlfriend.  She feared that my mom would never view her the same and that I was giving one sided stories.  Of course naturally there would be biases, but I did not best to give a fair story of what has happened, as I am trying now.  Once this erupted into an argument, I no longer would go to my mom, but now I was a neutral ear I can talk to.  And talking about an issue to someone is how I deal with things, it helps me even if I am wrong.

Now comes today, we both had the day off so my girlfriend and I *tried* to enjoy the day together.  She picked me up and we both did some grocery shopping and then move on.  As it was a nice day I suggested we get her car a car wash.  Prior to leaving her place I moved a box of cereal that she put down from one spot to another.  We proceeded outside were she put the recycling in a full can.  Commenting how it will call out and make a mess I moved the bag she put down into an empty can.  You remember were I said I like to help even when its unwanted, this is another time where it bites me in the butt.  She asked why I have to touch things that she puts down.  I respond with an apology and said that I will do my best to be more consciencious of doing such actions.  She was frustrated at this point.  Recognizing this I stood silently behind her car as she began to move things around so that it can be vacuumed at the car wash.  Seeing what appeared as being done in with the front passenger seat I quietly walked and sat in the seat.  Once sitting in the car, I asked what else was wrong and she asked if I was angry because I wasn't talking (which I had no reason to be, I was merely trying to avoid a fight by not saying anything that may make things worse).  She then seemed upset that I did not help her prep her car because ""usually"" I would help her (again I was just trying to stay out of the way).  Proceeding out of the parking lot I asked if she knew how to get to the car wash and she said no.  I, thinking aloud, said that she needed to take ABC Road.  Proceeding to the main road she comments ""You made me feel like an idiot"".  Asking why, she explained that she didn't know how to get to ABC Road and that when I said that she needed to go that way it made it her feel as she puts it ""like an idiot"".  Remembering that it was her feelings I apologized and said that I had no malicious intent in doing so.  I tried leaving it at that.  Comments went back and forth and I eventually suggested that she just take me back to my place.  She drove off and now I was home.  After about a half hour I get in my car and start pulling out of the driveway.  Thats when I receive a text message from her.  Seeing that she's trying to communicate I try calling her.  I get sent to voicemail.  This is typical for her to do when we argue.  I am one who refuses to fight via text as I am not as quick to type as she is.  So I keep getting sent to voicemail.  I make the decision to drive to her place and see her in person.

She lets me in and we talk, kinda.  Again I apologize for my actions earlier.  We spend some time at her place and I suggest she come out with me as I still had things to do on my day off.  I run some errands and we stop at a place for her.  Time is quickly catching up on us as I soon have an appointment with my doctor.  

In an effort to satisfy our growing hunger pains, my girlfriend asks me about what I talk to my doctor for a full hour.  I try explaining that it is a time for me to talk about the weeks events and what I think I did wrong.  I then get asked if I talk about Jane while I am there.  Of course I say yes because Jane has been the root of some of our problems.  That's where things start to get intense.  My girlfriend does not seem to be too happy with the fact that I talk(ed) about (1) Jane and (2) her (my girlfriend) behind her back.  I calmly explain that I am not at the doctor to fix my girlfriend that I am there to fix my problems with ultimately with help us.  That doesn't seem good enough.  My girlfriend continues to interrogate me and my frustration level is rising and so is the excitement in my voice.  I offered for her to join me at a session but she refused, as she has done in the past.

To my girlfriend my excited voice is yelling and my yelling is worse.  I do not yell at my girlfriend.  I have never abused her nor will I ever.  I do not have the time of day for anyone who is abusive.  My excited voice though will make her bottle up.  I know the difference between me yelling and not but she can't hear the difference.  Maybe there isn't one, but I beg to differ.

I finally walk out of the car to get the food.  By the time I return my girlfriend is not talking to me.  I ask her is she will and she shrugs her shoulders.  I get her to her house and thats where more arguing occurs.  It comes to the point where I snapped from pure fustration and I take the food we just got and throw it out the passenger door.  Unfortunately my girlfriend was in the path of this food.  I was convinced up to a couple of hours ago that it never hit her.  I was not aiming for her, again I am not abusive and have never done anything to harm her.  I hurts me to see her cry and thats the last thing I am trying to do.

Immediately my heart stopped and I realize what I did.  I ran out of the car and tried to comfort and apologized.  I felt and still do feel like the biggest a$$hole for what I did.  I left and headed straight for the doctor.  How convenient...

I go to the doctor and explain everything that has happened.  I tear up and begin to cry because talking about how I hurt her by throwing the food in her direction, not at her.  I regret what I did.  I hate how my frustration got the best of me.

My doctor explains my reaction was only normal and that I am human.  I still think its unacceptable.  She then tells me that she believes that my girlfriend also needs to seek help.  That this relationship needs to be more 50/50.  Now this conclusion was not made based on all these events, but has been made based on all the other previous sessions I have had.

As soon as I reach my car I try contacting my girlfriend.  Blocked.  Not just blocked from the texting or calling, blocked from Facebook, Instagram, you name it, I was banished.  I left voicemails, many, trying to get her to meet me somewhere neutral to talk.  Somewhere that she felt she had control to leave when she wanted, I did not want her to feel trapped.

I drive to her place and sit outside reaching for my last hope of sending an email and getting a response.  I do.  Essentially she replies with us being done.  She does not want to see me and wants me to let her go.

I leave and head back to my place.  Some more email exchanges occur and finally I get a text.  She wants me to acknowledge her last test and agree to let her go.  More specifically ""If you love me, you'll let me go"".  I tell via text I can't. I love her too much.  She proceeds to tell me that I am like one of her exes.  (He was sexually abusive, psychically abuse, and mentally abusive).  Mind you, every time we have sex (which happens *maybe* once or twice a month) I ask her point blank ""do you want to have sex"", trying to let her feel comfortable.  She then tells me that my doctor is making me worse and I am turning into a monster more and more everyday.  It continues with her telling me that everything that I have done for her has been done for her before by this same ex.  And that his throwing of things has led to her being abused.

I will never know what she has to deal with.  But I am damn sure I would never hurt her.  I love her too much to ever lay a hand on her and if I did I would bring myself in to the police as I have told her before.  The texting continues with me pleading with her to let me see her.  Her responses become more and more hurtful saying that she does not love me and that she doesn't think she can ever love me.  She continued by saying that she hates me.

At this point I am lost.  I have tried everything I can think of to be as transparent, supportive, and everything she wants me to be.  I have let friendships go, heard how she does not want to be friends with my family, and I have given her the option of having all my passwords for social media and emails.  She has access to my phone whenever she wants and so forth.  I have gone as far as asking her what exactly she wants me to do.

Despite our problems I still love this girl.  Not because I am afraid of being alone, but because she does make me happy and I am able to talk to her about a future together.  When the good times are going with us, they are great.  We seem to have reached an all time low in our relationship and I want it to work out.  I genuinely love her and will do anything for her, no matter what.

I am looking for all the help, comments, and/or suggestions you can offer.  

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My girlfriend and I have been arguing more frequently and I am trying all I can to fix our relationship.  I have made many mistakes, some big and some small, and have owned up to them.  I want to save our relationship and I am looking for all and any suggestions on what I should do."

Background: Early 20's, worked in restaurants (mainly for family) for majority of my mid-late teens. Sadly, no secondary diploma but I'm working on it. Started programming as a kid after being interested in how it worked through Starcraft's map editor. From there, I learned Python, Lisp, and settled into C++ as I saw that's what the entire games industry was using.

I built very minor programs to start with after I was done messing around with Starcraft/Warcraft 3: one, a point-of-sale proof of concept system to convince people to purchase an actual one that looked nicer (in hindsight, I should've just ran with it and made something from it); another, a rudimentary game engine with SDL, later SFML, processing graphics and audio with input being hacked together through DirectInput; a myriad of other, smaller ones whenever I have to learn a concept (file editors, taking source files and turning them into something else, etc); all of them in C++. I've since worked with and familiarized myself with C# (first for Unity3D, then generally just messing around creating do-nothing desktop applications), Java for Android development, and Go recently for a concept I wanted to try. Barely touched upon Ruby, looking to do that after I mess with HTML5 more. I've also started to branch out my learning into more traditional computer science versus just programming through various online resources. Currently, I'm working on a server backend for a game I thought up both as a personal ""I've wanted to make this for awhile"" project and as a learning tool and portfolio padding.

I'd like to start working and applying right away since I've finally found the time to step away from the business and madness of the restaurant world, and I feel like I have a good grasp on the things that my peers in the industry know as well as a drive for it, but I'd like to get an unbiased opinion on my current state of affairs so I know what my next steps should be. Thoughts?

I am not a CS student, but I took a few electives on the major. I'd like to try to land an internship in the field to see if I'd like to do it professionally or if I should stick with doing it just for fun. I've started to build my resume and everyone mentions how important projects are to building a strong application.

In one of the electives I took we had to design a 2D platformer in Java and a Zork like game in C++. For various reasons I could not give proper attention to all of my classes that semester and, even though the games worked and I passed the class, the code is sloppy and confusing. Not well designed at all.

Looking back to what I've done, I don't have a lot of projects to display. Right now I am already building something else and I think the time it would take to fix the code will be just as long as making new games and I find my current project a bit more interesting so I don't feel like stopping that to re-do the other ones.

Considering I don't have a lot of projects would it be a good idea to upload them to github acknowledging that it has some design flaws that I plan to fix, even if not right now?

edit: I hope I was clear with the question. I tried to post this and Reddit crashed so I had to retype it and I am not sure that it seems as clear as I wanted it to be. Anyways, thanks :)"

This is my first post here, I'm looking for some kind of support or input:) i don't really know how to deal with my situation.

Few things about me: i'm a student and i'm about to start my master thesis next month. I dont have any courses anymore, but i still need to finish stuff my internship report. I have some mild form of social anxiety and feeling depressed for a while now. I don't have much social contact at the moment, mostly because i barely reach out to friends or initiate, but wait for friends to call me.

Well at the moment I really need to finish my internship report and start doing some research for my master thesis. Although i spend my days mostly at the home i can't seem to get any work done. I end up thinking about the problems in my life and trying to find fixes. I feel like I am totally unable to function at the moment, days go by me sitting at home dwelling on my thoughts all day long without writing a single sentence... I know that this won't help me at all and is total bullshit, yet i am somehow unable to change it. On the other hand if I go out and do something fun or social I feel bad for not have gotten any work done and can't enjoy it.
Sometimes I feel like losing my mind or the sense of reality... I think I know on a in intellectual level that my behaviour is self destructive and unhelpful as well as what i really need to do: Setting some time aside to do my work, and spend the other time going out and doing fun stuff. Yet my permanent thinking prevents me from doing this, i don't know how to change it 

Needed to get this off my chest, i'm open for any help or other response.

Take care"

Just got some questions real quick about something I've been wondering about for quite some time.

I am a 20 year old college student living in NYC and am currently an authorized user under a parent's Citi Double Cash card. I pay my own balance on my own, the parent doesn't use the card whatsoever, and have been doing so for the past year and a half. I began with a 3.4k limit which was upped to 5.5k after a year of having the card, and just again upped to 7.5k. I currently have a balance of around 2.9k on it which I am slowly working down which accrued from some personal expenses that I couldn't change, but it does kind of suck as now there's a ridiculously high APR on it that I am responsible for. I never pay minimum, always as much as I can, and it will be gone in the next several months. I'm an auth user on this card.

I currently bank with BOA, and I want to get my own standalone credit card, away from my parents. I like to set money aside to travel with my girlfriend, money permitting, and want to apply for the Bank of America Travel credit card. However, I just tried to check my credit score via annual credit report, and it came up with an error and truth be told, I'm a bit worried to play with that stuff.

I am sitting on the BOA application page, wondering what I should do. I am a college student, in my junior year of uni, but I heard that college students are frequently not approved for these travel cards, unless it's from Discover or something like that. I currently work at an internship, and get paid on W2, so should I put down Employed as opposed to Student? In regards to income, should I inflate it slightly and put say 15,000$ (not exactly 100% truthful) but I do make a decent amount through work and frequently find other ways to lowkey make money, be it selling things online that I don't need anymore, etc.

Please lemme know guys, I've been wondering about this for quite some time and really do want my own card to build credit, as I'm sure being an auth user doesn't do the same. Thanks!

**Edit**: Well, thanks all, applied and got approved, kinda cool so I guess this is my first CC that I'll be responsible for entirely on my own!"

51x5kx,6,2016-09-09,Finding Internship Opportunities UK,FlaccidCucumber,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/51x5kx/finding_internship_opportunities_uk/,"Hi,
I'm a 1st Year Mech Eng student going into 2nd Year in October, I'm trying to find summer internships for 2017 and as of right now I'm applying to the 'big' engineering firms for internships but I know it's a bit of a shot in the dark trying to get a place. So I want to apply to smaller companies but I'm struggling to find any companies that are offering any summer internship and I'm not familiar with any smaller companies so I don't really know where to look. I'm looking for some help in finding some smaller companies that have internship opportunities :)
Any advice is appreciated!"
51xaku,0,2016-09-09,My girlfriend [20 F] of 3 months just cried over me [23 M] cancelling a short holiday I booked earlier on,Void-freedom-775,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/51xaku/my_girlfriend_20_f_of_3_months_just_cried_over_me/,"So both me and my girlfriend are in college and we're on break now. She went off to her hometown to visit her family earlier on while I went ahead and booked a short, 1 night vacation for us since it's been something she's been hinting at for a bit. Now, after telling her roughly what the plans are (I only just made a free booking, didn't spend a single cent), our grades come out and we find out that she's failed one of her classes.

Now, I made it very clear to her when we began our relationship that our grades could not slip. I'm no 4.0 GPA student but I do have a tuition waiver and allowance (based on both financial background and academic results) from the university I'm attending and I can't afford to lose it especially since I'm not as well off as she is. The very least I hoped from her was that she also passed her classes (I usually need As to keep my scholarship).

What I decided to do then was cancel that booking of ours due to this (I didn't think it would be a big deal since she was already vacationing a bit with her family in Europe) and in the process, caused her to cry. Now, the only thing she blamed me for was getting her hopes up and then crushing them which I will admit was not very considerate of me (really though, I just didn't expect her to fail especially since I helped her study, at least in the subjects that were related to my major). Obviously, I can't erase the fact that I made her cry and I've been feeling guilty about doing this to her. So much so that I'm reconsidering booking the place again.

What I would like to know is whether my behavior seems overly controlling. Like I don't care so much about grades but what I really dislike is people not putting in the effort to do their best especially when others (i.e. parents) are breaking their backs to send them to college. However, she obviously has different standards than I do and I wonder if it's exceptionally inconsiderate of me to expect her to follow mine. I just want her to be the best she can be (it doesn't have to be grades, I have friends who are too busy with internships and work to do more than the bare minimum for classes but I hold them in high regard since they're actually putting in the effort) but before she met me, she spent a good amount of time shopping and procrastinating especially when it came to schoolwork.

I just have a gut feeling that if we engage in such rewarding activities regardless of how we perform that she'll start subconsciously believing that she won't need to try all that hard and that crying is all it takes to get her way. Am I being too much like a dad to her instead of a partner? Should I keep our relationship and our achievements separate?

It just doesn't seem right to me to spend money when things are going poorly (she, on the other hand, wants to spend more the worse things are). 

edit1:
Ok ok I get it, my standards are mine not hers'. It's just that I'm not very well off either so I guess this was my excuse to try and save money. Bad idea on my part I get it. So should I still take her on the trip?

For those of you wondering why I'd pull something as crazy as this, I come from a very performance oriented Asian family. My parents never mentioned it out loud but me and my siblings are usually measured by our 'return on investment (monetary)', only reason I'm getting an engineering degree and she's in medicine. So it never really occurred to me that I should separate stuff like this. I've got a long way to go.

edit2:
She told me to add that I was actually planning to replace that trip with a dinner instead due to time and monetary constraints.

But thanks for showing me how much of a controlling asshole I can be.

  **tl;dr**: Girlfriend cried over possible vacation with me (I canceled the booking due to grades), should I just re-book the place and surprise her?"
51xauy,119,2016-09-09,Blow by Blow Justice V,schoolgirlerror,Schoolgirlerror,https://www.reddit.com/r/Schoolgirlerror/comments/51xauy/blow_by_blow_justice_v/,"The nurse in the emergency department kept her eyes flicking between Mary and Gabriella like she was trying to work out if one of them was my wife, and if so, which one. She was placid, feathers unruffled by the blood on my torso, seeping over my hands. At triage, they established the wound wasn’t deep, but took me aside immediately. 



The emergency department wasn’t far from the courthouse, and if the clientele of each had been swapped, I wouldn’t have noticed. Thugs with broken arms, superficial stab wounds, bruising from fights, sat open-legged in the orange chairs holding ice or homemade bandages. The porters rushed me through. I drew stares. I wondered how many of the men in that room I’d fought. 



Mary was nervous, sticking to Gabriella like a kid to his mother on the first day of school. My new intern wasn’t much better. She’d dropped everything at the courthouse to bring me here, and her face had turned grey. Still, she had that set in her jaw that I’d come to recognise. I reckoned she’d hold herself together long enough to take care of our client. 



“Mary,” I said. I leant back against the plastic covered bed, sweat pouring off me. The tired lino had footprints trodden into it, and the privacy curtain was grey with age. “Do you still smoke?” 



“Nah, I quit, Mr Red. They all say it’s bad for you, and after Lyle—”



“Of course, I apologise,” My voice came out in gasps. I couldn’t concentrate on the pain. It rolled over me in waves, the left side of my body on fire. If I thought about it, my head span like I’d sat up too fast. The nurse lifted my hands from my side, pouring sterilised water over the wound. Blood washed away, coating my shorts and the white bed. 



“Gabriella, run out and get me a pack.” I tried to snap my fingers at her. The nurse tutted. 



“This is a no smoking zone,” she said. 



“Get me cigarettes, Gabriella,” I said. “She’s my intern,” I explained to the nurse, who had lifted one eyebrow and was staring at me. “She has to do what I say.” 



“Well, right now, she’s going to wait outside so we can get a doctor in—Ma’am! You cannot use that in here!” 



Gabriella wrestled my ringing phone from her pocket. Accepting the call, she laid my wallet and watch on the table beside me.



“Hi, Judge Fisher?” she turned away from the bedside. The nurse glowered at her, shooing her towards the door. Mary sat on the only chair in the room, clutching her knees and looking between the nurse and Gabriella as though one of them would shout at her. 



“What do you mean? He got *stabbed,* your Honour.” Gabriella clamped her hand to her forehead. Her hair started to unravel from its neat twist as she lost her composure.



“What kind of fucking—”



“No, you’re right, that language was inappropriate, I apologise. I see. Well, I’ll be disputing this on behalf of my client. And if you’re lucky, I won’t hit you with a charge of negligently allowing an armed combatant to fight.” 



“Yes, I am serious. Have a good day, your Honour.” 



“Please!” The nurse exploded, still clutching at the fringes of politeness. 



“Okay!” Gabriella held her hands up in defeat. “I’m going back to the courthouse. Judge Fisher’s awarded Lyle custody. Apparently you forfeited the fight.”



I shot up, pain lancing through my side. The nurse pushed against my shoulders, and I smacked her hands away. Mary’s mouth dropped open.



“He can’t do that,” I said. “He broke the remits of the fight.” 



“Yes, but it’s the same way someone gets charged for contempt of court, apparently. It has no impact on the trial itself. He’ll serve jail time, Mary—and your hospital fees are on him, Mr Red—but we have fourteen days to lodge an appeal or he wins.” 



“He can’t!” Mary turned white.



“He can, and he will,” Gabriella said. “I’ll take care of it, Mr Red.” 



I had no choice but to agree. The nurse watched me with the gimlet stare of a prison warden. 



 “What’s your brand?” Gabriella asked, dropping the phone on the bedside table.



“Camels,” I replied. Tutting, the nurse snapped on a pair of rubber gloves. 



“Mr Red, you have been *stabbed.*” 



“It was a small knife,” I said. That earned me a smile I didn’t deserve from Gabriella. Sinking back onto the bed, I watched her leave the room. 



I was no stranger to pain, and I was quietly proud of it. Broken bones, bruises—once I pissed blood for three days after the respondent, a trucker, hit me so hard I saw stars. Never had been stabbed. As the nurse cleaned the wound, and the sharp sting of disinfectant reached me, I decided I wasn’t keen to repeat the experience. 



---------


I woke from a drug-induced sleep in a room filled with light. Mid-afternoon, it filtered through the bars on the window, spilling onto the dirty floor. The pain in my side had been replaced with a throbbing ache. I lifted the blanket to find it neatly patched with white gauze and a thick cotton pad. The room was empty, pulse monitor clipped to my finger, and panic button within easy reach. 



On the table beside me, where Gabriella had left my watch, wallet and phone, someone had placed a small bundle of cheap flowers. And a packet of sunflower seeds. I laughed.



Things were a mess. As memories of my last conversation with Gabriella filtered back, I leant my head against the pillow and groaned. A forfeited fight: my first. Lyle would pay for what he’d done, but procedure remained the same. He’d won on a technicality, and I wouldn’t be fighting fit in two weeks. I’d let down Mary. 




I called her from my bed, wincing as I shifted to grab the phone. 



“Mary? It’s me.” 



She was worried about me, and I reassured her I was doing fine. 



“They’ve patched me up. I need bed rest. I’ll be out of here as soon as I can, save Lyle his hospital fees.” 



“Is it true what Gabriella said, that he won custody?” 



I paused. “You can appeal, Mary. We’ll make sure Moe and Eric stay with you.” I rubbed my face with my palm. “Look, if you can pay, we can submit a formal case. We can do evidence, discovery. Courts never take custody away from a woman unless there’s something seriously wrong with you. It’d be easy.” 



“I can’t come up with that sort of money,” Mary sounded close to tears. “You know I can’t, Mr Red. All my money comes from Lyle’s job and now—”



I sighed. “I know, I understand. The problem is, with this injury, I can’t fight. I’m not going to be ready to take hits again for a while. My advice is, as your attorney, that you find someone new to represent you. I can give you a few names, but—”



“Why would I go somewhere else?” Mary said. 



“Because I can’t fight!” The frustration bubbled over and I bit my lip, hard, not to show it. “You won’t win, Mary. You’ll lose unless you find another firm who’ll take you on.” 



“But Gabriella said she was going to fight,” Mary said. “She said she was an associate at your firm, and she’d do it. We went for coffee and she explained everything.” 



“Did she now?” 



“I like her, Mr Red.”



“I’ll let her know,” I growled. I hung up on Mary, knowing it was rude but no longer caring. Gabriella could be as ripped as Kell Brooks, twice as determined, and there was still no way I’d let her walk into a ring with the likes of Lyle Blount. 



But I had a sneaking suspicion that what Gabriella wanted, Gabriella got. From the moment she ducked under the metal grille at the gym, she’d known what she was after. I just hoped for both of our sakes that she knew what she was dragging me into. 



--------


During outpatient, I avoided the nurse from earlier. She bore a grudge against me for not lying down and taking my medicine like a good boy. The taxi wouldn’t drop me at my office, no matter how much I pointed out my brand-new stab wound. I used the wall for balance, stepping gingerly over the trash littering my route. 



By the time I reached the rainbow graffiti, I could hear the iron-slap of weights hitting the floor. Ducking beneath the grille, I took a look around. 




A handful of men were in my gym, using my equipment. Dressed in vests and sweatpants, they were muscled in a way that suggested they had nothing else to do. A couple went bare-chested, slapping chalk between their open palms before ducking to the bar. The smell of coffee fought against the sweat. 



“What’s this?” I rattled the metal grille to get their attention. Someone pulled a pair of headphones out to listen to me. “This is a private gym.” 



“No disrespect,” the man who replied stood a head above me, biceps cultivated for aesthetics rather than strength. “But there was a flyer, and we’ve all paid our dues.” 



“Your *dues?*” I said. A sneaking realisation came over me. “You paid them to?”



“Miss Cole,” he replied. “She’s upstairs, said not to disturb her unless it was urgent. Are you an attorney too?”



“You’re damn right I’m an attorney,” I growled through gritted teeth. “Same message stands. Don’t disturb us unless it’s urgent.” 



I threw open the office door and regretted it immediately. Gripping the handle to mask my pain, I entered, breathing through my nose. 



“Hey!” Gabriella dashed over to help me. I waved her away, sinking gratefully into my chair at my desk. It was then I saw what she’d done. 



She’d completely cleared Hammer’s desk. It stood empty, box files placed neatly on the floor beside the open cabinet. The surface had been dusted, and she had a laptop and Mary Blount’s file open in front of her. A mug of good coffee steamed in the corner. 



“What do you think you're doing?” I asked. “I come back from *hospital,* Gabriella, I find people in my gym, and—”



Getting up, she crossed the room smoothly and closed the door. 



“First things first,” she said. “I’m taking Mary Blount’s case. You’re not fit to fight the appeal, but I am. He’s sloppy, his punches are telegraphed and if he hadn’t had a knife, you would have taken him.” 



I was in no fit state to argue, and merely nodded. 



“Second: this place is in trouble. We both know it, and I don’t know what mad dream is keeping the finances in order, but it’s not going to keep you afloat for long. There’s six people down there that just paid for three months use of this place. That’s going to cover the mortgage. Case-wise, I’ve been looking through them. You’ve got so many fish files in this box that they’re starting to stink out the office.” 



“They’re Hammer’s files,” I replied. 



“Two of them got default judgements against us because you didn’t file a motion in time,” she continued. “There’s three I had to apply for an extension, pulling some strings at the courthouse, and—”



“Stop,” I held up my hand to silence her, and reluctantly, Gabriella closed her mouth. “Bad luck, kid. You’ve done a lot of work for no reason. I’m shutting the firm down. You’re right, there’s no way I can cover the mortgages on this place with the cases I’m working. I can’t fight, and you’re naïve or stupid if you think you can.” 



The set of her jaw was back. I rummaged in my pocket for painkillers. 



“My partner died because he didn’t know when to stop. I don’t want to be there, fifty years old, staring down a fight I can’t win. It ends now.” 



“You can’t,” Gabriella whispered. 



“I can, and I will,” I replied.

I'm writing this post to hopefully receive some feedback about a plan of action. Initially, I tend to be more of a lurker, but I'm gradually realizing that not seeking help when I need it is making things unnecessarily hard on myself. I received some feedback from others (friends, a professor I emailed), and thought that it could not hurt to ask others who are actively working in the field. 

To give some context, so comply with the posting rules: I have a M.S. in speech-language pathology. I enjoy the degree and work that I do in social-communication, language, cognition, speech, and swallowing function and disorders. I have about 2 years of work experience (not including clinical practicum and internships in grad school). But I wish that it could be applied more technically, for lack of a better word, as I list programming, artificial intelligence, development of assistive &amp; augmentative communication (AAC) devices, robotics, interface between humans and technology, and computer science and engineering under my interests. I have some experience programming (predominantly Python) that I self-taught, because I found ways I could apply it to create a program to help coworkers. The crux is that my degree did not have the prerequisites and training that would typically fall under computer science and engineering degrees, and so I am researching the necessary path to take toward academia and continuing education.

I asked for others' feedback, including a professor who is doing research in artificial intelligence, social robotics, and applying technology to research and teach individuals with autism; it's work to which my current background could be applied provided I had the requisites taken care of.

Some of the feedback included suggestions to complete prerequisites for a CS or engineering program at a community college and later transition toward a B.S. degree. A friend mentioned that, given my existing M.S., I may not face the same hurdles as someone working toward a first degree. However, I don't know how true this is considering there is not significant overlap between my current degree and one I'd be working toward.

The professor's email is quoted below:

&gt; There are a few different routes into this kind of work, the most common of which is via a computer science degree. As it doesn't sound like you have enough CS background to be accepted into a PhD program, I'd suggest looking into one of the Masters programs. Many places have excellent MS programs that will let you get up-to-speed in a year or so and then be ready for more serious research.

This was very encouraging, but it left me with some follow-up questions, namely:

* Would a CS degree be the most advantageous route, even if it is the most common? One concern I came across is that CS may leave one less prepared in terms of hardware, embedded systems, and interface between humans and technology. A suggestion was to focus on CE instead, and tailor the program toward CS if that interests somebody.

* Would the Master's programs mentioned be a type of accelerated program? I wasn't aware of their existence for someone without a B.S. in a related field, but that may just be because I'm an outsider.

* Along the same vein, does such a Master's program exist for other fields (e.g., CE or EE), or is it exclusive to CS?

I've given this a lot of thought and would like to start taking the necessary steps. I hoped that I could pique the minds of people actively working/studying in the field, so I would appreciate any information. Thank you in advance!

Smart?,yokoonoshedidnt,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/51xwnr/putting_college_on_hold_and_accepting_a_full_time/,"Hi all, I'm currently a college freshman working an internship to save a little money and build experience. I've been blessed with the opportunity to potentially land a full time position with great benefits and great pay at 19 doing mobile app development. The phone interview is scheduled for Monday and while I'm very excited for this opportunity the voice in the back of my head keeps telling me that I shouldn't take it and I should focus on my studies. I've always had it drilled in my head that if I don't go to college then I will never get a full time position and I will end up ""working at McDonald's my whole life"". This opportunity proves that what I've been told is a lie. Hell, at the internship I'm in now there are senior managers who have worked here for 15 years and don't have a degree. I'm hoping that with the knowledge that I have developed apps since I was 14 (5 years of app development experience) and the fact that I've worked with clients to build apps for them will trump the fact that I don't have a degree yet. I talked with someone about it and asked for his advice on whether having a degree is more important than work experience, and he said that in most cases experience is more important, especially in software where most employees teach themselves. The job description states ""Bachelor’s Degree in CS, Engineering, or IS or any equivalent combination of experience, education, and/or training in the computer systems development field"", so I'm going to say that I should be fine without a degree, but I'm not entirely sure.

What I'm thinking is that with this opportunity I can save up money over the course of one to a couple of years, pay college out of pocket and never rack up student loans, and with the health insurance coverage I can go to a psychiatrist and figure out whether I have ADHD or anxiety or whatever since I've never been to one. My parents are the type to let pride overrule my fear of having something mentally wrong with me, e.g. ""You don't have a disease, you're better than that!"" or ""Don't ever say you have something mental going on with you, you're not that type of person!"" as if mental illness only affects people ""beneath"" them. But I know that there's something wrong with me mentally and I have to address it on my own. And then finally the biggest reason is that my situation at home is very toxic and I have to move out. Having a boyfriend while living with homophobic parents is not good, believe me.

Honestly I think that this is too good of an opportunity to pass up, especially for a 19 year old. My parents want me to live with them and focus on getting my degree, but I would rather have it so that I can say that I've worked at big companies building brilliant apps while getting a degree as opposed to showing them a sheet of paper that basically says ""I graduated."" But I'm having second thoughts about it. What do you think? Do you have a good paying job and you didn't get a degree?"

(ugh stupid comma on the title, can't change that now)

I had an amazing internship this summer with a medium-sized company. They're the dominant company filling their niche currently, and they recently upgraded from startup status due to their success and just went international. My job was in ASP .NET with MVC, and I worked mostly backend with data and data services. Web dev is not something that I see myself in as an ultimate goal, but the culture was awesome, the team was amazing, and the company is really great.

Anyways at the end of the summer they gave me a full-time offer and if I accepted I would start once I'm done with school in April. It's 70,000 USD/yr (in Midwest dollars). I'm torn because while it's an awesome opportunity, I still feel like I want to shoot for the stars.
Favorite-big4-company visits my campus annually. I've met their recruiter for our area several times and he's pretty great. Anyway last time they visited he did an exclusive Q&amp;A with an org that I help run. Only the leaders showed up, so he told us that he had been personally instructed to reach out to us specifically and iirc he said they ""badly"" want the 4 of us work for them.

So, that's encouraging. Except for the fact that he hasn't even seen me code.

This summer has also been a study-up-for-interviews attempt because another recruiter contacted me, I sent transcript, they called me &amp; wanted to start interviewing, I didn't feel ready, I said call me back at the end of summer, and thus began the summer of studying (CTCI, MIT OCW, etc). Well, half-assed studying.

I don't feel ready at all, and also I won't have my algo class until spring. I know that information won't make them go ""easy"" on me. I'm the kind of person that wants to shoot for the stars but then either tends to disappoint themselves by not making it or back out because they feel inadequate. I want to shoot for favorite-big4-co but part of me says why even try if I don't think I'll make it?

Relevant subquestions: is it easier to get into competitive companies as a new grad or as an experienced dev? Should I not take the offer if it means I would get pigeonholed into web dev forever?

Relevant details: 3.76 gpa in major, multiple TA jobs, leader in multiple CS orgs, CS education volunteerism, 2 web dev internships so far"
51y15x,2,2016-09-09,Did I just shoot myself in the foot without realizing it? First offers out of school.,default_dev,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/51y15x/did_i_just_shoot_myself_in_the_foot_without/,"This is the story of my first offer, followed by a couple questions!

I graduated in the fall semester of 2015 from a Massachusetts state school with a BSCS, 3.0 GPA, no internships, some significant projects (mostly small). Since then I've been applying for between 30 and 40 hours a week to many companies, big and small. 

Since the start of 2016, I've had a total of 4 calls from HR departments doing the initial screening. From that, 3 on-site interviews. 2 of those interviews turned into offers (both within the last two weeks). Both offers seemed to be ecstatic to have found a candidate like me after the interviews. I received calls with offers literally within hours of both interviews, and it was obvious that they had other candidates they were interviewing. This was a HUGE confidence boost, but I could be reading it wrong.

The first offer was the higher salary (51k non-negotiable), but a total PITA of a commute to the south shore (~50min without any traffic, ~120+ with traffic), and also would be a dead end, using proprietary languages and gaining minimal skills that would apply elsewhere.

The second offer was 4k less than the first (non-negotiable), but a MUCH better commute on the north shore (~20 minute reverse commute, never any substantial traffic), with a broader net of skills that would be a real career builder.

The latter seems like the no-brainer to me. The office life seemed better, the team I'm going to be working on is developing a new technology for the company that basically all of their products will be based on in the future, the supervisor is MUCH more human (also a girl like me so we sort of ""clicked"" in the interview), etc. 

I am truly excited for this opportunity, and happy that I accepted, but there is this looming feeling that I can't shake that tells me that I just accepted a terrible offer, remuneration-wise. I know the whole selection-bias schpiel about the people here who post their newgrad 125k+ salary offers from ridiculous companies, having just graduated ridiculous schools with ridiculous GPAs (good for you, I'm happy for you, but I'm simply in no way comparable to you). But still, under 50k in MA? This is higher salary than anything I've ever received payment for, but this seems very low to me, though I don't have anything to compare it to besides the first offer I mentioned, which just barely broke the 50k line. The silver lining to me is that I'll be using over 5 languages that are mostly all very highly sought for in the software industry. They are mostly languages I've never used before and I made very sure to state that clearly, so I'm excited to be learning these new skills that can be put on a resume for the future. I understand that this company also promotes from within, so this seems like it could be a great investment in my future, just not the best compensation for the time being.

Am I crazy to be expecting higher pay? My dreams of getting a full inbox of offers right out of school was crushed when I realized that I wasn't exactly the ideal candidate, so that's not what I'm expecting here, but I certainly was hoping to have higher offers than this. Is there hope that my pay will increase in the future, whether by being promoted or by switching to new companies? Or did I shoot myself in the foot by basically advertising to future employers that I will accept low offers (I believe they ask for previous salaries when they do background checks, correct?)?"
51y5dw,8,2016-09-09,Am I [23 M] stupid for being in a relationship with this long time friend [23 F]? We just started and I'm really confused,throw9s16,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/51y5dw/am_i_23_m_stupid_for_being_in_a_relationship_with/,"Hi everyone. So I started a relationship with a long time friend just a few weeks ago and I'm having trouble dealing with some issues that I didn't expect to have. 

I met this girl a few years back at a party (she was dating a friend of mine) and turns out she studied in the same college campus as me. We became very good friends and we start trusting each other a lot. When she broke up with this guy (he cheated on her) we kissed, but at the time I was seeing some other girl and I felt guilty, although I liked it. 

A year passed and we slept together but I was just out of a relationship so nothing more happened (although she implied that she wanted to be with me). Anyway, she started two troubling relationships (one with her boss and one with some married guy). At the time we were just friend so she told me all about it and I could tell she was suffering deeply for these guys. I gave her my honest advice.

Anyway, another year or so passed and we start going out again, things happening (no sex, though, she told me she wanted to wait) and things are kinda going to a serious relationship (she told me that we would make a good couple and we started sharing a lot of things). 

However, we were chosen for an internship (more like a professional practice my college does) to some other state. We were really excited but we decided to leave the serious relationship thing until we were sure so we don't screw our 4 month stay there.

Someday out of nowhere she stop talking to me so I confront her and turns out she met a guy and she's really excited about it. I was kinda angry, not because of the guy, but because she stopped talking to me out of the blue (we were friends atm). Anyway, we worked it out, go to the internship and she's being really faithful to this guy all the way, until some day at a party she slept with a random guy.

I was pretty devastated tbh, specially because she was distant towards me (which I supposed was because of the guy she met before the internship) and that happened with a random guy. Anyway, I didn't got mad at her or anything, but I was hurt and she noticed it. We talked some days later and stuff started happening again. Some time later she told me that she wanted to be in a serious relationship with me, which I declined because I wasn't trusting her 100%. 

She told me that she was going to prove herself to me. She did (although I told her not to) by doing a lot of things (I can give details but this story is starting to get big). So, a few weeks ago we started officially having a serious relationship. The thing is, she's being really into it, I can't complain really. She tells me that she loves me, that she always wanted to be with me, that she's 100% committed and that she understands that she hurt me so she's making an effort to make things right. 

I love her too, but I can't help but feel played. The other day I kinda snooped in her cellphone and found a convo with the guy she was dating before the internship. Nothing bad, really, just a text that said ""sorry for all the drama, I'm going to remember you"" and some things about school and books. Nevertheless I got super jealous (I'm not usually like that) but didn't say anything. 

Sometimes I get annoyed by stupid things, like comments about good looking guys, or movies, or a comment about her ex, or things like she doesn't texts me, whatever. I'm usually really secure, but with this girl I feel lost. I really want to be with her, she's my best friend, but the past is messing with me and I know it's unfair but I can't help it. What should I do? What's your opinion? Can I trust this girl, is she playing with me? Should I care that much about the past?
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I started a relationship with one of my best friends, although she's trying to make things work I can't help but feel played."

I live in Canada and am a little flexible with cost. I would rather have something that lasts then buy something cheap and replace it in a year. max like $1,200?

* **Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications to your requirements for the money? Pick or include any that apply.** 
 I have zero need for a 2 in 1. I don’t really like the idea of a touch screen (I have an iPad). 
I am in gradschool, so a good battery life is very important to me. As is easy typing ( I write/excel a lot). I am looking for something pretty. As much as I hate to admit it, I am a big aesthetics gal. 

* **How important is weight to you?**
Very. I lug my laptop around school/work everyday. I will most likely be lugging it around in my internship and career (PR). So something small/thin is ideal. 

* **Which OS do you require? Windows, Linux, Mac.**
 I am very much in a Windows/Mac debate. My old personal computer was a mac . It survived 6 years, 4 moves and a lot of carelessness.. but I am willing to convert. 

I used to have a work computer with windows 10 a while ago and found it frustrating but maybe the kinks are worked out?

* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 
 Not really. 

* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run. If you have no requirements, put N/A.** 
 I do use adobe suite sometimes and have to meticulously format documents for school/work and sometime shave to edit video/crop pictures.  but I’m not a gamer or CAD operator  

* **If you're gaming (leave blank if you put N/A above...), do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** 
 

* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable business grade build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** 
GREAT keyboard! Asthetics? Battery life. Ummm.. easy to navigate? Quick start up?

* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**

2.) Which programming language is worth investing time to learn to make myself more marketable to employers?
3.) What are some of the best online resources to help me learn along the way?

51yid2,11,2016-09-09,What are my options? I'm 22 and by the looks of it I will get my B.S. at 28 if I'm lucky.,Nuclearpolitics,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/51yid2/what_are_my_options_im_22_and_by_the_looks_of_it/,"I came to the U.S. when I was 16, had to wait a year, then took a placement exam that allowed me to go directly to a community college skipping high school. 

In college, I had to take a bunch of ridiculous general education classes to be eligible to transfer. I initially wanted to go into the medical field, but I realized I enjoy Math and CS way more. 
Then, a year ago, I got an internship at an industrial automation company in LA, as a ""software intern,"" and officially made the switch to Computer Science. I lost a good two years or so because of this switch. 

Currently I'm 22 and preparing to transfer next Fall to a UC campus. I have a near 4.0 GPA, the recommendation of most of my professors and supervisors at work but I'd never actually looked at the curriculum for B.S. in Computer Science. I never looked at it because it seemed like a distant dream, and after I looked at it today I have only confirmed by doubts. 

I still have to take about 34 courses, which add up to a minimum of 4.5 years. That means if I transfer next Fall at the age of 23, I will graduate when I'm almost 28 (assuming no delays).

When I initially came to the U.S. I had no idea how the educational system worked and thought community college was a mandatory in-between step. Did I have to take those general education classes only because I didn't go to high school in the US? I feel like a prisoner who's been locked up for most of his prime years. My college counselors keep reassuring me that I'm on the right track but I don't really trust their judgement.

But no crying over spilled milk. What are my options now to finish this up as quickly as I can? If I go to a less ambitious university, will the curriculum be shorter? I can always do my masters somewhere else (assuming by the time I'm 28 I don't get sick of living a student's life). Are there accelerated online pathways? I really don't want to spend all of my early twenties studying, and gearing up for some desk job maintaining someone else's code. 

I'm so lost.

I need some advice. So, part of my masters in CS included an internship. I enjoyed the work and, after it was over, the company offered me a good job. I'd already finished all my course work so I accepted the job figuring I could write my thesis (based on the work I did for the company) on evenings and weekends. The problem is, I've been working for the last six months or so and have made zero progress on my thesis. Between working extra hours at the office to make a good impression and just being too exhausted when I get home to fire up the word processor, I simply haven't managed to make it past word one. Now my thesis supervisor is asking me whether I'm planning on finishing or not and I don't know what to tell him.

On the one hand, I have a hard time leaving things unfinished when I've invested time and money in them. On the other hand, I'm not sure if finishing will actually have any impact on my career at this point and, in the meantime, having it hanging over my head has negatively affected my quality of life. I think at this point I have to choose whether to quit the program and focus on my career or quit my job, finish the thesis, and start the job hunt over again.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated!"

Ever since I was 13 and went to a presentation given by an ER physician, I knew I wanted to be a doctor. When I went to high school, however, I did a 4 year computer science program (to look good for colleges). Through this program, I took 4 years of programming, and I did an internship in IT. I was one of two girls in my programming classes, yet I always received the highest test grades and would help everyone in my class out with programming. It was something I truly excelled at. However, I did not have a good time at the internship because I basically did nothing and even the people who worked there did nothing. I do not like being idle so I completely wrote off computer science as a field for myself. Throughout high school, I additionally did many extracurriculars in the medical and more broadly, biological fields and enjoyed it a lot more than my computer science internship. So I finalized my decision to be pre-med, and additionally I decided that being a biology major would be the right choice for me. I have been volunteering at a hospital and working at a lab for months now and love both of these things so much (they are literally the best parts of my week). I took genetics, molecular biology, and cell biology my freshman year (core classes for the Bio major) and really found the content interesting. So basically all of freshman year I felt content with where I was and thought I was making the right decision as to what to study and what to do after graduation. Now I am a sophomore and decided to take a computer science elective (mostly about how computers impact society; not really hard computer science). I realize that I miss studying computer science/programming soo much. Like it literally hurts when I see all the comp sci majors around me coding and working on projects. I am starting to regret ending my studies in computer science so early on. I don't know what to do because if I pick up a different major/double major I won't graduate early and I will have to pay for my last year of college myself (my dad flat out told me he can't afford it) and I really wanted to have a gap year before medical school. I just feel so confused about the choices I've made these past few years and any advice would be appreciated!

EDIT: It's also worth mentioning that another reason why I decided not to do a computer science major was because I am not great at math. Pre-Calculus, AP Calculus AB and BC were the only classes I made B's in during high school. "

School has started up again. Upside; my neighborhood delinquents have to spend their days locked inside a brick institution learning whatever it is kids learn these days. Downside; the museum is swarming with school trips at least three days a week. There’s upwards of five to six hundred public elementary schools in the city alone. Ages 6-9. Maybe. Then add onto that the middle schools and high schools and private schools. And all the of those from the counties just north of the city that send their kids down for a day too. That’s if each class that wants to come down gets the budget. 
All of that so that we can instill a sense of humanity pride into them. At least that’s what some of the teachers I’ve met have said. Most do it for the educational reasons. 

Kristoph kept the schedule tight and actually put effort into this aspect of his job. So, while classes of youngins tramped around in the upper floors, I stayed quite content in my little archive room. Unless a CUNY class or other University class was coming to look at something rarer, I had no intention of stepping foot out of the archive room between the hours of twelve and four. 

“Not going out for lunch today?” Today’s lunchtime intern asked me.

“School trips effectively ruin my appetite for most of the year,” I said, resting my forehead against the edge of my desk. “I hate seeing kids disrespecting history. As most of them do ‘cause they’re too young to really understand it, or they just don’t care. Besides that, I’ve got some more artifacts that the IFU wanted to take a look at.”

“That can wait,” Kristoph’s voice said from the entrance. For once there was no one hanging off of his arm and ogling at the massive size of the room. 

“Where’s your miner?” I sat up. 

“Out shopping,” he answered. “Get up,  you’re needed upstairs.”

“Last time you said that I ended up almost kicking an eight year old out of the museum for trying to take one of the display items home for show and tell.”

“I’m not about to ask the intern to give a tour of the museum.” Offhandedly he added a “no-offense” to that statement, not bothering to give them a glance. 

“I don’t do tours. Not unless they’re adults.”

“Lucky for you these are miniature adults.”

“High-schoolers are still technically children in the eyes of the law.”

“Think smaller.”

“I will kill a middle schooler. They’re all brats.”

“I’m paying you extra. Plus overtime for your troubles.”

*Damn him and my need for funds.* I stood and straightened out my dress. “Is there a reason you can’t have a tour guide give the tour? Don’t we have ten on hand, like, everyday?”

“Tourism, Calla, tourism. Additionally, three of them called in sick and the other three are currently out giving tours. As you can see, we’re short handed.”

“I already said I’d do it. Do you not see me standing?”

“Good.” His smile was blinding, with his freaking clinically treated white teeth. “You’ll be meeting them at one thirty.”

The door closed behind him at twelve-forty-five

I kicked my chair into place. “Guess I better go review. Don’t lend anything out while I’m gone unless they’ve already got the prep-approval.”

The intern gave me a pained smile. “Yes ma’am.”

There had to be at least fifty kids staring up at me. A group of about one-hundred had walked in at half past one on the dot, and got divided up between myself and another guide. One of the teachers dropped off a box full of cellphones at the front desk in order to make the children pay attention. I don’t blame them for not caring about the shitty, half-hearted introduction the main teacher was giving me right now. It’s not like they got an advanced notice that their tour guide had changed. The other tour guide told me to start on the bottom floor and work my way up. He’d be starting five minutes before us so that the rooms didn’t get too crowded. 

As I watched the last of the other group disappear down into the neolithic and Sumerian room, I clapped to gather the attention of the students in front of me. “Alright, hello everyone, I hope you’re having a good day.” No response. “Well, as your teacher said, my name’s Calla Burnhart, you can call me Calla. I’m the head archivist here in the Museum of Human History. Normally I’m down in the basement working with the artifacts that we don’t currently have on display,” some of the students and one of the teachers perked up at this, “but unfortunately we won’t be going down there today.”

My watch told me that only two minutes had passed. *Damn, how do they do this. Questions, ask them a question.*

“So, who can tell me what the oldest known civilization is?”

A two hands raised and I picked the one closest. “Mesopotamian?”

“Close, that’s actually a pretty good guess. The Sumerian civilization was based in the Mesopotamian region, but Mesopotamia itself is not a civilization. However, before all that, I’m certain you guys have heard of neanderthals.” Five minutes passed and I was good the lead them into the early history floor. The stairs leading down weren’t as crowded as they had been during the summer and I was thankful for that. The more studious children stayed up front and payed attention to every word that fell out of my mouth. The others who stayed towards the back took the time in each room that I allowed them to look around to prank each other and make ridiculous dares instead of reading and learning. I hoped I wasn’t making a fool of myself, but by the time we got to the fourth floor (American Civilizations and Modern history) I felt more annoyed than stressed. The younger history teacher had straightened himself out and was trying to keep the children in line the entire tour. The older teacher just laughed and told him to give up. 

---

Let me reiterate just how annoying I find unbehaved, loud mouthed, incessant, children. Particularly of the adult variety. 
The trip was ending in the gift shop, so that the kids could buy something either for themselves or someone else. I was going to leave them there, but the history teacher cornered me by the rack of mugs and keychains asking questions about getting in to see the archives. 

“You’d have to call in to schedule an appointment,” I answered, absentmindedly turning the mugs so that they all faced the same direction. “The front desk has all the information you’ll need in order to do that-”

“Calla, there you are!” Niex’s voice boomed through the gift shop. Heads turned at the disturbance, but quickly went back to their browsing of items.  The owner of the museum and a security guard were trailing after him, albeit casually. 

“So I’d stop by there before you leave. There’ll be a fee and some paperwork if you want to take an item out, but if it’s just to look there shouldn’t be a problem.” I pulled a business card out of my wallet and handed it to him. “Here, if you have any questions about anything and you’re not able to come in, I’d be happy to help.”

“Calla, do you know this man?” Kristoph demanded from halfway across the store. 

The teacher looked conflicted. I smiled, “Please don’t hesitate to contact me. It’s my job to help.”

“Calla, don’t ignore me,” Niex whined, hand on my shoulder. The teacher backed away.  

“Excuse me. Hope you have a good rest of the day.” I whipped around and slammed the side of my hand into Niex’s side. He, a grown ass man, pouted and rubbed the point of impact. 

“What was that for?” 

Kristoph gave him a glare, “Do you know this man? He’s been causing disruptions since the moment he stepped into the building. Tried to take one of the sarcophagi from the Egyptian exhibit.”

“You’re just upset because I stole that chick you were flirting with,” Niex grinned. I felt my shoulders tense up and my mouth drop at the words coming from both of them. 

*Deep. Breaths*

“Anywho, who’s that guy you were talking with? Seemed like a scrawny type,” Niex continued on. 

Kristop raised an eyebrow, “Calla? Having a social life? Unimaginable.”

“Office. Now.” I snapped, pushing the two of them towards the door. The guard followed us, resigned to his fate. Siet came around the corner just then, took one glance at the situation and fell in step next to the guard. I slammed the service elevator button about ten times before resorting to tapping against my thigh. 

“Care to tell me exactly why the two of you had to come find me for this situation?” I asked, stepping into the opening doors.

“I wanted to.” They answered.

“I want you to know that I hate the both of you.”

“How on earth will I survive,” Kristoph deadpanned. 

“Don’t say that,” Niex smirked. “You’ll-”

“You lack a heart,” I interrupted. “What do you two idiots want anyway?”

“I was bored.” “He said he knew you.”

They glared at each other. “You’re annoying.”

“You’re both a pain in my ass, congratulations.” 

Niex shrugged and leaned against the back of the elevator.

“If it’s any consolation, the crew ordered Chinese food and it’s in the conference room,” Kristoph said. 

The doors opened at B2 and instead of taking the stairs down to the archive room I led the way to the conference room. Some of the researchers working looked up from their work as we moved along. The electronic lock beeped at my ID and the door clicked open. 

Kristoph and Niex took opposing ends of the table, Siet took the corner next to Niex and pulled out a tablet to do work with, and the guard stayed outside. I opened up the bag of Chinese food and snagged a fortune cookie. Kristoph and Niex continued to glare at each other while I snapped open the cookie and let half of it dissolve in my mouth. 

“What’s your fortune?” Kristoph asked, breaking from the staring contest to watch me tap against the table. 

I picked up the blue and white slip. *Don’t take yourself seriously, no one else does. Learn Chinese: Cucumber = Huang Gua. Lucky #s: 32-29-50-44-18-10* “Stupid.”

“Anway, Calla, you still haven’t answered who this man is?” Kristoph pressed. 

“Better question, who’s the person that was in the shop with you?”  

*...Idiots, the both of them.* “You two have fun,” I smiled, standing up and taking the container of sweet and sour chicken. “I have an actual job I need to get back to.”

I slammed the door shut behind me and locked it from the outside. The security guard gave me a questioning glance. “If you hear any shouting, ignore it. It’s an important business meeting. They just don’t get along.”

He nodded as I walked away. *If they don’t kill each other in the next thirty minutes I’m sure they’ll be best friends…. Oh dear god don’t let them become friends.*

---

Never have I ever: wanted to kill someone as much as I do right now. The two morons who I left in the museum at five-thirty were now sitting in the far corner sharing a drink with a diligent guard dog on either side of them. A group of about five college girls walked in behind me screaming “FUCKED UP FRIDAAAAY!” They reeked.

I snuck over to the booth that contained George, my best friend (Ash: Short for Ashley), and a “stand up guy” the George knew from college. It was a botched attempt at a double date by four singles. 

“Calla, you’re late!” Ashley shouted, pulling me into our side of the booth. 

I slapped my hand over her mouth and hissed out, “Quiet.” A peek over at the table on the other side showed that neither man had figured out I was here.

“What’s got you all tensed up?” George asked. He passed a cider to me, “We saved you one.”

“Thanks,” I said. “And my boss and housemate are in the bar.”

Ashley’s face lit up, “Whaaat! No way! You mean that guy that took you home last time? Oh. My. Gawd. You should’ve seen her Tim, she was sooooo fucking drunk.”

“How many fucking drinks have you had already?” I asked, pinching her arm. 

“Like, only five.”

George and Tim laughed. 

“Anyway, my boss is Kirstoph Caper and my housemate is also a fucking prick, so I don’t really want to encounter either of them right now.”

Ashley laughed, “You never even say his name. Didn’t you lock the two of them in a room together today?”

I glared. “Yeah. That worked out sooo well, clearly.”

“What did you expect? Two guys like them are bound to get along,” George answered. 

“I was hoping they’d kill each other,” I stated.

Tim, who’d been looking over at their table, turned back around. “What’d you say your housemate’s name was? I feel like I’ve seen him before.”

*What? I’m pretty sure his human form hasn’t been put up on the search list.* “Jonathan Vicariot. Why?”

Tim’s eyebrows raised and he looked back over. Niex was laughing and shoving more alcohol towards Kristoph. There were about twelve shot glasses turned upside down on their table. 

“Real piece of work that guy,” George glared. “I can’t believe he showed up at your work. Didn’t you tell him not to?”

“I didn’t even tell him where I work. I honestly think he came in to buy something and just saw me. I had to do a tour today, I hate children.”

Ashley let out a little giggle and leaned against me. “Re-remember when you wanted a kid? What the hell happened to that?”

“I grew up,” I pushed her so that she was leaning against the wall. A waitress came up to us and I ordered nothing but appetizers. 

“I’m here to drink and be merry,” I said once the waitress was gone. “No one take advantage of me.”

Tim told us more about himself. He worked as an accountant for a shipping company that had started in on extraterrestrial mail once the borders opened ten years ago. He’d seen Niex in their building last week, but hadn’t actually talked to him. Ashley, who’d been invested in the whole traveling to space and the like, asked him all sorts of questions. George put in complaints with me about our jobs. The embassy was apparently getting nowhere, and the earth ambassador and George’s boss had been spending the past couple of days arguing with Drien Shon on getting the FBI or some other criminal investigative services involved with the search. I offered my agreement and apologies on just about everything. 

“From the man over there,” the waitress said, placing a shot of Demon’s Blood in front of me with a note. I looked over to where she had addressed, to see Niex raising his own shot to me. Kristoph was trying to keep his head straight. I glared and looked at the note. 

*Might as well take it, I’ll drive you home.*

“The hell you will!” I shouted, crumpling the note and throwing it away. Stupid pride. I down the shot against the protest of George who recognized it. 

It wasn’t as horrible as the first time I had it. Still fruity and delicious, but it didn’t hit me as hard. I didn’t pass out in five minutes, but god damn I couldn’t remember half of what happened after I took it. Kristoph’s guard led him out of the bar at some point, and Tim followed shortly after that. Ashley and George tried to feed me water, but Niex and Siet came up and sat with us, trying to coerce me into taking the ride home.

“You know you won’t be sober enough to drive home, despite the train ride,” Niex said and drunk-me didn’t want to acknowledge the logic in it. 

“I’m not letting you drive me home,” I said, trying to stand. 

Ashley, who had sobered up, caught me and sighed. “Jeeze, you’re stubborn.”

George offered up his couch for me. Niex shut him down. Ashley tried as well.

“Why don’t you just take the train with her?” Siet finally offered. “You’re also intoxicated beyond your normal means, so you shouldn’t even drive. I’ll park your car overnight and which ever one of you sobers up faster can drive her car back to the house.”

Niex thought about it, even though I was absolutely ready to deny it. George and Ashley agreed, seeing it as a decent enough plan, though saying that if I really didn’t want to, I should just go to George’s apartment. I was adamant about taking that plan. 

“You know,” Niex started, “Scotty’s been alone all day. He looked so sad when you left this morning.”

My teeth hurt. “Ugh, fine. I’ll bear with it.” 

“Good. Let’s go before it’s too late.”

Thankfully, there was subway entrance on the street corner and while I wasn’t all too keen to sit across from other drunks and some other sketchy looking figures, Niex almost bit some guys hand off when he tried to pick-pocket him. The metro-north train was quieter. Two other people got into the car with us, and both had a computer on in front of them. Niex wanted to switch cars. 

“They’re not going to kill us,” I snapped, resting my head against the window. The glass fogged up with my breath. 

“You don’t know that,” he replied, cracking his knuckles. 

“Just let it go.” I closed my eyes. “If you really want to move, then leave me here. I don’t know anyone who’d want me dead anyway.”

“Just go to sleep,” Niex said. I opened one eye and saw him on his phone, mouth turned down. 

“Mm. Don’t abandon me.” I said, turning in the seat so that I wouldn’t get a sore neck. “Or I’ll kick you out.”

He laughed softly and the train jerked forward.

My fwb understands and has tried to explain the situation to them, but our friends are still blaming me. (long)",throwaway123213222,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/51zm7v/my_22_m_friends_think_i_am_evil_because_i_wont/,"Both my fwb Maggie and I are 22 year old college students. I want to emphasize that Maggie is NOT the bad guy in this situation and she has stood up for me against our friends throughout this entire process. Maggie has given me her permission to post this on Reddit and she will also be reading your comments with me.

Maggie and I have been close friends since middle school and we both ended up attending the same uni and living in the same dorm building throughout college. Maggie primarily dates other women, but she and I have occasionally hooked up over the years, hence why I refer to her as 'FWB' in the title of this post. 

Over the summer break, Maggie and I hooked up several times. We always use condoms + the pill, but Maggie took a round of antibiotics for an infection and as luck would have it, she is now about 9 weeks pregnant. She went to the Planned Parenthood and got a pregnancy test that confirms the pregnancy, plus she went ahead and scheduled herself for an abortion. Unfortunately, the PP did not have any open appointments until the next month and by that time she will be too far along for the cheaper medical abortion. She is scheduled for a surgical abortion on Monday, but the cost is $600 instead of $350. The PP was able to get her some financial help for the abortion cost, but we still owe $400 by the date of the appointment.

Since Maggie and I are both full time students in the same demanding major, we both only work part time at about 15 hours per week each. We are both interns working in the same lab and it is not feasible for either of us to increase our hours due to the way the internship funding works. After paying my bills for the month, I had a little over $170 in the bank and I gave it all to Maggie to help pay for the abortion. We won't get paid again until next Friday (her appointment is on Monday), which means that we are both about $70 short of the funds to cover the abortion costs.

Maggie decided that since we get paid only a few days after her appointment, that she could ask her best friend Sarah for the $70 and then pay Sarah back as soon as our paychecks came in. She asked Sarah if she could borrow some money, but did not mention exactly what the money was for at first. Sarah refused to loan Maggie the money without knowing the reason why and eventually Maggie told her that she was short the $70 she needed to get the abortion. Sarah freaked out on her, demanding to know who the dad was and why he wasn't helping her pay for the abortion. Maggie told Sarah to calm down, told Sarah that the dad was me and that I had already given her (Maggie) all the money I had until payday. Sarah gave Maggie the $70, but then mentioned something about how I had to pay her back instead of Maggie, Maggie thanked her and left.

The problem is, now our friend group is shunning me and essentially trashing my name because Sarah ran her mouth about lending Maggie the money for the abortion. Maggie spoke to Sarah on Wednesday and by dinner on Thursday (yesterday) all of our friends knew about the situation. We normally sit at a large table during dinner and lunch in the student cafeteria and when I tried to sit with them for dinner, they all turned away from me and fell silent. I asked them what was wrong, and our friend Laura told me that if I weren't willing to support Maggie and her choice, that I shouldn't hang out with the group anymore. I was confused and asked them to explain, but Laura told me that I knew exactly what they were talking about. At this point, Maggie had gotten her food and sat down as well. She was confused by the tense atmosphere and asked what was going on. Laura asked her if she was okay and then said that the group supported her even if I didn't. Maggie was confused and said that I was in complete support and that she didn't understand why everyone was acting so cold towards me.

Turns out, Sarah had told everyone that I wasn't supporting Maggie and that I had refused to pay for the abortion myself. Sarah told them that Maggie had to beg her for the money because I wasn't willing to help her pay for the abortion. Maggie told them that Sarah was lying, that I had paid for practically half the costs already and that I was the one who helped drive her to the PP in the first place. Laura countered that 'practically half' wasn't good enough and that a real man should have paid for it all himself. Maggie told Laura that she needed to stay out of her business, because her interpretation of the situation was not correct and because she didn't care for how Laura felt the need to talk behind her back with Sarah about her personal life.

At this point, things were getting nasty so I told Maggie that I was leaving for class. Maggie gave me a hug and said she would set them straight, then I left along with two of our friends. These two friends are on Maggie and I's side and think it's disgusting how everyone else is sticking their nose in our private affairs. While we were gone, Maggie told Sarah off and gave her back the $70 she had borrowed, saying that she didn't need money from someone who isn't supportive of her. Our two friends have already promised to help us out with the $70.

Now, both Maggie and I agree that we need to drop a lot of these people as friends, but it isn't so simple. Our college has less than 1300 students and everyone knows each other on campus. I can't avoid a lot of these people, as we have class together and often have to work together on projects. In addition, Sarah and Laura have made multiple posts on facebook (after blocking me and Maggie) saying that I am a terrible person, a misogynist, etc (mentioning my full name) and basically writing out that Maggie is having an abortion for the whole world to see. 

We do not know how to proceed tactfully from this point on, which is why we are asking on Reddit. How should we handle this from here on out to minimize the damage? I want to report both Sarah and Laura to the school, but Maggie is worried that we wouldn't be taking it far enough. What do you all think?

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Accidentally got my fwb pregnant, she scheduled an abortion. I gave her all the money I have until payday, but it isn't enough to cover the full cost. Fwb asked her best friend to lend her the last $70 until payday, fwb told our entire friend group that I am a misogynist who was trying to stop fwb from having the abortion. Fwb told our friends that best friend was lying and that I have been 100% supportive, now they are posting on facebook about us using our full names. We have class with these people and our college is tiny and now pretty much everyone knows what is happening. I want to report our friends to the school, but fwb thinks we need to escalate this further. How should we handle this tactfully?"
51zo41,15,2016-09-09,I have just been fired,crawder,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/51zo41/i_have_just_been_fired/,"So... this is it. Boss came to my desk and said we needed to talk (it was her last day) and went straight to the point. Even though I kinda expected someone would get fired, it was really shocking that it was me. I'm an intern and around here, it's very rare for interns to get fired. I don't want to make it personal, but it's so hard not to think about it this way. There's the fact that my boss really hated me since day one and barely helped with my difficulties, and every time I asked for a feedback on my conduct, she'd be completely evasive. She also treated every one on my division very well, but me very differently, and I could never understood why. She's not a good person and I could tell it by the fact that absolutely nobody liked her. I've got a lot of support from my amazing co-workers, and it's very sad not to see them anymore on a daily basis.
Of course I had my failures, lots of them, but I sincerely don't think those justify a dismissal, especially when lots of people did way worse to her and nothing happened.
Well, guess this is it. I'm not here for comments like ""yeah, she's disgusting and you are right"", I just needed to get it off my chest.
Thank you :)"

Our hometown has a University of California campus and a community college. 

For fall, she enrolled in 3 classes at the community college and in 1 at the university as a non-degree student. Then she found an internship at the university which turned out to be a great opportunity programming for virtual reality. The university also has a guaranteed admission program for community college transfers, so if she files some forms in fall 2017 she's guaranteed admission for fall 2018.

Going to a new job that i barely know anything about or going back to a job where i spent almost 4 years of my life. Please give me some advice.

Old job. Pros:

- part time, only 5 hours per day, i can spend a lot of time on side projects like remote internship in a journal that i have right now, there are a lot of other good things that i can do with free time to develop my intellectual and social skills

- old boss promised me to help a build a portfolio for me that might help me to help for a better job in future, but i cant be sure that he is capable of that

- certainty that i wont be fired

- almost no stress

- 8-9 hours of sleep every night

- good location, i can get to the office in 50 minutes



Old job, cons:

- small salary, enough to sustain my lifestyle, going out with friends, buying little things for me, but not enough for travelling or buying expensive stuff or saving anything

- no people around, working either in an empty office or with the boss that i dont like much as person, feelings of occasional annoyance, boredom and loneliness are guaranteed

- the boss takes me back only with condition that i work with them at least for 6 months, until then i wont be able to leave

New job, pros:

- novelty of unknown, its a thrill and adventure

- people around, they might be good or bad, but there is a chance to make new friends

- better salary after few months of working...they take me as an intern and if i would prove myself as good worker, they would give me more than at old job, but only after a few months

- good working experience, they would really teach me some skills of copywriting and social media marketing that might help me looking for a job in future

- possibility of making a career in promising company


New job, cons:

- full-time 9 hours, i would forget about sleep and side projects

- bad location, more than an hour to get there

- office building is quite gloomy, huge and empty, renovation and darkness everywhere, i am afraid it might be depressing working there

- they might fire me if i wont prove useful...after being fired at last job i feel like its a decent chance of that happening, its basically the same field of profession and this guy who offered me the job said that they fired two people already, one was alcoholic and the other showed that he was unteachable

- the job might be too hard or dull for me, i cant be sure unless i try though

5209zi,1,2016-09-09,M4F The future face of fetish fashion,xxMrJxx,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5209zi/m4f_the_future_face_of_fetish_fashion/,"The fashion world was no stranger to kink but the break out designer Mr J was the talk of London fashion week when he shocked all who attended. He sent his summer collection down the catwalk where each model’s key accessory was Mr J's cum all over their face. The line of dresses where each designed as a single piece of beautifully embroiled fabric held to the body by complex shibari.

This bold statement clearly impressed as during the year Mr J has hand tied many celebrity in his creations, before sending them down the red carpet. That said only one starlet made her way down the red carpet wearing Mr J on her face too. Mr J's success doesn’t end there either, his studio has been filled with a veritable who's who of the sexist women alive. All trying to join his harem of muses for his next adventure 

So here's where you come in, I'm starting my new venture and you have either applied to an open casting call or perhaps your already a star and requested my services. I'm happy for real or original starlets but if you do go real please give a few options. 

The Catwalk: looking for new models to show off my latest collection. Exhibitionists are required.

The Fitting: an opportunity for socialites and heiresses to be fitted for the latest must have garment.

The Cover Shoot: I'm shooting a fetish cover for a fashion magazine and am looking for a photographer who can work with me to create a shared erotic vision

The Book: I'm putting together a book of celebrities in fetish situations, the twist though is that no one is to be identified in the book so views are left guessing who's who.

The Album: I'm putting together a concept album where the music is a mix of the growls, sighs and moans of my instruments along with the hits on their skin and the lead singer being toyed with throughout recording.

The Music Video: the theme of the video is pony girl chariot racing and Roman orgy. Lots of different position to fill on this set.

The Internship: I'm in need of a new seamstress and secretary, a good place for the more innocent to start.


So please include your project, who you are, a bit about both your look and personality why you want to work with Mr J. also a warning I’m a slow writer so this will be more of a long term thing.

520skt,2,2016-09-09,Profile Review - CS Undergrad,CyberEasyFeature,MBA,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/520skt/profile_review_cs_undergrad/,"DISCLAIMER: I haven't graduated yet. Interested in hearing my chances and hopefully your advice will help me make decisions over the next few years.

**Background**

*  Work Experience: Ran my own egg business for ~10 years, starting in elementary. 2 summers as a Systems Administrator for the province's largest health care provider. 8 months internship as a software developer for a major Silicon Valley company (not quite Google, Apple,etc but very close). Hoping next summer to work as a Product Manager in California.
* Extra curriculars: 2 x Fraternity President, Order of Omega President, multi-time exec in CS club, volunteer with high school transitioning to University (program founder), semi-pro, world travelled Ukrainian dancer (~15 years)
* Undergrad school/major: University of Alberta - BSc Honors in Computing Science. Graduating December 2017.
* Race/nationality: Caucasian/Canadian
* Sex: Male

**Stats**

* GMAT Score: Planning to take over summer/last semester.
* Undergrad GPA: 3.585

**MBA Info**

* Goal of MBA: Move from technical to leadership/business side of the company
* Target Schools: US. I want to go to the best possible school that will let me in. Hopefully M7. Planning to apply to Yale Silver Scholars and Harvard 2+2. Any other similar programs?

**General Comments**

* Didn't do as well in my first year as my later years. GPA's been increasing year over year. Hoping to finish with a 3.65+ in December 2017. 
* In the process of writing a research paper that should go to publication in a major CS/IT research journal. Focus is fairly cutting edge tech with little similar research in the area.
* Quite confident I can get at least good, if not decent academic and professional references.

**Questions!**

* How do US schools look at Canadian undergrad schools? Do they see GPA differently? Canada has much less of the idea of ""top-tier schools"" and such. Still, Alberta is a fairly strong CS school, even for North America. I've also heard we do not inflate grades as much?
* I've heard internships do not count as work experience time, is that true?
* I am a Canadian, educated in Canada, but I'd like to attend a US MBA school. If I work in the US for a while, does that count as ""International Work Experience"" that so many candidates have?"

Workers Hammer No. 235
Summer 2016

MAY 31 — In the run-up to the 5 May local and Welsh and Scottish assembly elections, the left-wing leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, was subjected to a vicious smear campaign spearheaded by Labour’s right wing with the aid of the Tories and the capitalist press. Corbyn was elected as party leader last September based on talk of socialism, trade union rights and immigrant rights and is also a forthright defender of Palestinian rights. The get-Corbyn cabal, which reached all the way to Zionist New York Times columnist Roger Cohen and Israeli opposition leader Isaac Herzog, shrieked that the party under his leadership has become a haven for “leftist anti-Semites”. To hear Tory swine like Prime Minister David Cameron and then-mayor of London Boris Johnson sanctimoniously bemoaning racism in the Labour Party was truly sickening.

The right wingers of the Labour Party, successors to former prime minister Tony Blair, have been manoeuvring to oust him. Most recently they looked forward to removing him in the event of a Labour defeat in the elections. In the upshot, Labour pretty much held its own. Underlining the cynical character of the witch hunt, the “discovery” of ever more “anti-Semites” ceased even before the ballots had been counted, to be replaced by a new “scandal” that Corbyn’s Labour Party was supposedly rife with woman-haters. The latest smear was based on specious claims, quickly proven false, that many of the 35,000 signatories to a petition urging the BBC to remove Laura Kuenssberg as its political editor had made misogynist comments. Kuenssberg has consistently hounded Corbyn, seeing in him a representative of the working masses the establishment so loathes.

The supposed evidence of anti-Jewish bigotry ranged from the trivial to the stitched-up, much of it coming from the notorious right-wing bottom-feeding blogger who goes by the name “Guido Fawkes” and dating back to well before Corbyn became party leader last September. The witch hunters were joined by the successful Labour candidate for London mayor, Sadiq Khan, a Muslim who had himself been pilloried by the Tories for allegedly befriending “Muslim extremists”. Corbyn strenuously rejected charges that Labour was full of racists, but he did acquiesce to the suspension of a number of party members. Worse yet, his chief lieutenant John McDonnell volubly endorsed the crusade to hunt down “anti-Semites” in the party. Those suspended included Muslim MP Naz Shah, who was also forced to resign as McDonnell’s parliamentary private secretary, and sometime left-Labourite Ken Livingstone. These suspensions should be rescinded immediately.

Livingstone has much to answer for to the working class. As mayor of London he faithfully served the City bankers, he urged Tube workers to cross RMT picket lines and defended the role of the police in the cold-blooded execution of Brazilian electrician Jean Charles de Menezes in 2005. As a Spartacist League placard at the London May Day rally read: “Ex-Mayor Livingstone: Pro-City, Pro-Police, Anti-Union, but NOT Anti-Jewish!” A second placard read: “No Vote to Blairite Stooge Sadiq Khan!”

To his credit, Livingstone rightly stated: “If you look at what this is all about, it’s not about anti-Semitism in the Labour Party.... What this is all about is actually the struggle of the embittered old Blairite MPs to try to get rid of Jeremy Corbyn” (BBC News online, 30 April). Indeed, a spokesman for the Zionist Britain Israel Communications and Research Centre (BICOM) admitted as much when he ranted, “Save your pitch fork for Corbyn.”

As we documented in our article, “Britain: Banana monarchy” (Workers Hammer no 234, Spring 2016), since Corbyn’s election, the Tories, Blairites and the bourgeois media — especially the liberal Guardian — have waged an unrelenting class war aimed at removing him. Only days after Corbyn took over as Labour leader, the Sunday Times (20 September 2015) published a warning from an unnamed “senior serving general” that Corbyn would face a “mutiny” if he tried to act on his commitment to scrap the Trident submarine nuclear missile system or pull out of NATO. This coup threat was echoed two months later when the head of the armed forces, General Nicholas Houghton, in full military regalia, effectively declared on TV that Corbyn’s opposition to nuclear weapons made him unfit to be prime minister. Houghton was immediately backed up by Corbyn’s defence spokesman, the Blairite Maria Eagle. Barely a week has gone by without some overt attack on Corbyn by Blairite plotters. But as the outcome of the latest vendetta shows, every plot to remove him comes up against the stubborn fact that he is more popular than ever among the party membership, which has doubled in size since his campaign for party leader.

Corbyn is hardly a revolutionary; he is firmly committed to a parliamentary path to what would effectively be a new version of the old Labourite “welfare state”. Nonetheless, Corbyn’s election as Labour leader came as a nasty shock to the bourgeois establishment, and especially the right wing of the Labour Party. His campaign set in motion a process to restore the party’s historic links to its working-class base, reversing the direction the Blairites had taken towards becoming an overtly capitalist party. As we wrote in “Britain: Banana monarchy”:

“Any move that weakens the grip of the Blairites within the party is in the interests of the working class in its struggles against the capitalist class. As the Spartacist League/Britain has stated from the beginning, we have a side in the class war raging in the Labour Party. Against the right-wing attempts to oust him, we say: Defend Jeremy Corbyn’s right to run the Labour Party, and in his way!”

Zionism: no friend of the Jewish people

August Bebel, a central leader of the pre-World War I German Social Democracy, pithily described anti-Jewish bigotry, which whipped up populist venom by singling out “Jewish bankers”, as the “socialism of fools”. But those who today promiscuously toss around unfounded accusations of anti-Semitism are sinister enemies of all who solidarise with the Palestinian people and of the left and workers movement as a whole. The campaign to neutralise and silence international solidarity with the besieged Palestinian people is orchestrated from the highest levels of the Israeli state, with support from its imperialist patrons in Britain, the US and Germany.

In 2011, the Israeli government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu enacted a law that criminalised advocacy of a boycott of Israel. And at a 28 March conference in Jerusalem to plot strategy against the pro-Palestinian Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, Intelligence Minister Yisrael Katz called for “targeted civil eliminations” of BDS “leaders”. Coming from a government that has killed some 200 Palestinians just since last October, and slaughtered more than 2300 during its July 2014 onslaught on Gaza, this is not idle chatter.

Within the Labour Party, there is considerable overlap between Labour Friends of Israel and the Blairite Progress grouping. In early April, Progress head Richard Angell issued an “action plan” involving the Jewish Labour Movement to deal with “antisemitism within [Labour’s] ranks” (mirror.co.uk, 5 April). The Jewish Labour Movement is affiliated not only to the Labour Party but also to the World Zionist Organization, which finances the expansion of Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank.

This provides some context for the recent raft of “anti-Semitism” smears in Britain. In February, Alex Chalmers, a BICOM intern, slandered the Oxford University Labour Club for having “some kind of problem with Jews” after they voted to endorse Israeli Apartheid Week on campus. When Malia Bouattia, a Muslim woman of Algerian origin who supports the Palestinian cause, subsequently ran successfully for the presidency of the National Union of Students, she, too, was accused of being anti-Jewish. Vicki Kirby, a Labour candidate in Woking, was suspended for a 2011 tweet that Guido Fawkes dug up and doctored to make it look as if she promoted racist caricatures of Jews. As Jewish writer David Baddiel attested, Kirby had simply quoted some lines from his 2010 comedy film The Infidel.

Fawkes likewise “outed” Naz Shah for a 2014 Facebook post, before she became a Labour MP, that depicted a map of Israel superimposed on a map of the US. Ironically, those who maligned Shah for allegedly supporting the forced transfer of the Israeli Jewish population are the very people who apologise for an Israeli government filled with open proponents of the forced transfer of the Palestinian population from “Greater Israel”. It turned out that the map was originally posted by American Jewish academic Norman Finkelstein, who pointed to the obvious dark humour intended: “So, we have this joke: Why doesn’t Israel become the 51st state? Answer: Because then, it would only have two senators” (opendemocracy.net). The Zionists hate Finkelstein, the son of concentration camp survivors, not least for his indictments of how they cynically wield the Nazi genocide of the Jews as a bludgeon against those who speak out against Israeli atrocities.

Ken Livingstone was accused of being anti-Jewish because, in defending Shah, he had the chutzpah to say that when “Hitler won his election in 1932, his policy then was that Jews should be moved to Israel. He was supporting Zionism. This was before he went mad and ended up killing six million Jews.” Sundry critics tried to dismiss Livingstone’s statement by pointing out how his facts were mangled (Hitler never won an election, etc, etc). Despite his glib reduction of the Holocaust to a product of Hitler’s madness, his point about collaboration between Zionists and the Nazis is correct. Livingstone cited Lenni Brenner’s Zionism in the Age of the Dictators (1983), a book the Spartacist League/Britain drew on for the article “Zionist Big Lie targets Perdition” (Workers Hammer no 88, May 1987). The Zionists prevented that play, written by Jim Allen and directed by Ken Loach, from being staged in London because it was based on the true story of Zionist collaboration with the Nazis in facilitating the deportation to the death camps of more than 400,000 Hungarian Jews in 1944.

Hitler’s ultimate aim was the extermination of all Jews, Zionist and non-Zionist alike. But in its first years, the Third Reich frequently accepted the proffered assistance of the Zionists in helping make Germany “Judenrein” (cleansed of Jews). As documented by Yeshiva University historian Lucy Dawidowicz in The War Against the Jews 1933-1945 (1975), only months after Hitler came to power, the Zionist Federation of Germany (ZVfD) “proposed that the ‘new German state’ recognize the Zionist movement as the most suitable Jewish group in the new Germany with which to deal” and “that since emigration would provide a solution to the Jewish question, it should therefore receive government assistance”. The ZVfD welcomed “the foundation of the new state, which has established the principle of race”. Two months later, the Jewish Agency signed the secret August 1933 Ha’avara (Transfer) agreement with the Hitler regime, which allowed wealthy German Jews to move to Palestine (and only to Palestine) with part of their capital in order to provide an outlet for German exports.

In turn, the Nazi state granted special status to the Zionist movement, which was far smaller than the non-Zionist Jewish organisations. In January 1935, Nazi chief Reinhard Heydrich, head of the Gestapo and second-in-command of the SS, told the Bavarian political police that “the activity of the Zionist-oriented youth organizations...lies in the interest of the National Socialist state’s leadership” because they were preparing Jews for emigration to Palestine (quoted in Dawidowicz). While active socialists and communists were thrown into Dachau, the Zionists were for some years the only non-Nazi political group allowed to function legally, the Zionist banner the only flag aside from the Nazi swastika to fly on German soil.

There was more to this than Zionist Realpolitik in the face of overwhelming Nazi repression, as latter-day apologists would have it. As the revolutionary workers movement grew towards the end of the 19th century, so did organised anti-Jewish bigotry. Overwhelmingly, the Jewish workers, and a significant layer of the Jewish intelligentsia, sought their salvation through the struggle, alongside their non-Jewish class brothers and sisters, for socialist revolution. It was to stanch this movement and to incite pogroms that the tsarist secret police propagated The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, a crude forgery that conjured up an international Jewish conspiracy to take over the world. But when rumours of a pogrom spread through St Petersburg at the height of the 1905 Revolution, the workers soviet mobilised some 12,000 armed workers to fight the reactionaries; likewise in Warsaw, integrated workers defence guards were set up to patrol Jewish areas and ward off pogromist mobs (see “Revolution, Counterrevolution and the Jewish Question”, Spartacist [English-language edition] no
49-50, Winter 1993-94).

In his 1958 essay “The Non-Jewish Jew”, Marxist historian Isaac Deutscher accounted for the disproportionate role of Jews in the socialist movement:

“They were a priori exceptional in that as Jews they dwelt on the borderlines of various civilizations, religions, and national cultures. They were born and brought up on the borderlines of various epochs. Their mind matured where the most diverse cultural influences crossed and fertilized each other....

“Like Marx, Rosa Luxemburg and Trotsky strove, together with their non-Jewish comrades, for the universal, as against the particularist, and for the internationalist, as against the nationalist, solutions to the problems of their time.”

Zionist founding father Theodor Herzl (1860-1904) despised the assimilationist and pro-socialist Jewish proletariat. Rather than fight anti-Jewish bigotry and repression, Herzl and his fellow Zionists used it as an excuse to separate Europe’s Jews from their compatriots and mould them into a nation with its own homeland, in Palestine. Ideologically nurtured in the cradle of German national “awakening”, Zionism embraced the reactionary ideals of Blut (blood) and Volk (nation). Born long after the bourgeois nation-state had outlived its historically progressive role in the era of capitalist consolidation, Zionism distinguished itself in being a particularly venal and racialist brand of nationalism. The Zionist leaders raised the battle cry, “A land without people for a people without land”, knowing full well that to make Palestine a land without people would require the expulsion of much of its Arab population.

The Zionist project could only be realised with the support of a powerful imperialist patron — be it tsarist Russia, the Kaiser’s (or Hitler’s) Germany, Britain or the US. The Zionists peddled their wares with the claim that they could neutralise Jewish support for the revolutionary socialist movement. As Winston Churchill later ranted, the Zionists could help in defeating the “sinister confederacy” of “International Jews” who conspired “for the overthrow of civilization” (“Zionism versus Bolshevism, A Struggle for the Soul of the Jewish People”, Illustrated Sunday Herald, 8 February 1920). While Zionist leader Chaim Weizmann looked to the British or US imperialists, the Revisionist right wing inspired by Vladimir Jabotinsky gravitated towards Mussolini’s Italy and even Hitler’s Germany. As late as 1941, a Revisionist splinter calling itself the National Military Organisation (NMO), better known as the Stern Gang, appealed to the Third Reich:

“Common interests could exist between the establishment of a New Order in Europe in conformity with the German concept, and the true national aspirations of the Jewish people as they are embodied by the NMO.”

— quoted in Zionism in the Age of the Dictators

It was such “common interests” that led Herzl and his followers to find allies among the more reactionary elements of the bourgeoisie, who wanted to rid themselves of “their” Jews. Weizmann managed to secure the 1917 Balfour Declaration, with its vague promise of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. The British imperialists aimed to establish a bulwark of support in the region, pitting Jews against Palestinians. They also hoped to undermine Jewish support for Bolshevism on the eve of the victorious October Revolution in Russia, then Britain’s ally in World War I.

In this latter aim they failed. In the course of the Russian Revolution and the civil war against imperialist and domestic counterrevolutionary forces, which carried out pogroms against Jews and reds wherever they went, the dispossessed Jewish masses flocked to the Bolshevik banner. The Jewish nationalist and pro-Zionist socialist groups in Russia and the Ukraine became empty shells. As the Third All-Russia Conference of the Jewish Communist Sections declared in 1920:

“The Jewish workers and the poorest of the Jewish people understand quite well that only the communist order will put an end to all pogroms, will root out all nationalist prejudices, will erase all national restrictions and install over the whole face of the earth a genuine brotherhood of peoples.”

— News of Central Bureau of the Jewish Sections (October 1920)

The Bolshevik Revolution and the early Soviet state under Lenin and Trotsky were a beacon to workers and the oppressed everywhere, including the Arab masses subjugated by British imperialism in the Near East, who suffered under the barbarity of capitalist “civilisation”. The overthrow of capitalism and the institution of a planned collectivised economy opened the road to the liberation and development of all the many Soviet peoples. Even after the reactionary and nationalist Stalinist bureaucracy usurped political power from the working class, it was the proletarian class character of the Soviet Union that allowed it to save well over two million Jews fleeing the Nazi murder machine and to smash Hitler’s Third Reich. In contrast, the imperialist “democracies” turned back all but a handful of Jewish refugees. Many of the Jewish refugees who were allowed into Britain were detained as so-called enemy aliens during World War II and thousands were deported. Most notorious was the ship Dunera, which was packed with 2000 mostly Jewish refugees along with 450 Italian and German prisoners for the two-month voyage to Australia.

For a socialist federation of the Near East!

Young activists who solidarise with the cause of the Palestinian people in the face of Israeli state terror would do well to consider the words of the Jewish Communists in 1920. Revolutionary proletarian internationalism is the only road to the national and social emancipation of the Palestinian people. This may seem far-fetched in an age when the opportunist “far left” sneers at the Marxist goal of an egalitarian international communist order and even class struggle seems a thing of the past. However, if the past decade has demonstrated nothing else, it is that catastrophic crises are endemic to the capitalist profit system. The same holds true of the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, as the current strike wave in France and years of protests and strikes in Greece demonstrate, notwithstanding the stranglehold of the reformist, pro-capitalist trade union bureaucracies.

The capitalist state of Israel is no exception to this Marxist understanding. While Israeli society has moved steadily to the right in recent decades, the historic interests of the Israeli Jewish working class run counter to those of their capitalist rulers and exploiters. So long as the national rather than the class axis prevails, the Palestinians will lose out to the overwhelming military superiority of the Zionist state. It is only the working class of Israel that has the capacity and historic interest to shatter the Zionist state from within. In fighting for the creation of revolutionary internationalist workers parties in the Near East we struggle to win the Israeli Jewish workers away from their Zionist rulers, to recognise that their class allies are the working people of the Arab countries and to champion the national rights of the Palestinians. Likewise we seek to break the Arab toiling masses from Arab nationalism and Islamic reaction (see “Defend the Palestinian People!” Workers Vanguard no 1089, 6 May).

The 2011 Egyptian protests did find an echo in the mass protests in Israel that summer, showing the potential to undermine the garrison mentality drummed into Israeli Jewish workers by the Zionist rulers, who tell them that they are surrounded by a “sea” of hostile Arabs. However, the uprising in Egypt did not present a challenge to capitalist rule by the proletariat; rather, it was dominated by bourgeois nationalists and Islamists. For their part, the Revolutionary Socialists (RS) in Egypt, associated with the Socialist Workers Party (SWP), simply capitulated to these forces. From pushing illusions in the army to backing the reactionary Muslim Brotherhood and, ultimately, the coup that brought the military to power, at every stage the RS helped to ensure that the Egyptian proletariat would remain tied to its class enemies.

In Britain, the reformists of the SWP prate that the liberal BDS movement is “the potentially most serious challenge to Israel’s position and to the continuance of its long-term policy of piecemeal and de facto annexation of the whole of Palestine” (Socialist Review, July/August 2013). The BDS campaign is based on the bankrupt assumption that the Israeli state can be pressured by its “democratic” imperialist paymasters to halt the oppression of the Palestinian people. The notion that the (admittedly well-funded and powerful) “Zionist lobby” is responsible for imperialist support to Israel is ludicrous. It is in pursuit of its own geopolitical interests that US imperialism pumps some $3 billion a year in military aid to its Israeli gendarme.

According to the Palestine Solidarity Committee, the boycott strategy “exerts moral pressure on the British Government by giving expression to the desire to move towards a more ethical foreign policy”. “Democratic” Britain, as much as, if not more than, any other country, bears the burden of historical responsibility for making the Near East the slaughterhouse that it is today. At the start of World War I, Britain sought to encourage an Arab revolt against the Ottoman Empire, then Britain’s enemy, by promising that the Arabs would be granted freedom at the war’s end. Two years later, the British imperialists and their French allies, in the secret 1916 Sykes-Picot agreement, carved up the Near East for themselves. This was followed by the pro-Zionist Balfour Declaration. Thirty years later, the Clement Attlee Labour government presided over the bloody partition of Palestine (and the far bloodier partition of India). Divide-and-rule — that is the “morality” of British imperialism.

While defending BDS activists when they come under attack by the state, we oppose this strategy, which looks to the supposed “humanitarian” instincts of capitalist governments, campus administrations and corporate giants to pressure Israel. Ongoing economic sanctions serve mainly to weaken and undermine the workers and oppressed of the targeted country, not its capitalist rulers. Particularly odious are academic and cultural boycotts, which equate Israeli scholars and artists — such as the integrated West-Eastern Divan Orchestra set up by Palestinian scholar Edward Said and Jewish musician Daniel Barenboim — with the chauvinist Zionist rulers. In contrast, Marxists assert the need for international working-class solidarity with the Palestinians. A standing boycott by British and US dock workers, for example, refusing to handle military shipments to Israel, would strike a powerful blow against Zionist state terror.

Marxists reject the notion widely held on the left that an oppressor nation forfeits its right to self-determination. This is a species of nationalist moralism, which ends up mirroring the lie that equates Zionism with the Jewish people. As we explained in “Birth of the Zionist State: A Marxist Analysis” (Workers Vanguard no 45, 24 May 1974):

“Out of the destruction of European Jewry by Hitler (without whose aid the Zionists would have gone the way of the Shakers and other utopian sects) and at the expense of the Palestinian Arabs, a settler colony was transformed into a nation....

“This Hebrew nation came into existence through force and violence, through the suppression, forced expulsion and genocide of other peoples. Communists must oppose this brutal national oppression. Yet once this historical fact is accomplished, we must certainly recognize that nation’s right to self-determination, unless we prefer the alternative, namely national genocide.”

We defend the Palestinian people against the Zionist state down the line, even when that means taking a military side with Islamic fundamentalists like Hamas in Gaza. But we recognise the right of the Israeli Jews as well as the Palestinians to national self-determination. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is at bottom a situation of interpenetrated peoples. Both peoples lay claim to the same small sliver of land. Under capitalism, the exercise of national self-determination by one side necessarily comes at the expense of the other. There can and will be no just resolution to the conflicting national rights of the Palestinian and Israeli Jewish peoples short of the establishment of a socialist federation of the Near East, requiring the overthrow of all the bourgeois states of the region through proletarian revolutions.

For revolutionaries in Britain, solidarity with the oppressed in the neocolonial countries must start with opposing our “own” ruling class and fighting to bring down British imperialism through socialist revolution at home. Leftist youth who seek effective solidarity with the Palestinian people against Zionist terror need to study the lessons of the Bolshevik Revolution, the greatest victory for the working class and the oppressed to date. Based on those lessons, the Spartacist League/Britain, section of the International Communist League, fights to cohere a revolutionary workers party as part of a reforged Trotskyist Fourth International. It is only through the worldwide victory of the socialist proletariat that all manner of exploitation, oppression and imperialist barbarity will be overcome.

I am in my 4th year of college. I didn't switch to CS until halfway through my second year so I am equivalent to junior status right now in terms of finishing the program. I've just started to care about making personal projects (I'm working on a Pygame and building a portfolio website after i learn basic html and css plus maybe a little JS), but I feel like it's too late to land an internship for the summer. I don't feel like I have enough to offer on my resume to impress employers enough. I went to the career fair last spring and no one was interested in my resume enough to call me back for an interview. I'm just frightened and worry every day whether this degree will be a waste because I got started on enhancing my personal portfolio too late. I feel like I have nothing worthwhile to offer to employees... The career fair is coming up in about 2 weeks and I'm so nervous that I'll look like a fool because my resume's a little light... I wish I got serious about my major earlier. 

I am starting to get very passionate about CS (meaning I'm beginning to do side projects and think about it in my spare time), I'm just wondering... At 21 years old in my 4th year of college? Is it too late for me?"

5214lw,1,2016-09-09,21 [M4F] - Starting Over,burnbabyburner69,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5214lw/21_m4f_starting_over/,"On September 22nd, 2036, a deep space probe was launched from Cape Canaveral. Its creators had designed it to detect supernovas in far away galaxies, but they had no idea that it's destiny laid in another direction. In order to escape the solar system, it had to use the Sun as a gravity assist. Readings taken from the probe as it circled the Sun were almost ignored completely, as many thought that the probe's sensors wouldn't read any significant information. Luckily though, a team of interns had no better work to do at the time and combed over the data as a way to keep their skills honed. One of them found an abnormal measurement and reported it to her superiors, but she got no word back about it. She figured that it must have been nothing. She was wrong.
As soon as her superior looked over her discovery, he knew something was amiss. He went straight to the top and a small, top-secret task force was commissioned to investigate the measurement. A couple decades passed by before they reached their conclusion. The chemical makeup of the Sun was not nearly as stable as had been accepted for so long. The Earth didn't have billions of years left before the Sun blew up, it had hundreds.

President Alvarez had just been sworn in weeks before he was informed of the matter. While still keeping the veil of a normal presidency around him, he spent the entirety of his 8 year term researching the options that Earth had left. It was settled within a year that Earth was doomed. The Sun had reached the point of no return centuries ago and moving the Earth out of the blast radius was [out of the question](http://imgur.com/a/SIfaO).

Obviously, there had to be some kind of evacuation, but technology was extremely limited. Even when the other governments of the world were contacted, their pooled efforts could only create one spaceship that had could carry the resources necessary for sustaining life far enough away from the Sun. It wasn't all doom and gloom though. The research on designing the base accelerated quickly, and the spaceship itself was designed in less than a decade. The same probe that discovered the Sun's fatal flaw was retasked to scout out planets, and a small list of acceptable candidates was assembled quickly. Models suggested that the primary planet candidate could have its atmosphere be made breathable in less than a century and that the soil could be made farmable, though that would take a significantly longer amount of time.

All that was easy. The hard part came when it was time to select the people to fill the ark, as most of the people who knew of it called it. Some thought they should all be engineers, people who could manage the base well and troubleshoot mechanical problems the easiest. Others wanted a more balanced team that could manage all sorts of things, like the plants or the crew's health. A few politicians even suggested that the crew should be made of philosophers and artists to preserve Earth culture.

The decision was largely made for them though as two new problems surfaced. First, the cryogenics systems didn't develop as nicely as the others. Tests on people over 50 were catastrophic, with volunteers not lasting more than a few days before the tests had to be stopped for safety reasons. Further tests and calculations estimated that no one over 40 could survive the journey. To add onto the problems, volunteers with even average amounts of stress were much more likely to suffer heart attacks in their sleep state.

The second problem was the elephant in the room that everyone tried to ignore for as long as possible. To continue the human race, the crew had to breed. But the ship could only hold six people, five women and one man to ensure long term species procreation. There would have to be incest just to create a third generation. Knowing that it had to be done, research was done on the science of incestuous breeding and it was found that only .0001% of the population had the genes necessary to sustain a healthy family tree.

With these two factors in mind, the most qualified candidates were identified from a short list. Most people who were involved in the decision wanted the candidates to be trained and debriefed extensively before the launch. However, the cryogenic scientists made it clear that the stress of knowing the fate of humanity was to be carried on their shoulders was far too much. The only plan that ensured the safety of the candidates was to sedate them in their sleep and put them into the cryochambers without even the slightest bit of warning or preparation.

Thousands of years later, the lights in the spaceship turned on. It had landed on the virgin planet just as the scientists and engineers designed it to. The cryochambers started their three day reanimation process, and once the crew members exited, they barely had a chance to speak to each other before a video played in the center of the room.

""Hello, I'm Dr. Baker. Welcome to Project Phoenix.""

***
This is obviously a long term prompt that will focus on breeding, and if the RP goes on for a long time, incest. However, this most likely isn't going to be a sex-focused RP. The main focus will most likely be on the characters themselves as they go through the emotions of knowing they're the last humans alive and the struggles that they'll face just to survive and deal with each other. I'm looking for realistic character development, with each one taking a different view on their situation.

Breeding is the only truly necessary kink for this RP, but others can be discussed. Here's my [kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/ZTXuOUH.png) if you want to check it out. I'm always open to doing this prompt, so no matter when you're reading this, feel free to shoot me an orange envelope!"

Chairs? Not sure what to say. Fuck it. Just drink. I have killed a fifth of Jamo already since 5pm.

521glb,3,2016-09-10,F4M Some fun scenes!,[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/521glb/f4m_some_fun_scenes/,"Hey there DPP, tonight I have a couple scenes for you all to choose from and/or work out with me!

We can discuss specific prompts in private and please, do not message me with a scene already started, that’s the easiest way to get blocked. The same goes for one line/word messages.

I'm fairly open with my kinks with my only hard ""no""s being scat, unrealistically huge cocks, 3rd person writing, and vomit.

Without further ado, here are some of my prompts:

**The Lawyer and the Con**: For this one, I was thinking I’d play a young and up and coming lawyer tasked with defending you. We can discuss the specifics in PMs but one thing is for certain, I’ll be taking my payment in the form of cock.

**Breaking the Law**: For this one, the roles are reversed, I was caught committing a crime and you’re the officer/journalist/detective who caught me. Where that leads? Well that’s up to you.

**Wrong neighborhood**: What happens when me, a young and sexy girl finds herself in the wrong neighborhood? Do you help me find my way or decide you want to take advantage?

**Sports Star and Reporter**: A classic scene were I’m a reporter and you’re the sports star, that can only lead one place, right?

**The intern and the boss**: Fairly self explanatory, I’d love to be the intern at her dream job who meets you, her boss and potentially so much more.

**Opposite Sides**: For this one, I want to play a FBI/CIA/DEA Agent who is tasked with infiltrating your organization, now what that organization does we can discuss in PMs but I basically want you to turn me from righteous agent of the law into your slut.

**I’m gonna fuck your sister**: For this one, you’ll play my little brother’s best friend, I’ll be his big sister who is now recently single and back in town. You guys always joked that you would fuck each other’s mom/sister only this time, you’re not joking.

**Giving back**: In this RP, I’ll play someone  famous be it an actress or singer or sports star. You’ll be the person tasked in helping me set up some sort of event to give back to the community, only you want me to give you something more than this event.

**Bullies always win**: In this one, you’ll be as the title suggests, you’re a bully who grew up terrorizing my son (or brother), only unlike the stories we tell our kids to make them feel better, you know better. You get what you want, when you want it, in this case, me.

For those of you so inclined, I do like playing celebs in any of these roles so we have visual aids, if you’d like me to be any, just ask!

As for celebs I’d play, here are a few, feel free to ask about ones not listed:

Celebs: **Mary Elizabeth Winstead**, **Maisie Williams**, Anna Kendrick, Selena Gomez, Hailee Steinfeld, Taylor Swift, Willa Holland, Daisy Ridley, **Melissa Benoist**, Emma Stone/Watson/Roberts, Hayley Williams, Alison Brie, Alexandra Daddario, Aubrey Plaza, Bella Thorne, **Alicia Vikander** Jennifer Lawrence, Keri Russel, Neve Campbell, Jennifer Connelly, Scarlet Johansson, Sophie Turner, Oliva Munn, Olivia Wilde, **Miranda Kerr**, Jessica Biel/Alba, Victoria Justice

YouTube/Social Media: **Meg Turney**, Lia Marie Johnson, **Alli Speed**, Barbara Dunkelman, Ashley Jenkins, **Bree Essrig**, Maude Garrett, Trisha Hershberger, Datev Gallagher, Lindsey Stirling, Christina Grimme, Dodger, iJustine, or Meghan Camarena.

Whew, that was a lot. Hope to get some dirty orangereds soon!

521k5p,2,2016-09-10,"Even though tuition is paid for, should I take advantage of low interest, deferred, federal student loans?",GodFather0326,investing_discussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing_discussion/comments/521k5p/even_though_tuition_is_paid_for_should_i_take/,"Hey guys and gals, first post here so let's get to it.

I’m young, and painfully aware that I “don’t know everything about everything, or much about anything.” I’m posting this to get feedback from older, more experienced, and smarter investors than I. 

I'm wondering if it’s a good idea to take advantage of federal and private student and VA loans that are deferred until 6 - 9 months after you graduate? 


I qualify for 100% of my Post 9/11 GI benefits, will be working part-time, etc, etc. 


But let's say that on top of that, my freshman year I borrow roughly $50,000.00 in deferred federal student loans (current IR's are about 4.69%) with a grace period of 6 months after graduation.)


The plan is to invest this capital into various opportunities that, after much deliberation and analysis, should grow at about 9 - 12% per year. 


But for the sake of the argument let's say that I play it safe and dump it all into an ETF that tracks the S&amp;P 500 index. Something like SPY.


Historically, The SPY ETF's (and S&amp;P 500) growth rate is roughly 8 -10% per year. We're going to go conservative here and adjust that to a constant 7 – 8.5% just in case. Did I mention that the SPY ETF pays a quarterly dividend? (2.02% or $4.34/share annually) Dividends that I intend to DRIP right back into the SPY to compound this financial momentum.


(Conservative) Estimates of growth from years 1 - 4:

1st year: 50,000 x 8.5% = $54,250.00 + annual dividend payment of $986.00


2nd year: $55,286.00 x 7.6% = $59,487.00 + Dividends of $1,066.00


3rd year $60,552.00 x 8.8% = $65,880 + Dividends of $1,127.00


4th year: $67,007.00 x 7.0% = $71,697.00 + Dividends of $1,215.00


Total: $72,912.00

Repayment option A: Upon graduation I would sell my position and repay the loan before the interest rates or payments were activated. Netting me a cool $22,912.00

Repayment option B: Make monthly payments on the loan with my extra income to widdle it down before graduation. The logic behind this is getting and investing 50k NOW vs saving and investing 50k over 4 or 5 years. I'm thinking about the Time Value of Money here. 

This growth is ONLY from the $50,000.00 loan and does not include my existing position in the SPY ETF or any other investment I am part of.


On top of this, the extra income I make from my GI bill benefits and part time work will be saved and invested (estimated around +$2,500.00/month x *8 school months* = $10,000.00 per year) into stocks, options, and other securities that I deem beneficial to my portfolio. 


**non-school months will be spent studying abroad or at an internship. This has been factored in and budgeted for**


What do you think? What have I not accounted for? What obvious financial truth have I ignored or missed or am simply not aware of? Please leave your feedback below with valid points as to why it’s a good or bad idea as well as other suggestions to wisely invest during my early twenties (Please don’t say TSP. That’s taken care of.)  Any and all advice is much appreciated!

521oih,2,2016-09-10,"I [25 M] need some advice from all you redditors, of how to proceed with my failed closure with [21 F] friend",throwaway-sadfs,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/521oih/i_25_m_need_some_advice_from_all_you_redditors_of/,"Full disclosure, before I begin with my post. I've lied about mine and my friends age in the title. Reason being is because I know she has a Reddit account, I don't believe she is an active user of Reddit, you just never know.
Ok, this is going to be a long story, full warning. My friend in this post, she will go by R. 


R and I have known each other for about two years now. When I met R (beginning of 2014), she had a boyfriend of 7 years at the time. However, when I first met R I really didn’t have any feelings towards her. I just thought she was someone cool to talk to do. Later on after we met, we started talking more and more, yet I still didn’t develop any real feelings for her, at this point I had barely started seeing her as a good friend. A few months after I met R, some Venture Capitalist guy (VC) had also met R. I forgot to mention R and I are both in college. 

Over the 2014 summer, R and I would have weekly (sometimes bi-weekly) lunches and we would text each other every day. I would enjoy talking to R as I felt I could talk to her about anything such as life, business, school, and future ambitions. Over the summer, R desired to go Town (I won’t state what Town is as that would be obvious), as she grew vastly interested in interning at Town and working there after college. R went to visit (Town) over the summer, she decided to stay with the VC guy she met. Now at that time, I still didn’t realize my feelings for R and only saw her as a friend. I did see that move as shady, because she was still with her longtime boyfriend and she had more than one friend who lived in Town, however she still decided to stay with the VC guy. Even though she had been with her boyfriend for 7 years, I could tell that relationship was going to end sometime soon, they just didn’t really have anything in common at that point. She broke up with him, while she was staying at the VC guy’s apartment.

We enter the end of June and R is back and we continue to have our lunches/texts. The way I discovered I had feelings for R was in at some party in July. I remember I saw some guy totally trying to hook up with her and I got jealous. Anytime the guy got close to her I would take her away, at the time I didn’t see it but she had zero interest in the guy, I was just too drunk to see that. Anyways that same night, I remember we were outside, I grabbed her hand and brought her close to me. I meant to kiss her… but I couldn’t, so instead I just held onto her tight. It’s not that I didn’t want to kiss her, I really did, however I didn’t want to risk it. I didn’t want to kiss and then only for her to kiss me back saying she just didn’t want to hurt me.

Anyways that same night, she got mad at me, not because of the party guy or me trying to kiss her. Its because she asked if I could hold onto her keys since she didn’t have any pockets. Needless to say it was one of those situations where I wouldn’t give her the keys. A few days went by without her texting me back. I finally saw her in person and just apologized which she accepted. However, this is where things started to change between her and I. We didn’t really have our lunches anymore and she would take forever to reply to my texts. Not only that, but when it came to texting, we would usually text each other, at this point I was doing majority of the texting and I would get late responses. 

Finally August comes and the school year, at this point I’ve become frustrated with me always texting her and receiving late responses. In the beginning of September (2014), I find out she is going out with the VC guy. So basically after this, I distance myself from her all of Fall 2014. We still talked, just not as much as we usually would. In comes Spring 2015 and I will admit, that semester I was a bit of a cold person to individuals in my life. Fall 2014 semester I had a bit of a crisis with school and family problems. During the Spring 2015 semester, R and I still texted each, again not as much though. However, the scripts had switched, R tried to hang out with me a with few times during that semester however I either made up an excuse or canceled on her last minute (really she only tried to make plans with me 2 or 3 times). Yes, I did do that by design and at times I wouldn’t text her back. While I did do that to her because I was being cold, I also did that because I officially wanted to get over her. Why? Because in Summer 2015 she was going to intern in Town and in Fall 2015 she was going to study abroad. I knew I wouldn’t see her for a year. So I was successful in that attempt (so I thought), I got over her and I didn’t say good bye to her in May when she left.

We talked to each other only like twice during her internship and never during her studying abroad. Over the summer she broke up with her VC boyfriend. Basically I didn’t see her at all after May 2015 until New Years 2016. I was excited to see her, mainly because she was in Paris during the terrorist attacks. I remember when those events had transpired, I promised myself I would fix my relationship with her when she came back. As imagining her dying made me realize how much I would regret never fixing that relationship. Now no feelings came back when Paris happened, I was just glad she was alive and safe. While I was excited to see her at the New Years party, I also wanted to avoid her. Mainly because I know how we both get with each other when we are drunk, we tend to bicker at each other. Anyways I didn’t talk to her for the first half of the night, the second half the night we did and it was a big mistake. I won’t go into it because this post is already a long one. If you do want know what happened, then please just let me know in the comments. After that night I realized something, the feelings I had for her had come back. I also realized I never really got over her, I had only suppressed my feelings.

Two weeks after New Years I shoot her a text saying I want to see her. I wanted to meet up with her because I wanted to verbally tell her how much I care and feel about her. Do you recall when I said she took forever to reply back? Well I was I mistaken, she would text me on average 5-8 hours later (Summer/Fall 2014 &amp; Spring 2015). In Spring 2016, she now takes days and even a week to reply to me. That really pisses me off because at that point why would anybody reply to a text? Anyways it took us 3 weeks to finally meet, either because we couldn’t find the time on our schedules or she would cancel on me last minute. Finally, when we met (February 2016) I felt like I had to beg her to meet me.

As I walked to the Starbucks on our campus to meet, I started to feel nervous, I literally had to stop and take a few breaths before heading to the Starbucks on our campus. I knew I hadn’t seen her in almost a year and I was getting nervous to talk to her. So basically our conversation didn’t go as planned and I became emotionally paralyzed. Below is our conversation.

R: So what’s up, what did you want to talk about?
Me: Look – we use to be close friends right? (My planned response from her was that she would mention how we use to have our lunches and text each other in 2014).
R:  I mean (confused look on her face), we use to talk to each other in [BLANK] meetings. ([BLANK] is the name of school organization we were a part of)

If you’ve been paying attention to my post, you know I have never mentioned [BLANK], that’s because I only ever saw her at two of those meetings. I really don’t how to explain it in written words so I’ll try my best. The fact that R said, “I mean (confused look on her face), we use to talk to each other in [BLANK] meetings”. Totally felt like I was stabbed by some sort of emotional knife. It meant she didn’t remember me as friend, she remembered me as an acquaintance. All those memories of us having lunch and texting each other way past midnight, were thrown out of her mind. While I did tell her how I felt about her, I couldn’t continue the rest of the conversation of what I had planned, I was too hurt and emotionally paralyzed at that time.

At the end before we parted I told her I wanted to see her before she left to Town (she got accepted a full time offer from her internship) and she told me to text her, I told her I didn’t have her number. After the conversation I was furious, mainly the purpose of that conversation was to have start the path of my closure with her. I was mad at her, but even more at myself. I was mad at myself because I couldn’t believe I was stupid enough to think that R would actually remember those memories of us after interning at Town and studying abroad. 

I was telling the truth when I told her I didn’t have her number (if you’re wondering how we communicated to meet up in the first place, I was using Facebook messenger.) However, I had no intention of reaching to her in any form of communication, I didn’t want to be the first one. I needed to know if whether she still cared about me as a friend and if she texted me just once to hang out. Then I wouldn’t mind putting in all the effort like I usually did. I just needed to know if she still cared about me as a friend.

In comes March 2016, it’s been a month since R and I last spoke, R out of the blue texted me. While I know I said I would be happy if she reached out to me first, I wasn’t happy about this text. She doesn’t text me to hang out, she texted me for a favor. Yes, I did get mad at her for our last conversation, however this specific text finally threw me over the edge with her and I was seriously just done. I’m fast forwarding to May just to finish this long post (again if anybody requests for the full story I’ll be happy to explain).

May 2016, on Facebook (events feature) she invites me to her graduation, at first I considered going. But when I went her list of who she invited I saw she also invited people she barely talks to anymore (R invited a total of 200 plus people on that event). I knew I was one of those people she barely talked to so I declined. Later, she went to an event that I was a part of, she comes up to me to say hi, however I was rather rude to her when she came up and said hi to me, I could tell I pissed her off. I wasn’t mad about it what I did, I wanted R to know I was done with her. A week after that I saw her at a mutual friend’s wedding. I didn’t expect to her to say hi to me as I was rather rude to her at the previous event I saw R. However out of the blue she came up to me and said hi. I’ll be honest that caught me off guard and made me feel bad for our last interaction. A week goes by and I text her if she wants to meet. At this point I only have three weeks before she officially moves out of state. I wanted to meet again just to tell her how much she means to me and that I’ll miss her.

When I texted her I fully prepared for R to take forever to text back. R responded in one hour or two, so that threw me off. I immediately texted her because I want the same thing to happen that happened in February (taking forever to meet). I texted her on a Monday and she told me Wednesday would be a good day for her to meet, she didn’t confirm with me though. She didn’t reply to my text until Tuesday night, saying Wednesday wouldn’t work out. Again, that pissed me off and I told her.

Me: I’m just trying to see you before you take off. I’m not going to go back and forth with you like in February. Let me know when you make time.

R: Ouch, ok. (This was also the fastest she ever replied back to me as she replied within 10 minutes)

That ladies and gentlemen was the last conversation I had with R that was in May 2016. I reached out to her a few days later restating what I said in a gentler manner, however she never texted me back. My question to all of you is what should I do? Should I let this go or reach out to her find the closure I never found? I still care about her deeply, but the truth is I’m tired of being hurt by her and me looking like the bad guy. She does live out of state now, so I won’t be seeing her in person anytime soon.


I thank you in advance for reading this post and sharing your thoughts.

  **tl;dr**: Basically I fell in love with my friend of two years. Things changed between us and that relationship was left in a bad state. She has moved states and I don't know if whether I should reach out to her for closure or just let it go."

But then I'd be missing out on the skills that I could be collecting in internships.

-Given my situation and desires, what do you guys think I should do? 

-Also, what kinds of internships should I look for that would improve some of the skills I would need to be a successful entrepreneur later? (I was thinking an internship in marketing could be useful.)

-What if I were to do both - do internships and build side businesses on the weekend or something similar? Any tips on juggling the two without burning myself out?"
521qky,196,2016-09-10,"Terminate my offer based on bullshit heresay? You picked the wrong person to fuck over, bitch.",herpderptheslurpderp,pettyrevenge,https://www.reddit.com/r/pettyrevenge/comments/521qky/terminate_my_offer_based_on_bullshit_heresay_you/,"All right, so I have been spending a LOT of time thinking of how to explain this story without giving revealing details. Unfortunately, I don't get to be as specific that I'd like, but most of the juicy parts are still here. 

So, in my last internship, I worked for a really awesome tech company (it's one of the popular ones out west), and had one of the greatest experiences of my life. I learned so much from my manager, and delivered a finished project that was so good they incorporated it fully to be utilized by the whole company for future product development (it was a manufacturing/testing optimization kind of project). 

It started out difficult, and my manager (Brian) told me that himself that I'd struggle, but with perseverance and confidence, I'd deliver. HIS manager (Wes) was the one who made the decision to hire me in the first place, and he wanted me on this project. Long story short, it worked, I put in so many hours (70+ hour weeks in my last month there), but Holy shit, just finishing that made me so proud. My exit interview was basically Brian giving me advice on what I should do next with my skillset, since unfortunately he could only take interns after I finished my last year of school, and I was looking for a full time job. Again, Brian is the greatest person I've ever met, and I've learned so much from him. Fuck, I miss working there. 

So, with that background, here's where shit gets interesting. I interviewed with a startup a few months into my final year that created products for a different area, but still required someone with my science background and manufacturing/test experience. I was excited, because I knew a LOT about the kind of products that these guys were designing. In fact, I actually made a cheaper and clunkier version of one of their products for an open ended projects class (minus the cloud storage, infrastructure, and really expensive sensors, cuz I only had 50 bucks). After I flew out there, had an intense five hours of interviews, I felt confident and ready to provide some expertise while also learning so much from these guys (they brought in a lot of experts in industry to start this company, so even if it failed, I'd learn so much from them). 

A few months later, after I already signed my offer and started looking for places to live, I got a call from my future boss, Travis. Travis tells me that he heard from a previous employer of mine that I'm not able to deliver on time and because of that, they're going to end my offer. I was shocked. I asked him for more information, as that sounded nothing like me, and he said he wouldn't give me any more because of confidentiality. I told him to talk to my manager, Brian, from my most recent job, as he'd be able to give a good reference and proof of my skills. Travis ended the call by saying that it was that employer who gave him this information, and told me to consider a larger company, as they move slower and ""will give me time to learn how to work."" I was shocked. Shattered. I genuinely thought I was fucked in the head for thinking my last job with Brian was my best. 

I needed closure, and that's when I called Andrew. Andrew was a full time engineer who mentored me for the first two weeks during that job, and I asked him to tell me why my project sucked. He asked me what the fuck I was on, and that my project was well received. I told him the situation, and he got pissed. Like, I could hear him breathing more heavily on the phone, because this can potentially affect our team's reputation if someone gives false information. He told me to focus on finding a new job while he talked to Brian. 

This is where it gets good. Brian sent me an email apologizing about this situation and that Travis was full of shit, since he never got a call from him. He reminded me of our exit interview and my final presentation, encouraging me to focus on the future, and gave me his phone number in case I ever needed to use him specifically as a reference. 

I thought it was done there, but it gets better. Brian talked to Wes, and this resulted in a meeting between then and a couple other managers in the company, discussing potential legal action. But since everything was based on word of mouth, and I had no recorded evidence, they couldn't push forward. This whole part I only found out recently, because during this time, I was finishing my degree and interviewing with other companies to figure out my future. Thankfully, I bounced back (much better than I thought, luckily) and got a great job with another amazing manager. 

So where's the revenge? Well, it turns out that the person that talked shit about me was Cunt, one of the engineers on my team during that internship. He left the company to join this startup a few months after I signed, and left on good terms with Brian, where Brian even said that if Cunt didn't wind up doing well, he was always welcome back to the company to his team. 

Well, it turns out that Brian and Wes found out that when Cunt joined, he clearly talked shit to get them to drop me (I still don't know why this was done). Brian and Wes then made a personal note on his name, along with notifying many of the other managers in the company (it's a large company, so unfortunately not all) about this employee. 

Now, I'm really happy in my new job, Brian and I catch up somewhat frequently to have random discussions where he would teach me so much about tech and life (he did this with me during the internship too, which is why I fucking loved him), and Cunt better fucking hope the startup actually makes it, because if not, he doesn't have a safety net. 

TL;DR Take two tostadas and microwave them for about thirty seconds. Then, prepare refried beans (and any other protein of your choice), making sure it's baked/grilled/whatever to your liking. Put the beans and cheese (and protein) between the tostadas. Add enchilada sauce, chopped tomatoes, and shredded Mexican cheese on top. Put it in the oven at 375 for about 10 min. Boom, you just made your own Mexican pizzas and don't need to go to taco bell.

Edit: Sorry about the confusion on the revenge. The revenge was that I was the one who found out and told Brian about Cunt initially (a friend of mine works at that startup luckily and didn't know about the situation). Then, Brian and Wes looked into it and came to the conclusions regarding what he said about me."

I'm currently a junior studying CS in the States. A lot of people in my year (myself included) are ramping up to apply for internships for the summer, so I've had to sit down and think semi-critically about what I want to do beyond just graduating in the next couple years. 

I have basically no interest in trying to work in Silicon Valley right off the bat. I'd love to work somewhere in Europe (Copenhagen, Stockholm, Zurich, and Hamburg are the first few cities on my list), but I'm unsure of how to go about doing this or if it's really even a viable option. I know the pay will be less than what I could get in the US, but that isn't a big concern for me. I'm more interested in taking advantage of the time I have to be young and adventurous.

As far as language stuff goes, I speak a little German, which was the reasoning behind most of the cities I picked. I'm willing spend the time to really learn it if that would help me out at all, but most jobs I've seen only mention English proficiency.

Does anyone have any experience with this, or any advice to share? Am I more likely to get a job in one of the offices of a huge company like Google, or somewhere smaller? Is it even something I could do straight after graduating, or would I need more experience before I'm even considered? Any input would be very helpful. "

I didn't put much thought into any of my responses because I had a test at noon and wanted to get it over with quickly for some last minute studying. During the interview I was asked for my class schedule and availability. The interviewer asked if i would be available for graveyard/night/early morning shifts of 8 hours during the weekdays when I have class, without thinking my dumb ass said yes. I was surprised that I was hired immediately after the interview ended. 

I'm worried that they might schedule me to work those shifts. I looked over the syllabus for my classes and all of my exams  are on the same week. Plus my professors like to give pop quizzes almost every other class, so I really have to stay on top of the material. I'm taking 16 credit hours this semester. 3 classes being ""weed out"" classes and a class that requires a bit of work because of projects. I  have to maintain my GPA for the program im in and scholarships that will allow me to graduate debt free. Plus I want to join 2 clubs that would be extremely helpful in getting me an internship. 

I only want to work weekends 15-18 hours max. Im scheduled to attend an orientation for the job on Monday and plan on telling them there. The job isn't that important to me. I still live at home with the only bill I have to pay being my phone. I'll always have a job in my uncle's roofing company(The only job I've ever had). I only work Saturdays with him but its a very long and tiring day. I won't make a lot of money but enough to get me by. 

I wanted the job because I could make more money working the weekends than I would working 1 day with my uncle. Also for another name on my reference list. I fear that they won't give me my desired schedule and I'll have o quit. I'll make a lot more money once I have my career than I ever would working there. so, obviously school has to be the #1 priority in my life. 

Could there be any negative drawbacks if I quit or am I overthinking? I want some opinions/advice from other college students"

- What to study, how to study. e.g. IPT, IST
- Information in general

Also be glad if anyone on the sub could help find experiments or so.

I aim to work or create my own Info Sec company cause money is something I hope to provide for my parents and hopefully a wife lol. Also I wouldn't mind self teaching material so i can learn, textbooks and videos. 

For those interested, my interest came from: https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/51rorn/we_are_reallife_hackers_who_break_stuff_send/

A recent AMA from Duo Labs: https://duo.com/labs

Hopefully I can work there they seem like genuine people that I can strive myself to aim for.

Pretty much want any guidance towards a tech career, what to study, videos and material and if you can possible internships.

So far I've narrowed down about four reach schools, one of which I will apply to ED, but would like to hear anyone's opinions for ""safer"" schools because I know admissions is a crapshoot. I want a strong engineering education but am interested in taking classes in the liberal arts as well, so for this reason I'd like to avoid schools that are primarily tech-oriented. I have a few ideas but would like some outside input. Thank you for your help! 

Demographics: Male, white, public HS in New York

GPA: 96.5 UW, 99.0 W. My school doesn't rank but I would estimate that I am within the top 5-10% of my class based on GPA.

Courses: All honors/AP where applicable- probably the same as most people on this sub. The AP's I've taken are: AP World (5), AP Enviro. Sci (4), AP Chem (5), APUSH (5), AP Lang (5)

This year I am enrolled in AP Calculus BC, AP Physics C (Mech and E&amp;M), AP Lit, AP Macro, AP Comp Sci, College Italian &amp; Orchestra

SAT: 800 Math, 790 CR, 740 W
SAT II: 760 Molecular Bio, 790 World History, 760 Chem, 760 Math 2 (Retaking in October, trying to reach 800)

Extracurriculars:
-Boy Scouts (5th Grade-present): Just finished my Eagle Scout Project (~200 service hours) and about to finish my last merit badge, which will mean hopefully I'll have the award by mid November because the process of getting everything approved takes a while. On my ED application I plan on explaining in the additional info section that the award is expected by then. Also served as Assistant SPL (basically Vice President) of the troop, help run and plan trips and meetings.
-Varsity Swimming (9th-present)
-Italian Club &amp; Italian Honor Society (10th-present): This past year another student and I started a walkathon that 50+ students participated in. About $2000 was raised by club members to support Cooley's Anemia research, a lesser known blood disease common in Italians. 
-Math Team (10th-present), Co-Captain
-Viola (3rd Grade- Present) Member of school Chamber Orchestra, tutor two younger students once a week. All County Orchestra in 10th grade. 
-Internship in a Biomedical Optics Lab this past summer in the BME Dept. at an elite university (not giving name for privacy reasons, it would be easy to find the professor I worked with).  Research was in optical imaging for early detection of cancer/dysplastic tissue. Helped grad students set up/align laser systems, prepare biological samples. Learned lab basics. (100 Hours)
-NHS, Tri-M Music Honor Society
-NY American Legion Boys State, Elected as a State Assemblyman

Essays: Still drafting but I've been working closely with a counselor and teachers to get opinions and make changes- hopefully will be good and I know this part is very subjective. 

Recommendations: School doesn't let me look at them but I expect them to be decent. Chem teacher of two years, Italian teacher/club advisor of three years, and my internship mentor who is a professor at the university I'll be applying ED to. 

I appreciate anyone's feedback. Thank you!

I tried the staircase coding challenge and I couldn't even solve that.
52467n,2,2016-09-10,Ambition,theOmnipotentKiller,theOmnipotentJournal,https://www.reddit.com/r/theOmnipotentJournal/comments/52467n/ambition/,"Ambition is intoxicating, empowering, exciting and, above all, the best motivator.

Ambition provides a ginormous impetus to the ideas lying dead in your mind. A problem that I am personally sick of hearing (from myself included) is: how do I convert my thoughts to action. I had always approached this seemingly intimidating problem through conventional means. ""Maybe it is because I don't plan meticulously. Or perhaps, I don't possess the **courage** or **grit**."" If you have followed this journal long enough, you will realize that to me every problem is a function of your courage and grit. Each and everyone of my approaches distilled the problem further till I hit this roadblock which I hadn't been able to scale for a while.

My most crucial realizations in the quest to solve this problem have been:

* Humans make decisions based on emotion; not logic.

* Courage is required to start. Grit is required to continue.

* Boredom/Ability to do deep work is the sole way of developing grit.

* Courage stems from the unique personalities and motivations of each person. The fact they hit upon this question means it is a matter of time before they develop enough courage to go ahead.

Haha I think I just summarized my summer vacation in 4 points. 

Like every diabolical product, the solution to this problem requires an essential element.

After my short experience in college and watching Pablo Escobar in Narcos, I have discovered the Secret Element X: Ambition.

I have been running around this problem in the wrong way. Most people strike upon this question once they feel an inkling of ambition. Which was true in my case as well. However, I was so focused on the technicalities of moving from thoughts to actions that I forgot the reason I even started my conquest. 

Ambition!

The word itself makes my heart churn in excitement. The unrivaled source of courage and the invincible symbol of any personality: ambition.

Till now I believed that I have been calling the students at IITB uninspiring because of their personalities (or lack of it). After meeting a sufficient amount of people, I realize that what bores me about IITians is their lack of ambition.

You are in IIT Bombay. God damn it! If you won't have ambition, then who else?!

That's what Saarthak showed me. He showed me what it is like to meet a man with high ambitions. I swear I could have pledge my life in his service when I first started talking with him. The way he would use my resources and skill set would make me feel that I was causing a disruption in this world. Though quickly enough, Saarthak became the closest friend I have ever had. Now I want to match his brazen mindset and blinding set of accolades, but in my flashy way.

For me life has been all about doing it the flashy way. It is not that I do it for the way people view it; though I won't lie I enjoy the amazement on their faces. I do it because that's how it always been and it is my way of life.

Rapping, Astrophysics, Multiple Schools, Self Help Addict, Anime-Manga-Chinese Novel Addict, Passionate Writer, Japan-o-phile, Vedic Math, Speed Reading, Fast Typist.

There has been an unsettled feeling in my heart whenever I don't follow the conventional methods. Now I realize that is fine. Too long my ambition has been burdened by worries too small.

What is my ambition?

My ambition is to leave waves so big that they disrupt every place I pass by in my life.

At my last institute, I grabbed an International Astrophysics medal.

Institute before that, I rapped. I topped Olympiads.

These waves haven't been as large as I wanted them to be. I will reach for the stars this time. College is a paradise of opportunities. The world is an even bigger forum for it.

As my ambition is becoming clearer and clearer, I have understood a couple of things.

* Majoring in Business is a must

* Self learning/Majoring in CS is imperative now

* Jump into research as soon as possible

* Start working on my start-up idea (more on this later)

---

Immediate To-Do:

1. ~~Email the professor I am interested in working with~~ [Completed]

2. ~~Set up a Meeting Agenda for the next time I meet up with the co-Founders~~ [Typing this was fun]

Long Term Goals:

1. Branch Change to CS or University Change to Stanford

2. Start a proper Entrepreneurship Club in IITB. The E-Cell here is useless as far as I can see. I guess I will approach them for funding later.

3. Collaborate on 4 Research Papers before leaving IIT/College

4. Intern at a CS Startup, ~~a Consultancy~~[My father said this would be a huge mistake], Caltech = CCC. (Lol)

5. Convert one course every semester to a MOOC

Ambition. This time I am not going to compromise. I am going through with everything I have mentioned.

This has happened multiple times in the past that I have made over-ambitious plans before/during exams and never followed up on those. This time there isn't going to be a chance I won't.

I am done with being incompetent. Academics in my institute is incomparably easy. They require diligent attention and a sharp intuition- both of which I have. I am going to fine-tune my system to a point at which it will be so efficient I will gape in awe at my own awesomeness.

PS

It might seem that I have been milking myself in this post, but this journal was created for me. If I am able to follow up to this dream, then this will help others who might find my entire self-journey."

Skipping over the fight. I 100% want to be free of them. I haven't had a chat with them about it yet. They are refusing to speak to me.


They pay for everything essentially right now of mine:
Car, insurance, rent, vet, sometimes groceries.

So I know chopping them off I have to potentially lose all of this.
Easier said than done.

My situation:
I'm 21 and enrolled full time in college as a junior in computer science. I work as a small-time cook making roughly 160$ for only 2 weeks pay, clearly, this won't cut it.

+ My rent is 409$ a month 

+ 25$ for internet. 

+ I pay roughly 60$ for gas, but that might be snipped out if I lose the car. At the end of the day, I can see I need more money.

+ food is around 50$ a week.

I just got a refund check from school for 1,700$ that went into my account which has my name on it, but my parents are the primary holders of the account. Do I have legal right to transfer that money to my new bank account I just opened up?

Also, the money came from veterans benefits that my step-father passed on to me for college, so morally it's their money, but they are cutting me off for standing up for myself, so all I care about are legalities.
*need this answered asap, I'm sure once my parents see I have this money they will try to take it away from me to make it harder to be independent, aka, force me to come back and listen to their rules.


None of my family wants to argue with me about anything, they want to assume they are right and that's that, I see this as immature. They are not willing to have a sit-down conversation with me and talk adult to adult. Even if they do it's not long before someone's feelings get hurt, usually theirs.


I'm filed under them as a dependent on taxes, otherwise, I'd owe money on taxes, which I will have to deal with obviously.


So what should I do?
I'm trying to get an internship set up for next summer, hopefully, start working on my career. I feel I NEED to finish college, and am okay with taking out loans to cover my ass in the regard. But as far as living goes, what should I do now?


edit: It feels like I'm going to be in trouble, and may not be able to pay rent eventually, other than credit score, what else should I be worried about? If I'm broke and can't pay rent, what stops me from moving into a friends house for a few months.

We instantly hit it off and became good friends. We went to different high schools 4 years ago but reconnected through fb about a year ago and I could say now he's one of my closest friends.

This past year we've been texting almost 24/7 and we've met a few times. But after cancelling one meeting a few months ago, I felt as if something has changed. He stopped starting conversations and if I didn't text him, we would just stop talking for weeks at a time. 

Lately he's been insisting on meeting with me but I couldn't because each time he asked I was either out of the country or out of town. 

Yesterday I texted him about a funny thing that happened at a kindergarten (I have an internship) and asked if his day/week was also interesting. He responded immediately and told me a story about him and his girlfriend.

After asking him why didn't he tell me about her earlier he said he wanted to tell me in person. They have been together for a couple of months. I figured that they got together at the time he stopped talking with me as often as he used to.

Should I step back and stop texting him? He doesn't text me first now and I feel like I'm a bother now that he's in a relationship. 

I've also developed a mild crush on him a few months ago (I've cancelled that meeting because I wanted to sort out my feelings) but it doesn't really matter now, I guess.

A few years ago I lurked in this subreddit and started to do some research around cigars. Back then, being able to afford cigars was out of the question (probably because I was 16 I believe), so I just got a (very) small humidor, which waited on a shelve until recently.

And so now I stand there, having finished my first internship as a fisherman, and I got paid for the work I've done. Came as a surprise, but with that I was finally able to afford something that's been sitting in the back of my mind for years. I finally got a good bunch of cigars. Now it's sitting in my humidor, and it's just waiting to be smoked whenever the time permits it.

I could tell you what I bought (Nah I just don't remember), but why bother when I got **[pictures](http://imgur.com/a/5fUvD)** ? *Threw in a bonus photo, the last day of my internship/work*

And I'm not sure if the choices for my first cigars were the right one, but I've been to a place where the woman selling them seemed very knowledgeable. And the place is gorgeous, they got a shitton of tobacco-related products (so I don't list everything), the look is very clean, quite big... It's just the way I wanted it to be, really.

Anywho, I hope this sunday will be bright, I'd like to smoke one before autumn hits Brittany hard. 

Thank you for existing and keeping this idea in the back of my head all this time. Have a great day.

I am interested in pursuing higher education and do research in the same.

I can go ahead in the following ways:
1. Apply for Masters for fall 2017 intake. I feel that the coursework might get redundant and i would be forced to take up a job to repay loans
2. Apply for Phd directly for fall 2017 intake. However, this will be difficult as I have no prior research experience and average performance in Undergrad
3. Apply for yearlong unpaid internships under professors and get relevant research experience. And then apply for direct Phd

Can you please advice me on the best way to go forward. I am sure there are many like me that are facing a similar dilemma.

I've never felt like I've fitted in in this industry; all my peers seem to have been coding since they were 12, have done tons of side projects and have a github and all that, and know a bunch of languages we were never taught in class, and I've mostly just done what classes require; I've done one side project and I know how to make it sound impressive if needed, but I don't think it's actually very impressive and an experienced interviewer could probably figure that out. I also doubt my technical interview skills will be up to par.

Thing is, I'm not really sure I want to go into software development, and I'm leaning towards becoming an Actuary. But I haven't yet passed the actuarial exams (taking them soon, before graduation, but that doesn't leave me much time to find anything), so I can't really apply to actuarial companies at this time, and I need a job when I graduate. And studying for actuarial exams is taking up all my spare time - having to brush up on my CS interviewing skills in addition to that, and coursework, could get rather overwhelming.

So, does anyone have any recommendations for someone like me? Could I get a decent-paying ($65k or so a year) job in a company that's not a major tech company (like insurance or something) without having great technical interviewing skills?

525cvi,1,2016-09-10,HELP! Considering Architecture,coopzors,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/525cvi/help_considering_architecture/,"Hey everyone,

My name is Cooper. I'm a 19 year-old student in attendance at Kennesaw State University, and I need advice! I would like to ask you folks the following:

**1) How can I determine if architecture is the right career for me?**

**2) What advice would you offer to someone considering architecture as a pursuit?**

**3) Where can I learn more about the daily responsibilities of an architect?**

**Background:** I am thinking about changing my major to architecture, but not without doing my research. I am a sophomore in college, and I have been a music ed major, a music performance major, and a computer science major. I have had some difficulty finding my career, and now, I am simply undeclared in my studies. I've been taking ""general education"" courses, which apply towards just about any major I could choose, in order to buy me some time to make this ""major"" decision (pun intended). Anyways, while I have always considered architecture a fascinating and mysterious career, the idea of majoring in architecture really caught a hold of me a few days ago, and it has not escaped my focus. I've turned through a number of podcasts and youtube videos, and it seems like it may be a great fit for me as a career.

**About me:** I strongly identify with the Meyers-Briggs ENTP personality type, and it was through an MBTI website that Architecture was suggested to me as a career. I have always been very spatial, and had a knack for construction/creative toys like Legos, Lincoln Logs, K'nex, and video games like Minecraft. My best experience with any of these toys has been the times I made my own creations without the aid of instructions, and this is how I spent about 90% of my childhood playtime! I am a very creative and artistic person, and have taken music lessons across piano and percussion for 14 years. I love to draw. I am intellectual (Official IQ of 130, processing score of 132), in both a lingual and mathematical sense. I have a great appreciation for art and architecture, and like a true ENTP, I am obsessed with learning new things and finding new interests (hence my difficulty in finding a niche; I want to do EVERYTHING)! My mother was an architecture major in college, and worked in an architect's office before marrying my dad and becoming a full-time mom, so I may have a genetic disposition (if such a thing exists (it probably doesn't)).

With all of that said, I understand that an Architect's education involves a 5-year degree program, followed by a three-year internship, and I welcome the academic rigor with open arms. I would be very appreciative if you folks could offer me any sort of insight or share your experience, I'd really just love to hear what you have to say.

Thanks!"

The quick story is that he's been ""absent"" for about a year and then he had an affair with another woman. 

I tried to make it work. We went to counseling. But he never stopped talking to his little girlfriend (a different girl.) So at that point I tried to move on.

I graduated in may and then finished my internship. Then I broke. I ended up on medication to help with anxiety. I gave him so much of me.

But I'm trying my best to build myself. I've learned so much about self love and self worth. 

I've actually tried to have some kind of relationship with him so we've been very amicable towards each other. Talked with each other everyday. 

He saw all of his little girls. And I tried meeting guys. Everytime I met with one he pulled the ""I want to be with you"" crap.

It's really disgusting how he could tell me that one second but then have sex with a different girl the next.

Anyways, I know better now but he's cutting me off financially. I just got a new job and make decent money. Not as much as him. 

I am forced to get a roommate. But how can he break his vow and just walk away from his responsibilities?

I left my family and what I know and moved away with him. I wanted to spend my life with him. We worked together to end up in the home (renting) that I'm in now. 

I plan to meet with an attorney soon. I should've done it awhile ago. I guess I was waiting to see if he would even try. 

But do I have any rights to have him continue helping with bills even though he doesn't live here? "

Wondering if others could share their experience with negotiating pay. I have interviewed at two hospitals, 1 is unionized and the other is not. From my understanding it is more difficult to negotiate wages from a union, as pay is experienced based. I plan on trying to negotiate my wage through the hospital that is not unionized. I used AND's salary calculator and based on my area, education, and experience, it calculated I should be paid 25.96/hr (54,000 per year). However, I reviewed the Academy's ""Compensation &amp; Benefits Survey of the Dietetics Profession 2015"" and the 50th percentile for my area is 34.62/hr (74,000 per year), which is most likely heavily skewed by more experienced dietitians. I am wondering what a good starting point would be for me to begin negotiating? Any experiences/insights would be much appreciated as this is an area that I think our field is lacking.

A little background about me: I have a MS degree and recent internship grad from a largely teaching hospital that was heavily clinically focused. I received top notch training and feel highly confident I could step into a clinical position and provide value right away with minimal guidance. Biggest factor I feel like in terms of negotiating power is my lack of experience as an actual practicing RD, despite my excellent training from my internship."

At the time I was depressed, lazy and immature, and my GPA and overall motivation reflected that. I dropped out after my second semester and entered the ""real world.""

The real world, as it turns out, has consisted of part-time minimum wage retail and food service jobs because I lack both education and connections. I became sick of this and decided it was time to get my shit together.

I started at my local community college last year at the age of 23. I am involved with extracurricular clubs, studying hard (4.0 community college GPA with full-time schooling + two part-time jobs!), and have just been accepted into a Bachelor's program at my old university. I will be 26 or 27 when I graduate, depending on internships.

But my family - aunts, uncles, cousins, grandparents - are always trying to get me to drop out. They say that it's too late for me and I won't stand a chance at competing against fresh graduates 4+ years younger than me. They also say that no employer would want to hire an inexperienced 26-27 year old. 

Normally, I would ignore their opinions. They live in a small, rural Midwest county where people have equally small minds (my parents moved away from there along time ago). But now my parents, my mom (45F) especially, has expressed similar sentiments. 

She says she worries that I'll drop out again or flunk out, or that even if I graduate I'll never be able to get a professional job due to my age. She worries that I won't be able to pay back my loans and she and my dad will be, in her words, ""stuck with you [me] forever."" My dad [48M] has also admitted in the past that he's deeply embarrassed his 20-something daughter is still living in the family home - although that's probably a separate issue. All of this has planted seeds of doubt into my head.

So I know that my education is very important and that I should absolutely continue it. My question is: how do I push their negativity aside?

  **tl;dr**: Family thinks that I'm too old to go to college or make something of myself. How do I push myself past this negativity?"

After studying for the GMAT for 4 months, I took the test today and received a 540 (Q43, V22, IR 7). In my GMATPrep practice tests, I was scoring 620s. Due to family issues, and with round 1 admission deadlines around the corner, I am not able to retake the GMAT.  I was hoping to receive some feedback on whether I have a chance at some of my target schools before I spend the time to write essays and pay for applications. I know I do not hit the 80% range for my target mba programs and have a lower gpa than the listed class profiles.

""Good evening my fellow blood-worshippers of the Dark Blood Gods, it is I, Blood-Lord Evil Painsword, here to bring you some bloody news. The Department of Darkness has emerged from the shadows of my own twisted mind, and it has one terrible, awful, vile, and loathsome mission: to spread darkness and blood-darkness. Now, I must say, I quite none of you, as my tortured soul cannot feel any emotion but pure sadness, pain, and anger. I am in a blood-filled coffin of my own regret, and if any of you feel the same, find me. I can blood-give away coffins, black trenchcoats, skeleton blood-gloves, and blood(maybe real, maybe fake, who knows? I'm a wildcard).""

*He disappears, and the screen now shows some bats that are bloody and wearing trenchcoats. It then cuts back to whatever was on.*

*It then hastily cuts back to him, and he sounds out of breath.*

""What I provide is a way to SACRIFCE THE WRETCHED AND PURE INTERNS TO THE DARK BLOOD GODS FOR BLOOD GIFTS, BLOOD STUFF, AND BLOOD.""

*By blood gods he meant his garage, and by ""Gifts"" he meant shitty trinkets. After all, he was a man on a covert mission. He wanted to save interns. By making it seem like they will die, many will give away the poor guys, and from there, he takes them. His interns are all free range(in his underground pasture) and fed a diet of ""food he smuggles in"". From there, the adorable guys are sent out in an ""Underground Railroad"" of sorts, where they can run free and try to rejoin normal society.*"

We can discuss specific prompts in private and please, do not message me with a scene already started, that’s the easiest way to get blocked. The same goes for one line/word messages.

I'm fairly open with my kinks with my only hard ""no""s being scat, unrealistically huge cocks, 3rd person writing, and vomit.

Without further ado, here are some of my prompts:

**The Lawyer and the Con**: For this one, I was thinking I’d play a young and up and coming lawyer tasked with defending you. We can discuss the specifics in PMs but one thing is for certain, I’ll be taking my payment in the form of cock.

**Breaking the Law**: For this one, the roles are reversed, I was caught committing a crime and you’re the officer/journalist/detective who caught me. Where that leads? Well that’s up to you.

**Wrong neighborhood**: What happens when me, a young and sexy girl finds herself in the wrong neighborhood? Do you help me find my way or decide you want to take advantage?

**Sports Star and Reporter**: A classic scene were I’m a reporter and you’re the sports star, that can only lead one place, right?

**The intern and the boss**: Fairly self explanatory, I’d love to be the intern at her dream job who meets you, her boss and potentially so much more.

**Opposite Sides**: For this one, I want to play a FBI/CIA/DEA Agent who is tasked with infiltrating your organization, now what that organization does we can discuss in PMs but I basically want you to turn me from righteous agent of the law into your slut.

**I’m gonna fuck your sister**: For this one, you’ll play my little brother’s best friend, I’ll be his big sister who is now recently single and back in town. You guys always joked that you would fuck each other’s mom/sister only this time, you’re not joking.

**Giving back**: In this RP, I’ll play someone  famous be it an actress or singer or sports star. You’ll be the person tasked in helping me set up some sort of event to give back to the community, only you want me to give you something more than this event.

**Bullies always win**: In this one, you’ll be as the title suggests, you’re a bully who grew up terrorizing my son (or brother), only unlike the stories we tell our kids to make them feel better, you know better. You get what you want, when you want it, in this case, me.

For those of you so inclined, I do like playing celebs in any of these roles so we have visual aids, if you’d like me to be any, just ask!

As for celebs I’d play, here are a few, feel free to ask about ones not listed:

Celebs: **Mary Elizabeth Winstead**, **Maisie Williams**, Anna Kendrick, Selena Gomez, Hailee Steinfeld, Taylor Swift, Willa Holland, Daisy Ridley, **Melissa Benoist**, Emma Stone/Watson/Roberts, Hayley Williams, Alison Brie, Alexandra Daddario, Aubrey Plaza, Bella Thorne, **Alicia Vikander** Jennifer Lawrence, Keri Russel, Neve Campbell, Jennifer Connelly, Scarlet Johansson, Sophie Turner, Oliva Munn, Olivia Wilde, **Miranda Kerr**, Jessica Biel/Alba, Victoria Justice

YouTube/Social Media: **Meg Turney**, Lia Marie Johnson, **Alli Speed**, Barbara Dunkelman, Ashley Jenkins, **Bree Essrig**, Maude Garrett, Trisha Hershberger, Datev Gallagher, Lindsey Stirling, Christina Grimme, Dodger, iJustine, or Meghan Camarena.

Whew, that was a lot. Hope to get some dirty orangereds soon!

My buddy contacted me about an internship position at his company. I wasn't getting much luck applying on my own, so I took the opportunity. I've been out of school for 2 years, so an internship position on my resume may put some recruiters off. It would probably also lower my negotiating power (as I have experienced in the final round of interviews during my most recent interview). Do I have to tell potential employers that this was an internship position? Can't I just say it is a contract position (as that what my boss calls it sometimes). I am also an official employee of a 3rd party and not an employee of the company (Sounds a lot like a contractor to me). Anyways, even if I do land a full time role at this company, I think they may offer a lower salary, so I want to have some options open to me."

At this point, I'm seriously considering the program for the Winter quarter. Wanted to ask a few questions and see if this plan is feasible. Any feedback is greatly appreciated!

- Can't help but see the same set of courses listed in the tracks and class descriptions. As Post-bacc online students, are we allowed to take CS electives? Or are these the only classes available for online? Ex: can I take another CS course instead of CS 372 - Intro to Computer Networks?

- My hope is to start the program with my full time job with 2 classes/quarter, then maybe after 2-3 quarters, transition to full time student until I finish. My thought process on that is with a full time job, I'd only have the energy for classes. But as a full time student, I would like to use spare juices to look for internships, participate in open source projects or networking events (I live in Bay area), learn and build things that can hopefully help with career search. Is this plan feasible? Would there be some logistical issue (aka can't get classes, etc.)? Has anyone had any experience with something similar?

- For any alums working in the Bay Area: after completing your degree, how competitive were you in the region, and how were your job prospects? I'm a little intimidated here with so many prestigious colleges in the area  and around producing solid engineers, and companies having such high standards.

Thanks for any feedback!"

527zr1,2,2016-09-11,I am drowning.,takgnur,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/527zr1/i_am_drowning/,"I'm feeling lost. I'm not here seeking sympathy or someone to fix my entire life. I just need to get this out of my head and into words. This will probably be a wall of text. 

Three months ago I lost my grandma. I know a lot of people hear that and automatically think 'oh but it's just a grandparent at least it's not your mother/father/cousin/sibling/whatever. But my grandma was and always will be my biggest inspiration and the only constant in a life filled with so much uncertainty (child of divorce, moved houses 13 times, met way too many of mum's partners, hostile relationship with dad). When she passed, I didn't get to say goodbye which to this day cuts so deep. But I haven't fully processed it because I've gone into denial: she lives interstate so this just feels like it's been a while since I've visited her. But it hurts. I could write about this for days. 
Anyway she was amazing at everything, a published academic, selfless humanitarian, avid churchgoer but not the preachy type, she just adopted the morals (I'm atheist) and the most loving family member you could ask for. But she was also tenacious and her will was so inspiring. So when she passed, I decided to get my shit together in her honour. I have had generalised anxiety disorder for most of my life and bouts of depression more times than I can count and I have always let it consume me, I finished a psychology degree last year and realised my passion lies in the environment so that went to waste, I was drinking and partying far too much, I was stuck in a dead end supermarket job and I had no savings. I could go on but suffice it to say; pretty well every aspect of my life was in shambles. 
So I started seeing my psychologist again and started taking medication. I applied for a masters degree in environmental policy &amp; management, and I got in. I stopped drinking and using other substances and I'm still going strong. I saved a few thousand dollars and I started mending my relationships with my family. Five weeks into my degree I landed my dream research internship helping a humanitarian organisation go carbon neutral. 
Everything was on the up, but I'm exhausted. I'm juggling working part time, the internship, the volunteer work I do weekly, and Uni. Plus somewhere in there I have to fit a social life and family time. 

And then I met someone. Three weeks. It took three weeks for him to walk into my life, go from friends, to more than that, to sleeping together and spending every second night with each other, to walking back out. We'd met each other's parents because we live at home. I adore him. But he is emotionally unavailable so two days ago, we called it off. He's not ready and we are both so torn because the only factor that is an issue is timing. They say if you have chemistry all you need is timing. But timing is a bitch: basically, my life is an ode to that saying. I love him. I think that's the problem. It's not necessarily that I'm IN love with him, rather that I have such abundant, pure, unconditional love FOR him. I love the things he loves about me. I love the things that make him. I love how I feel when I'm with him. I love knowing I make him happy. I love how easy it was with him. I don't know how to let go of that. I don't know if I can let go of him. 

And now, my grandfather has had a stroke. The doctors have already said they don't expect him to live (he also has bowel cancer, diabetes and numerous other health issues and this isn't his first stroke) and in his last will he requested a DNR, so we are literally here waiting for him to die. He's been unconscious for three days now, the 'death rattle' in his lungs grows worse with every minute that passes and his care is palliative. I can't believe we have to go through this again so soon. 

Right now, as I type this, I feel as though I am drowning. I'm suffocating. I have assignments due and reports to write and I've taken the last few days off work because I can't get out of bed so this week I'll be fucked financially. My entire family is so tense because of pop so we're all fighting and home is awful. I want to talk to my friends but I feel like none of them can give me the support I need. I just want to sleep for a month until all of this is over. 

Tl;dr lost my grandma, got my shit together, met someone beautiful, lost him, about to lose my grandfather and now I feel like everything else is falling apart. "

Decent / Decent Foundation

**Value Proposition**

DECENT is a decentralized content distribution platform that utilizes blockchain technology to ensure trust and security. The platform will be open source. Freedom from censorship, fair rewards for publishers and anonymity (if so desired) are mentioned as key advantages.

[Whitepaper](https://decent.ch/src/decent-whitepaper.pdf)

**Customer Segment**

Content producers, content consumers, miners (called ""Publishers"" by Decent).

**Technology**

The whitepaper is not yet entirely clear on the tech stack that will be used. Blockchain technologies are mentioned, Kademlia DHT and Bittorrent for content distribution. Apparently, parts of the software are already in development.

**Team**

The company mentions a Swiss and a Slovak office. There are three Founders: Matej Boda, Matej Michalko and Wayman Kwan. The core team consists of 13 persons total, plus four ambassadors and four advisors. 

**CV Matej B (from their website):** Matej was always interested in new technologies and future progress. During his studies at the Technical University in Bratislava he took an internship in BMW Munich as a technical concept creator. Although his background is in applied mechanics, he became involved in blockchain based technologies in 2013. Fascinated by the decentralized protocols, he was interested in the cryptocurrency mining at first. Since then he has supported the community by helping to organize events such as Central European Bitcoin Expo Vienna and Bitcoin 2 Business Congress Brussels, advising on mining technologies and discussing future possibilities for blockchain. Currently he is focusing on the main project – DECENT platform – he co-founded.

**CV Matej M (from their website):** Matej’s interest in online privacy was fueled first while studying Computer Science at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne where he completed a project concerning the privacy protection of mobile phone users for Nokia Research Center. Since then he became more and more involved with Bitcoin. Mining at his own laptop in the beginning, then organizing cryptocurrency conferences around the world (Austria, China, Belgium, UK, …). He also founded the first Bitcoin Marketing agency in the world. Matej has operated from multiple countries, including the UK, Isle of Man, Switzerland, Slovakia or China. Since the beginning he is passionate about the immense potential of blockchain technologies. Thereby, he founded DECENT last year.

**CV Wayman Kwan (from their website):** Wayman Kwan is a venture capital investor partner of Elements Capital LLC, USA. He was responsible for the business development, financing and promotional activities in several international companies. He founded a private information services team providing finance and investment advice to the companies around Asia and became a partner in Malaysian and Chinese Joint Venture. He is a well-recognized investment advisor and also participates in many other non-profit and charitable organizations such as Rotary International, Negeri Sembilan Royal Anti-drug Association and Malacca Shooting Association.

[Team Page](https://decent.ch/about/#team)

**ICO offering details**

ICO starts at 1:00pm GMT Sunday, 11th of September. Duration: 8 weeks.

70% of the total available DCT (""fuel of the network"") will be distributed initially, 30% will be made available to miners later on. Of the initial distribution, 10% of the tokens go to the Decent Foundation, 2% go into an ""Investment Fund"", 1'000'000 go to the bounty program, 3'000'000 go to the marketing program. The rest is sold in the ICO. I did not find the total number of tokens to be created, only percentage numbers. Sale starts at 5000DCT/BTC (+50% bonus on the first day, up to 10M DCT), going down to 3000DCT/BTC over time. 

**Update:** Decent just reiterated that ""The final amount of DCT will be determined by ICO results. DCT distributed during ICO will represent 70% of the total DCT ever issued."" on Bitcointalk. I find the combination of relative and absolute numbers a bit confusing, but in the end, 70% seems to go out to ICO participants (plus the devs), 30% to miners. 

**Update 2:** Decent made the 50% bonus ""dependable"" by removing the 10M cap and prolonging it until today (September 11th), 11PM GMT. Good reaction.

Everything that I never had in high school.  
I helped people too. I made sure I made it a safe and welcoming community. I made sure everyone was able to voice their opinions freely and that everyone got along well.  
Things were good for so long. 

That was all until this one asshole whom I thought was a friend went and stabbed me in the back.  
He started talking shit about me behind my back and taking all the credit of all my hard work that I had put in to making sure the group was a fun, fair and safe place for everyone.  
They ended up kicking me out and ostracising me from the group that I had spent more than 5 years of my life building. 

5 years of blood, sweat and tears.  
5 years of working 80 hour weeks. 
5 years of getting paid for a 40 hour week at minimum wage. 
5 years of lost friendships. 

I had dedicated my life for 5 years to the community of this company, only to be shafted and given nothing to show for it.  
I put my life on hold and missed out on so many things because of it.  
I missed out on going to college because I didn't have the time to go. 
I missed out on my dream job to work an unpaid internship. 
I missed out on countless chances of seeing family for the last time because I had to work while the backstabber was able to go home early just because he felt like it. 

The schism happened earlier this year. 

Between then and now has been nothing but a roller coaster.  
I've attempted suicide at least six times, almost succeeded twice. Was homeless for a few months. Was less of a shell of a human being.  
However I've finally found a job after searching for more than half a year, managed to get a house, fixed my relationship with my partner and am slowly becoming more stable. 

The only thing I'm missing now is friendship. 

Since the incident, I only have three friends. 

One of them hasn't spoken to me in over a month even though I try and make conversation all the time. 

Another has slowly started shutting me out by giving me short and abrupt answers and no longer reciprocating any conversation. 

The other is stuck with me because we live together, but I feel like they're only with me because they feel sorry for me. 


So that's my life in a nut shell.  
I don't know why I made this post.  
I just feel like I'm useless and so easily forgotten and wanted to vent. 

Thank you for reading this, it means a lot that someone has taken the time to listen to me ramble.  
You don't even have to reply, just knowing that someone out there has taken the time to listen makes me feel better. "

My parents are not physically or verbally abusive, but I think they're emotionally abusive.

* my mom always reminds me that I messed up my first 2 years of high school by not taking electives.
* they both always tell me they can't pay for my college, when i've told them both i've never expected them to pay for it. In fact my dad got angry the one time I told him my plan to get through college without debt or his help.
* they tell me all the time about how I hate them and don't love them and I don't spend enough time with them.
* When I came to theconclusion that I'm an atheist my dad asked if I got off to deqd bodies.
* I've overheard them talking about me before and they've said that I'm a narcissist, that I enjoy the pain, etc.
* I have severe clinical depression and I've probably had it most of my childhood, they finally took me to our doctor at 16 aand they said tney knew for about a year, but i wouldn't listen to them.
* When I told them I was transgender, my went off and did ""research"" and asked if I had sexual fantasies about imagining being a woman or got off to it.
* my mom always tells me not to blame her if I don't get anywhere because of highschool. (I'm homeschooled, so she's in charge of my education)
* whenever I do something good like coming in the top 17% on the SAT it's because of her, but if I failed something it's my fault (which it is)
* After I told them I was transgender they stepped up the usage of my birth name and gender and refered to me a lot by ""son"" and they knew it bothered me
* they talk bad about my friends and their friends and family when they're not around.
* my mom's told me before that i'm a ""horrible bigoted person who nobody likes"" and ""the most hateful person she has ever seen""
* if I disagree with my mom at all, it cascades into a fight (being her yelling at me and me sitting there shutting down, because I can't deal with people yelling at me and her getting angrier)
* when I go to the doctors, my dad comes with me and asks, ""do you want me to go with you"", I say, ""I don't care"", so I don't start anything, and he stays there the entire exam.
* when we go on vacation my mom finds some way to tell me I've ruined it for everyone.
* whenever I break one of their rules, they take all of my electronics and my communication to my friends and my hobbies.
* they almost kicked me out, because I'm an atheist, to live with my grandmother, but they said, ""we couldn't do that to her""
* When I asked if I could see a therapist my mom said, ""I guess I could dump all of you kids into a public school and pick up a job just for you"", I would have understood if she had just said we don't have the budget.
* a few months later (about 9 months?) they were looking for a therapist to ""help me with my gender problem"" and I asked some question I've forgotten and my dad picks up the list of therapists in our area, rips it in half, hands it to me and says, ""there, you can find your own and pay for it too""
* we're currently on vacation and the other day my dad got upset because I took a nap, which they told me I should, and I didn't wake up when my grandparent's came back from their hotel, even though they said they'd wake me up when my grandparents were coming back.
* my parents like to remind me how much I look like my dad and how manly and masculine I must be.
* I own about 30 pairs of clothes, about 4 of those are normal, the rest are for church, the only place I leave my home for.
* I loved playing my cello, they loved bragging about how smart I was and how fast I learned to play it to friends, you know and then a year later made me sell it after my teacher moved so they could pay for this really expensive math program
* they like to rag on me about how I'm always on my computer, even though that got me in contact with google for a scholarship possibility, a paid internship if I go to a university nearby, and a job right after graduation, which they say is do to my mom's teaching skills.

My mom's background:
Comes from an abusive family who were drug addicts and alcholics.
My dad's background:
Comes from a family where hise mom was ""emptionally unavailable"" and his dad cheated on her for romance, not sex.

Sorry I guess that was really long."

I have been following this sub reddit since quite a while. All I have seen is people with top profiles, top colleges, top internship, top CGPA, etc. 

Heck, even on the internet all I land upon is people graduating from top schools with an internship at the Big 4, with already multiple jobs in hand.

Is there a place for a student with 3.5 GPA from an average school, very few side projects, and average coding? I can solve few hacker rank, leet code problems, never tried too hard. 

I am worried, thinking I am not good enough. I don't have major side projects, never worked in a collaborative manner with a team. I don't aim for Big 4, but a job with average or decent pay, good work culture at some small college town which is not expensive and crowded. 

Can I do it? How much efforts are required? 

TL;DR: Average student in all aspects, can I land a average job being an average student?
Using a throwaway. 

Thanks in Advance !"

Some questions I have:

1. What kind of clothes should I wear? I'm unsure how fancy I should dress. 

2. Since they are flying me to NYC, how likely am I to get the job, they should can't fly everybody in to interview right?

3. I'll probably be quizzed again in person and have to code on a whiteboard right?

4. Should I practice leetcode or CTCI?

What else should I expect or do before my interview? I would be estatic if I received an offer but I'm sure there are people much better than me so I'm not going to get my hopes up. Any and all advice would be great. This community has helped me so much already and I really appreciate the kind people in this sub.

I realize that if I were to apply to summer internships, I would be severely lacking in knowledge right now but would gain it over the year. With this in mind, should I still apply to internships but mention somehow that these are courses I will have completed by the summer and have not yet completed? Not mentioning I haven't completed them yet doesn't really sit well with me, as if I'm somehow lying."
52atdw,3,2016-09-11,I [24M] failed/betrayed my girlfriend [22F] of 5 years by accepting a position,thrillthrillthrill,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/52atdw/i_24m_failedbetrayed_my_girlfriend_22f_of_5_years/,"Dear people of /r/offmychest,

This is a throwaway account for obvious reason. 

First off, a little bit of background. I am a 24-year-old guy from France who finished college (MSc in Biotchnology) in 2015. 
I have been in a relationship with my girlfriend since I am 18 (she was 16) and it is my first serious relationship ever. She is currently completing her lat year in college before going to law school. 
We've been living together for a year and half in 2013-2014, partly supported by our respective families, but since my parents broke up in 2014 we moved back to our parents place for a while. 

After finishing my degree (summer/fall 2015), I was hesitant about starting a PhD or not (something that is very standard in my field) so I decided to tke one year to make my mind and I took a job that was offered in the lab in which I had done my Master internship. 
Since it provided my first 'stable' (only a few months) source of income, we decided to take a flat together again (we got it in february 2016). Before we took the flat, my girlfriend asked me if I had any plans to move abroad... This is where I fucked up: I promised my girlfriend that even if I was to do a PhD, I would find something in the area. 
Which was completely absurd to promise as I had no idea what I would do.  

So, we move together, take back our stuff that was stored in cardboards since 2014, and I don't think about the future at all. Actually, around mid-April I still did not know what I wanted to do and started to worry about not having anything after summer (the end of my contract). 
There is another important aspect here: my gf is still studying so I pay for the whole rent+bills. We were supposed to benefit form some housing financial help from the state but as I type those lines nothing happened. Everything combined was about 60% of my income and I'm stressed out regarding money issues since we moved here...

So, as I begin to be worried, I decide to apply to 'big' PhD programs, just by blind luck, convinced that this would lead nowhere as I'm not a top-class student form a top-ranked university. I actually applied to 2 programs, each time at the very last minute and with very sloppy application files... I really feel ashamed about that. My other option was t apply for a PhD with my current boss, which was OK (but not so great, and I was not passionate about the subject, and I don't really like the way he works). 
Still, by an unlikely event of luck, one of my applications led to an interview, which I enjoyed (I don't know why I had a rush of confidence during it) and at the end of it the guy was ready to give me the offer. He gave me a few weeks to think about it and let him know if I want the job.

And this is where it gets really messy... The lab for this PhD is 300 km away from our flat with my gf, in a neighbor country (Belgium). I will have to do three internships in France, Norway and Spain (a few months each), something that I was dreaming about (being paid to study and travel around Europe). 
It is a really promising opportunity (top university -at least in life sciences- in which I would have no chances to enter if I was not that lucky, one of the best fellowship I could obtain in Europe). 

I eventually told my girlfriend (after days and nights of worrying about her reaction) that I had this opportunity and that I wanted to go. 
I decided to accept the position (a bit in a whim, something like 2 hours before the deadline for my answer). 

This decision completely destroyed the relationship: 

* My girlfriend feels betrayed as she took this flat to be with me, and only a few months afterwards I tell her I will to leave. Even if I told here that we could keep the flat, I would still pay for it, and I would visit her 2 WE a month as I only need 4 hours of travel, it's not the same...
* When I told her parents about that, they completely freaked out and told me I betrayed them (at the time her father lost his job, but he found a new one now) as they had helped with the flat (buying stuff for their daughter, helping to move stuff around). They were so upset they spent a few hours telling me everything negative they had been thinking about me for all these years (including things about my parents, friends, family). 
* My girlfriend does not want to be engaged anymore does not trust me anymore
* I cannot believe how selfish I've been when I decided to go for it, I'm really disgusted with myself.But I cannot help to think things like 'it's better to do these things now than when we have children or a mortgage', or 'it is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity' or trivial things like that.

Still the starting date (october) approaches, day by day. I have a lot of documentation to do, mails to send, files to complete and to find a flat there, and I feel unable to do any of these things, especially when my girlfriend is around. I'm so ashamed I cannot even do that properly.

Any advice or comment on this whole situation is welcome. 

**TL;DR:** I'm an asshole that moved in with his girlfriend of 5 years only to tell her that I had the possibility to do a PhD 300 km away from where we live. 
Guilt, fear and doubts make me unable to complete any of the tasks I have to work on before starting. "
52b536,3,2016-09-11,Mom turned covert flying monkey,ripestpeach,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/52b536/mom_turned_covert_flying_monkey/,"So I think I've posted about this before but ever since leaving my Naunt's home to live with my boyfriend, my mom's been increasingly distant. 

I would tell her about all the emotionally abusive stuff Naunt was doing and my mom would console me but remind me to ""just let it roll off your back, she's just intense,"" which worked for a while but eventually didn't cut it. 

After I moved out, my aunt sent me a couple nasty emails but that's it. She of course told my cousin and my mom about what had happened and the flying monkeys started in. I held my ground while also respecting their desire to continue a relationship with Naunt and the campaign to have me make up with her diffused quickly. 

Over the past month and a half though, my mom (who lives in a different state for reference) has gotten increasingly distant and when we do talk, she underhandedly finds ways to disapprove of most everything I do. I'm about to graduate with a bachelors degree, am working at a great internship but all she wants to do is criticize everything I'm doing, as if it's simply not enough. She openly admits to talking to my aunt quite often, even though for the two years I lived with my aunt, my mom was completely ignored by her. Now suddenly that I'm not there, it's like their best friends. 

My mom's a hypochondriac and has recently been acting up more than usual with that (having an ambulance pick her up at a restaurant, refusing to let my dad drive her to a hospital and then being rude to the multiple doctors telling her nothing's wrong with her). I'm annoyed by this behavior but now she has this added negativity when we talk. I snapped a little today on the phone with her and told her to stop asking me so many questions and criticizing me because I just wanted a pleasant conversation with her and she hung up on me, screening my texts and calls afterward.

I feel like my aunt has had a huge impact on her somehow recently, though I could just be paranoid. I guess this is sort of venting but also, has anyone experienced anything similar? I didn't think my own mom would turn against me..."
52bcj9,8,2016-09-11,I [26M] feel like my GF [25] of three years always puts me last,MasterLenor,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/52bcj9/i_26m_feel_like_my_gf_25_of_three_years_always/,"Evening guys, 

Me [26 M] and my GF [25] are dating now for almost three years now. For two years now we are living in a long distance relationship (I took an job offer in the UK and she lives in Portugal). For a year now I feel like she always puts me last. She just spent 7 months in the States for an internship and after her stay there she only planned 4 days for me to see each other before going back to university to start graduate school.


Please, do not get me wrong. I really appreciate it that she is going to graduate school and I think it is really important these days to be supportive in a relationship regarding such topics. But to be honest, I was a little disappointed that she only planned to see me for four days after we haven't seen for four months (I visited her during her internship in the states - just to avoid any confusion). 


After the four days of her stay I made a trip to Portugal to visit her and her family and stayed for about 10 days. This was like three weeks ago. In total I spent all my vacation but two days for her for this year. I'm trying to save up those two days to see my family in my home country during christmas. 


It is not about the money, her family is quite wealthy and I do not have any problems to pay for her flights (which I actually already did a couple of times). I always try to make time for her, ALWAYS pick her up from the airport and ALWAYS bring her to the airport when she leaves (and thus do overhours at work to do so)


I feel like this might all be a little confusing so I try to narrow it down in a simple way:

- during her internship in the states, I went through hell. She barely wanted to talk to me, never replied texts when she was out (because her 'phone died' or she 'was out of data' or she 'did not have any network')

- we only talked during the weekends (and only when she really made time for me)

- our calls had a duration of like 8 to 15 min. - in the best cases 

- when I visited her in the states for about 2.5 weeks (to be there for her birthday) she only took off 2 days from work in order to spend time with me

- during that time I also found out that there have been two 'kind-of-dates' with other guys...(I went over it - enough said about that - 'water under the bridge')

- on my birthday I just got a quick call from her, because she was too tired (it was a Sunday)

- personal problems on my side as in serious sickness, stress, but also accomplishments did not really interested her


My current problems: 

- i feel like she does not want to make time for me so we can see each other

- the thing with the four day visit, after not seeing each other for several months 

- she also is now volunteering in another project of her university and will be in another country over christmas and new years (our 4 year anniversary). And I wasn't really sure what that means for her, because I feel she does not mind it - and obviously I do.



--&gt; to be a little more specific: From January this year on I feel like that I have done everything possible to talk to her, to see her, meet her and so on and did barely get anything in return. I literally feel like I 'run after her' for now 9 months by now. For me it is not only frustrating but it also makes me almost depressive every now and then (and I actually consider myself a quite happy person). 

What I would like to know is if I am overreacting. Again, please do not get me wrong. I really support her in her things regarding university and volunteering there at the same time. But I always feel like she barely thinks about our relationship or me in general and it just keeps me up at night and keeps my mind busy at work. And of course I know it is hard to handle such things (university in general, but also volunteering at the same time), while being in a (long-distance) relationship. Did anybody of every had similar issues and if so, how did you resolve them?

I really appreciate any help and input from you guys. Many thanks in advance!!!


TL;DR: relationship (mostly long distance) of three years in total, GF does not make any time for me, GF does not think about our relationship, feeling like she puts me last and I have to run after her in order to see her, question is if I am overreacting or if my feelings a justified and if so how to handle the situation."

You have to apply to a university, study there, work a lot to publish a paper, or else work a lot and take a lot of stress to get a job, there's the stress to find a life partner (I'm gay), have kids, get a good house, provide for your family, provide for your parents, etc. There's a lot of thinking to be done, work to be done, stress to be taken. Don't get me wrong - I'm familiar with hard work, I've worked pretty hard for whatever I have in hand.

I just wish I could transfer all my blessings to someone who had more enthusiasm for life than me, and myself go into an early permanent slumber. The main reasons for me wanting to be alive are - my family and friends would be bummed if I were to die and I am blessed with good finances and health and opportunities, and it would be a complete waste if I were to not live. But sometimes I think, I haven't signed up to live life, I should be able to transfer my blessings to someone who truly wants to do things in life. The thought keeps visiting me late at night or in the shower.

I am wondering whether it is a reason to worry, or whether it is normal existential worry that hits everyone at some point. And if it is a reason to worry, what I can do to get back on track.  "
52blrz,2,2016-09-11,Job that I will get and a possible internship,dogneeds,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/52blrz/job_that_i_will_get_and_a_possible_internship/,"Okay I have a problem that is eating away at me. I applied for a job a while back and an internship. The job I almost certainly have thanks to me and the previous manager working together in the past. However a few weeks back I also applied for an internship and I am very far in the process. The last step is an phone interview I am taking within the hour.

My problem is the internship starts in January and the job would probably have me starting in about a week or two. Is it right to take the job if there is even the smallest chance I might get into this internship? And if I do get the internship is it wrong of me to take or stay at the other job till just January? Both positions help me out in my career in the long run but I feel conflicted. The position I Would be taking supervisor role and like I said I know the person helping me with getting this position. He is kinda like my mentor. "

I don't have much of a CS background before coming to school so my resume is pretty sparse with one contracted software project for a professor, a couple cool projects I've worked on during classes here, and a good GPA (3.9). I'm applying for my first real internship, looking at all the tech names in SV and New York as well in quantitative finance.

I've noticed that a lot of the companies at career fairs and online are looking for juniors since they want interns that'll matriculate to full time, so I feel like saying my intended graduation date is 2018 might be helpful, but I'm also worried that I'll look under qualified as junior since I have no major personal projects and no real previous software internship experience. What do you all suggest? Thanks!

52c15f,7,2016-09-11,"Me [21 M] with my GF [20 F] of 3 months, I have no idea what I'm doing",LuckyConfusedBastard,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/52c15f/me_21_m_with_my_gf_20_f_of_3_months_i_have_no/,"I'm 21 years old and until about 3 months ago, I had never been in a relationship. But, by some miracle, now I am and I have no idea if I’m supposed to be doing something I’m not or its already over. I have no idea what I'm doing.


I’m in a relationship with a very cute, nerdy, and funny girl. I met her last year through a roommate who had a few friends (including her) that went to a university around 30 minutes away from ours. These friends of my roommate would visit our campus every week or two. Over the two semesters that I lived with that roommate, I would hang out with him and his friends every once in a while. She was easily the nicest, friendliest, and most outgoing of my roommate’s friend group, and we became friends over time. 


Besides some fleeting moments where I noticed how cute or nice she was, at no point did I even think about pursuing a relationship with her. But randomly last April our friendship changed rapidly. I came home late to see my roommate watching a movie with her alone. They asked if I wanted to hang with them and I did. After the movie ended, we popped in another (both Harry Potter). My roommate called it quits halfway through the second movie and my girlfriend said she’d finish up the movie with me and go back to her university. Once the movie ended, we just hung out some more talking. I can’t even remember how it happened looking back on it, but all of a sudden she was on top of me and we were making out. It was so random and unexpected to me, but I went with it. I never made out with anyone before and I was enjoying it. We made out for a good 20 minutes then talked for another hour or so until she left. 


It was only after we made out that I noticed how flirty she was beforehand. Apparently the whole time it was going right over my head and I didn’t even notice. After I finally did notice I tried to flirt back. It probably came out as the most cringy thing anyone has ever read, but she said I was cute so hey. I saw her once more before the semester ended around 2 weeks after we first made out. When we were alone, she told me she was trying so hard to make “us” happen and I just said something along the lines of “I had no idea.” She laughed and we made out some more. 


That was the last time I saw her in person for a while. She went back home for the summer while I stayed in the city for an internship while rooming with the same guy (her friend). Over the summer would text not every day, but at least a few times a week. In July she came down to our city to visit us, my roommate blatantly and me secretly I guess. That was until she saw me, kissed me, and basically told my roommate we were boyfriend and girlfriend. I don’t think we even discussed it beforehand, but I wasn’t complaining. I grew to really like her. While she was here, we hung out a ton after I got out of work each day. We even went out on a sort of double date with my roommate and his boyfriend, which I really liked cause I would’ve been super nervous just with her. Overall it was a really good time. I enjoyed it and she said she was so happy to finally spend time with me. I guess that was the week we “officially” started dating.


Ever since then though, it seemed like everything became so much less flirty and fun. We still don’t text everyday but we do every few days. It seems like that’s just the norm for both of us. But since she visited, her replies are almost never flirty at all and a lot of the time are just one or two word answers. Even more so, I don’t think she has texted me first in the past month or two. It seems like its always me trying to make the effort. 


We’ve only been on a few actual dates, but it seems (at least to me) like its mostly me making the effort to set them up. I visited her home city during the last week of the summer to spend the day with her, explore, and get some food. I’ve visited her 3 times (once a week) since the semester started, once to get dinner and crash at her place, once to catch a movie and hang out before I left, and once more to order in some food and hang out before I had to go. For every one of these, it was me saying “How bout I come see you and we can hang out?” or something along those lines. 


I seriously just don’t know if there’s something going on or if it’s all in my head. Again, I’ve never dated anyone else and I don’t know what to expect. While she tried so hard to get with me while I was completely oblivious, in comparison I feel like the typical “Honeymoon phase” came and went super quick. I’ve really grown to like her more and more than I ever thought I would, but I just get the feeling she doesn’t care much anymore or I’m not doing something right. Or is this just normal? I’m really out of my element here. Any tips?

TLDR: Girl liked me A LOT while I was oblivious. We eventually got together and I've started to like her more and more but now I feel like I'm the only one trying. I have NO experience in relationships and need some help.

52cdb4,1,2016-09-11,[M4F] Looking to Get Lucky? [Lengthy],BreakFromReality,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/52cdb4/m4f_looking_to_get_lucky_lengthy/,"*(Thanks to everyone who has responded to my previous roulette posts. I've decided to retool some things, and I hope you enjoy!)*

Hi there, and welcome to DPP Casino! I'm your host, BreakFromReality, and I'll be accompanying you in your journey to find a fun, erotic roleplay.

Please check your ID with the security guard -- all potential RP partners and their characters MUST be at least 18.

So now that you're here, how do you get started?

First, you'll sit down at our [single-deck blackjack table](https://www.random.org/playing-cards/), where you'll be deciding the kinks of the RP. You'll be dealt eight starting hands of blackjack, with each total matching up with a specific kink. (For example, a 20 is for cheating.)

Here's the full list of kinks:

* 4 -- Dealer's Choice
* 5 -- Light Bondage
* 6 -- Group Sex (MFMF, MFMFMF)
* 7 -- MFM Threesome
* 8 -- FFM Threesome
* 9 -- Interracial/Raceplay
* 10 -- Anal (Woman Receiving)
* 11 -- Filmed
* 12 -- Clothed Sex
* 13 -- Dirty Talk/Name-Calling
* 14 -- Rough Sex (Hair-Pulling, Spanking, Light Choking, etc.)
* 15 -- Public Sex
* 16 -- Creampie/Risk of Impregnation
* 17 -- Facial
* 18 -- Risk of Getting Caught (i.e. ""hold the moan"")
* 19 -- Uniform/Costume
* 20 -- Cheating
* 21 -- Player's Choice

Once eight unique hands are drawn, you will choose two kinks that you would like to include in the RP. You will also eliminate two other kinks that you would not like to include. The dealer will then choose two kinks of the remaining four.

The Dealer's Choice and Player's Choice can not be excluded.

*(To play: draw 2 cards from 1 shuffled deck. Make sure all cards except jokers are included. Repeat this eight times until complete.)*

Once the kinks are decided, you'll decide if you want to stay on the main casino floor or head over to The Den. *(While I will absolutely play with everyone, those choosing to go to The Den will get VIP status.)*

If you choose the main floor, you will head to our [roulette wheel](https://www.random.org/sequences/), where you'll help decide the character you'll be playing. The women listed on the wheel will be character models only (with one exception).

The list is as follows:

* 0 -- Player's Choice of Anyone on the List
* 1 -- You, because you're always #1 at DPP Casino!
* 2 -- Bella Thorne
* 3 -- Dove Cameron
* 4 -- Laurel Coppock
* 5 -- Alison Brie
* 6 -- Kendall Jenner
* 7 -- Candice Patton
* 8 -- Margot Robbie
* 9 -- Vanessa Hudgens
* 10 -- Scarlett Johansson
* 11 -- Taylor Swift
* 12 -- Miley Cyrus
* 13 -- Ariana Grande
* 14 -- Emma Stone
* 15 -- Milana Vayntrub
* 16 -- Nina Dobrev
* 17 -- Rihanna
* 18 -- Sarah Hyland
* 19 -- Lily Aldridge
* 20 -- Mila Kunis
* 21 -- Stella Maxwell
* 22 -- Dianna Agron
* 23 -- Chloe Grace Moretz
* 24 -- Katherine McNamara
* 25 -- Victoria Justice
* 26 -- Carrie Underwood
* 27 -- Jennifer Lawrence
* 28 -- Selena Gomez
* 29 -- Emilia Clarke
* 30 -- Emily Ratajkowski
* 31 -- Meghan Markle
* 32 -- Jourdan Dunn
* 33 -- Katy Perry
* 34 -- AnnaSophia Robb
* 35 -- Nicole Beharie
* 36 -- Ariel Winter

You will spin the wheel six times (12 for two-female scenes and 18 for three-female scenes). You will then pick three characters (six for two-female scenes and nine for three-female scenes). The dealer will then choose the character he would like you to play (the Player's Choice may get excluded).

*(To play: Set the smallest value at 0 and the largest value at , and keep it in one column. Take the first 6/12/18 numbers in the list.)*

Finally, it's time to ""role"" the dice at the [craps table](https://www.random.org/dice/) and see just what you'll be playing. The roles are below:

* 2 -- Role Not on List
* 3 -- Coach's Daughter
* 4 -- Friend's Wife/Girlfriend
* 5 -- Student
* 6 -- Sister's/Daughter's Friend
* 7 -- Incest (Daughter, Sister, Cousin)
* 8 -- Friend's Sister/Daughter
* 9 -- Work Scenario (Secretary, Intern, Co-Worker, etc.)
* 10 -- Wife's/Girlfriend's Friend
* 11 -- Celebrity
* 12 -- Bully's/Bullying Victim's Sister

*(If Celebrity is chosen, you will be playing the actual celebrity from the wheel instead of a lookalike. For 12, I am giving the option of playing either the bullying victim's sister or an interesting revenge plot with the bully's sister.)*

You will roll the dice four times. Of the four unique roles, you will then discard one. The dealer will discard one of the remaining three, and you will then choose one (or both, if possible) of the remaining two.

*(To play: simply roll two virtual dice. Repeat until four different roles are picked.)*

After that is done, we will have the RP with the characters, roles and kinks!

Now if you choose The Den?

Here's the list of characters for the roulette wheel:

* 0 -- Player's Choice of Anyone on the List
* 1 -- You, as a woman age 40+ (if you're not one already)
* 2 -- Rena Sofer
* 3 -- Nigella Lawson
* 4 -- Christie Brinkley
* 5 -- Eva Longoria
* 6 -- Rashida Jones
* 7 -- Jane Seymour
* 8 -- Elizabeth Hurley
* 9 -- Jennifer Lopez
* 10 -- Julianna Margulies
* 11 -- Patricia Heaton
* 12 -- Cheryl Hines
* 13 -- Jordan Ladd
* 14 -- Jennifer Aniston
* 15 -- Giada de Laurentiis
* 16 -- Julie Bowen
* 17 -- Alyson Hannigan
* 18 -- Gabrielle Union
* 19 -- Melinda Clarke
* 20 -- Jennifer Garner
* 21 -- Marcia Cross
* 22 -- Christina Hendricks
* 23 -- Angela Bassett
* 24 -- Elizabeth Banks
* 25 -- Isla Fisher
* 26 -- Natalie Imbruglia
* 27 -- Mary-Louise Parker
* 28 -- Kate Beckinsale
* 29 -- Sofia Vergara
* 30 -- Julianne Moore
* 31 -- Kim Cattrall
* 32 -- Ellen Barkin
* 33 -- Sharon Stone
* 34 -- Paula Patton
* 35 -- Mary Steenburgen
* 36 -- Courteney Cox

And here are the roles:

* 2 -- Role Not on List
* 3 -- Coach's Wife
* 4 -- Friend's Wife
* 5 -- Teacher/Principal
* 6 -- Mom's Friend
* 7 -- Incest (Mom, Aunt, Grandmother)
* 8 -- Friend's Mom
* 9 -- Work Scenario (Boss, Co-Worker, etc.)
* 10 -- Wife's Friend
* 11 -- Celebrity
* 12 -- Bully's/Bullying Victim's Mom

That does it for our tour! We can't wait to play with you, and we know you'll have a good time; others have! 

If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. And from all of us at DPP Casino, have a winning day!"
52cgdc,0,2016-09-11,F4M Some fun scenes!,[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/52cgdc/f4m_some_fun_scenes/,"Hey there DPP, tonight I have a couple scenes for you all to choose from and/or work out with me!

We can discuss specific prompts in private and please, do not message me with a scene already started, that’s the easiest way to get blocked. The same goes for one line/word messages.

I'm fairly open with my kinks with my only hard ""no""s being scat, unrealistically huge cocks, 3rd person writing, and vomit.

Without further ado, here are some of my prompts:

**The Lawyer and the Con**: For this one, I was thinking I’d play a young and up and coming lawyer tasked with defending you. We can discuss the specifics in PMs but one thing is for certain, I’ll be taking my payment in the form of cock.

**Breaking the Law**: For this one, the roles are reversed, I was caught committing a crime and you’re the officer/journalist/detective who caught me. Where that leads? Well that’s up to you.

**Wrong neighborhood**: What happens when me, a young and sexy girl finds herself in the wrong neighborhood? Do you help me find my way or decide you want to take advantage?

**Sports Star and Reporter**: A classic scene were I’m a reporter and you’re the sports star, that can only lead one place, right?

**The intern and the boss**: Fairly self explanatory, I’d love to be the intern at her dream job who meets you, her boss and potentially so much more.

**Opposite Sides**: For this one, I want to play a FBI/CIA/DEA Agent who is tasked with infiltrating your organization, now what that organization does we can discuss in PMs but I basically want you to turn me from righteous agent of the law into your slut.

**I’m gonna fuck your sister**: For this one, you’ll play my little brother’s best friend, I’ll be his big sister who is now recently single and back in town. You guys always joked that you would fuck each other’s mom/sister only this time, you’re not joking.

**Giving back**: In this RP, I’ll play someone  famous be it an actress or singer or sports star. You’ll be the person tasked in helping me set up some sort of event to give back to the community, only you want me to give you something more than this event.

**Bullies always win**: In this one, you’ll be as the title suggests, you’re a bully who grew up terrorizing my son (or brother), only unlike the stories we tell our kids to make them feel better, you know better. You get what you want, when you want it, in this case, me.

For those of you so inclined, I do like playing celebs in any of these roles so we have visual aids, if you’d like me to be any, just ask!

As for celebs I’d play, here are a few, feel free to ask about ones not listed:

Celebs: **Mary Elizabeth Winstead**, **Maisie Williams**, Anna Kendrick, Selena Gomez, Hailee Steinfeld, Taylor Swift, Willa Holland, Daisy Ridley, **Melissa Benoist**, Emma Stone/Watson/Roberts, Hayley Williams, Alison Brie, Alexandra Daddario, Aubrey Plaza, Bella Thorne, **Alicia Vikander** Jennifer Lawrence, Keri Russel, Neve Campbell, Jennifer Connelly, Scarlet Johansson, Sophie Turner, Oliva Munn, Olivia Wilde, **Miranda Kerr**, Jessica Biel/Alba, Victoria Justice

YouTube/Social Media: **Meg Turney**, Lia Marie Johnson, **Alli Speed**, Barbara Dunkelman, Ashley Jenkins, **Bree Essrig**, Maude Garrett, Trisha Hershberger, Datev Gallagher, Lindsey Stirling, Christina Grimme, Dodger, iJustine, or Meghan Camarena.

Whew, that was a lot. Hope to get some dirty orangereds soon!

This is an awkward situation for me to be in because I am trying to tell her how to be successful and I don't know if it is helping at all. It puts me in a weird spot.

52cwrt,2,2016-09-12,Some insights on my plans to move to San Francisco?,kericat,AskSF,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskSF/comments/52cwrt/some_insights_on_my_plans_to_move_to_san_francisco/,"Hi, I'm currently in San Jose and have considered moving to San Francisco closer to 2018. I'm about to graduate and already have an internship at a commercial insurance company. I want to move into underwriting and San Francisco has a better market for that. I'm staying at this company for a year or so because I can live rent free and save to live in San Francisco comfortably by then. I also want more exposure to the job as well.

I'm trying to make predictions based on underestimating my starting income which at worst would be 40-45k. I also have a unit in San Jose that I'll be renting out when I'm ready to move so I can expect an extra $700-800 to supplement my income monthly. With that in mind, I wouldn't mine paying a little higher for rent.

I was browsing craiglists to get an idea of rent and it looks like $1400-1700/mo can get me a decent room. I have pets so I initially wanted to get a larger apartment with the money I'm saving and be the one finding roommates instead of the other way around. This is my ideal living situation but I was wondering if it's realistic since it sounds too good to be true. It comes out to a little under $1500 per person which arounds great: https://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/apa/5777665874.html

Also, is a car really that not that functional? I play a sport and I want to go to a specific gym to train in south of market and I'll most likely be traveling from the financial district. I probably won't be home until 8-9:30 pm on the weekdays and not being in my own vehicle makes me a little nervous since I won't know how far I'll have to travel to get home yet.

I'm in my second year of college and currently looking for summer internships. Right now I'm applying to two major types of jobs: 

1. The deam jobs: Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon... The one's that everyone has heard of, the jobs that you can find by searching ""top computer science jobs"" and that I have very very very little shot of actually getting.

2. Local jobs. CS jobs in my hometown and in my college town that I think I have a good shot of getting. I had one of these internships last summer, and while I did gain a lot of valuable experience, I would like to do something better for this summer.


So my question is this: What is the middle tier? Where do I find the jobs that aren't the Google-tier jobs, but that the Google-tier jobs will want to see on my resume? Obviously nobody is going to advertise themselves as mid-tier, so I'm wondering if anybody has been in a similar place to where I am now, and has any suggestions for searching.

Thanks so much!"

52dlbx,8,2016-09-12,Acres of Hope: A True Proposal for A Solution to Portland's Homeless Problem,pdx595,Portland,https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/52dlbx/acres_of_hope_a_true_proposal_for_a_solution_to/,"                                    Acres of Hope


I am sympathetic to both the homeless population of Portland (who are often unfairly stigmatized), and hard working residents of Portland (who feel that their tolerance of the homeless is being taken advantage of). My proposal to fix the problem is the establishment of Acres of Hope, a farm situated outside Portland whose workforce is comprised of homeless individuals currently living in Portland’s urban areas. 

Most homeless people do not want to be homeless, do not want to leech off of social services and do want to contribute to society. Knowing this, Acres of Hope workers would be individuals who volunteer for the program and would be taken to the Acres of Hope farm (outside the city). Their volunteered removal from the city would  help to ease tensions between their community and the housed residents of Portland, who are bothered by presence in the urban areas of Portland. 

Once at Acres of Hope, staff (the previously homeless individuals of Portland) would be housed and work for a small salary, learning important farm and life skills, including the humanistic values developed through cultivation, working with animals, and working towards a common goal with others. The food and products produced by the farm would be used to feed Acres staff, and the surplus sold to Acres of Hope partners. 

The farm would be run by Acres of Hope staff with oversight and consultation done by a leadership group comprised of experts from the the farming industry as well as Acres of Hope leadership staff. The performance of individual staff members would be rewarded with incremental promotions which would include small increases in pay as well as increases in responsibility over other staff and operations on the farm. The highest rung of the ladder would the group of leadership staff, each responsible for different operations at the farm. 

After 12 months (could be less) at Acres of Hope, Acres leadership staff would be evaluated on their performance on the farm. Those who demonstrated good behaviour and who operated at a high enough capacity over the course of the 12-month period, including during their time as Leadership Staff,  would then join work at one of Acres of Hope’s partners as part of a 6-month internship.  

Acres of Hope Partners would receive products and produce at a reduced cost in exchange for receiving and mentoring Acres of Hope staff at their establishments. The produce and products would be labeled as being from Acres of Hope, allowing for community members to easily target and support the work at Acres of Hope and its staff.  Potential internship establishments for staff could be supermarkets, coffee shops, restaurants, bars, etc. 

After completing their 6-month internship with an Acres of Hope Partner, they would graduate from the program, and begin their post program life, being assisted by Acres of Hope to find permanent work placement through a partnership with already established work placement agencies in Portland and the Greater Portland Area and partnerships with local farm networks. 

This network could be expanded as the project scaled, not just increasing the size of Acres of Hope in terms of the number of staff but also the number of locations. This network would eventually be made to include other social agencies, mental health care providers, drug abuse counselors,  and farmers networks across the state of Oregon to help with job placement. Staff would leave Acres of Hope with a regionally (or eventually, nationally) recognized certification, and the resources to find permanent work. 

There are endless areas of expansion that Acres of Hope could eventually offer. College students studying everything from psychology to sociology to nursing to education receiving college credit for volunteering at Acres of Hope, to members of community establishing after work courses for staff for evening after their day’s work was completed. Once established, the opportunities are endless. 

This is a pragmatic, humanistic and realistic solution to a problem that will continue to affect Portlanders for decades to come without creative solutions. A full proposal is currently being developed. I would love to hear feedback about people's opinions about the feasibility of such a program, if they would support something like it, or changes they would make to it. Thanks!  "

Also I cannot afford a therapist. If anyone can recommend a different sub for this, that'd be great.

I am not sure exactly why but I am not very likable (no okay, I have some idea). I am slowly drifting away from my friends. I don't connect with them and I am always the one initiating conversations. When I talk to them, they stop replying unless it's in person. Like, they wouldn't even read my message and disappear. The other night I was talking to a friend and she ranted and I sent a long reply and when she replied it was just one line and nothing else. Once again, I initiated that conversation. I told a friend about this and she said that it's because I never go out with them anymore, which is BS because when I did go out with them I'd get left out of things even if I try to connect with them. I've known them forever and they're nice people but I just cannot relate to them. One time, when I was hanging out with them and a friend had to leave, he said goodbye to everyone BUT me. It seems that they are closer to each other than they are with me. My best friend lives in England and she's the only one I am truly only close to which is weird because she moved to the UK almost 8 years ago.

Also, I have never had a job because of this reason. I did an internship but I felt very uncomfortable around those people and they kept pointing out about how awkward I was which made me feel more awkward. Also people do this giggle thing when they talk to me like they're trying not to laugh even when I'm being nice or making sense. Sometimes, when I do say something, I get no reaction.

Here are some reasons people hate me for:

* Shy, insecure, and I feel inferior to everyone. I feel like I deserve the shit I'm getting.
* Introverted
* Over-friendly - I don't really know when it's okay to start talking to people about what friends talk about or like asking them about their day and stuff.
* I rant to my friends a lot - I've stopped doing this to my close friends for about a year. I know they're not my therapist... but they still kinda ignore me.
* I don't know what else to say to people when they're talking to me about things. I ask them questions and react, but they eventually get tired of it I think.
* I react strongly when people disrespect me - like if their jokes are half-meant. But I am VERY sensitive though so I don't know if I should be offended by it or learn to make fun of myself.
* I don't believe in myself / very negative outlook on life. - Been bullied since forever even in college, raised by an overprotective anxious parent who nitpicked everything I did, and people never believed in me. So, I don't know how I can have faith in myself.

Growing up, I missed a lot of social events because my mom was and still is overprotective. So that's why I need to improve it. I'm 23 now and I want real genuine friends who I get along with but making friends as an adult is so hard especially to someone with social skills like mine.

Help me please improve on this."

52ehvt,9,2016-09-12,"New CS Grad., Internship experience, Curious about transitioning to computational work (video game physics design, etc.)",mamemaki,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/52ehvt/new_cs_grad_internship_experience_curious_about/,"Hi Everyone,

A little bit about my background: 

* I just graduated this June with a degree in Computer Science from a well-known tech school.
* I have a strong background in physics and mathematics -- I took graduate level physics courses up through Lagrangian mechanics, I also have experience in linear algebra, tensor analysis, etc.. 
* I've completed two CS-related internships focused in C++, one research-oriented, the other at a hedge fund in finance. Thus I have some experience in advanced level C++ concepts (template meta-programming etc.), but I believe I am more of an intermediate C++ programmer. 

Given my background, I don't think I would have too much trouble getting into a software company, but recently I've considered transitioning to a more computational role -- I want to do physics and programming since I love both. 

With that in mind, I've thought about working at scientific laboratories, but those are basically impossible to get into without a graduate degree. 

Assuming I don't want to get a graduate degree at this time, I figured that one of the best places to combine my love of physics and programming would be to make physics engines in the video game industry. However, I fear that my lack of experience in the industry bars me from entry, despite my education and internships in other sectors. Pretty sure experience in the game sector is king, and for that I'm out of luck. 

What steps should I take to transition to this sector? I was thinking about holding a software job in the meantime while building a portfolio, but that strikes me as something a game developer should focus on. Maybe there's something I'm missing. I'm also open to advice about computational roles in general.

Thanks a ton for any advice in advance. I really appreciate it.

Majoring in Finance and Computer Information Systems but I'm thinking about doing Finance/CS instead.",wsh009,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/52ekhl/20m_junior_in_college_majoring_in_finance_and/,"Currently, I'm working towards a Bachelor's in Finance and because they're both in the College of Business, I could easily complete the requirements for a degree in Computer Information Systems too. *Technically* I can't double major in those two things, but no one is going to blame me if I say that I did on my resume.

I've really wanted to work in the finance industry as a CFP/CFA, but most financial institutions won't take any interns or recent graduates unless they went to a target school or are well-connected. Neither of these things apply to me. So, I'm worried that a Finance/CIS degree is too broad and that I'll be struggling to find a job after college.

Is it worth it to double major in both Finance or Computer Science, even though it may set me back a year?"
52en1u,3,2016-09-12,How should I handle an uncertain grad date?,cs_throwaway12345,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/52en1u/how_should_i_handle_an_uncertain_grad_date/,"I'm wondering how I should handle an uncertain grad date. Right now it looks like I could graduate in two or three semesters. Two would mean I would be applying to full-time positions. Three would mean I would be able to get another internship if I wanted to.

I've considered applying to both, but the one complication is that I think I should be able to take care of all of my cs requirements in two. Then I'd just have one or two gen ed classes. Now this does add more time, but because they are gen ed classes it'll probably be possible to test out or transfer those credits in. So I'm not sure if I'll even need to actually go back to school if I take three semesters. And if I did do an internship and got a full-time offer I might decide I want to talk with them about moving up my start date.

I started out with a different major, so I had a fair number of gen ed classes when I started. Because of that I haven't spent a full four years as a cs major. I feel like an inexperienced developer, so I'm ok picking up a little more experience as intern.

So I'm not at all opposed to taking three semesters. It's just that I'm a little unsure about how to talk to recruiters about it. I don't want to tell a recruiter that I'm graduating in two and then come back later and tell them that I'll be available then, but I still need one or two classes before I actually graduate. And I'm not quite sure how an internship will take being told that I'm actually immediately available right after the internship ends. Most internships expect students to go back to school. "

I'm 27 years old 6'4 and I outright own a 2011 Chevy Cruze. I live in NE Ohio so we do get quite a bit of snow each year. I'm not a materialistic person, but I would rather spend more money on quality if it will make the product I'm buying last longer and run better.


I have about a 30 mile highway round trip commute each day for work (about 15 miles each way).


I'm looking to trade in my current car and buy another one in the next 4-7 months.



**Current Car Chevrolet  Cruze RS:**


-  68k miles. RS package. Candy Apple Red. Clean, Zero Accidents and only 1-2 ""dings"" on the doors. Other then that to me I've kept it very maintained.


- It's Small, I'm 6'4 and if I ever have to drive a group of people I normally take my wives car (2012 Chrysler 200), because I drive with my seat 100% back and there is zero leg room behind me.


- I didn't pick out this car. When I was in college I got an internship that was about 50 minutes away. My parents didn't feel save letting me drive a 1996 Lumina that many miles a day. So my father co-signed for me to lease my current car (Cruze) and by the time I graduated I was WAY over miles. So when my lease was up I just bought it outright. 


- From first to second gear SUCKS. I've always had complaints about the car getting from first to second gear, and every time I take it for a oil change I bring up the problem and they always tell me the same thing. That's it's a computer issues and there is no way to fix it. [This is an example of the review site where the top problem is what I'm complaining about.](http://www.carcomplaints.com/Chevrolet/Cruze/2011/transmission/). It's actually gotten so bad that my wife won't even drive my car anymore. In the last 4 months the car has almost gotten me into 4-5 accidents due to the acceleration. 





**New Car:**

- Something that's large and small at the same time. I really like the ""small car"" feel, like for parking and road present. Like the Cruze, I really like the outside size of it, but I'm a bigger guy so I need that extra leg room. So this is pointing me to a ""Crossover"" type car or a ""compact SUV"". I don't really feel comfortable driving Large vehicles. 




- Reliable I'm hoping to buy a car/suv and drive it until the wheels fall off. So reliability is probably #1 priority for me right now.
	

	
 - Kids, my wife and I are planning on starting a family in the next 3-ish years. So I guess we have to take that into factor.
 - Maintenance, I know very little about cars and their maintenance. So if anything goes wrong or I'm having trouble 95% of the time I'll take it into a shop.
		

- Snow and Winters. I live in NE Ohio (snow belt) so snow can be a problem. I know a lot of people say that AWD isn't needed but get snow tires instead. But I think in the long run AWD would be a good option to have.


- I'm not a car enthusiast. I see cars as a tool to get you from Point A to Point B.
 

-   Safety, I'm sort of a ""worry wort"" so safety is something I actually care about. So options like Brake Assistance, Blind Stop Assistance, the Active Cruise Control would all be nice to have if my budget can afford it. I guess it would be nice to test this out too before I thought about buying.

	
- Other features like Keyless Start, Heated Seats, and anything else related to cold weather. 


- Looks, I don't mind some ""old man"" or ""soccer mom"" look but I still would like it to look like a 27 year old mans vehicle.


- Price Under $30,000 But Preferably under $27,000. (How much % should a car be that you can afford, any good rules of thumb?) I'm hoping to trade in my Cruze, but I have no idea how much it's worth and I wouldn't mind putting more % down. I'm not a part of a credit union or anything so I'm not sure what my Interest % would be, but wife and I both have Excellent Credit Score ratings.     


- Nothing To big, In about 11 months my wifes car will be paid off and she's been itching to get a SUV. She said she totally regrets buying a car because she's always wanted a SUV. 



**TL;DR** Looks for a new/used Vehicle under $30k that would fit a 6'4 man, who is more worried about reliability and getting from Point A to Point B.


I know I wrote a wall of text. If you have any questions,comments or concerns please let me know and I can definitely get back to you."
52ets0,55,2016-09-12,My (25F) mother (60F) keeps ruining my visits home with her obsession with me working during them.,mildlycatastrophic,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/52ets0/my_25f_mother_60f_keeps_ruining_my_visits_home/,"Hi Reddit! Longtime lurker, first time poster.

Basically, I'm a student who loves her family (divorced parents) and friends back in her hometown, which is several hours away by train. It's one of the greatest sadnesses of my life that I don't get to see them very much. I only get the opportunity to go home for a few days once every 3-4 months. Typically I'll get there late on a Sunday and have to return home on the following Thursday or Friday morning. I generally stay with my Dad and Stepmother (late 50s) when I'm there because I love my mother, but... as you'll see, she stresses me out big-time.

She has this outright obsession with trying to make me work during these trips. I'll see her for lunch on the Monday and sooner rather than later, she is guaranteed to start mentioning every single local place that is hiring, and trying to pressure me into applying for jobs at them. Even though I live several hours away in a different city, and am going back in a few days. When I mean she pressures me, she really packs it on. Her voice and body language change. I have problems with anxiety, and, well, conflict in general, and this REALLY upsets me and takes me a while to calm down. She's even gone up to the manager or staff of a venue while I've been in the restrooms, and I've come back to a member of staff enthusiastically asking if I have a resume and what are my available hours? 

I can't convey how hurtful I find this. If I'm working, I won't be able to spend any time at all with my loved ones. Most of these workplaces are bars or restaurants, with hours that don't go well with hanging out with people. She says I should be working every single hour I possible can to make money.

Doesn't she miss me when I'm away? I feel like she's telling me that she doesn't actually want to see her own daughter, that time with me means nothing. That my time with my friends and family doesn't matter, and is some sort of ridiculous luxury that I'm really spoiled for wanting. The worst time she did this was when I went to go live in another country on the other side of the world for the best part of a year (but at the time I thought I might be away a lot longer). I got on the plane on Thursday and on Tuesday she was trying to force me to get a job and work those last two days instead of packing my entire life up and saying goodbye to people I might not see again for years.

A few pertinent details - I'm in college a little older than usual, partly because I was unsure what to study and didn't want to potentially throw away a lot of money and several years of my life studying the wrong course. Secondly, I am financing my studies COMPLETELY on my own, through a combination of savings (from the years I worked before I started), loans and working 25 hours a week during the semester and as much as I can in the vacations.

I love my mother dearly, but she can be very controlling and doesn't seem to realize that I'm a grown adult. She's particularly obsessed with my finances (I try to give her as little detail as possible but that doesn't stop her thinking she deserves full disclosure) and my work. Now, I'll admit that I'm not as financially sound as many others my age. I don't have much in the way of savings, my income is low and I live in an extremely expensive city. But short-term, this is worth it to me - I attend a very prestigious university, and this city has an incomparable wealth of jobs, internships, training programs, etc., as well as basically being a world hub of the industry I want to go into eventually. It makes sense for me to be here. The longterm benefits outweigh the short-term drawbacks for me. I work very hard to make it work. This summer I've worked two jobs on top of reading for the semester ahead. I haven't celebrated my birthday or Christmas in two years because I've worked both events.I don't think I'm financially irresponsible or workshy. But my mother keeps telling me I am.

I mean, how would it even work if I did just take her advice? So, I spend all of Monday contacting employers, handing out resumes. Maybe Tuesday too. At the quickest, nobody is going to interview me before Tuesday, for start that night or Wednesday. I'll have to go out and buy work-appropriate clothes/shoes, because I don't take those home with me. And I'll only be able to work one or two days at the very most before I go home. How much money am I actually going to get out of this?

Also, I'll have to lie the entire time. About where I live, my education. I can't admit I go to my actual university because they won't give me a job knowing I actually live in a city hours away. They're not stupid. So I have to lie and say I attend local university. My references are all in my current city, so what do I do about that?  And then I have to work that job, knowing that very shortly I'm going to have to screw my new employer over by leaving them high and dry to go home. All for a very small amount of money, especially if I've had to buy certain clothes/shoes to work that job in the first place.

Am I in the wrong here, Reddit? Should I be working during my trips home? And if I'm right, how do I deal with my mother and get her to stop doing this? I've tried explaining everything I've said here to her several times and she just says I'm being stubborn and a spoiled brat.

TL;DR - I only see my family and friends for a few days every few months, mother trying to force me to work that time instead of seeing them."

Not Today!,BreakFromReality,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/52euwt/m4f_case_of_the_mondays_not_today/,"*(Thanks to everyone who has responded to my previous roulette posts. I've decided to retool some things, and I hope you enjoy!)*

Hi there, and welcome to DPP Casino! I'm your host, BreakFromReality, and I'll be accompanying you in your journey to find a fun, erotic roleplay.

Please check your ID with the security guard -- all potential RP partners and their characters MUST be at least 18.

So now that you're here, how do you get started?

First, you'll sit down at our [single-deck blackjack table](https://www.random.org/playing-cards/), where you'll be deciding the kinks of the RP. You'll be dealt eight starting hands of blackjack, with each total matching up with a specific kink. (For example, a 20 is for cheating.)

Here's the full list of kinks:

* 4 -- Dealer's Choice
* 5 -- Light Bondage
* 6 -- Group Sex (MFMF, MFMFMF)
* 7 -- MFM Threesome
* 8 -- FFM Threesome
* 9 -- Interracial/Raceplay
* 10 -- Anal (Woman Receiving)
* 11 -- Filmed

* 15 -- Public Sex
* 16 -- Creampie/Risk of Impregnation
* 17 -- Facial
* 18 -- Risk of Getting Caught (i.e. ""hold the moan"")
* 19 -- Uniform/Costume
* 20 -- Cheating
* 21 -- Player's Choice

Once eight unique hands are drawn, you will choose two kinks that you would like to include in the RP. You will also eliminate two other kinks that you would not like to include. The dealer will then choose two kinks of the remaining four.

The Dealer's Choice and Player's Choice can not be excluded.

*(To play: draw 2 cards from 1 shuffled deck. Make sure all cards except jokers are included. Repeat this eight times until complete.)*

Once the kinks are decided, you'll decide if you want to stay on the main casino floor or head over to The Den. *(While I will absolutely play with everyone, those choosing to go to The Den will get VIP status.)*

If you choose the main floor, you will head to our [roulette wheel](https://www.random.org/sequences/), where you'll help decide the character you'll be playing. The women listed on the wheel will be character models only (with one exception).

The list is as follows:

* 0 -- Player's Choice of Anyone on the List
* 1 -- You, because you're always #1 at DPP Casino!
* 2 -- Bella Thorne
* 3 -- Dove Cameron
* 4 -- Laurel Coppock
* 5 -- Alison Brie
* 6 -- Kendall Jenner
* 7 -- Candice Patton
* 8 -- Margot Robbie
* 9 -- Vanessa Hudgens
* 10 -- Scarlett Johansson
* 11 -- Taylor Swift
* 12 -- Miley Cyrus
* 13 -- Ariana Grande
* 14 -- Emma Stone
* 15 -- Milana Vayntrub
* 16 -- Nina Dobrev
* 17 -- Rihanna
* 18 -- Sarah Hyland
* 19 -- Lily Aldridge
* 20 -- Mila Kunis
* 21 -- Stella Maxwell
* 22 -- Dianna Agron
* 23 -- Chloe Grace Moretz
* 24 -- Katherine McNamara
* 25 -- Victoria Justice
* 26 -- Carrie Underwood
* 27 -- Jennifer Lawrence
* 28 -- Selena Gomez
* 29 -- Emilia Clarke
* 30 -- Emily Ratajkowski
* 31 -- Meghan Markle
* 32 -- Jourdan Dunn
* 33 -- Katy Perry
* 34 -- AnnaSophia Robb
* 35 -- Nicole Beharie
* 36 -- Ariel Winter

You will spin the wheel six times (12 for two-female scenes and 18 for three-female scenes). You will then pick three characters (six for two-female scenes and nine for three-female scenes). The dealer will then choose the character he would like you to play (the Player's Choice may get excluded).

*(To play: Set the smallest value at 0 and the largest value at 36, and keep it in one column. Take the first 6/12/18 numbers in the list.)*

Finally, it's time to ""role"" the dice at the [craps table](https://www.random.org/dice/) and see just what you'll be playing. The roles are below:

* 2 -- Role Not on List
* 3 -- Coach's Daughter
* 4 -- Friend's Wife/Girlfriend
* 5 -- Student
* 6 -- Sister's/Daughter's Friend

I will be graduating couple of month before baby is due, then I have 90 days to find a full time employment. Right now I am only able to find entry level unpaid internships. I talked to a lawyer , he said not to worry about it until the baby is born, as the process takes 6 to 8 months before she can sue me for child support, and the Child support payment will be roughly 20% of my income +/- $50. 

-How can I make payments if I only find unpaid internships? (my visa doesn't allow me to seek other 2nd or part time jobs and is valid up to 12 months on securing an employment)

- What happens after my visa gets expired?  (My country is not a reciprocating country) 

- As per my friends she haven't told her husband about pregnancy yet, I will be leaving to taxes for my internship after my graduation, how will he disprove his paternity if I move to taxes or back to my country? can he sue me for damages? 

- Can I give away my parental rights and responsibilities based off my immigration status?

I am just scared as I don't want to be in a wrong in the eyes of law. Saddest part is, I heard that mom of my kid is very happy about pregnancy as she will have 2 baby daddies ( she has a kid from her marriage) and all the government benefits, so she dose't have to work anymore.   "

After the first month of working there I did not receive a payment because I ""wasn't on the payroll"". After that I received pay bi weekly by check.

My main question is how do I go about getting the first month's pay and my mileage. I have mentioned it to my ""mentor"" several times but no steps have been taken to get me my pay. Should I go back and speak to him again or go directly to the owner? Does not having a contract that was written limit what I can do?

The first one is a credit analyst. It isn't my dream job because it's basically being in front of a computer analyzing data and calculating risks and forecasts. However they offer me a good contract and it seems a very stable job where most guys work there for many years.

The second one is a job in mergers and acquisitions of a big company. It seems a more enjoyable job but they offer me a 1 year internship with no guarantee after that and it seems really hard to develop a career there without contacts. If after 1 year they kick me out it may be difficult to get the same job in other firm because they usually hire people from prestigious universities but maybe I can get a job in an investment firm.

It's important to note that I'm from Spain and we have 20% unemployment and almost 50% youth unemployment so the stability is certainly valuable.

52focc,2,2016-09-12,Searching for the best place to find scholarships/ student aid,basketball--jones,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/52focc/searching_for_the_best_place_to_find_scholarships/,"I am a 20 yo business student at a large, Big 10 university, and am just beginning my Junior year of undergrad. Right now, I am doing something I rarely ever do, which is ask for help. I am a first generation college student, and have no additional support for my education aside from my own and through aid from the government. My parents split up when I was 5 and both vowed to finance 1/3 of my college education each, though this never happened. I could have taken them to court, though I did was most sons would do and chose to go about it on my own. I made it quite further than most people told me I would, through a ever-increasing, massive pile of debt, working part-time, and few scholarships. I am sure that anyone reading this that went through college on their own dollar knows the position that I am in, and how frustrating financial obstacles are on the path to a degree. It is perhaps the most difficult thing I have ever experienced in my life, where I know I am intelligent and dedicated enough to get a degree, though I may not be able to simply because of financial issues. 

As hard as things have been up to this point, I've reached a tipping point where these resources will simply not be enough to support me. My tuition increased three separate times over this summer; once as a school wide increase, a business student increase, and a third-year student increase. As a result, my financial aid was no longer enough to cover my tuition expense, let alone expenses for books, rent, and food. I cannot even get any more relatively low-interest rate loans from the government, my parents get declined when they attempt to co-sign on loans, and the rest of my extended family is already supporting their own children and cannot afford to offer me a hand. Basically, I am desperate for another method of gaining funding for my education, aside from my last resort of private loans. I am a relatively intelligent student that works extremely hard in school and outside as well. I work 20+ hours per week during the school year and full-time any time I am not in school. I've sold all of my valuable possessions, sneakers, clothes, etc. I run errands for my friends, and basically take any odd job I can for some extra cash. I've become quite a ""hustler"" since coming to college, though I'm sure that my friends would just call me broke and cheap. Regardless, I have adapted to survive already and intend on continuing to do so.

I have had an internship in banking, a respectable GPA, am involved on campus, and have a decent resume. I feel that I am pretty marketable, though I do not know where the best places are to look for scholarships from private donors. If anyone knows of fruitful places to look, or any other creative ideas aside from this, I would be extremely appreciative. Any idea or information at this point would be helpful. I really just want to finish school, begin working, and be able to do good for the world while providing my family with opportunities I've never had. Also, just any general advice from someone who's graduated or been in a similar situation would be awesome. I would love to hear anything from anyone, and I genuinely thank you for taking the time to hear my story. I'd also be happy to share my experiences with anyone else and offer advice to those who may find themselves in my position when they go off to college.  

TL;DR   I am halfway through college and my university is sucking me dry. Broke and desperate for ideas/scholarships. Any ideas/suggestions/links help. Thank you.

Should I jump ship?,m8te88,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/52fyy3/worried_about_the_future_of_the_semiconductor/,"I have always loved the process side of semiconductors specifically working with semiconductor tools and working on R&amp;D. However after working at a small semiconductor company for an internship, I am worried that the industry won't be around too much longer in the US. There is too much physical labor involved with the industry and with extremely expensive tools many companies are moving to Asia or using the services of large Asian fabrication facilities such as TSMC. 

 &amp;nbsp;

I was thinking about switching fields and going more into the design side of semiconductors such as VLSI and computer architecture. When looking for jobs, I see many more openings for the design side rather than the manufacturing side. However, having just graduated, I never took deeper courses into VLSI and computer architecture. I only took one digital design course, which I barely remember. 

&amp;nbsp;

It has always been my plan that I would go for a PhD in semiconductors and work as a process engineering but I really feel like the area is drying up. I feel like I have the ability to switch my focus now but I will need to do a lot of self studying to catch up."

52g6s5,16,2016-09-12,[UPDATE] Negotiated salary on entry-level job/lab position; offer rescinded. :-(,SnTTs,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/52g6s5/update_negotiated_salary_on_entrylevel_joblab/,"I can't believe this happened. The boss himself said there is a ""small room for negotiation"" when he extended the offer.

The offer originally was for $28k for bachelor's with zero experience in an academic lab. I had a bachelor's and have 2 years part time unpaid relevant experience and 2 full time, paid summer internships with relevant lab experience.

I looked up various threads / websites on how to negotiate. I went on Glassdoor and Payscale and looked up averages for that particular position for the company. The average was about $31k-33k. People said to add 10% - 15% to the amount and attempt to negotiate with HR.

So I called HR and asked for $35k; expressed enthusiasm for working in the company, etc. They came back and said the boss would paid maximum of only $29k and if I wouldn't drop my ""requirement"", they'd consider other candidates.

Without hesitating, I quickly told them I'd be happy to take the $29k and I'd love to work for the company as it was a very good environment. I told them the $35k I counteroffered wasn't a requirement in any way and I thought they were open to negotiation (which I originally asked the HR too before naming a number).

5 hours later, received a call from HR letting me know that the boss has gone with another candidate and my offer has been rescinded.

I feel so sad and defeated. I've been dealing with depression for the past two years and finally feel like I am getting my act together and doing something with my life. The first offer was a god-send, even though the offer was low. I wanted to negotiate to an amount that would allow me to survive independently and afford the raising rent prices, but would have been extremely happy with a job in a good lab environment with a nice boss. I think the advice from internet sites regarding negotiating salary did not apply to entry-level lab positions in academia where I'm essentially dispensable.

I don't know what to do at this point. I have one other interview lined up and waiting to hear back from other positions, but I feel so down. Was I wrong to negotiate? Did I come off as arrogant? Was the amount I quoted too high? What should I do in the future to ensure this does not happen again?"

52gdjq,6,2016-09-12,Squidwards's Suicide,TheCreepyKiller,creepypasta,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/52gdjq/squidwardss_suicide/,"Since I worked directly with the editors and animators, I got to view the new episodes days before they aired. I’ll get right to it without giving too many unnecessary details. They had very recently made the Spongebob movie and the entire staff was somewhat sapped of creativity so it took them longer to start up the season. But the delay lasted longer for more upsetting reasons. There was a problem with the series 4 premier that set everyone and everything back for several months.

Me and two other interns were in the editing room along with the lead animators and sound editors for the final cut. We received the copy that was supposed to be “Fear of a Krabby Patty” and gathered around the screen to watch. Now, given that it isn’t final yet animators often put up a mock title card, sort of an inside joke for us, with phony, often times lewd titles, such as “How sex doesn’t work” instead of “Rock-a-by-Bivalve” when spongebob and patrick adopt a sea scallop. Nothing particularly funny but work related chuckles. So when we saw the title card “Squidward’s Suicide” we didn’t think it more than a morbid joke.

One of the interns did a small throat laugh at it. The happy-go-lucky music plays as is normal. The story began with Squidard practicing his clarinet, hitting a few sour notes like normal. We hear Spongebob laughing outside and Squidard stops, yelling at him to keep it down as he has a concert that night and needs to practice. Spongebob says okay and goes to see Sandy with with Patrick. The bubbles splash screen comes up and we see the ending of Squidward’s concert. This is when things began to seem off.

While playing, a few frames repeat themselves, but the sound doesn’t (at this point sound is synced up with animation so yes that’s not common) but when he stops playing, the sound finishes as if the skip never happened. There is slight mummuring in the crowed before they begin to boo him. Not normal cartoon booing that is common in the show, but you could very clearly hear malace in it. Squidward’s in full frame and looks visibly afraid. The shot goes to the crowd, with Spongebob in center frame, and he too is booing, very much unlike him. That isn’t the oddest thing, though. What is odd is everyone had hyper realistic eyes. Very detailed. Clearly not shots of real people’s eyes, but something a bit more real than CGI. The pupils were red. Some of us looked at eachother, obviously confused, but since we weren’t the writers we didn’t question its appeal to children, yet.

The shot goes to Squidward sitting on the edge of his bed, looking very forlorn. The view out of his porthole window is of a night sky so it isn’t very long after the concert. The unsettling part is at this point there is no sound. Literally no sound. Not even the feedback from the speakers in the room. It’s as if the speakers were turned off, though their status showed them working perfectly. He just sat there, blinking, in this silence for about 30 seconds, then he started to sob softly. He put his hands (tentacles) over his eyes and cried quietly for a full minute more, all the while a sound in the background very slowly growing from nothing to barely audible. It sounded like a slight breeze through a forest.

The screen slowly begins to zoom in on his face. By slow I mean it’s only noticeable if you look at shots 10 seconds apart side by side. His sobbing gets louder, more full of hurt and anger. The screen then twitches a bit, as if it twists in on itself, for a split second then back to normal. The wind-through-the-trees sound gets slowly louder and more severe, as if a storm is brewing somewhere. The eerie part is this sound, and Squidward’s sobbing, sounded real, as if the sound wasn’t coming from the speakers but as if the speakers were holes the sound was coming through from the other side. As good as sound as the studio likes to have, they don’t purchase the equipment to be that good to produce sound of that quality.

Below the sound of the wind and sobbing, very faint, something sounded like laughing. It came at odd intervals and never lasted more than a second so you had a hard time pinning it (we watched this show twice, so pardon me if things sound too specific but I’ve had time to think about them). After 30 seconds of this, the screen blurred and twitched violently and something flashed over the screen, as if a single frame was replaced.

The lead animation editor paused and rewound frame by frame. What we saw was horrible. It was a still photo of a dead child. He couldn’t have been more than 6. The face was mangled and bloodied, one eye dangling over his upturned face, popped. He was naked down to his underwear, his stomach crudely cut open and his entrails laying beside him. He was laying on some pavement that was probably a road.
The most upsetting part was that there was a shadow of the photographer. There was no crime tape, no evidence tags or markers, and the angle was completely off for a shot designed to be evidence. It would seem the photographer was the person responsible for the child’s death. We were of course mortified, but pressed on, hoping that it was just a sick joke.

The screen flipped back to Squidward, still sobbing, louder than before, and half body in frame. There was now what appeard to be blood running down his face from his eyes. The blood was also done in a hyper realistic style, looking as if you touched it you’d get blood on your fingers. The wind sounded now as if it were that of a gale blowing through the forest; there were even snapping sounds of branches. The laughing, a deep baritone, lasting at longer intervals and coming more frequently. After about 20 seconds, the screen again twisted and showed a single frame photo.

The editor was reluctant to go back, we all were, but he knew he had to. This time the photo was that of what appeared to be a little girl, no older than the first child. She was laying on her stomach, her barrettes in a pool of blood next to her. Her left eye was too popped out and popped, naked except for underpants. Her entrails were piled on top of her above another crude cut along her back. Again the body was on the street and the photographer’s shadow was visible, very similar in size and shape to the first. I had to choke back vomit and one intern, the only female in the room, ran out. The show resumed.

About 5 seconds after this second photo played, Squidward went silent, as did all sound, like it was when this scene started. He put his tentacles down and his eyes were now done in hyper realism like the others were in the beginning of this episode. They were bleeding, bloodshot, and pulsating. He just stared at the screen, as if watching the viewer. After about 10 seconds, he started sobbing, this time not covering his eyes. The sound was piercing and loud, and most fear inducing of all is his sobbing was mixed with screams. Tears and blood were dripping down his face at a heavy rate. The wind sound came back, and so did the deep voiced laughing, and this time the still photo lasted for a good 5 frames.

The animator was able to stop it on the 4th and backed up. This time the photo was of a boy, about the same age, but this time the scene was different. The entrails were just being pulled out from a stomach wound by a large hand, the right eye popped and dangling, blood trickling down it. The animator proceeded. It was hard to believe, but the next one was different but we couldn’t tell what. He went on to the next, same thing. He want back to the first and played them quicker and I lost it. I vomited on the floor, the animating and sound editors gasping at the screen. The 5 frames were not as if they were 5 different photos, they were played out as if they were frames from a video. We saw the hand slowly lift out the guts, we saw the kid’s eyes focus on it, we even saw two frames of the kid beginning to blink.

The lead sound editor told us to stop, he had to call in the creator to see this. Mr. Hillenburg arrived within about 15 minutes. He was confused as to why he was called down there, so the editor just continued the episode. Once the few frames were shown, all screaming, all sound again stopped. Squidward was just staring at the viewer, full frame of the face, for about 3 seconds. The shot quickly panned out and that deep voice said “DO IT” and we see in Squidward’s hands a shotgun. He immediately puts the gun in his mouth and pulls the trigger. Realistic blood and brain matter splatters the wall behind him, and his bed, and he flies back with the force. The last 5 seconds of this episode show his body on the bed, on his side, one eye dangling on what’s left of his head above the floor, staring blankly at it. Then the episode ends.

Mr Hillenburg is obviously angry at this. He demanded to know wht the hell was going on. Most people left the room at this point, so it was just a handful of us to watch it again. Viewing the episode twice only served to imprint the entirety of it in my mind and cause me horrible nightmares. I’m sorry I stayed.

The only theory we could think of was the file was edited by someone in the chain from the drawing studio to here. The CTO was called in to analyze when it happened. The analysis of the file did show it was edited over by new material. However, the timestamp of it was a mere 24 seconds before we began viewing it. All equipment involved was examined for foreign software and hardware as well as glitches, as if the time stamp may have glitched and showed the wrong time, but everything checked out fine. We don’t know what happened and to this day nobody does.

There was an investigation due to the nature of the photos, but nothing came of it. No child seen was identified and no clues were gathered from the data involved nor physical clues in the photos. I never believed in unexplainable phenomena before, but now that I have something happen and can’t prove anything about it beyond anecdotal evidence, I think twice about things.""
In most YouTube videos on the subject, this is the account used. It is allegedly the true and original account of the episode, although it has not yet been proven.

Needless to say, it will most likely change you entire outlook on Spongebob Squarepant"

I have been taking Xanax daily for around a year and a couple of months for severe panic disorder and agoraphobia along with 20 MG of fluoxetine. I take around 0.25 during the day and 0.5 to sleep. I understand the daily use of Xanax is not the best solution however it has saved my life in one way or another as I was treated my anxiety with alcohol which led to serious alcoholism.

I have been on an internship abroad for 6 months now and j am going back home for a month or two where I will see my childhood friends. I used to go out a lot with them back when j was drinking but the last time I saw them I started not seeing them to be less present in the alcohol/pub scenes. I don't want to lose my friends and I am going to put some effort to go out with them but I always have this anxiety of the excuse of not drinking. I am thinking of just ordering one beer and sip it slowly to avoid any questions, there is nothing worse for me than having to explaining why I am not drinking and I can't keep on using the antibiotics. I know that I am not going to go back to alcohol it's been already 1 year and a half and I am not even interested in drinking but maybe just ordering a beer and barely finishing it can make me feel more comfortable and avoid being a total outcast

I Just wanted to know whah you would do in my place and if you ever drank a beer with 0.25 Xanax or drank a beer and then take 0.5 Xanax before sleeping. Will drinking half of it affect my health in any way, is it not worth it? 

Thank you "

https://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2548251

by Marion Nestle, PhD, MPH in *JAMA Intern Medicine*, September 12, 2016

&gt; Industry-sponsored nutrition research, like that of research sponsored by the tobacco, chemical, and pharmaceutical industries, almost invariably produces results that confirm the benefits or lack of harm of the sponsor’s products, even when independently sponsored research comes to opposite conclusions.1 Although considerable evidence demonstrates that those industries deliberately influenced the design, results, and interpretation of the studies they paid for,2 much less is known about the influence of food-company sponsorship on nutrition research. Typically, the disclosure statements of sponsored nutrition studies state that the funder had no role in their design, conduct, interpretation, writing, or publication. Without a “smoking gun” it is difficult to prove otherwise.

&gt; In this issue of JAMA Internal Medicine, Kearns and colleagues3 report on having found a smoking gun. From a deep dive into archival documents from the 1950s and 1960s, they have produced compelling evidence that a sugar trade association not only paid for but also initiated and influenced research expressly to exonerate sugar as a major risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD). Although studies at that time indicated a relationship between high-sugar diets and CHD risk, the sugar association preferred scientists and policymakers to focus on the role of dietary fat and cholesterol. The association paid the equivalent of more than $48 000 in today’s dollars to 3 nutrition professors—at Harvard no less—to publish a research review that would refute evidence linking sugars to CHD.

&gt; The sponsored review appeared in 2 parts in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1967. Its authors acknowledged support from the industry-funded Nutrition Foundation, but they did not mention the sugar association’s specific funding of their review. Their first article demonstrates a close correlation between sugar and fat “consumption” (actually amounts in the food supply) and mortality in 14 countries (Figure).4 To minimize the association with sugar, the authors seem to have cherry-picked existing data. Despite their having previously published studies linking both fats and sugars to CHD risk, their review gave far more credence to studies implicating saturated fat than it did to those implicating sugars.

&gt; The documents leave little doubt that the intent of the industry-funded review was to reach a foregone conclusion. The investigators knew what the funder expected, and produced it. Whether they did this deliberately, unconsciously, or because they genuinely believed saturated fat to be the greater threat is unknown. But science is not supposed to work this way. The documents make this review seem more about public relations than science.

&gt; This 50-year-old incident may seem like ancient history, but it is quite relevant, not least because it answers some questions germane to our current era. Is it really true that food companies deliberately set out to manipulate research in their favor? Yes, it is, and the practice continues. In 2015, the New York Times obtained emails revealing Coca-Cola’s cozy relationships with sponsored researchers who were conducting studies aimed at minimizing the effects of sugary drinks on obesity.5 Even more recently, the Associated Press obtained emails showing how a candy trade association funded and influenced studies to show that children who eat sweets have healthier body weights than those who do not.6 The results of such studies have obvious implications for public health.

&gt; For this reason, it is of more than academic interest to find out when food companies began to fund research for public relations purposes. Fred Stare, then chair of Harvard’s nutrition department and senior author of the 1967 review, began soliciting donations from food companies in the early 1940s but insisted that these be unrestricted and pooled into a common fund for research and education.7 If earlier examples to the contrary occurred, they were not disclosed. If nothing else, the analysis by Kearns et al3 makes it clear why full disclosure of funding sources is essential.

&gt; In addition, their study is highly relevant to ongoing debates about the relative harm of fats and sugars. By 1967, as the Figure shows, both sugar and saturated fat had been identified as mortality risk factors. But for decades following the funded review, scientists and dietary guidelines focused on reducing saturated fat as the primary strategy for CHD prevention. They also advised consuming sugars in moderation, but mainly to prevent tooth decay. Today, the balance has shifted to less concern about fat and much greater concern about sugars.

&gt; It is worth noting that this debate focuses on sugars and saturated fats rather than on the foods that contain them. This approach, termed “nutritionism” to refer to the reductive use of single nutritional factors to stand for foods and dietary patterns, is inherently misleading.8 In excess, both sugars and saturated fat are markers of Western dietary patterns high in calories from meat, processed foods, and sugary drinks, all associated with increased chronic disease risk.9

&gt; As George Santayana famously said in Reason of Common Sense (1905), “Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.” Today, it is almost impossible to keep up with the range of food companies sponsoring research—from makers of the most highly processed foods, drinks, and supplements to producers of dairy foods, meats, fruits, and nuts—typically yielding results favorable to the sponsor’s interests.1 Food company sponsorship, whether or not intentionally manipulative, undermines public trust in nutrition science, contributes to public confusion about what to eat, and compromises Dietary Guidelines in ways that are not in the best interest of public health.

&gt; Kearns et al3 urge policymakers to view industry-funded studies with some skepticism. This is excellent advice. Disclosure of funding sources helps but is not sufficient to address the potential conflicts that can occur with such funding. These authors3 have done the nutrition science community a great public service by bringing this historical example to light. May it serve as a warning not only to policymakers, but also to researchers, clinicians, peer reviewers, journal editors, and journalists of the need to consider the harm to scientific credibility and public health when dealing with studies funded by food companies with vested interests in the results—and to find better ways to fund such studies and to prevent, disclose, and manage potentially conflicted interests."
52ghlr,1,2016-09-12,Xanax and anxiety advice,madridista931,Drugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/52ghlr/xanax_and_anxiety_advice/,"Hello everyone,

I have been taking Xanax daily for around a year and a couple of months for severe panic disorder and agoraphobia along with 20 MG of fluoxetine. I take around 0.25 during the day and 0.5 to sleep. I understand the daily use of Xanax is not the best solution however it has saved my life in one way or another as I was treated my anxiety with alcohol which led to serious alcoholism, I stopped drinking for around 1 year and a half and I managed to get my life together. 

I have been on an internship abroad for 6 months now and j am going back home for a month or two where I will see my childhood friends. I used to go out a lot with them back when j was drinking but the last time I saw them I started not seeing them to be less present in the alcohol/pub scenes. I don't want to lose my friends and I am going to put some effort to go out with them but I always have this anxiety of the excuse of not drinking. 

I am thinking of just ordering one beer and sip it slowly to avoid any questions, there is nothing worse for me than having to explaining why I am not drinking and I really don't want to open up about my personal problems.I know that I am not going to go back to alcohol it's been already 1 year and a half and I am not even interested in drinking but maybe just ordering a beer and barely finishing it can make me feel more comfortable and avoid being a total outcast

I Just wanted to know whah you would do in my place and if you ever drank a beer with 0.25 Xanax or drank a beer and then take 0.5 Xanax before sleeping. Will drinking half of it affect my health in any way, is it not worth it? 

Thank you "
52ginp,5,2016-09-12,From PHP 4 to PHP 7: modernizing a 13-year-old custom-built CMS. I need an adult. Help me.,rustbeltgelt,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/52ginp/from_php_4_to_php_7_modernizing_a_13yearold/,"Alright, so, context: I graduated from school this May and began working in June for a very small local factory. I stay in a small town in the Rust Belt; I'm very happy to be able to find work in my field, in a community where we are still trying to revive an obsolete manufacturing industry.

What I soon have to do at work is kind of a microcosm of that. Basically, in 2003, the company I work for hired a team of students &amp; recent grads as interns to build them a custom CMS for internal use in the factory. In 2003, I was 11. We are using a custom CMS that was written when I was still baby-deving on Neopets. *At the time*, they were students &amp; juniors my age now who did a fantastic job writing thousands of pages of PHP 4 to meet the company's needs. Again: *at the time*. This was 2003, remember. This team of former interns has since moved away &amp; found new work.

So now it's been 13 years and the company is *still* using this CMS, in its exact form. Our servers run 5.5.9. Obviously everyone is itching for updates to the CMS. There are 2 of us in IT and our first choice of course would be to simply start from scratch, because it's 2016 now and it wouldn't be hard at all for us to simply construct something for us out of any of the wonderful CMSs &amp; CMFs there are to choose from here in 2016.

However, our boss insists we must not start from scratch. We *must* not ""waste"" this particular CMS. The other IT guy (he does server admin &amp; LAMP stuff mostly) is in the process of upgrading our dev servers from 5.5.9 to PHP 7.

I am honestly fucked and have no idea how I'm going to efficiently modernize this old CMS. It would be so much easier, faster, and cost-effective to start from scratch--but, since our boss insists it will be wasteful, I can't do that. I also can't take forever on this. I don't know what to do. Does anyone know where I should begin?

(As an aside, I'm the only one here with hands-on PHP dev experience.)"

52gu4v,33,2016-09-12,"A 3.5 GPA at a top 10 college is not enough - featuring our dear friend, gaslighting",GaslighterThrowaway,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/52gu4v/a_35_gpa_at_a_top_10_college_is_not_enough/,"(I hope the title isn't too arrogant or patronising, it just feels so helpless that nothing is ever enough)

Throwaway because friends know my Reddit account.

Seriously, this happens way too often. I'm someone who believes in standing up for yourself, but after standing up for myself for the past 100 times I know no matter how much I reason with NDad he will *always* be right (of course) - so now I just nod and say yes, and then fuck off because that's better than arguing with him, *for the third time this week.*

Before the end of spring semester, I'd asked my dad if he had any work available at his shop over the summer, as I would've liked to make some money and learn a bit about the business. I'm studying a natural science, but I like the idea of running a business - especially the financial aspect, as it has a lot of numbers to it, and I like numbers. So I thought I could spend a big chunk of my summer helping him out with work, having some fun, and feeling fulfilled in a sense because I've made some money through my own sweat. He said ""Yes of course"" and I was excited, because it's not usually like him to react with enthusiasm like that.

Disclosure (and I hope I don't sound arrogant saying this): I study at a top 10 college and my dad has continually been pushing me to have the highest grades and work as much as possible, but I still think I can finish college with a high GPA while also, you know, having friends and going to events and being part of student societies. I had enough work, trapped in my room, studying for my SATs and APs to get really high scores and get into a good uni, and now I don't really enjoy the thought of rotting over a book for most of the week (even though I still do a lot of studying). I've found a new group of friends at college, and they have similar interests to mine, so we visit student societies a lot which really helps take the edge off when most people around you are doing internships at Goldman Sachs and working 18 hours a day. (again, this is just explaining the context, I don't want to come off as some ""oooh look at me and my cool type-A friends"" guy, so I'm sorry if that's the impression this is giving)

Anyways, I digress... Cue the end of semester. I come home, dad is disappointed I have a 3.5 GPA and thus I wouldn't be able to ""put myself out there for headhunters."" (because I'm not among the top five people in my class) I say he shouldn't worry, I'm at a really good school studying a natural science, if I so much as sneeze after graduation I'll get a job (as one of my friends likes to joke). He gets pissed, tells me I'm not taking my life seriously, tells me ""You've gotta be kidding me, focus on your grades"" when I ask him about working at the shop during the summer. We have several arguments, he says I shouldn't have ""my head in the clouds"" about working during uni (???) because literally all that matters are good grades and connections.

Fast forward to today. I mention to dad about how I'd like to get an internship in a company related to my degree, hopefully after this academic year, and he says ""Yeah I'm just not gonna listen to you after the shit you pulled.""

I'm dumbfounded. What shit did I pull?

""You were *so* yuppity to work at the shop during term time, then you come home and don't speak a word about it. You just want to be lazy and have others take care of your responsibilities and remind you of the promises you've made.""

At this point, the gears in my brain stick, as I'm trying to decipher what he's just said. Wanting to be lazy? Have others take care of me? Not speaking a word about the work I'd asked? 

So I remind him (in the most soothing voice possible, of course, because God forbid I flat-out tell him he's *wrong*) that I didn't forget about my ""promise"" and in fact had asked about it after I'd come home, and that he told me not to speak about it because he wouldn't allow it (and that I should focus on studying, even though it was summer break... ? Still haven't figured this out) And here he just cracks.

""Ex-*cuse me?*"" he exclaims, turning to look me in the eyes (which is a start, as he'd been too busy watching TV to even pay me the slighest bit of attention as I was making conversation with him). ""What did you just say? When the FUCK will you stop lying, like that bitch of a mother of yours?""

Ah, the standard ""you're just like your mother, always expecting others to do your work for you"" response. He usually waits to use that one, but this time he started the argument with heavy artillery. Okay, get ready.

""When the FUCK did you say anything like that? Do you fucking expect me to believe you that this really happened? You were all crying about how you wanted work over the summer, then bam, break time comes around, and you're nowhere to be found.""

(this is all, obviously, untrue. I had spoken to him about work, and he told me no chance. Maybe because I didn't get the perfect GPA - but I've already stopped analyzing and re-analyzing THAT conversation in my head, like I do all my arguments with him)

What follows is just an endless stream of insults about how I'm lazy and worthless and should be grateful I have food on my table because obviously the thing that matters most in a parent is how much money they bring home, right? Comparisons between my mom and me, and how I've inherited her lazy gene, and how I'm a ""snake"" like her because I ""pull this shit"" all the time and ""expect others to do [my] work for [me]."" At this point I just give up, blankly staring at the TV because there's nothing else to do except wait for him to blow his fuse and calm down. Thankfully, because I don't call him on his bullshit, this happens much quicker than usual. I feel defeated because finally, after so many arguments, I've started doing what my mom does when she argues with him (which is multiple times a week): just sit still, say yes/stare into the distance, wait for him to calm down.

Actually, my mom doesn't argue with him. No, she just stays put while he fucking carpet bombs her psychologically and destroys any lingering self-esteem she might still have. 

It's more difficult than it sounds. I'm still actually asking myself, ""Did I really mention the work after I came home from college?"" even though **I know I did,** but somehow he still makes me question myself, for days at a time. I don't know if he's a true narcissist, but in the past he's basically told me things like ""I work a lot and make a lot of money - it doesn't matter if you never see me, I put food on your table, *I'm doing my part as a parent*"" and then freaks out when I don't immediately run into his arms when he comes home from work and spend all my free time with him. I dunno.

I just wanted to share this. It feels kinda cathartic, but I also feel defeated. I really can't wait to finish college, find my own place and start my life, basically. For a short while at the beginning of summer, I was home alone for about 10 days, and it felt *fucking blissful.* Then my mom and dad came home, and *literally the first day they were back* they started arguing.

Oh well. Such is life. How was your day?"

I work at a small division of a (undisclosed) Fortune 500 company. I was excited as the office looked pretty interesting, and the people seemed alright. It looked like an awesome first ""real"" job after dinky jobs like being a TA and tutor. ...and it's boring. 

Completely, utterly boring. I'd be down if I had any busywork, but not even that. I'm doing nothing but maybe coding on Codepen every once in a while and a few things here and there like cleaning up the computer room.

The servers are all maintained by the parent division, and it's all really boring Microsoft stuff that cannot be changed or modified without their direct permission. There's people out there with shitty HP laptops with their keys falling apart complaining to **me** that they need them replaced. But I unfortunately have to point them the other direction because I'm just an intern. That's where the other problem lies: my boss.

The company is drastically downsizing IT departments worldwide, so it's just me and my boss. And well... He's a piece of shit. For starters he pretty much forgot to update Windows Server 2008 R2 to 2012, aaaand he ran out of those additional 120 day license extensions. So we had an expired Server OS turning off constantly in the middle of the day, with people asking us why they can't see their networked folders. So I had to find a crack because my dumbass boss can't get things right.

Yep.
A crack.
On day 1 of the job.

And yet, no matter how hard I try to talk to him to let me do more things, like Active Directory for when people have problems accessing their accounts, he insists I'm not ready yet because I do minor mistakes here or there. He says I should write things down (which I do) on my notebook like he does (uhuh, I've never seen him do that ever). He's constantly behind schedule, and no matter how hard I insist on us having weekly reunions to chat on what we should have planned for the week, he never does because he has more important things to do.

Oh, did I forget to mention he forgot to do maintenance on his console air conditioner? It started to drop shittons of water, so more and more water started to seep out of the computer room and into the carpet. In spite of telling him that this is a very concerning problem that needs fixing as soon as possible, he got to work almost an hour and thirty minutes late, got scolded by his boss, and started to rant to another one of the employees because he didn't do the proper maintenance he was HIRED TO DO.  Oh, he more or less called me a drama queen, too. 

On top of all that, I have no car and I often times end up waiting 2 and half hours (sometimes more) in order to go back home because public transportation here is the worst. 

What do I do? I'm getting seriously depressed here, I'm trying to juggle this crap and my classes which I take from 8 am to 4 pm every day. Both are taking a toll on my life right now; I barely have time to hang out or go on dates with my girlfriend (I haven't seen her for a month). 

I'm at odds here... Sorry for the rant, I'm just so frustrated.

I had a year and a half sobriety until recently. I did a 6 month program and stayed there after I graduated to work as a Drug and Alcohol Counseling Intern. I worked there for 7 months and then moved back home where I did very well for a few months. My girlfriend then broke up with me, admitting to me that she lied about being in love with me as I was with her, and led me on through our long distance relationship. She is or was the only girl I've been in love with truly and it broke my heart. I then made a horrible decision to relapse on heroin to escape that reality. After a couple weeks of using, I realized what I had thrown away and immediately called the program I worked for (Elevate Addiction Services) and told them what had happened and that I needed to come back for a program. They have been nothing but supportive and helpful and worked with my insurance to cover most of the costs and even waived the $10,000 out of pocket fee. Now I just need to pay the deductible so I can start the program. I picked up extra shifts at work to try and come up with the money, but it would be quite awhile until I will have enough to make it down there, and everyday I spend up here is another day I fall deeper into my addiction. I have never asked for handouts and feel absolutely horrible about doing it now, but unfortunately I've run out of options. I started a GoFundMe Campaign to try and come up with the rest of the money to pay for the deductible, along with what money I have saved. Thank you to anyone who even stuck with me long enough to read this post, and a huge thank you to anyone willing to donate even the smallest amount. I am forever grateful and appreciative. I know I need to confront my problems and tackle them before it gets out of hand again. Thank you so much.

52h8ip,4,2016-09-12,"My [22M] gf [21F] of 3,5 years unsure about our relationship after months of feeling taken for granted",throwawaythrowe,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/52h8ip/my_22m_gf_21f_of_35_years_unsure_about_our/,"My girlfriend and I are currently going to college and we were together since senior highschool year. We both live in the same city and we attended the same highschool class so we know each other for 7 years. The whole relationship is based on friendship which had evenutally grown into mutual feelings so the bond I feel with her is very deep. We had also experienced and helped each other through some extremely hard moments of our lives like passing of my father, her mother heavily drinking after her father left her mom for another woman and also really bad financial states in which we sometimes did not had enough for basic life requirements like rent, bills and food - and situation was very similar in both of our families.

We had basically grown together in last four or five years and despite the circumstances we always stayed together and managed to grow from our problems individually or with help of each other. The connection sometimes had issues and doubts, but we talked through them and managed to fix them mutually. I got to be honest, I think some of our issues may have not been adressed properly on time due to the fact that she is a person that sometimes easily steps away from fighting and I am the person that would quickly say he will improve or change if the solution to the problem feels reasonable and full of compromise. Sometimes we would not talk deeply about the problem, but after a bit of arguing we would feel really bad that our behaviour led to a fight and then agree to continue our relationship with trying to improve something that made us argue. I seriously think this was successful in some situations because I really felt the need to improve myself for her and myself and she did too. Her reasons were almost always very reasonable, respectable and with goal to improve our relationship and each other and I believe so were most of mine. The problem is that I would occasionally ignore her true feelings and words and just easily say that I will change, without actually putting enough effort into it so after short time of trying to improve myself on certain subject the issue itself would fade away on me and I would quickly return to my “before” state, as she says. She would then feel disappointed, but she would not tell me that immediately. The feeling of disappointment would than build up in her and then she would start to distance herself from me. After I would see that she is in real emotional pain I would feel scared, guilty for ignoring her and afraid of losing her so I did everything to get her back. Surprisingly, I had always somehow managed to get her back despite my carelessness and selfishness. I would then listen to her, deeply communicate and try to understand her and eventually I would regain her trust. She had her quirks also, but she always seemed a lot more emotionally stable than me so she always did her best to improve herself and she kinda always knew what she wanted. Her actions were always fulfilled with compassion and patience, which is why this thing worked out in really dark times I had been going through at some point of our relationship and I am really grateful she did stay with me.

Through love and respect we had always found a way to regain connection, but in the last few months we are really struggling to regain it properly, and I seriously think it is mostly because of my inability to stay caring and engaged into relationship when I am really busy working or studying, but also I often become very lazy in a relationship and just focus on myself and my goals, irresponsibly (but kinda subconsciously) thinking she would wait for me to have time and love for her. After realizing what douchebag I turn into after some time of not giving her affection she deserves makes me want to punch myself, and I somehow managed to get myself into this kind of behaviour for too many times.

I am aware this was a long intro to our current problem, but I also believe it is also really relevant for the whole story.

Let’s get back to last summer. After two years of doing dead-end student jobs I finally found the thing I want to do in my life, programming, and I felt very passionate about it. Because I was *really* struggling with money, I then decided to dedicate my time to learn quickly so I can easily find a job  and fix my financials. Besides going to college, I think this was almost everything I did with my time. I sometimes felt so tired and puzzled that I forgot to eat or felt sick from exhaustion, but I thought it was worth it and that it will be worth eventually.

Only few months later I got an internship I was very very excited for as it was for the company I admired. This was on the beggining of this year and because I was on probation work I had put extreme amounts of effort into keeping that job, doing things like studying and researching immediately after I went home from work, day or night. Our time together struggled in these times a lot because I haven’t had energy to do anything else besides programming, but she then said she understands this is important to me and that she believed in me so she gave me full support. I promised her it it would be only temporary until I get confirmation I can stay indefinitely in the company and that we will work on everything after I secure my job.  Financial stress was really big for me and feeling of financial security after years of being next to broke felt like I can seriously create meaningful and engaging life for myself, my family and for my girlfriend.

The problem was, after I had been accepted to stay indefinitely I did not change my tempo a lot. I felt like I should not settle down now, but continue to grow and learn. I was telling her that it is for both of us, but I think I lied not only to her, but to myself.  I loved the feeling of progress I was making, but I was also slightly scared of losing my job because I had no other income so I pushed further and further with this rhythm, blindly hoping that it *will not* impact on our relationship and that she will love me forever no matter what. idiot

She slowly started losing interest in me because she had given so much energy into supporting me and waiting for me. She told me that she understands my needs for financial independence and personal growth, but that this is too much for her and that she does not know me any more. I would come to her place with plan to hang out with her, but I would quickly reach for my computer and just work or learn more without the actual critical need to do so. I completely ignored how she felt.

She told me that the way I behave is changing the way she feels, but I tried to comfort her that this will all change in the summer when all challenges will be over (work and final college exams). She again had patience but our relationship was seriously messed up. I sometimes actually had to work really long because I also did some freelancing so I could save more money for the summer and school fees, but I really wanted to improve our relationship at the same time. Our time together looked extremely sad because she sometimes cancelled her plans for me and than I would show up late or even come and still be in front of computer.  In times when I tried to make love and make it up for being emotionally away, she felt used because I engaged only when I really needed it, not thinking at all about how she feels. We may have had a few fun times in those 6 months, but seriously that was next to nothing. All of those problems true, but I was too self centered to actually see it, accept it and do immediately something properly about it.

Finally, summer came and she went on vacation with her friends. We communicated through those 3 weeks apart and after that we went to vacation together. I though it was time to improve things, so I did try. I finally had proper free time for anything I wanted. We talked and regained some communication, things started to be a bit better, but I did not try hard enough based on the actions I  did through past few months. I promised her I will change and that I would plan my days better so that we have time for ourselves. We then returned to our home city to study for finals and knew we would not see each other again ofther through this period.

Despite the fact that we haven’t had time to hang out often, I felt like the relationship slightly improved. It did, but not on the levels I thought it were. I finally realized the depth of the problem when a week ago we got into a fight where she said she is seriously questitoning our relationship after months of being taken for granted.

It finally hit my head properly and I had a mental breakdown. How could have I been so blind? I realized this needs serious discussion and we had seen each other few days after that. We exchanged what we feel about this relationship and she told me that this constant disappointment led to her being unsecure and unhappy. She said she still loves me and that she still understands that I was busy with work, but that reality is that it changed her.

I read a lot of articles on how to approach this kind of problem in relationship, but this goes so deep I did not know where to start. I told her I realized that I am responsible for the love I sucked out from her and that I really struggled at those times, really wishing to do my best for everyone, but managed only to do it for myself. She said she is willing to see where this relationship will go, but she needs time to think about everything and how she feels.  We talked about every problem we’ve had in the past and present. I think honesty is only thing that could create something positive after all this.

We are now still seeing each other after that and communicating, but taking smaller steps. I try really hard to understand how she feels, but I am unsure how to properly approach this. I love her but I was stupid. I understand that this could lead to a break up and if she feels like that, so be it. My question is should I contact her a lot and show affection or keep it slow while giving her space?

TL;DR Got a job and was very busy, but also focused on myself and lazy about relationship. My girlfriend stayed with me and supported me, but now she does not feel the same anymore because we've distanced from each other.

Seriously, thank you everyone who reads this."
52hb56,0,2016-09-12,"I am thinking about double majoring in Computer Science, but need a little bit advice?",haramwothebae,computerscience,https://www.reddit.com/r/computerscience/comments/52hb56/i_am_thinking_about_double_majoring_in_computer/,"So I am currently a Biology (B.S.) major in the US who is also completing the pre-medical course of study. I just started my sophomore year of college, but with summer classes and AP credit, I am halfway done with my major. 

Because I am relatively ahead, I basically planned to get my undergraduate career done in 3 years as opposed to 4. However, I decided to take a Comp Sci class this year to fulfill a gen-ed requirement and I realized how much I miss studying computer science. So I am thinking about just graduating when I was originally supposed to (2019) in order to complete a CS BA major along with my Biology major. 

I was in a special program in high school where I had to take technology-heavy courses for all 4 years. I decided to take the programming track so I learned how to code in Visual Basic, C#, SAS, and Java. Plus, I did an internship in IT and learned a bit of Bash and Python. I really excelled in my programming courses, I would always score the highest on all my tests (meaning I really understood the logic/theory behind everything) and I had no problem with any of the projects. In fact, my teacher in high school used to make us write code by hand for her tests and I never had any issues with that. So I think I have a good baseline understanding of programming. 

Anyway, in high school I also pursued my interests in health/medicine and biology inside and outside of the classroom. When I went to college I was sure that I would rather pursue medicine as opposed to computer science (I liked my CS classes, but I did not like my CS internship at all). 

I still want to go to medical school. Since college has started I have done ample hours of hospital volunteering, research, a bit of shadowing, etc. so I know that my passion lies in medicine. However, being in my comp class, I really miss computer science as well. I would love to study the intersection of computer science and biology. 

I would have liked to do a computational biology major, but my school has nothing of that sort. I was thinking instead doing a B.A. in Computer Science (there are a few classes in this course of study that deal with computational biology). I do not want to do a B.S. because I do not want to take any math classes in college (I fulfilled my calculus and statistics requirements in high school).

Ultimately, I would like to use this knowledge and try to get a position in a computational biology lab (I know of two that I would like to get into). Also, I would hope that a BA in Computer Science would help me learn enough programming to program something really useful and creative related to Biology (even on a very small scale). Additionally, as a female, I think I would offer that diversity factor medical schools are looking for (since there's not a whole lot of females who major in CS). 

My ultimate question is: am I being to naive in thinking that I could complete a CS major at the university level? Is my background sufficient or do you think I will struggle through the coursework? Even though I took all these classes and really understood these programming languages when I took them, I haven't coded since, so I do not know how much I would remember."

thank you in advance fpr your advice and help!
Later this year I will be doing an internship in China for 6 month. I plan to travel after the internship, and thus I don't want to take my primary Laptop, which is a Thinkpad L450. It is just to large and to expensive to me. I don't want to bother much about material stuff while travelling and worry if someone will steal it or else. 
I do not need the notebook to be able to perform all the tasks during my scientific internship, there will be computers in the lab. What I need it to do is to be decent to write on, and be able to perform basic online tasks and office. Watch videos. Skype. 

* **Total budget and country of purchase:** 
Maybe 250 €/ 300.$, less is of course appreciated, am considering buying used

* **Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications to your requirements for the money? Pick or include any that apply.** 
I am not sure about this 2 in 1 would be nice maybe.

* **How important is weight to you?**
as I will travel with it, it is a main factor

* **Which OS do you require? Windows, Linux, Mac.**
Windows

* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 
11''-13'', during 6 month in china I would rather buy a screen, than carry around a large computer afterwards

* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run. If you have no requirements, put N/A.** 
Very light photo editing. 

* **If you're gaming (leave blank if you put N/A above...), do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** 


* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable business grade build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** 
 a not completely horrible keybord would be great. Sd card reader. 

* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**
I was considering buying the Lenovo Miix 300, I could get it for 150 €. "

52hv4y,1,2016-09-12,21 [M4F] - Starting Over,burnbabyburner69,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/52hv4y/21_m4f_starting_over/,"On September 22nd, 2036, a deep space probe was launched from Cape Canaveral. Its creators had designed it to detect supernovas in far away galaxies, but they had no idea that it's destiny laid in another direction. In order to escape the solar system, it had to use the Sun as a gravity assist. Readings taken from the probe as it circled the Sun were almost ignored completely, as many thought that the probe's sensors wouldn't read any significant information. Luckily though, a team of interns had no better work to do at the time and combed over the data as a way to keep their skills honed. One of them found an abnormal measurement and reported it to her superiors, but she got no word back about it. She figured that it must have been nothing. She was wrong. As soon as her superior looked over her discovery, he knew something was amiss. He went straight to the top and a small, top-secret task force was commissioned to investigate the measurement. A couple decades passed by before they reached their conclusion. The chemical makeup of the Sun was not nearly as stable as had been accepted for so long. The Earth didn't have billions of years left before the Sun blew up, it had hundreds.

President Alvarez had just been sworn in weeks before he was informed of the matter. While still keeping the veil of a normal presidency around him, he spent the entirety of his 8 year term researching the options that Earth had left. It was settled within a year that Earth was doomed. The Sun had reached the point of no return centuries ago and moving the Earth out of the blast radius was [out of the question](http://imgur.com/a/SIfaO).

Obviously, there had to be some kind of evacuation, but technology was extremely limited. Even when the other governments of the world were contacted, their pooled efforts could only create one spaceship that had could carry the resources necessary for sustaining life far enough away from the Sun. It wasn't all doom and gloom though. The research on designing the base accelerated quickly, and the spaceship itself was designed in less than a decade. The same probe that discovered the Sun's fatal flaw was retasked to scout out planets, and a small list of acceptable candidates was assembled quickly. Models suggested that the primary planet candidate could have its atmosphere be made breathable in less than a century and that the soil could be made farmable, though that would take a significantly longer amount of time.

All that was easy. The hard part came when it was time to select the people to fill the ark, as most of the people who knew of it called it. Some thought they should all be engineers, people who could manage the base well and troubleshoot mechanical problems the easiest. Others wanted a more balanced team that could manage all sorts of things, like the plants or the crew's health. A few politicians even suggested that the crew should be made of philosophers and artists to preserve Earth culture.

The decision was largely made for them though as two new problems surfaced. First, the cryogenics systems didn't develop as nicely as the others. Tests on people over 50 were catastrophic, with volunteers not lasting more than a few days before the tests had to be stopped for safety reasons. Further tests and calculations estimated that no one over 40 could survive the journey. To add onto the problems, volunteers with even average amounts of stress were much more likely to suffer heart attacks in their sleep state.
The second problem was the elephant in the room that everyone tried to ignore for as long as possible. To continue the human race, the crew had to breed. But the ship could only hold six people, five women and one man to ensure long term species procreation. There would have to be incest just to create a third generation. Knowing that it had to be done, research was done on the science of incestuous breeding and it was found that only .0001% of the population had the genes necessary to sustain a healthy family tree.

With these two factors in mind, the most qualified candidates were identified from a short list. Most people who were involved in the decision wanted the candidates to be trained and debriefed extensively before the launch. However, the cryogenic scientists made it clear that the stress of knowing the fate of humanity was to be carried on their shoulders was far too much. The only plan that ensured the safety of the candidates was to sedate them in their sleep and put them into the cryochambers without even the slightest bit of warning or preparation.

Thousands of years later, the lights in the spaceship turned on. It had landed on the virgin planet just as the scientists and engineers designed it to. The cryochambers started their three day reanimation process, and once the crew members exited, they barely had a chance to speak to each other before a video played in the center of the room.

""Hello, I'm Dr. Baker. Welcome to Project Phoenix.""

***

This is obviously a long term prompt that will focus on breeding, and if the RP goes on for a long time, incest. However, this most likely isn't going to be a sex-focused RP. The main focus will most likely be on the characters themselves as they go through the emotions of knowing they're the last humans alive and the struggles that they'll face just to survive and deal with each other. I'm looking for realistic character development, with each one taking a different view on their situation.
Breeding is the only truly necessary kink for this RP, but others can be discussed. Here's my [kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/ZTXuOUH.png) if you want to check it out. I'm always open to doing this prompt, so no matter when you're reading this, feel free to shoot me an orange envelope!"

Things seemed so much simpler two years ago. 

I'm graduating university this semester with a Professional Bachelor's in Industrial Technology and Management. I used to study aerospace engineering and engineering management and I quit it for this more or less pointless degree because I couldn't handle the stress of engineering nor was it something I wanted to do anymore. Now, I'm facing poor job outlook because where I'm working currently is irrelevant in respect to what I studied (currently item procession clerk at an insurance company).

I left social media last week and now I feel more alone than I felt before. Friends who used to Snap me every day haven't spoken much to me as of when I left social media. I have good friends, but I don't see em much (both childhood buds are away for uni or jobs). They both have serious relationships and they dedicate more time and effort to them than to the three of us together, but I've expected this. Friends here at home are great but I can't only hang with em for so much. I don't have a girlfriend; I really crave a meaningful relationship but at the same time I don't want one because I don't think I'm mature enough yet to be capable of one. 

I'm finally making okay money (well, with respect to what I should be making had I an internship or a job lined up after graduation) which I'll need because I'm planning a month or two month-long backpacking trip to Europe and Scandinavia next summer. I'm very excited for that of course.  At the same time, I really want to (need to, actually) move out into my own place, but that'd mean sacrificing the trip, which I refuse to do.

I dunno, I'm just not feeling really fulfilled at the moment. Part of me really wants to leave here and live elsewhere but I just don't know how to go about that. Everything I'm feeling is just confusing. I'm trying to take it day by day but emotions can be overwhelming one day, then not or feeling completely the opposite the next day. 

Just wanted to vent all this. Haven't really wanting to tell anyone I know closely much of what I'm feeling lately.

52i3jq,1,2016-09-12,That Initial Hurdle...,Dark454,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/52i3jq/that_initial_hurdle/,"Hi, I am a prospective 26 year old from Toronto, Canada looking to potentially start a career in IT, and a bit of an outlier, to say the least.


While I was in high school, I slowly started to experience chronic fatigue and I found that I would get tired very quickly when I did virtually anything that required mental effort. I barely finished high school and only decided to head off to University because I thought my problems were caused by smoking weed (albeit infrequently) the previous year, and assumed it would clear up since it had been a long while since I smoked.


Fast forward to halfway through my first semester of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo, and I am struggling. I had no idea what was wrong with me, but I dropped out before my first set of exams due to burnout.


My parents convinced me that my failure was due to being too young and immature to move out and live on my own (read: University residence). I reject this, of course, since I didn't really have any added responsibilities except an occasional laundry session. Anyway, they convinced me to try University again even though I felt the same in regards to my health. Long story short, I dropped out again, this time for good.


I finally found out a few years later that I had a disease causing me to have chronic fatigue and a low tolerance to stress. After getting treated, I suffered with depression for a few years, which I strongly suspect is due to me not being able to move forward in life. Before and during this time, (and presently), I have worked part-time at McDonald's. 


Fast forward again to the present...and I am 26 and working part-time in a dead end job for minimum wage. Dropping out twice has plagued me with debt that I have now finally managed to pay off with my job, thanks to living rent-free with my parents.


My question is...how can I once again attempt to break it into the IT world? My depression is mostly taken care of...however I cannot afford University. My math and programming skills have, for the most part, atrophied since I have been in school. I have always enjoyed programming, however finding the motivation to self-teach myself during this depressing and fatigued time has proven difficult. I also want to get a career started ASAP and would prefer not to spend another 4-5 years on University before I can even start gaining experience (excluding internships).


My goal right now is to get a decent paying job in the IT field with the potential to climb up the ladder, and experience working in different positions that I might be interested in specializing in later. I understand that having a CS degree will open many doors for me later on in my career, but right now I would be very happy with a job in which I can learn on the job.


What would be the fastest route to landing a job with potential career growth? My programming experience consists mostly of C and assembly from my childhood days...I have made a few offline hacks for the game Starcraft a long time ago. I also have experience in Java (mostly making swing applications) from my high school Computer Science class.


I would like some guidance on what I should teach myself in order to get a development job (or something similar in which I can prove myself for advancement) ASAP. People keep telling me that web development is the craze nowadays, however I am not too keen on spending $8000+ on a three-month boot camp, even if I could afford one. 


The Odin Project and freecodecamp seem like attractive alternatives, but I seem to really enjoy C and low-level stuff, and these courses don't really cover this. I also want to work through SCIP or HtDP as these books seem very efficient in teaching programmers not only how to code, but also how to really design and engineer large scale programs.


For some reason, I have always found that my motivation to do pretty much anything is an order of magnitude greater when I am surrounded by people also trying to learn (i.e. in a computer lab). Upon hearing my story, one guy I met on the bus who was apparently starting a start-up, told he would like to **give me a minimum-wage internship in which I would learn from practically zero, (googling everything on the job), and if/when I was a good programmer, he would hire me as a full-time junior dev.** He has since disappeared.


^THIS is exactly what would be ideal for me. However, if it is not a possibility, and I need to learn by myself and/or at meetups, I would be fine with that too.


So it all boils down to...What can I do to break into the IT field ASAP???? My end goal is to be a software engineer. Money doesn't matter too much, I just want to have the potential to turn programming into a career at some point, and need help getting started with networking and whatnot. If free internships/volunteer work are a thing, I would gladly accept an offer. 


What would be the best use of my time? Odin's Project? freecodecamp? Certs? Something not related to web development at all? Currently I am working through Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie's ""The C Programming Language"". Most of it is so far is review, however it has been years since I have coded seriously, so my problem solving skills are a little rusty. Is it possible to start out with no experience or education in a help desk position and learn from the software developers while on the job or something?


By the way, I would very much like to pursue a Computer Science degree part-time concurrently with a job, however that would be way down the line when I am at least a Junior developer or something with a similar salary. Also, some people think that if you aren't already passionately churning out code in your spare time, and that if you need some external motivation to get started, then you aren't meant to be a programmer. I mostly disagree with this: when I can find the courage and motivation to attempt to write software, nothing makes me happier than solving a difficult logical problem with my google-fu skills. However, I tend to overthink things and the anxiety that manifests itself as a result causes me to procrastinate. I know that for me, getting started is by far the hardest part.


Thanks for any help and guidance, and sorry if this post is a mess, my written/communication skills haven't been put to use in a long time!


I am posting this in both r/ITCareerQuestions and r/CSCareerQuestions.

Basically. I went to film school at School of Visual Arts after leaving high school in 2010. I was excited and nervous to begin my journey on my filmmaking path. A dream I’ve had since I was little (like I’m sure many others have on this sub). Long story short, I dropped out 2 years in because I was feeling lost and didn’t think I could afford the bill anymore. My grandmother died and I broke up with my girlfriend of 5 years at the time. Its been 4 years since I’ve been out of school now, they have been dark times for me. A lot of depression and anxiety. I told myself I’d continue my scripts outside of school, I never did. I fail at my dream and for a little believed I needed to go back to school to get a normal degree to have a stable job. I’m currently in community college working toward a degree in nutrition science. I still have a long way to go to finish and get my degree. Everyday I think of what could have been and what I could do differently right now to help resurrect my fallen dreams of making my own films come true.

I just came on here because I’m honestly lost. I’ve never felt so lost in my whole life and it frightens me. My question to everyone out there would be what would be the best course of action for me? I don’t need pitty talk. I think about this every night before I go to bed. I’m 24 years old. My resume is honestly weak. I’m broke and have no connections to any filmmakers from my past. I’m alone and feel like I’m at the base of a giant mountain I want to climb. I know the journey will be long and hard. I can’t stop listening to my heart for some reason, even though my brain is yelling at me for doing so.

What is the best course of action for someone with no connections, no resume, and no money to go back to film school?

Should I work on small shorts with friends? Although I honestly dread doing this because my friends aren’t as serious as this as I am. 
Should I go Kevin smith style and self fund one of the small Indy scripts I have?
Should I look for an internship? Even if I’m out of college and don’t have great portfolio? I’d imagine there are tons of people that would get the position over me.

I live in north NJ, about 30 minutes for NYC. I’m just lost on where to start my dream up again and any help or advice would really help me out.

* UW &amp; W GPA: 4/4, 5.36/6 (4 for regular, 5 for honors, 6 for AP)

* Class Rank: 1/809

* Coursework: Honors for all core classes, except when AP available (13 AP classes, not including senior year). 3 years of Latin. Did a PLTW elective freshman year, Comp Sci electives (including AP Comp Sci) sophomore and junior year, then a student government period senior year (in previous years I'd only participated in student government outside of class).


**Extracurriculars:**

* Interact Club:  (Rotary service org along the lines of Key Club), president. Member all four years of high school. Plenty of volunteer hours and a wide variety of service projects.

* Student Government Association: class VP all four years of high school. Prom committee, Homecoming game half-time show and court banquet committee lead, constitutional revision committee lead. 

* [National Economics Challenge Team](http://councilforeconed.org/national-economics-challenge/): president and founder. Founded junior year.

* National History Club and Honor Society: vice-president (founding officer). Club just started senior year by teacher. National history day committee.


**Awards:**

* Boys Nation First Alternate for Florida

* Florida Boys State Best Forum Bill

* National Beta Convention 2nd Place Social Studies

* National Merit Semi-Finalist



**My List with reasoning:**

* UF &amp; FSU: Top 2 state schools, parental savings cover in-state COA, state government offers partial merit-scholarships (Bright Futures). Good econ programs.

* University of Maryland: COA isn't too bad for an out-of-state, and the school offers full merit scholarships to 250 individuals (Banneker/Kee scholarship). School is a quick Metro ride from D.C., meaning there are great internship opportunities in the realm of public policy. Some are even for credits. Very good econ program (better than UF or FSU). Scholars program gives additional opportunities in the area of public policy.

* Boston University: I like Boston. Excellent econ program. High COA, but full merit scholarship (Trustee) offered to about 20 freshmen. Fed branch nearby; internships (monetary policy is an interest of mine). I've checked out the campus online and like how it's very urban.

* UChicago: Fantastic econ program, quirky culture which I'm *pretty* sure I'll fit into. Prestige. Fed branch nearby; internships (monetary policy is an interest of mine). Liberal education.

* Yale: Fantastic econ program. Prestige. Yale. Liberal education.

* Duke: Full-merit Robertson Scholarship offered to 16 freshman, comes with international trips and other special opportunities, modeled after Rhodes. Econ and public policy studies are top 2 majors, so the campus culture definitely reflects my interests.

Everytime I take my CS classes, I talk to some people after class or maybe discuss test to see how classmate do and sometimes we work on group project and I talk that way. After semester over, and new semester start or I get internship or they do, it is different people in my class next sem. so I don't make any friends.  Sometimes I get too busy with school work that I forget about making friend. I try to make effort to talk to people, but it only go so far. It been like this since freshman year What can I do to make close friend? My facebook friends have lots of friends when they post picture, but they in different school. Did i pick wrong school?"

First post on TRP. This is a field report regarding discussions and relations with different women. This covers one before swallowing the pill, and one after. I go into a bit of detail for both of these scenarios, as to explain how it all happened. Hopefully it will benefit some of you.


**Background**


I am 22, in my last year of college studying engineering; decent shape, workout 3 times a week, 5'10"" and 175lbs at about 15% body fat. I am definitely working on improving but my point is, I'm decent looking at least. I'm also good in social situations and have been involved in greek life. I was led to TRP like most of you, by a girl who screwed me over. Well, in my case, it was a gradual transition of figuring it out on my own until around April this year when I found this subreddit. Now, about my discussion...


**Body**


*Ashley*


Girl 1 was my high school sweetheart, I'll refer to her as Ashley. HB7, Great girl; conservative household, religious, very submissive. We broke up going into college because of a few hour time difference. We were both virgins at the time and she was saving it for marriage and I didn't want that. I managed to string her along though while I was dating other women (with varying success) throughout college. 

Fast forward to last summer (2015) when I have an internship across the country. I'm back in my hometown before leaving, and we hungout and things built up and we ended up having sex (her first time). She ended up visiting me at my internship where that continued. Ashley later told me that she *""felt she could only keep me by having sex""* which honestly wasn't true, but it was great nonetheless. Proceeded to us dating in the fall up until March of 2016 still distance because of college, and we had been discussing marriage. In February, at one point she said to me *""I want to be able to trust my husband with decisions, and I don't know if I trust you enough for that.""* I was blindsided by the comment. See, in my blue pill mindset, I was looking for a partner, an equal. And I had her on a pedestal, because I knew she was a great girl, and she made comments before about not doing that. Big mistakes. 

Now what led to me breaking up with her. Before the school year ended, we had been extremely busy with school and hadn't been able to see each other in a bit. She had made a few comments here and there about her lab TA being interested in her. By that I mean he directly told her that. I simply told her as long as she shuts it down it's fine. I had zero worries. A few weeks later Ashley asked if it was okay if she went over to his place for dinner and that one of her friends would be going so she wouldn't be alone. I told her I did not think that it was appropriate but I'm not going to tell her no. Another mistake on my part. About a month after that, she had been in lab working and, on one of my most successful nights actually, she ended up kissing him. She told me a week later after saying *”I thought I could just not tell you and keep you, but it was eating me up inside.”* At first I flipped out, then stopped responding to texts for that night and talked to some bros. Ended up breaking up with her the next day because she knew my boundaries and broke them.


*Lessons from Ashley* that should be obvious after reading the sidebar anyway


-This was the only girl I had completely trusted and NEVER expected to cheat on me, and she did. Absolutely AWALT. 

-Do not put girls on a pedestal

-You need to lead your girl


*Liz after finding TRP*


After Ashley, I found the blue pill randomly from ask reddit. Started reading it and was like “this is complete bs” and found TRP from that. Eye opening. Everything started making sense. I started lifting more, read “No More Mr Nice Guy”, and began to experiment with TRP tactics. Girl 2, who I will refer to as Liz, was my test of TRP over this past summer (2016). 

Liz is a HB6 who I met at an intern function at the beginning of the summer. I worked at a huge company and did not work anywhere near with this girl so I considered it safe from a career perspective. I was chatting everyone up at this function, getting peoples numbers, and my roommates and I were going to host a party that night for everyone. I had talked to this girl for maybe 10 minutes, not even mainly talking to her, and mentioned to my roommate that I was going to get alcohol for tonight. This girl out of nowhere said *”I can go with you”*. This let me know everything I needed to know. We went and she made a comment about how *”I didn’t need her there”*. So, things progress that night but nothing happened besides flirting due to other work people being there. Over the week we’re texting and the convo goes like this:

Her:		…Guess where I am

Me:		In my bed

Her:		You’re close… I’m at Walmart lol

Me:		I prefer my guess

Her:		I do too



And just like that, I knew she was at least interested in having sex. I invite her out to bars next weekend, Make out with her before leaving my apartment, and Liz couldn’t keep her hands off me that night. Deed was done, great time. She was a plate for a while and became a semi-dating thing for the summer. Constant shit tests, but I knew how to handle them thanks to TRP. She would leave cute notes in the morning after staying over, and clean up the place some too. Later in the summer I asked her why she wanted to sleep with me that first date. She said *”You knew what you wanted, and I could tell you were experienced.”* I would take her out on dates every so often and tell her what to where, what time to meet me, where, no details about what was happening, and she LOVED it. Directly told me she did as well.
Other notes about Liz. I could basically do whatever I wanted to her sexually. I would throw her around, make her say that pussy was mine, even had public sex. Great time. This is definitely because she saw me as Alpha, and I knew what I wanted. Don’t get me wrong, I was not perfect. Definitely still beta traits lying around. You don’t need to be perfect, but you need to be good. Also, she would tell me about her beta orbiters. One of whom I thought was a decent (although very BB), who told her he didn’t like me because I was too *“Type A.”* I thought that was interesting, especially when she added *“It’s great for me.”*

**TL;DR Lessons Learned**

- AWALT. You never have a special snowflake, although there are girls who are better than others

- Don’t put any girl on a pedestal

- Lead girls, especially in a relationship

- Talk to everyone, be social, have fun

- Be bold and know what you want

- If in a relationship, you need to throw in some beta traits (comfort) as well

52ig02,1,2016-09-12,"Just broke up with my girlfriend of 10 months, I'm not sure if I'm sad",suitaway111,confessions,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/52ig02/just_broke_up_with_my_girlfriend_of_10_months_im/,"I've been thinking about breaking up with her for a while now, and I literally just broke up with her this morning. 

We met in high school, and this is right before college starts for the both of us. 

The first two or so months of summer break was great, we were still together, messaging each other everyday, and making plans. I had a full time internship for a month, but we still saw each other as much as possible. She got a full time retail job about a week before I ended my internship.

I wanted to look for a job after my internship ended, but decided not to, because I'd only be able to work for about a month (which wasn't worth it). Instead, I took up a couple hobbies with my money (rock climbing, photography, and cars).

It was alright the first week or two of her having a job, we still messaged each other and made plans. I kept myself occupied with hobbies and friends when she was working. As time went on though, she slowly stopped messaging me until our messages just amounted to good mornings and good nights. 

She was still texting, just texting her new coworker friends. i know this because whenever we went out, she would constantly be on her phone texting her new friends. This went on for some time, and I didn't mind at first because they were new friends. But then it started to annoy me when she was checking her phone during our dates and even during a movie. I asked her to focus more on our dates, but she didn't really follow through until our last date.

I would honestly say from about two/three weeks into her job, we've been messaging less, hanging out less (from 2-3 times a week each one being a full day hang out to about 1 time a week with half a day if I'm lucky). Conversely, she began to hangout more with her coworkers after work until 2-3 am, she hung out with other friends before work as well even though whenever I asked her if we could get breakfast together she would decline saying she's too tired.

About a month in, it honestly just felt like we drifted instead of grown together. She never tells me what happened at work, instead she'd tell her friends. She never initiates our hangouts anymore, I'd always have to. I just felt like she stopped caring. I did bring these points with her, but nothing really changed.

And then just now, I brought them up again, saying that I can't continue with this neglact, and she just said I'm sorry, maybe it's best we breakup. And idk, I guess it hurt a little because I thought she'd be a little more sad about the whole thing or something. It sorta made me question how much she really valued the relationship 

Right now, i haven't really cried yet. I'm not sure if I feel sad. Maybe it's because the past month sort of eased me into not seeing her, and just generally not being in contact with her most of the day. But i guess there's still some sense of loneliness lingering in me that just hasn't hit yet or something.

I laid in bed the whole day today, except for a trip to Home Depot to buy some screws for my car. I talked to a couple of friends, but i didn't want to linger on about how the breakup went down. I just told them it was on mutual terms and ofc I'm sad about it. I proceeded to do the normal breakup social media thing and changed all my pictures. I didn't delete any pictures of us on instagram because I thought it would be immature. I unfollowed her on fb so I wouldn't see her posts (did not want to block/unfriend her, but also did not want to eventually see her with another guy). I muted her on twitter. I deleted snapchat to avoid seeing her stories.

I'm not sure what to do tomorrow. I would love to go to the gym or rock climb, but my car isn't in running condition yet and won't be for a while. I don't want to laze around all day in bed either. I'd go for a walk or something but I feel like that would just make me think about things.

I still have some of her things and she still has some of my things. Most notably, she has my 3DS that I'd very much like back, even though I don't use it very often.

All in all, I guess I just suddenly feel lonely or something. Like even though our contact was minimal, just the idea of not being with her makes me a little lonely. My best friend started school already, so he's usually busy and I can't hit him up. My other friends are similarly busy with school so we won't be hanging out til wednesday. 

I'm not sure what's really going on here. I know I was happy before I met her, so I know I can be happy withour her, but I just don't know how to get to that point. I don't know how to get to the point where I can just sit in my room and think about things other than her."

52izju,8,2016-09-13,Here goes everything...,I_am_a_throwaway_IRL,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/52izju/here_goes_everything/,"So I don't know what went wrong. I'm a 3rd year college student in the supposed ""best years of my life"" yet I sit here wallowing in self-loathing and isolation. I don't know if writing all this down is going to help, but I know damn well it's going to hurt, I'll try and lay it down from bedrock up.

The hardest part for me to rationalize is how I came to be this manically depressed sack of lethargy. I was a very intelligent high school student, athlete and had a great group of friends. I had my teenage drama, but who doesn't? I was the fat kid who felt obligated to play football as if I had to justify my excess size for some higher purpose but was never any good. Never really met any girls, but I always took it as part of the ""fat guy territory"" to basically be inept at doing anything with women. Never went on a single date, dance,  prom, nothing. I never got so much as a hug until college. This led to me being closed off to people I didn't know very well. And you know what? In high school that was all fine-and-dandy, I was at the vert least content. 

Jumping to the present unfortunately not much has changed. I played collegiate sports my first 2 years but the toll has become too much to bear on top of everything else. My grades have been slowly declining. I'm probably heavier than I ever was in high school. I've made virtually 0 progress with any women. My college is far larger then my high school was, so my timidness has blown into full fledged social anxiety. If you're even still reading this than you must be thinking ""damn this dude's life must be fucked"". One of the hardest parts for me is dealing with the fact that it's actually not. I have internships and jobs lined up, I have several leadership positions around campus and am very involved. Hell I even have good friends and am even in a social fraternity. The reason this is so hard for me is I am forced to drag myself around like a puppet to all these responsibilities and put on a mask that everything is fine. 

It's not, nothing is fine. I'm holding on by threads. 

I come back from meetings and can find myself on the floor in a crying-meltdown within minutes, only to pick myself up an hour later to get that report done by 10 or send out that email I forgot. It's not sustainable. My friends, hell now my housemates, will throw parties that I'm too embarrassed to show up to. They'll go meet some girls for lunch but I'm too scared to join them. Freshman year I'd at least go to parties and bars. I'd feel sweaty, uncomfortable and like I didn't belong but at least I'd go. Now the thought of doing anything social gets me nervous, let alone the thought of going to meet women. 

Someone tried to tell me I might have Body Dysmorphia but I find it hard to believe I'm over analyzing my flaws when aside from my face (maybe) I'm physically repulsive. I do admit it sounds harsh, but even among fat guys I'm disgusting. I think hell itself could be me shirtless in front of a group of strangers, and I mean hell for everyone, my nerves and their eyes. This for me is a main reason I have such trouble with women, I've been told that girls I know are sending me signals by friends but I can't even begin to rationalize the thought. Even if the feeling was mutual, I don't think I could even be intimate if I knew they were going to see me. People say ""but hey, lights off. won't that solve the problem?"". I find it hard to believe the darkness would hide the sweaty, fat mess that is my body from whoever I'd be with. Just the thought of intimacy with anyone seems repulsive, but not for me, for them. I really can't offer anything stimulating in that department, let alone just basic looks. 

I've had crushes where I just wish I could tell them how I've felt, but at the same time I know that if I really cared I would never want them to end up with a guy like me. I'll be casual, but far too casual to ever seem interested because I'm too much of a pussy. I'll avoid contact, never make any moves toward actually pursuing her, wish I wasn't me, then remember I am me, and that even if she wanted me I mentally don't think I could process it. I'll just wallow away in isolation wishing I had the balls, but knowing if I did how embarrassed and ashamed I'd be of being myself.  

I could keep writing for hours but it just gets too painful to spin around in thorny circles. If there is anyone reading this, it didn't help writing it out. After reading it over I see my best option as totally overhauling my body and going into workout overdrive, but between school and emotions and crying and work and all the other bullshit I see myself turning to food more than the gym. Maybe that's my problem is that I'm too helpless to help myself. All I know is that tomorrow I'm going to wake up a fat, sweaty, depressed mess and that's not going to change. Maybe I need a catalyst, I just hope it sends me in the right direction because I don't know if I could handle getting worse, I don't think I could bare with it mentally. Who knows, just like my body I'm probably just soft. "
52jahl,3,2016-09-13,How to categorize technical skills?,popanu,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/52jahl/how_to_categorize_technical_skills/,"I'm in the process of revising the **technical skills** part of my resume. I was hoping to get a little feedback so I can find a job and start contributing to society. 

&amp;nbsp;

The technical skills summary on my resume looks like this: [http://imgur.com/a/eZTqb](http://imgur.com/a/eZTqb)

&amp;nbsp;

**What I've been working on:**
&amp;nbsp;

I've been using Digital Ocean VPS for over a year now. I'm confident with using Nginx as a web server and reverse proxy, creating SSH keys, SSL/TLS, user and group management, file permissions, symbolic links, setting up the firewall, private networking, etc. I've been successful with using Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana to create a basic SIEM for monitoring failed SSH logins and monitoring the Nginx access logs for HTTP requests. I typically use Qualys SSL labs to check my sites for proper SSL/TLS configuration, and I'm learning how to implement security headers for added protection.

&amp;nbsp;

I'm now working to improve my knowledge and proficiency with using Docker. I'm comfortable writing basic web applications and building containers using preexisting images (Redis, Python, etc) and deploying them. I'm also familiar with continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD). I'm building a static site, pushing it to Github and letting the service I use compile the repository during each new commit / push. I'm making a little headway with learning Go and Rust, since several positions I've been interested in require knowledge with Go. Rust is just a bonus since it's a fun language to work with. I'm not a *great* programmer by any means, I need a lot of practice.

&amp;nbsp;

Besides all of that, I'm comfortable using Compute Engine (Google Cloud Platform), and using EC2 (AWS). While I haven't done it many times, I know the importance and how to set up firewalls, create load balances, etc. 

&amp;nbsp;

I'm an honest person, so I don't want to list anything on my resume that I'm not *extremely* competent with. I suppose I'm a bit afflicted by ""imposter syndrome"", even more so because I've never had an internship or worked in my field yet. However, the logical part of me is thinking that the only way to become confident with your skills is to work among others, learn from those with more experience, and gradually become more proficient.  

&amp;nbsp;

**My background:**
&amp;nbsp;

I'm a new graduate, about 3 months unemployed. I have a Masters and Bachelor's in Cybersecurity and Computer Science. I've applied to 50+ positions, all met with rejection (about 5-10 so far) and the rest nothing. This tells me that my resume was either filtered or difficult to read. I've since revised my resume and I'm going for round two, but this time I want to actually get invited to a phone screen and make it to in-person interviews. "
52jcn4,4,2016-09-13,Failure to launch,bzarnzy,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/52jcn4/failure_to_launch/,"I tested into one of the top high schools in the nation. I was written up in articles because of my participation in a technology program.

I went into an accelerated medicine program because I didn't know what to do with my life after high school. My mom recommended medicine, so I did it. I flunked out in the next three years. Left without a bachelor's and no more path to follow.

I transferred to a regular 4 year city college.

I found a SO who loves me. I think I love them but I also feel like I don't know anything about relationships. My high school experience was not normal, I learned. No one had time for dating in the ultra competitive environment. So I never really dated beyond this SO. No one else has ever been interested in me in this way. I was also not really interested in others before them. I feel like I'm lying sometimes.

I don't know how to make decisions for myself. Where do I go with my career? I landed an internship back in technology and it's a ""safe"" job with good benefits if I stay on this career path. I want to come to terms with the fact that it may not be what I love or am passionate about because I know no one really ever does what they're passionate about. It's just logical. Even more, I have no passions and I used to be good in school but now I have no drive. This city College isn't challenging. I get good grades without trying too hard but obviously when things get too hard I don't try hard enough.

I never slept when I was in my medicine program. I tried so hard. I thought I did everything I was supposed to. I printed out hundreds of slides and covered them with notes from lecture. I read through them night after night. I didn't eat because it was too much of an inconvenience. I lost 20 lbs. I still failed.

My parents are successful immigrants. My dad self studied with the rise of the Internet and computers to become an engineer. My mom graduated from an amazing college and is the breadwinner.

As a minority, I feel fetishized everyday when I walk out of my house. People cat call constantly. What is my worth in this world? I want to be a strong woman who can make her own way. I grew up thinking, I didn't need a man. Now I've become so weak. 

I am good at cooking and cleaning. My SO's family is so traditional. The mom is a SAHM. The dad is a cop. What if I become trapped as a housewife. Is that all I'm worth? I had so many dreams to be more in elementary school -- a doctor, an engineer, a lawyer. I had dreams to be like my mom and earning more than my SO. 

I cry almost every night, alone in my room. I have cried alone for a long time. My dad used to call me a failure in middle school. I would lay in the bathtub and cry into a towel to muffle the sobs. It was the only way no one would question what I was doing in there for so long. Sometimes, I'd eye my sister's razors and wonder how bad it would hurt if I took one apart and ended it.

Last month, I stared into my closet, crying. I was wondering if the small, braided belt in my closet would be enough. 

I know I need so much help. I've wanted help for years. I've wanted to die since I was 11. I can't ask for it because of the stigma, especially in my culture. No one really knows the extent of my depression. My mom asks why I'm tired all the time."

********* 

^14th ^July ^2021

Bangalore's recent investments in increased information technology production has opened up the opportunity for various to relocate to India, while providing opportunities for other companies to by overseas corporations. India, wanting to increase its capabilities in the sector of smartphone production, as well as computer production. Several billion dollars from the technology budget will be given to Indian corporations looking to acquire overseas assets.

###HTC

Indian telecommunications company Lava International is one of the largest in India, which partnered with Intel in order to launch an intern powered phone in India under the brand name XOLO. The Taiwanese based HTC has been seen as a phone giant in the past, however in late 2016 the company was seen to be failing, and with the ceasing of diplomatic ties with Taiwan by many nations (not including the UK and India who have recognised the nation), HTC will soon find it hard to export its products across the globe.

As such, in a move of mercy, Lava International is willing to pay $2bn to acquire HTC. HTC will be allowed to retain its operations in Taiwan, and will use India as a gateway to western markets. Lava International will be responsible for opening HTC factories and production lines within India, in cooperation with their other phone brand, XOLO.

###Acer

Acer is another Taiwanese based computer company which may suffer from the lack of recognition as a nation, and continuous belligerence from the Chinese rebels. The Indian government would like to personally purchase Acer for $5bn. 

###BlackBerry Limited

Canadian based BlackBerry Limited has fallen behind in terms of smartphone production, and in recent years its technology has become outdated compared to its competitors. Losing money fast, the company is seen as a failure. However, Intex Technologies sees a way to improve blackberry sales and help Canadian's get more jobs. Intex would like to purchase Blackberry Limited and its subsidiaries for a handsome price of $2.2bn, and would like to propose that Intex invests in creating more BlackBerry R&amp;D and management jobs within Canada, while using Indian factories to produce blackberry phones, new and old.

###Motorola Mobility

Motorola is another mobile phone company which seems to be failing, it was purchased by Google and then sold to Chinese company Lenovo for approximately $2.91bn.

Here’s a no-BS guide if you want to do the same (which requires REAL WORK).,gresquare,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/52juca/i_started_a_consulting_business_my_first_company/,"I haven’t written a blog post in more than a year. It’s been a busy year.

In one year, I went from a one-man show with €0 in revenue to a great team of 3 with €84k in revenue.

I have a newfound respect for you entrepreneurs. The people who have been doing this for years or decades.

A confession: Writing scares the shit out of me. I’m not afraid to speak in public (I love it). But writing does. It’s time to conquer this fear.

I wanted to write a letter to people who are in the same situation that I was in just before I left my job. I was miserable. I always wanted to do my own thing. Even my mom was saying that I should do something on my own. That I wasn’t made to receive orders.

[I’ve posted my progress here a year ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/3dqfok/ive_started_my_own_business_as_a_marketing/). I used the questions you guys asked then to create this post.

This letter is for people who are struggling to get started. Who have this itch about doing their own thing. It’s also a letter for me. To realise how much I’ve done and what I’ve become.

It makes me sad to see all those startup events or free entrepreneur meetups. I don’t know about where you are, but in Dublin you’ll see always the same people. They never seem to make any progress.

It’s fake work.

This letter is for you. The wantrepreneur. The guy who always thinks and never does.

#First, here’s some context

Born in 1988. Great childhood.

**2003:**

I went to a good high school in Clermont-Ferrand, France.

**2006:**

I studied hard the last year to go to a school of engineering in France (so I could build wind turbines). But I didn’t get in.
I went to another school of engineering in 2006 to 2009.

**2008:**

Went to Kansas for a year as part of an exchange program. I saw another side of the World. I realised how lucky I was.

**2009:**

I was lost. I decided that marketing and business was much more interesting to me than mechanical engineering and found a business school that would take me.
I did a Bachelor Degree back in my hometown for a year.

**2010:**

I had to find an internship abroad. With the little bit of experience in mechanical engineering and my good english, I landed in Dublin.
As an intern, I was a prick. I was still very unsure about my future and myself.
I didn’t want to go back to France so I pushed hard to be hired. I found a weakness in the way the company was reporting data. I proposed to my boss to take care of it. He agreed.

**2011:**

I got a contract job in Dublin on something I barely understood. They gave me some budget and I managed to get a solution off the ground.
I thought hard about my future one weekend, and somehow I connected the dots. I always have been fascinated by the internet. I always had a computer in my room. The sound of my first 56k modem was a delight to my ears.

Marketing was also something I liked. But not the bullshit marketing. Not the shitty ads. What I really liked was trying to understand people. The psychology. How do people think? Why do they behave this way?
So I started a blog about entrepreneurship and marketing (in French). I spent my evenings (and days) on Twitter, connecting with people and I wrote a few blog posts. They were mostly research from reading books. They weren’t really me.

**2012:**

I managed to land a permanent full-time job with the same company. I replaced my boss who was leaving. For the first time in my life, I had a very decent salary (around €28,000 a year). I also had a company car.

It’s an important year. This is when I met Jen. She changed my life. She really did. She put me back in touch with my family. I got closer to my siblings and parents thanks to her. And it gave me confidence. Confidence that I could do whatever the fuck I wanted.
I earned a Professional Diploma in Digital Marketing.

**2013:**

I found a job in the industry I wanted - a job with a mobile marketing company. I put everything I had in this business for almost 2 years. I learned so much about marketing and sales. I was involved in everything. The problem was: I learned by myself.
The product we were selling wasn’t good and customers didn’t want to pay for it. I was involved in business development at the end and I thought I was a bad salesperson. Turned out I wasn’t. The product just wasn’t good enough.

I also started to attend a few Startup Weekends. At the time I didn’t know much about the startup scene. Going to those events made me realise that it wasn’t that difficult to launch something. I just had to stop finding excuses.
I started a few side projects here and there but none of them were truly interesting to me. I just gave up very quickly.

**2014:**

I started to work on yet another project in December 2014, while I was still working full-time. I got the idea at a conference I was attending.
I started to blog about it. I was planning to help eCommerce retailers to retain their customers with smart emails.

**2015:**

The idea wasn’t better than the previous ones. But this time I decided to go for it and stop finding excuses. I had €20,000 in savings and just said “fuck it”. I left my job.

I felt it was the only way for me to actually do it. To be in front of a cliff and jump. I had to build a plane on the way down. Going back to work for something I didn’t believe in wasn’t an option.
The idea moved from a product to consulting. I didn’t want to raise money and I had to make money. I even got some financial help from the state for a few weeks to avoid making a big dent in my savings.

**Today:**

[We are a team of three, working remotely](slicesconsulting.com). Serina is based in Seattle. Marco is based in Barcelona. I’m based in Dublin.
We help companies make their website better so they can sell more.

##I’m lucky

I’m white, straight, living in Europe. I’ve never experienced discrimination. I’ve never experienced poverty. I’m well educated. I have a fiancée. Siblings I love more than anything. Parents who love me. Good friends.

I know that some of you have a way tougher life than me. Use it at your advantage. What you’re going through will probably help you to be tougher than most.

#Let's start

[Here's my desk \(in my living-room\) when I started.](https://slicesconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Desk.001-1024x576.jpeg)

This is what I would have liked to read before I got started. This is a letter to you if you always wanted to create a business but never did. Or if you feel like the business is going nowhere.

There are no hacks and no easy way to achieve this, so if you’re looking for a quick way to make money without working for it this guide is not for you.

##Your vision board

Before starting anything you need to know why you’re doing it. Why exactly do you want to have a business? To do it because it’s trendy? To follow your inspiration? To be able to be “your own boss”? Dig deeper.

“Why?” is the most important question. It took me a while to realise what was my “Why?”. I had to dig deeper than “having enough money to live”.

I’m lucky to have a lot of siblings that I love very much (my parents got remarried). I’m based in Ireland and they are in France. My first objective was to be able to visit them as many times as I wanted, without being wary of money or time off work.

My second objective was to live a happy life with my soon-to-be wife. To be able to take time off when I wanted to and travelling. To be able to afford a nice house, and a nice car.

In one word: Freedom. I wanted my freedom back.

##What are you fighting for or against?

Your vision for yourself is slightly different from the fight you should pick up.

Many people start with a business model or an idea. I believe that you should start with a fight.

Whatever your industry and what you want to do, what are you fighting against? What pisses you off the most? What do you want to change?

I’ve never liked bullshit. I’m a straight-forward person. I’ve been involved in marketing for while, and its bullshit always pissed me off.

A few examples:

* Internet is polluted with popups, clickbait articles (“You won’t believe what happened next!”), or spammy, irrelevant, content.
* Some companies lie and manipulate people to make money. Think about [Enron](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1016268/) or, at a smaller scale, all of those brands with lock-in contracts, fine print, etc…
* Most businesses focus on short-term gains rather than making an impact. Shareholder capitalism isn’t working, let’s face it. [“The harder a CEO is pushed to increase shareholder value, the more the CEO will be tempted to make moves that actually hurt the shareholders.”](https://hbr.org/2010/01/the-age-of-customer-capitalism)
* What’s your fight?

##How much do you have in the bank?

Do you have enough money to run for 6 months without any revenue? This is the question you need to ask yourself.

I burnt through €10,000 in 6 months without overspending at all. Just surviving with rent, food, and some entertainment. If you don’t have any savings, keep your job and put some money aside.

If you’re lucky enough to be able to come back to your parents’ house, do it.

Work during evenings and weekends but don’t quit your job.

##Where are you going to work from?

I worked from my living room for a few months. I was on my own for most of the day.

If you have the luxury to be able to work from home, do it. Do it until you get your first paying customers.

Working from home got to me sometimes. It is tough not to have many human interactions. Even being surrounded by people you don’t know feels better than being alone.

I was able to move to a co-working space after a few months. My productivity went up.

##Support system

Who can you talk to when you’ll feel down? Yes, you will like shit some days. You need to be able to talk to someone.

My dad, my siblings and my fiancée have always been very supportive. I know that I wouldn’t have been able to do it without them.

Mental health is really important if you want to make money. It won’t happen overnight. You need to rely on other people.

You might feel isolated even with a support system. It is difficult for people to know what you’re going through if they’re not going through it themselves.

##Customer development

You just can’t come with a good idea if you don’t talk to people. Talk to people.

People won’t steal your ideas. They don’t care. They have other stuff to do.

I’ve used the book [The Four Steps to the Epiphany](https://www.amazon.com/Four-Steps-Epiphany-Steve-Blank/dp/0989200507/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1473426213&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=four+steps+to+the+epiphany) (by Steve Blank) a lot and you should, too.

Other good books I recommend :

* [The Entrepreneur’s Guide to Customer Development](https://www.amazon.com/Entrepreneurs-Guide-Customer-Development-Epiphany/dp/0982743602) (by Brant Cooper).
* [The Lean Startup](https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous-Innovation/dp/0307887898/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1473426190&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=lean+startup) (by Eric Ries).
Problem(s) you’re solving

Don’t focus on what you do. Focus on the problems you’re solving. Look for the struggle. What prevent people from doing what they would like to do?

Let’s say your original idea is to launch a cake shop. What are the potential problems for your potential customers?

They need to get a cake for a special occasion, but:

* they don’t have time to make it,
* they don’t know how to bake.
Validate that with people. Ask them about their problems. Make them talk.

##Solution you’re providing

Once you’ve identified problems, you can look for a solution. Don’t think in term of services or features. You’ll start to copy what’s around instead of coming up with your own stuffs.

Isolate each problem and focus on its solution.

* Problem 1: They don’t have time to bake one.
* Solution: A shop where they can buy cakes right now, without having to wait.

And:

* Problem 2: They don’t know how to bake.
* Solution: A shop where they can buy cakes without having to bake.
* Another solution: A series of courses where people could learn how to bake themselves.

#Understand if your problem is painful enough

Your job is then to understand if the problem you’re solving is painful enough. If your problem is not painful, people won’t look for a solution. They won’t pay for it either.

If your problem is painful enough but your solution is bad, they won’t pay for it either.

Here’s how I went about it:

##List all the people you know

Create a new Google Spreadsheet and start typing the names of all the people you know:

[Your contact list could look like this.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18WWsMzzkSC5y4XC2wzijsMq7EZhXgUMZR-EODS7QRLY/edit)

Don’t list only the people that you know related to what you’re planning to do.

List everyone. Your uncle who lives on the other side of the World, your friends from high school, everybody.

Make sure to look at your email contacts, social network contacts, “real life” connections, so you don’t forget anyone.

Add a way to get in touch with each of them: their email, their phone number, their postal address, etc…

[Here’s an example on Google Sheets that you can view and copy.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18WWsMzzkSC5y4XC2wzijsMq7EZhXgUMZR-EODS7QRLY/edit)

##Contact them one by one

Then contact them one by one.

In three sentences, tell them about:

* Who you are
* How you’ve met
* What you’re planning to do

Then ask them for one favour: an introduction.

You should ask them to introduce you to people you want to talk to: potential customers.

You want to learn from them. About their day-to-day, their problems, the current solutions they’re using, etc…

Make it clear that you’re not trying to sell anything. Think about yourself as a researcher, not a sales person. You want to learn.

##Follow-up like a mofo

People don’t care about you. Even your own uncle doesn’t care. They have other things to do. You can’t blame them for that.

That’s why you need to follow-up. If you don’t get an answer after the first contact, get in touch again.

Once every week should be enough.

You wouldn’t believe the number of times I had to contact people before I got an answer. Don’t give up.

Add a few columns on the right of your contacts. Every time you get in touch with someone, enter the date.

##People don’t care about you

Did I say you should follow-up?

If it was easy, everybody would do it. Most people give up after one try. Don’t be like this. Keep going until you hear something back.

Vary the ways you get in touch with them: two emails, one call, one tweet, one message on LinkedIn, two emails…

##Questions

Your objective is to learn. To validate what you thought was a good idea. Your initial idea will change, I can guarantee it. Don’t fall in love with it. Fall in love with the problem(s) you’re solving.

When talking to people, ask the right questions. [This post](http://mfishbein.com/the-ultimate-list-of-customer-development-questions/) from [Mick Fishbein](http://mfishbein.com/) is a goldmine.

If you’re on your own, record the conversation. Take notes. You will forget key insights after a few minutes if you don’t.

I used Google Docs to record my notes in the past. You can use Evernote, pen and paper, whatever you want.

Just make the calls. Send those emails.

Do it.

#Refine

After talking to a few people you WILL learn a lot. Chances are, the solution you were thinking about has already changed.

That’s good.

Don’t try to convince people that your idea is the best one. Just listen.

Refine your business model.

Update your problems and solutions.

##Niche

Ah, finding your niche. How many times have I read this about Internet marketing? Too many to count.

Don’t be stressed about it. You don’t have to find a niche right now. Just talk to people. Refine your idea.

It took me months to find “a niche”, and even know I feel that we’re still tackling too many problems at once.

I’ve started trying to sell a solution for eCommerce to retain their customers. By talking to my first people I ended up focusing on conversion (making website visitors do what I wanted them to do) rather than retention (making them come back). I switched from a product to consulting.

I can’t tell you what will happen to you. What I can tell you though is to look for patterns. Follow your guts and say no.

There are three good ways to start:

* Focus on one industry, solve many problems with many services. For example, marketing consulting for the pharmaceutical industry.
* Focus on many industries, solve one problem with one solution. For example, Trello. It’s a tool that help you get organised. Whatever you do, whoever you are.
* Focus one industry, solve one problem with one solution. For example, [Winterhalter](http://www.winterhalter.biz/), selling dishwashers for hotels and restaurants. Inspired by [this post](https://nothingventured.rocks/lessons-on-the-art-of-specialisation-from-the-dishwasher-market-67384f6693ba#.6hdpclp1p) from my friend [Connor Keppel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/connorkeppel).

#First clients

Many people talk about starting a startup. They think that creating a startup means creating a product in 6 months with money that isn’t yours, sell that a year later for $100M, and get rich.

If it’s your first business, take it slow. Fall in love with the problems you’re solving. Start with a very simple solution.

A solution that doesn’t require €100,000 in investment to get off the ground. A solution that you can tweak and change as you please. A solution that you can start from your home, with a laptop and a lot of grit.

I believe that freelancing or consulting is the easiest way to go about making money.

You will be able to learn from your clients, change your offerings very fast, pay yourself, and build the foundation to create products in the future.

I started by trying to talk to eCommerce companies only. I then moved to any businesses selling products or services online.

My very first client was somebody I already knew (I was lecturing a bit at his college). He was paying me €500 a month.

The second client was a referral from somebody I knew. I worked as a consultant with them for 3 months to bridge the gap between their digital agency and their team. They were paying me around €2,000 a month.

The third client came from a referral from my accountant. They were paying me €1,200 a month.

Do you start to see a trend?

My first clients came from my network. From more than 300 people I contacted, people started to refer me.

We got 23 interesting leads in one year and closed more than half of them. Services varied from a 30-minute training session to large retainers.

Here’s the breakdown:

* 9 leads came from speaking at events.
* 8 came from referrals.
* 4 from cold emails.
* 2 from networking events.

As you can see, the vast majority of clients came from speaking (more on that later) and referrals.

##Bull’s eye

Many founders try to do everything at once. You HAVE to focus on one or two channels to get your first clients.

There are 19 in total. I refer to the book Traction for that (by Gabriel Weinberg, CEO of DuckDuckGo, and Justin Mares)

As a solopreneur, you simply can’t focus on more than two. I would advise you to focus on contacting your network and get referred.

Don’t waste money and time on Facebook Ads or SEO when you’re starting. Sell directly. Talk to people.

Yes, it’s not easy. Some people will say no. Some people won’t have time to talk to you. But you have to do what others don’t want to do.

I also managed to get clients from speaking, at a later stage. I spoke at a few events in my last full-time job and I liked it. I actually paid to speak at a big marketing event in Dublin (that deserves its own article). [Here's me speaking at my first ""big"" event last year. Notice the beautiful pink shirt](https://slicesconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/8dd04a558c7d8b52a7328bd0466c734a-768x1024.jpg)...

##Routine

Set up a routine. This is so important.

I wake up every week day at 6.45am, go to work at 8am, and leave at around 5pm most days. I cycle to work. I eat a healthy breakfast (2 eggs, porridge, fruits).

This is a marathon, not a sprint. You will be full of energy at the start. Don’t burn it. Eat well, sleep well.

I remember reading this advice before I started. I found it to be over the top. It isn’t. Your brain is your most important asset. If you feel tired, you won’t be productive. If you’re not productive, your morale will be low. If your morale is low, you won’t achieve much.

Are you ready to keep up this routine for years? I’ve been doing this for more than a year. Every week day.

Some entrepreneurs have been doing this for decades. This is what it takes.

Reflect about your business every month. Think about its strategy. Read the book [Good Strategy / Bad Strategy](https://www.amazon.com/Good-Strategy-Bad-Difference-Matters/dp/0307886239) by Richard Rumelt. Here’s a free [video version of the book](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZrTl16hZdk). I also used the [SOSTAC Framework](http://prsmith.org/sostac/) for that.

Write a weekly todo list and a daily todo list.

##Say no

That’s also something I used to hear a lot. You have to say no more often than yes.

Focus on the problem you’re solving and the battle you’re fighting. Those two things shouldn’t change much.

However, be flexible when it comes to the solution you’re offering.

If you help companies to get more traffic to their site, don’t start offering web design services. Focus on one problem at a time.

Don’t be afraid to say no.

#Evolving

By then, you should have one or two paying clients. They will most likely friends of friends. This is great. They trust you because they know you.

Others won’t trust you just yet. Once you’re making a bit of money, you can start focusing on your business.

Those actions are from the book [Get Clients Now](http://getclientsnow.com/) that I found quite helpful at the start.

It makes you focus on what’s important.

##Description of services

This is what you do and how you do it. You should have a clearer idea of the services you offer once you’ve started working with a few clients.

##Website

Some of your clients might start referring you to others. This is when you can invest in a simple website. It won’t be perfect, don’t spend too much time on this.

Buy a domain name. Build the website using Wordpress.com, Squarespace, or Wordpress.org if you’re comfortable with it.

##Brand name

We haven’t talked about your brand name yet. It’s because it doesn’t matter.

If you’re planning to be a solopreneur, your own name would do just fine. If you’re planning to create a company and hire people, think about a name.

I came up with Slices in less than an hour. I took the idea of “slicing and dicing data”, looked at domains available, and picked one. It’s not perfect but nobody ever told me that they didn’t want to work with us because of our name.

You can always change name as you grow. Most of the time, spending weeks on picking the perfect name is just fake work.

It’s an excuse to avoid doing real work (making money).

[This article](http://joel.is/how-to-name-your-startup/) from [Joel Cascoigne](http://joel.is/), co-founder of Buffer, is great.

#Closing

Closing clients is tough. I always have this adrenaline rush just before I send a proposal.

Learn not to be afraid of it.

##Personalised proposal

We use a specific template for our proposals. They are not the prettiest but they are simple to understand. They are also focused on the client, not on us.

I recommend you to read [those posts](https://doubleyourfreelancing.com/category/proposals/) from [Brennan Dunn](https://doubleyourfreelancing.com/about/) about writing proposals.

We’ve tweaked it a bit, but the idea remains the same:

###Situation

In this part you should answer the following questions: Who’s the client? What problems and challenges are they facing?

###Tomorrow

What does your client want to achieve by using your services? Does she want to increase sales by 20%? Get more visitors on their site?

The more specific the better. Before sending a proposal, make sure that you know this information.

Make them talk.

###How to get there

This is where you present your solution as way to solve their challenges and reach their objectives.

You can get more specific about exactly what you’re offering.

###Investment

How much is it going to cost? Always a burning question. This is where you can answer it.

##Pricing

Compare your cost with the the benefits you’re providing: time savings, revenue growth, etc…

We price our services monthly or sometimes weekly. We never talk about the number of hours we’re planning to spend on a project. This shouldn’t be relevant to a client if you provide value.

Always quote more than what you’re comfortable with. €5,000 might seem like a lot to you. It might seem very little for your client.

Don’t be afraid to negotiate. This is the good part. It means that your prospect is interested.

Don’t bend under pressure. Keep focusing on value.

##Competition

If you’re able to extract the value you’re providing for clients, you’ve almost made it.

This is why competition becomes irrelevant at this point. It’s not about being the cheapest. It’s about delivering value.

Don’t be obsessed with your competition. It’s a good thing. Get interested only if you lose many proposals from the same competitor.

#Growing

At this stage you should have a few customers. You might barely break even. But who cares? You’re not under pressure to give money back to investors.

I’m planning to write more about the next part of our journey: how we grow, how we hire, how we organise ourselves, etc…

A few things to remember when you’re at this stage:

##Brain

Take care of your brain: exercise, eat well, talk to your friends, go see your family, spend time with your partner.

##Stay lean

Who cares if you don’t have an office or business cards? Be yourself, don’t follow conventions.

##Cashflow

Cashflow is king. At the start what matters is the amount of money you have available in your account. Don’t worry too much about making profits. You can tweak that later.

Track this daily.

##Fire yourself

Hire people smarter than you and fire yourself from each position. This is the key if you want to grow.

I recommend you to read [The E-Myth Revisited](https://www.amazon.com/Myth-Revisited-Small-Businesses-About/dp/0887307280) by [Michael Gerber](https://www.google.ie/search?q=Michael+E.+Gerber&amp;oq=Michael+E.+Gerber&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i61&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8).

*Damn. It feels good to finally finish and publish an article.*

#TL;DR

* I went from €0 to €84k by contacting my network and speaking at events. There was no silver bullet. It was painful (and it still is).
* I had €20k in savings and burnt half of it in a few months. I didn't take any loan and own 100% of the company.
* I believe that consulting is the best way to start as a first-time entrepreneur. Build products later.
* Work hard, don’t give up, focus on a few things.
* Pick a vision and a fight.
* Talk to people. Follow-up like a modafucka.
* Avoid fake work.
* Sell value.

#What to do next

* Ask me any questions here or via DM. I'll take the time to reply!
* Get in touch on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/LouisSlices) or [Linkedin](https://ie.linkedin.com/in/louisgrenier), I don't bite!

52jx8t,18,2016-09-13,When are you no longer entry level?,rofl_falafel,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/52jx8t/when_are_you_no_longer_entry_level/,"Obviously title, but I will be more specific in regard to my particular situation.

I didn't really follow the normal life script.  I dropped out of high school at 16 and did a crappy typesetting job for a print shop (think pagemaker and illustrator).  Then I started working for an ISP around 18.  The job was initially just basic internet phone support type stuff, connectivity, email, etc.  Over the course of the job I became a kind of RF guru for this particular brand of radio we used, wrote the training manuals for the in house people on this gear, etc.  That slowly morphed into a kind of junior admin position where I'd fix stuff on AP's (hardware, configuration, rat's nests of wiring jobs).  All of the responsibilities and none of the titles!  Getting tired of being a peon, maybe I should go to college?  Start taking dick around classes at local CC...

Get let go from ISP as part of buyout after 4.5 years there -&gt; maybe I'll take this college thing seriously.  I don't want to be asking people to reboot PoE's for the rest of my life.  Most of the jobs I envision myself doing all require a degree, so ok, college.  Everyone says CS has the most broad appeal, so lets give that a try...  -&gt;  WHY MATH, WHY!?

After a few semesters of not sucking at college + job at ISP ending, parents agree to pay for education if I do general IT for my dad's company (just him really, contractor).  He is in engineering, but TOTALLY unrelated to technology or anything that I do really, I just make shit work when he needs it to.  Don't do any internships (BIG MISTAKE) but couldn't really get any callbacks when I did desperately apply my last year either (software, not IT).

Now graduated BS CS, minor in stats; magna + AS from CC + some certificate that I got from CC for taking CCNA 1-4 but never took the Cisco cert test.  Oh and I did some windows admin stuff as an elective my last year.  70-410 of MCSA I think?  We did stuff like setting up server roles, domain controllers, active directory, intro to powershell, stuff like that.

Since I've graduated I've been working with a lab on campus to facilitate the way they analyze some data.  In a nutshell, I built the hardware and software for them to perform analyses on the web instead of from a command line.  And I mean built like, I built the machine it is running on, I set up the OS (Fedora), configuration, dydns for temp domain name, I installed all the associated tools and libraries, I did a significant portion of the software (writing code, html, etc.) as well as day-to-day admin of the box itself, user accounts, ftp access for faculty, etc.

So here is my problem: I think I hate software development.  At least, I hate the software interview.  Yes I have implemented BST's and red-black trees.  No, I don't remember how to implement them off the top of my head to solve some pointless exercise on a whiteboard so you can tell me how easy it is and how someone with my GPA shouldn't have this much trouble (thanks generic big software house).  If I needed a complex data structure or algo, I'd google that shit and call a library.  Don't reinvent the wheel, etc.

So needless to say, I have been failing miserably at software interviews despite my attempts to do better.  People seem flabbergasted this is an issue for me, as my GPA was north of 3.5.  I've done the CScareerquestions things, CTCI, leetcode, all that crap.  I just don't solve these DS/algo problems in 60 minutes, and it's not gonna happen, ever.  It takes me days of thinking, analyzing, reading, playing with code, etc.

So I've been thinking about not doing software and going back to my IT like beginnings.  I look at IT jobs and I wonder what the hell I am actually qualified to do.  I don't even know what I want to do either.  DevOps type stuff or networking are my strengths I'd guess, I don't even know where to start.  I just know that I don't want to be answering phones all day again or doing software interviews.  Please help.

Well that was long and rambling.  Please ask questions or yell at me or whatever it is you guys and gals do in these parts.  Thanks for reading.


**tl;dr**

A CS degree does not a software developer make.  Am I qualified to do something like Network Engineering or SysAdmin, DevOps, etc. with the experience I have?  Or is it back to square one and entry level if I go back to IT type roles?  "
52k15p,5,2016-09-13,When treating mental illness pays off.,minumoto,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/52k15p/when_treating_mental_illness_pays_off/,"I started effexor around 2 months ago. The doctor just upped my dose about a week ago, and I think I'm noticing a change.

I have to get up at 4am every morning for work, and that has been less awful, even enjoyable when I'm walking around outside.

I can feel my anxiety about my internship (it's only been a few days) but I can manage it, instead of wanting to vomit. 

I feel generally good about things. Yeah, there is a lot of shit going on and a lot of stuff to deal with, but I feel like I can take it all on.

I do feel a bit twitchy, and like I want to stretch out of my skin, but that should go away. As long as I keep moving it's not so bad.

This is mostly to remind myself that I can feel good about the day. It feels like it's been so long since I've felt like this, I don't want to forget it."
52k6b0,3,2016-09-13,Does my mother have BPD?,tottottt,raisedbyborderlines,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbyborderlines/comments/52k6b0/does_my_mother_have_bpd/,"First off, the obligatory kitties: http://wallpapersafari.com/kitten-pictures-for-wallpaper/

I've often wondered if my mother has BPD. But I guess mostly I need to share and hear from people with similar stories. 

My mother had me explicitly ""to have someone who'd always love her."" She violated multiple boundaries ""for my own good"" and always expected gratitude in return. The worst one was probably when she tricked me into having an expensive medical procedure we couldn't afford (she said we were just going for a checkup to the eye doctor and waited until they put atropine into my eyes and I couldn't see and then had me undergo a laser procedure on my retina). 

When I was a child she regularly got into screaming rages unexpectedly followed by silent treatment. She brought me to clothing stores and wanted me to get the most expensive thing and then screamed at me if I didn't want to buy anything (not because I didn't like anything but because I'd heard so many times we didn't have any money I didn't want to spend it unless absolutely necessary). 

My first memory is her screaming at me at home after a walk where her friend's daughter called me ""sick"" because I wouldn't talk to anyone. I literally had no idea until she started screaming that anything was wrong and never even registered that comment. I guess I was in my own world a lot and acted a bit like I had autism. This unexpectedness was the worst. Since then I have a habit of looking back at every social situation I go through and overanalyzing it in case I did something wrong.

When I was 16 I didn't know how to say no and started dating someone I actively disliked. I told my mother and she begged me not to break up with him because ""it's so hard to find people who'll love you."" 

When I was a student she got me a short internship in the company she worked for (for which I asked and was grateful) and then proceeded to ask my boss to hire me on the second day of it because she couldn't trust me to ask for it myself. I was hired eventually because I was good but my mother always took credit for it. Five years later when I was leaving the job she actually wanted to buy an expensive gift for my boss to thank her for keeping me in her department for so long. When I told her it was inappropriate because she didn't really have any sort of relationship with my boss she blew up.

When I moved out, she claimed I abandoned her and that I had become ""the head of the family."" She kept telling me she just didn't like me spending **my** money on rent when I could live rent-free with them and that she couldn't bear me living in such ""horrible"" conditions even after I repeatedly told her that this was what I knew was better for me. She later actually told me that it wouldn't be bad if I lost my job since I would then move back in with them. When I said no, she exploded into a tantrum.

And of course she always said, well, at least I fed and clothed you and put you through school. Or, you only remember bad things. Or, just wait until you have your own children, you'll see. (When I told her I don't want to have any, she told me confidently I'd change my mind). Or, I didn't say anything hurtful, you are just hurt because you're crazy. Or, did you really think that that thing I told you was totally fine with me was actually fine?! I'm just suffering for you you ungrateful b."

These are all open for discussion and I have photos of how I would like your character to appear as. 

1) Aunt/Nephew - Ever since I went through puberty I've occasionally masterbated about my Aunt and her giant tits. One summer I get to stay over for a month while I intern at my new college job. What we both don't know is our mutual desire for each other. We both take secret peeks at each other in our moments of undress during the morning and night and I could've sworn I saw your reflection in the mirror when I was showering.

2) Wife's Cousin - My wife and I have no sex life at all which makes me look for hook ups at night using Tinder. One night I come across my wife's cousin's profile and against my better judgement I swipe right but to my surprise it tells me we are a match. That's where we can start from there with a simple message in the app which will lead to us meeting.

3) Cousins - We have always been close growing up and being close in age. I've always pleasured myself to you and your giant tits and loved the summer time when the clothing would be less and less showing off your ample chest. This prompt we are at a family reunion away from our hometown and we are up late drinking and smoking pot, getting our inhibitions lower and lower. We discuss our sexual history and get each other all hot before we decide to let our taboo desires become reality.

4) Older Neighbor - You've recently moved into the neighborhood after your divorce. I just finished my first semester at college and live in my parents basement during the summer. You have a direct view into our backyard and have taken a hobby of watching me work out in the early morning hours. Occasionally you ask me to help carry in groceries for you and today you ask if I could finish some yard work your landscapers forgot to finish....


Kinks include: incest, age play, oral, anal, rimming (giving &amp; recieving) dirty kissing, spanking, dirty rough sex, lactation

Limits are toilet stuff, rape, any violence and animal stuff. 


Hope someone out there finds these interesting enough to send a message. This will always be open no matter how old the post is."

I've decided to retool some things, and I hope you enjoy!)*

Hi there, and welcome to DPP Casino! I'm your host, BreakFromReality, and I'll be accompanying you in your journey to find a fun, erotic roleplay.

Please check your ID with the security guard -- all potential RP partners and their characters MUST be at least 18.

So now that you're here, how do you get started?

First, you'll sit down at our [single-deck blackjack table](https://www.random.org/playing-cards/), where you'll be deciding the kinks of the RP. You'll be dealt eight starting hands of blackjack, with each total matching up with a specific kink. (For example, a 20 is for cheating.)

Here's the full list of kinks:

* 4 -- Dealer's Choice
* 5 -- Light Bondage
* 6 -- Group Sex (MFMF, MFMFMF)
* 7 -- MFM Threesome
* 8 -- FFM Threesome
* 9 -- Interracial/Raceplay
* 10 -- Anal (Woman Receiving)
* 11 -- Filmed
* 12 -- Clothed Sex
* 13 -- Dirty Talk/Name-Calling
* 14 -- Rough Sex (Hair-Pulling, Spanking, Light Choking, etc.)
* 15 -- Public Sex
* 16 -- Creampie/Risk of Impregnation
* 17 -- Facial
* 18 -- Risk of Getting Caught (i.e. ""hold the moan"")
* 19 -- Uniform/Costume
* 20 -- Cheating
* 21 -- Player's Choice

Once eight unique hands are drawn, you will choose two kinks that you would like to include in the RP. You will also eliminate two other kinks that you would not like to include. The dealer will then choose two kinks of the remaining four.

The Dealer's Choice and Player's Choice can not be excluded.

*(To play: draw 2 cards from 1 shuffled deck. Make sure all cards except jokers are included. Repeat this eight times until complete.)*

Once the kinks are decided, you'll decide if you want to stay on the main casino floor or head over to The Den. *(While I will absolutely play with everyone, those choosing to go to The Den will get VIP status.)*

If you choose the main floor, you will head to our [roulette wheel](https://www.random.org/sequences/), where you'll help decide the character you'll be playing. The women listed on the wheel will be character models only (with one exception).

The list is as follows:

* 0 -- Player's Choice of Anyone on the List
* 1 -- You, because you're always #1 at DPP Casino!
* 2 -- Bella Thorne
* 3 -- Dove Cameron
* 4 -- Laurel Coppock
* 5 -- Alison Brie
* 6 -- Kendall Jenner
* 7 -- Candice Patton
* 8 -- Margot Robbie
* 9 -- Vanessa Hudgens
* 10 -- Scarlett Johansson
* 11 -- Taylor Swift
* 12 -- Miley Cyrus
* 13 -- Ariana Grande
* 14 -- Emma Stone
* 15 -- Milana Vayntrub
* 16 -- Nina Dobrev
* 17 -- Rihanna
* 18 -- Sarah Hyland
* 19 -- Lily Aldridge
* 20 -- Mila Kunis
* 21 -- Stella Maxwell
* 22 -- Dianna Agron
* 23 -- Chloe Grace Moretz
* 24 -- Katherine McNamara
* 25 -- Victoria Justice
* 26 -- Carrie Underwood
* 27 -- Jennifer Lawrence
* 28 -- Selena Gomez
* 29 -- Emilia Clarke
* 30 -- Emily Ratajkowski
* 31 -- Meghan Markle
* 32 -- Jourdan Dunn
* 33 -- Katy Perry
* 34 -- AnnaSophia Robb
* 35 -- Nicole Beharie
* 36 -- Ariel Winter

You will spin the wheel six times (12 for two-female scenes and 18 for three-female scenes). You will then pick three characters (six for two-female scenes and nine for three-female scenes). The dealer will then choose the character he would like you to play (the Player's Choice may get excluded).

*(To play: Set the smallest value at 0 and the largest value at 36, and keep it in one column. Take the first 6/12/18 numbers in the list.)*

Finally, it's time to ""role"" the dice at the [craps table](https://www.random.org/dice/) and see just what you'll be playing. The roles are below:

* 2 -- Role Not on List
* 3 -- Coach's Daughter
* 4 -- Friend's Wife/Girlfriend
* 5 -- Student
* 6 -- Sister's/Daughter's Friend
* 7 -- Incest (Daughter, Sister, Cousin)
* 8 -- Friend's Sister/Daughter
* 9 -- Work Scenario (Secretary, Intern, Co-Worker, etc.)
* 10 -- Wife's/Girlfriend's Friend
* 11 -- Celebrity
* 12 -- Bully's/Bullying Victim's Sister

*(If Celebrity is chosen, you will be playing the actual celebrity from the wheel instead of a lookalike. For 12, I am giving the option of playing either the bullying victim's sister or an interesting revenge plot with the bully's sister.)*

You will roll the dice four times. Of the four unique roles, you will then discard one. The dealer will discard one of the remaining three, and you will then choose one (or both, if possible) of the remaining two.

*(To play: simply roll two virtual dice. Repeat until four different roles are picked.)*

After that is done, we will have the RP with the characters, roles and kinks!

Now if you choose The Den?

Here's the list of characters for the roulette wheel:

* 0 -- Player's Choice of Anyone on the List
* 1 -- You, as a woman age 40+ (if you're not one already)
* 2 -- Rena Sofer
* 3 -- Nigella Lawson
* 4 -- Christie Brinkley
* 5 -- Eva Longoria

52keuy,75,2016-09-13,Blow by Blow Justice VIII,schoolgirlerror,Schoolgirlerror,https://www.reddit.com/r/Schoolgirlerror/comments/52keuy/blow_by_blow_justice_viii/,"The bar was gritty and dark, filled with off duty detectives nursing hangover cures like their first born child. Gabriella, back in her suit dress, lifted herself onto the barstool and placed her elbows on the counter. Blue bruises had already taken root on her arms. She winced as she moved, still feeling the punches to her belly. 



“To Hammer and Red’s,” I said. The bartender placed two dusty glasses in front of us, and at a nod from me, poured a thumb of Jameson’s into each. 



Gabriella touched her glass to mine and hesitated. I knocked the drink back, wiped my mouth with the back of my hand and screwed my eyes shut. The burning in my gullet was good. I’d missed the sensation of drinking. But this time it was Gabriella sat beside me, sipping anxiously, not Hammer with his belly-laughs. He used to drink like a fish, and it was the memory of him stumbling home beside me that made my next order a soda water. 



That earned me dirty looks from the detectives *and* the bartender.



“You did well, kid,” I said. “But the game plan’s changed now.” 



“You still want to go after Holt?” Gabriella said nervously. 



“You’re damned right I want to go after Holt. I’ve got nothing to lose. The firm’s in its death days, our clients are gone. Let me do one last thing. Let me represent you in this.” 



Gabriella stared into her glass as though it’d answer her problems.



“Those other women you contacted, let me try speaking to them.” I leaned towards her. “I’ll persuade them to let us depose them, or at least talk to them.” 



“You think you can do that?” 



“You’ll file the complaint at the courthouse. The circuit court, near the big firms. Not the district one, here.” 



“They won’t hear the case there—” 



“No, but you’ll be seen leaving the courthouse. I’ll scrounge up some press contacts.” 



“You want to get the press involved?” Gabriella blanched. She tipped back her head and swallowed the rest of her drink in one. I watched her throat move. She winced. 



“Yes,” I replied. “People should know he’s a scumbag.” 



“What about the photos?” Gabriella said. “If he releases them—”



“He’ll dig his own grave,” I said. “If he releases those photos once you’ve filed a case against him for harassment, it only proves what we’re claiming. You’re safe. You’ll be safe with me.” 



---------



I called Quince later that evening from the office, and asked him if he had any contacts at newspapers. 



“Nothing small, you understand? I’m talking somewhere attention grabbing.” I dug my hand into the packet of sunflower seeds. 



“Yeah, I know a Michael Malone at the Tribune that owes me a couple of favours,” Quince said. “Have you been drinking, William?” 



“Just the one,” I admitted. “Can you get him down to the Circuit Court tomorrow at four? There’ll be a young woman in a blue dress filing a harassment suit. He might want to ask her some questions, because the named defendant will ruffle some feathers.”



“What are you planning?” Quince asked. “Don’t do anything stupid. Don’t bite off more than you can chew.” 



“Nothing’s too big now,” I said. “If we lose this case, it doesn’t matter. Come the end of the month, I won’t be practising as an attorney.” 



“Don’t get yourself disbarred, kiddo,” Quince said heavily. 



“I won’t,” I assured him, but the feeling wasn’t there. 



Hanging up, I made my way down the stairs to the gym. It was mostly empty, just Paul with the dog tattoos sitting on the sofa. His arms and legs spread, I noticed he wasn’t dressed in sportswear. He wore a pair of dark jeans, and a buttoned-down shirt. His forearms were tanned and veined, sleeves rolled up to show the start of his biceps. 



“You going out?” I asked, ready to turn off the light. 



“Yeah,” he stood, thrusting his hands into his jeans pockets. “Just waiting for Gabriella.” 



“Gabriella?” I echoed.



“Coming!” 



As I said her name, she appeared. She fixed an earring in her ear and pushed her hair back with a hand. 



“How do I look?” she asked, self consciously pulling at the bottom of the dress she wore. For the first time, she wore neither sportswear or business wear. The dress was burgundy, tight fitted to show the muscles in her back. Her hair was down, still wet from a shower. She’d applied make up, looking older with dark eyes and a flick of neutral lip colour. Powder covered the scar, and I realised I missed it.



“Great,” Paul replied. 



I nodded. 



“Do you want me to turn off the lights?” Gabriella asked. She scooped her purse up from the sofa, and Paul withdrew his hands from his pockets and wiped them nervously on his jeans. I could see the hints of the dog tattoos at his collarbones, poking out from beneath the shirt. 



“Yes,” I said. “I’m leaving anyway.” 



“See you tomorrow, Mr Red,” she smiled, looping her arm through Paul’s. 



I stood there as they left, waiting for the overhead lights to click off. The orange street lamps filtered through the open grille, and I stared at the graffitied rainbow, wondering if the pot of gold had been here all along, and I’d never noticed. 




----------


My routine back to normal, I was back in the gym at five the next morning. I peeled the dressing from my wound anxiously, fed up of trying to keep it dry in the shower. The skin was puckered and a little red. I poked it, sucking through my teeth when it hurt. 



Good enough. 



With callisthenics still beyond me, I looped an elastic band around a clip on the wall. The other end I held in my fist. A couple of experimental tugs, feeling the elasticity, the pull against me. Then I settled into it. Shadowboxing, the resistance of the band working the unused muscles. 



Soon sweat poured off me. My hips ached, the balls of my feet tiring as I turned. I wasn’t satisfied. All my life I’d been coached against letting my anger get the best of me. 



“Anger’s for those who’ve got nothing better to fight for,” my Dad said. “But if you feel rage when you take a punch, that’s normal. That’s normal.” 



But now, I was angry. It ate away at me, mixing with acid guilt. Anger at Ulysses Holt and all the men like him. My punches came thick and fast, uppercutting away from the elastic band. For the first time, I wanted to hurt someone. I wanted the rules thrown out the window, just me and my opponent, circling each other with hands wrapped and fists ready. It would be dirty, bloody, and ugly, but the thought of standing up for what I believed in had adrenaline coursing through my veins. 



As the sun rose, I stopped. My injury ached, but my muscles hurt more, and I liked it. I stepped into the shower, turning the water up hot and stood beneath the jet, letting it pound against my shoulders. The steam rose up the tiles like the smoke of a cigarette. Scars littered my body. Fighting without gloves left fewer attorneys braindead, but it did leave its marks. My knuckles were swollen and purple, the testament to a thousand fights. 



My first had been one of Hammer’s clients. A woman called Cara Lou Evans. She’d been so small boned, standing between me and him. She looked like a scared little girl when we took her to court. The case was a divorce settlement turned ugly. Two broken people scrabbling over the tiny apartment they shared, and all the furniture they could claim. 



The husband had been uglier than a sack full of shit. He was a bruiser, bare knuckle fighting for the hell of it. Hammer could have taken him, but an old injury playing up put him out of action. I’d agreed to take his place; twenty-four years of age, fresh out of law school and looking at my heroes like Quince Lane and my Dad.



That got beat out of me pretty quick. The bruiser split my skin open over my cheekbones and broken my nose for the first time. The two minute rounds ended with me flat on my back, blinking back into consciousness. There’d been blood on my face, and the knuckles of my right hand had been split raw. 



My biggest fear had been disappointing Hammer. He’d picked me off the floor and wiped my face clean and told me that everyone lost their first. 



Everyone except Gabriella. 



I left the mirror fogged up as I dressed, unwilling to look at my reflection. I knew what I’d see: the grey hair of a man growing old, the left eyebrow that drooped where I’d been hit one too many times. The crooked nose and scarred face of a fighter who should have given up. 



When I realised I had begun to wallow in self-pity, I drew myself up a little straighter. I threw back a handful of sunflower seeds and left the office, stalking past the younger men who had arrived to use the gym. Paul was not amongst them, and there was no sign of Gabriella. 



The first girl on Gabriella’s list was Francine Gianni. She met me at a coffee shop downtown. A wire of a girl, she had cropped brown hair and wore a dark yellow dress. 



“What do you want?” she asked impatiently. “I haven’t got much time.” I guessed she worked as a secretary somewhere; fallen far from her dreams of being an associate at Carter, Spiffins and Cadger. Gabriella told me Francine was the intake above hers. 



“Thanks for agreeing to meet me.” I’d bought her a cup of black coffee, and got nothing for myself. I didn’t like the smell of it, and I missed my arabica.  



“I didn’t want to be seen with Gabriella,” Francine explained. She leaned forwards, and I caught the scent of her perfume. “He’s got me scared, and if he thinks we’re working together…” 



“Tell me what happened,” I said. “When you say ‘he,’ you mean Holt?” 



“Don’t use his name!” Francine’s eyes widened in fear. She glanced around the coffee shop, as if making sure no one was listening. It felt like a moment from a second-rate spy drama, but I could see her hands shaking when she reached for the coffee. 



“Photographs?” I said beneath my breath. 



The girl nodded. The cup clinked against the saucer as she set it down. “Videos, too, he says.” 



I grimaced. “Would you be willing to be deposed?” I asked. “We’d use your recorded testimony in court. You wouldn’t even have to appear, just lend your word to Gabriella’s.” 



“I can’t,” Francine shook her head. “I don’t… I feel sick, every day, knowing those photos are out there and I fell for that trap like some *stupid,* naïve little girl. But if they’re released, my entire life would be ruined. I’d never find a job again, I’d be a laughing stock. You have no idea what that’s like.” 



“I’ve spent my life defending women like you,” I said. “Men like him are everywhere. They’re predators, and what happened to you wasn’t your fault. You have to help me, and you have to help Gabriella. Otherwise, this will keep happening to other girls.” 



Francine gripped her coffee like an amulet. 



“How old are you, twenty-six?” I asked.

 

“Yes,” 



“Imagine another girl, younger than you. She’s twenty-one, or twenty-two, just starting her time at law school. She’s applying for internships. Maybe not the most physically intimidating girl out there. Just wants to make a difference, wants to defend people who can’t defend themselves. Then a man like Holt takes advantage of that. He sees she’s determined, that she wants to help people and he says: ‘you can do that, you just have to show me you’re willing to do what it takes.’ He's flattering. He's an older man, powerful, well connected. She does what he says... Does that sound familiar?” 



Francine nodded. She was close to tears. 



“Do you want her to go through that?” 



“I don’t.” Her voice was a whisper. 



“Good. Agree to testify.” 



“You’re the lawyer handling her case?” 



“Yes.” 



Francine took a deep breath. 



“I’ll do it,” she said. “No one should go through this.""

I met my girlfriend when we were still in engineering school in France. When we got together she had just broken things off with her ex with whom she had been for 2 years. She made the first move but I still had to work my ass off to make it so she would think I was more thant just a fling to get over her ex. Eventually things got pretty serious.

&amp;nbsp;

**The first breakup**

A little under a year after that, she went to Berlin for a six month internship and I went to Barcelona. I convinced her things could still work. She came to visit in Barcelona and then I went to Berlin where she broke up with me in horrible fashion. I had not managed to make her forget her ex.

&amp;nbsp;

**The second stint**


We stay in contact during the whole 6 months of the internship skyping very often and eventually we go back to France for our third and last year of engineering school. It takes me a while but I finally manage to make us get back together and a few months later we move in together. At that point I got seriously sick and I had to have nurse treatment at home and pain meds everyday. This lasted 6 months. I still tried my heart out to be there for her but I started to get very tired and I began to be more and more distant as I couldn't take the abuse she was throwing at me because she thought we weren't doing enough things together. She would pretend she would go to events with someone else to make me go. She would say very mean words, break stuff or even threaten to break up so that I would do more for her. I thinkpoint the relationship was very bad  at that but I was hoping that it would get back on track once I finished school and I was healed. 

&amp;nbsp;

**The second breakup**


School came to and end for me and she went to study for another year in England while I was transfered in Rouen (North-West France) for my first assignement as a civil servant. She broke up with me soon after we moved out of the appartement we had lived in together and a few days before our graduation ceremony. I tell I don't want to hear from her anymore and that I really wanted to move on this time around.

&amp;nbsp;

**The third stint**


One year after that, she comes back to France and is transfered to Paris as she is a civil servant too and we casually meet up one day when I had a meeting in the very building she works in. Only time we had talked in between the break up and that was during the attacks in Paris and I called her to know if she was fine. We ended up having sex and getting back together. I felt like that's what I had always wanted but I was too proud to admit. 

&amp;nbsp;


**My struggle with anxiety and possibly ADHD**

Things start off very well, we have good times and we see each other 2 to 3 week ends every month. The problem is I had started getting really depressed a little while before we got back together. I have trouble being as efficient as I'd like to be at work and I think it's due to undiagnosed ADHD. Because of that I'm really stressed out at work, most of the time and even though I do a good job even according to my boss, I still get very ashamed when I come up across ""easy things"" that I cannot do. When I started getting worrying, I went to a see a physician and I now have a two date appointment in November and December to have a crack at a diagnosis so I can finally go on with my life.

&amp;nbsp;

**Tough love**

The first time I brought up the subject with my girlfriend she went all ""tough love"" on me, saying as long as I had two legs and two arms I was fine. Saying one of her exes was a looser for being anxious. I remember that night I got so stressed out after we had a big argument, she said the next day that my teeth were rattling during the night but thought nothing of it. There was no way to make her understand that I was having a really hard time and I needed help which contributed to me getting pushed over the edge once again and I started getting distant like I did in the past. She almost broke up with me again at that point, but we worked through it and she said she wants to be with me and we should make plans for a future together. I agreed to moving in with her  a year from now when i can change jobs and she started accepting that I might really need help and not just that tough love bullshit. The thing is she is not really willing to help me, she wants to be sure I'm going to be there for her but she says she doesn't want to help apart from being there when I go to get diagnosed. She gets very upset when I need time on my own and if don't send very many texts for a day or two. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Tough Expectations**


Now I feel like she's one more source of pressure in my life and even though I still like being with her, I don't know if it's worth it. I have trouble holding the rest of my life together and I don't want to make empty promises that I won't be able to fulfil a year from now if my life is  still a mess. I'm really counting on my medical appointment to help me sort out my life and help me move on from that dark place I am in but I don't know if I should really put all my eggs in the same basket. It feels like she always wants more from me. She brings up stuff between us and says her friends think I'm not good enough for her. 

&amp;nbsp;

**I am 100% confused**


It's all getting really blurry for me right now and I don't even know if she is right for me anymore. She can be very harsh sometimes and that makes me resent her in a way. She doesn't shy away from saying mean things about me and my past times. She says I'm a loser for playing video games as much as I do, especially violent ones even though I live a pretty active lifestyle and have good friends. 

On the other hand, she can be really sweet, we have some very good moments and at one point I could really picture myself fouding a family with her. I really enjoy being with her most of the time but I don't really know if all the hard stuff is due to me having issues or if it's just not meant to be between us. 


&amp;nbsp;


I'm sorry, this is a shitload of text and it might not be that very well written since english is my second language but I thought I'd come here to get some help/perspective on this. 

&amp;nbsp;


  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I finally got in a healthy relationship (even if long distance) with the girl I had been on and off with for 4 years. I commited to a lot. I started to get really anxious about life and work. I Told my gf I thought I had ADHD and was very depressed. She plays it off and gives me tough love. I got to a dark place, got more distant. Our relationship degraded. I commited to more to save it but I still feel like I'm on my own and she only adds more weight on my shoulders"
52kpez,0,2016-09-13,Advice for Intern that's graduating in Spring,Trying2LearnKali,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/52kpez/advice_for_intern_thats_graduating_in_spring/,"Hi everyone,

I'm currently interning for a company in their cyber security division as a student employee with background in computer science and technical writing. My job tasks mostly consist of helping them create documentation for new software and policies they are implementing.

I've worked with their security scanner, their firewall(read only), created Infopath request forms that users will be submitting for policies and I've created documents that the sysadmins are using as a reference for certain softwares. I've also helped them compare their GPO settings to Microsoft's recommended settings.

 I'm currently working on documenting the process for managing Lieberman so that employees can escalate their privileges on their local machine for a short while (I'm not actually implementing it, but through documenting the process I'll get a general feel for it).

I feel like this is all great work, and it's not so much of sysadmin work (aside from the documentation process), but the realm of cyber security and infosec greatly interests me. Besides continuing to work the internship through graduation, what are some other things I can do to increase my chances of landing a great job right out of college? 

I have the feeling that the company I'm working for will opt to hire me if I continue to do quality work, but if that doesn't happen I want to be prepared to look elsewhere. 

TL;DR: What are some things I can do as a student employee to increase my chances of landing a job right out of college? "

My question is what is the IT job market like in Spokane? I personally work in the Tech/IT sector and was wondering how the job prospects are there for that type of career, especially in some of the entry level developer positions?

For reference I do IT/Help desk and Data Analysis, but I'm also doing an internship for Full Stack Web Dev at the moment. I'm sure Spokane is no tech hub like Portland or Seattle but I was just curious how much opportunity there is for it here.

Thanks for any feedback."

I started on here at the begining of summer and really enjoyed doing CICO until mid-August when my partner returned from his summer internship. Now I find myself picking up sweets and indulging in breads, cheese, and sugars more. Anyone have tips on how to resist giving into temptations without making my partner feel guilty for eating foods he loves?

Note: I am the only one really concerned about my weight, he is much healthier/fit than I am and has a much better metabolism. We are both in college and live separately. In my living situation we have communal food that is typically more junk food with healthy, prepared dinners on weeknights that are out of my control."

Selina: A girl's gotta eat, right? I think it would be well within the realm of possibility for her to take payment for sexual acts. Whether they were from former classmates, older patrons or anyone else for that matter. Besides, maybe she can steal a little something at the end of the day, right?

Barbara: Crazy and sexy is a wicked combination. I think that she would happily play with a dangerous bar room type with a big motorcycle and bulging biceps. Or maybe she'll seduce another cop to get him on her side in the long run? Either seems probably to me.

Other females: Ivy, Fish Mooney, Harley Quinn (AU)

---House of Lies---

Jeannie: Obvious one here, but I'd play almost anyone against her in some fashion. A new boyfriend that is truly her baby daddy... A past fling coming back in to her life and wooing her .... A booty call on a business trip that turns in to something slightly more serious.... Etc etc!

Monica: She needs a nice young stud to keep her busy, doesn't she? I'm thinking an intern that she tries to belittle and finally wants to ease a bit of tension and then realizes just how big of a boy he is ... and it draws her to him more and more even if they really don't get along on a personal level.

Others: April, Sarah Guggenheim, Marisa McClintock, Brynn

---The Office---

Pam Beesley: Something without Jim would be fantastic. Whether she's desperate at her apartment after breaking up with Roy that she'll give herself up to the landlord for more time/lesser rent... Maybe she's lonely and lets a warehouse guy take her for a ride that she can't help but want to relive on a nearly daily basis? Or an intern that she catches taking a liking to her and who knows where they go from there!

Jan: Another cougar that needs a young man. She's shown many times over that she loves interns and younger men in general!

Erin: Someone very dominate for her since she seems to be unsure/innocent... and she needs somebody that can break her of that streak.

Kelly: I have a feeling that she'd use just about anyone to make Ryan jealous. Let's give her a new person to do just that with. We can figure out if he's a perfect fit for her or just a guy with a dick that can shut her up for a few minutes at a time while they do some dirty things with one another!

Others: Angela, Meredith, Holly Flax....

Feel free to toss almost anyone else at me too as I'm sure I've missed some! Looking for something potentially long-term but I'm more then happy with just doing one scene if you'd rather go that route!

Other shows/games I could be interested in: Tales from the Boarderlands, Smallville, Halo, Until Dawn, The Guild, Parks and Recreation, Community, Firefly, Buffy the Vampire Slayer

And if we've had a line going and you'd like to continue, please let me know! Working full time can really mess with you when you're checking your inbox and I'm certain I lose track of things!

52lbgy,8,2016-09-13,Suggestions for my IT Career Path?,Fauxfroyo,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/52lbgy/suggestions_for_my_it_career_path/,"

Hello everyone. I got a suggestion to post here asking for tips on my IT career path, and I'd love to hear anyone's advice or comments on my situation.

I am a 24 y/o woman working full time as a clerk typist for my county's DHS. I'm currently enrolled at my local community college's Computer Networking Technology 2 year associates degree program. Ideally, I'd complete this program, then get apply for a civil service position providing help desk support for state employees. I'd continue working full time and going to school full time, then to complete my bachelor's degree online through either Western Governor's University or Penn State World Campus. Then I could continue in civil service and work my way up there, or apply to other jobs elsewhere in private companies.

As for the rest of my work history, I've worked for the county as a clerk typist since April of this year, and before that I worked for the state as a temp clerk typist from Sept 2015 to April 2016. Before that, I worked part time then full time at a small business video game store from 2011-2015. I delayed going to school and stayed at that job for so long due to mental health reasons, which I have since made considerable progress on (especially in the past year). I currently have no certifications or experience in IT. Literally all I have at this point is an interest in computers and technology, and a genuine enjoyment of providing good customer service. Any suggestions on what I should study, where I should look for jobs or internships, and what fields to apply in are greatly appreciated. If it helps, I'm in the south central PA area, about an hour from both Harrisburg and Baltimore MD. Thanks so much!"
52ldbn,7,2016-09-13,I started a consulting business (my first company) and turned over €84k in the first year. We’re now 3 in the team. Here’s a no-BS guide if you want to do the same (which requires REAL WORK).,gresquare,Entrepreneur,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/52ldbn/i_started_a_consulting_business_my_first_company/,"I haven’t written a blog post in more than a year. It’s been a busy year.

In one year, I went from a one-man show with €0 in revenue to a great team of 3 with €84k in revenue.

I have a newfound respect for you entrepreneurs. The people who have been doing this for years or decades.

A confession: Writing scares the shit out of me. I’m not afraid to speak in public (I love it). But writing does. It’s time to conquer this fear.

I wanted to write a letter to people who are in the same situation that I was in just before I left my job. I was miserable. I always wanted to do my own thing. Even my mom was saying that I should do something on my own. That I wasn’t made to receive orders.

[I’ve posted my progress here a year ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/3dqfok/ive_started_my_own_business_as_a_marketing/). I used the questions you guys asked then to create this post.

This letter is for people who are struggling to get started. Who have this itch about doing their own thing. It’s also a letter for me. To realise how much I’ve done and what I’ve become.

It makes me sad to see all those startup events or free entrepreneur meetups. I don’t know about where you are, but in Dublin you’ll see always the same people. They never seem to make any progress.

It’s fake work.

This letter is for you. The wantrepreneur. The guy who always thinks and never does.

#First, here’s some context

Born in 1988. Great childhood.

**2003:**

I went to a good high school in Clermont-Ferrand, France.

**2006:**

I studied hard the last year to go to a school of engineering in France (so I could build wind turbines). But I didn’t get in.
I went to another school of engineering in 2006 to 2009.

**2008:**

Went to Kansas for a year as part of an exchange program. I saw another side of the World. I realised how lucky I was.

**2009:**

I was lost. I decided that marketing and business was much more interesting to me than mechanical engineering and found a business school that would take me.
I did a Bachelor Degree back in my hometown for a year.

**2010:**

I had to find an internship abroad. With the little bit of experience in mechanical engineering and my good english, I landed in Dublin.
As an intern, I was a prick. I was still very unsure about my future and myself.
I didn’t want to go back to France so I pushed hard to be hired. I found a weakness in the way the company was reporting data. I proposed to my boss to take care of it. He agreed.

**2011:**

I got a contract job in Dublin on something I barely understood. They gave me some budget and I managed to get a solution off the ground.
I thought hard about my future one weekend, and somehow I connected the dots. I always have been fascinated by the internet. I always had a computer in my room. The sound of my first 56k modem was a delight to my ears.

Marketing was also something I liked. But not the bullshit marketing. Not the shitty ads. What I really liked was trying to understand people. The psychology. How do people think? Why do they behave this way?
So I started a blog about entrepreneurship and marketing (in French). I spent my evenings (and days) on Twitter, connecting with people and I wrote a few blog posts. They were mostly research from reading books. They weren’t really me.

**2012:**

I managed to land a permanent full-time job with the same company. I replaced my boss who was leaving. For the first time in my life, I had a very decent salary (around €28,000 a year). I also had a company car.

It’s an important year. This is when I met Jen. She changed my life. She really did. She put me back in touch with my family. I got closer to my siblings and parents thanks to her. And it gave me confidence. Confidence that I could do whatever the fuck I wanted.
I earned a Professional Diploma in Digital Marketing.

**2013:**

I found a job in the industry I wanted - a job with a mobile marketing company. I put everything I had in this business for almost 2 years. I learned so much about marketing and sales. I was involved in everything. The problem was: I learned by myself.
The product we were selling wasn’t good and customers didn’t want to pay for it. I was involved in business development at the end and I thought I was a bad salesperson. Turned out I wasn’t. The product just wasn’t good enough.

I also started to attend a few Startup Weekends. At the time I didn’t know much about the startup scene. Going to those events made me realise that it wasn’t that difficult to launch something. I just had to stop finding excuses.
I started a few side projects here and there but none of them were truly interesting to me. I just gave up very quickly.

**2014:**

I started to work on yet another project in December 2014, while I was still working full-time. I got the idea at a conference I was attending.
I started to blog about it. I was planning to help eCommerce retailers to retain their customers with smart emails.

**2015:**

The idea wasn’t better than the previous ones. But this time I decided to go for it and stop finding excuses. I had €20,000 in savings and just said “fuck it”. I left my job.

I felt it was the only way for me to actually do it. To be in front of a cliff and jump. I had to build a plane on the way down. Going back to work for something I didn’t believe in wasn’t an option.
The idea moved from a product to consulting. I didn’t want to raise money and I had to make money. I even got some financial help from the state for a few weeks to avoid making a big dent in my savings.

**Today:**

[We are a team of three, working remotely](slicesconsulting.com). Serina is based in Seattle. Marco is based in Barcelona. I’m based in Dublin.
We help companies make their website better so they can sell more.

* We have a much clearer idea on how I’ll grow the business

##I’m lucky

I’m white, straight, living in Europe. I’ve never experienced discrimination. I’ve never experienced poverty. I’m well educated. I have a fiancée. Siblings I love more than anything. Parents who love me. Good friends.

I know that some of you have a way tougher life than me. Use it at your advantage. What you’re going through will probably help you to be tougher than most.

#Let's start

[Here's my desk \(in my living-room\) when I started.](https://slicesconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Desk.001-1024x576.jpeg)

This is what I would have liked to read before I got started. This is a letter to you if you always wanted to create a business but never did. Or if you feel like the business is going nowhere.

There are no hacks and no easy way to achieve this, so if you’re looking for a quick way to make money without working for it this guide is not for you.

##Your vision board

Before starting anything you need to know why you’re doing it. Why exactly do you want to have a business? To do it because it’s trendy? To follow your inspiration? To be able to be “your own boss”? Dig deeper.

“Why?” is the most important question. It took me a while to realise what was my “Why?”. I had to dig deeper than “having enough money to live”.

I’m lucky to have a lot of siblings that I love very much (my parents got remarried). I’m based in Ireland and they are in France. My first objective was to be able to visit them as many times as I wanted, without being wary of money or time off work.

My second objective was to live a happy life with my soon-to-be wife. To be able to take time off when I wanted to and travelling. To be able to afford a nice house, and a nice car.

In one word: Freedom. I wanted my freedom back.

##What are you fighting for or against?

Your vision for yourself is slightly different from the fight you should pick up.

Many people start with a business model or an idea. I believe that you should start with a fight.

Whatever your industry and what you want to do, what are you fighting against? What pisses you off the most? What do you want to change?

I’ve never liked bullshit. I’m a straight-forward person. I’ve been involved in marketing for while, and its bullshit always pissed me off.

A few examples:

* Internet is polluted with popups, clickbait articles (“You won’t believe what happened next!”), or spammy, irrelevant, content.
* Some companies lie and manipulate people to make money. Think about [Enron](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1016268/) or, at a smaller scale, all of those brands with lock-in contracts, fine print, etc…
* Most businesses focus on short-term gains rather than making an impact. Shareholder capitalism isn’t working, let’s face it. [“The harder a CEO is pushed to increase shareholder value, the more the CEO will be tempted to make moves that actually hurt the shareholders.”](https://hbr.org/2010/01/the-age-of-customer-capitalism)
* What’s your fight?

##How much do you have in the bank?

Do you have enough money to run for 6 months without any revenue? This is the question you need to ask yourself.

I burnt through €10,000 in 6 months without overspending at all. Just surviving with rent, food, and some entertainment. If you don’t have any savings, keep your job and put some money aside.

If you’re lucky enough to be able to come back to your parents’ house, do it.

Work during evenings and weekends but don’t quit your job.

##Where are you going to work from?

I worked from my living room for a few months. I was on my own for most of the day.

If you have the luxury to be able to work from home, do it. Do it until you get your first paying customers.

Working from home got to me sometimes. It is tough not to have many human interactions. Even being surrounded by people you don’t know feels better than being alone.

I was able to move to a co-working space after a few months. My productivity went up.

##Support system

Who can you talk to when you’ll feel down? Yes, you will like shit some days. You need to be able to talk to someone.

My dad, my siblings and my fiancée have always been very supportive. I know that I wouldn’t have been able to do it without them.

Mental health is really important if you want to make money. It won’t happen overnight. You need to rely on other people.

You might feel isolated even with a support system. It is difficult for people to know what you’re going through if they’re not going through it themselves.

##Customer development

You just can’t come with a good idea if you don’t talk to people. Talk to people.

People won’t steal your ideas. They don’t care. They have other stuff to do.

I’ve used the book [The Four Steps to the Epiphany](https://www.amazon.com/Four-Steps-Epiphany-Steve-Blank/dp/0989200507/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1473426213&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=four+steps+to+the+epiphany) (by Steve Blank) a lot and you should, too.

Other good books I recommend :

* [The Entrepreneur’s Guide to Customer Development](https://www.amazon.com/Entrepreneurs-Guide-Customer-Development-Epiphany/dp/0982743602) (by Brant Cooper).
* [The Lean Startup](https://www.amazon.com/Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous-Innovation/dp/0307887898/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1473426190&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=lean+startup) (by Eric Ries).
Problem(s) you’re solving

Don’t focus on what you do. Focus on the problems you’re solving. Look for the struggle. What prevent people from doing what they would like to do?

Let’s say your original idea is to launch a cake shop. What are the potential problems for your potential customers?

They need to get a cake for a special occasion, but:

* they don’t have time to make it,
* they don’t know how to bake.
Validate that with people. Ask them about their problems. Make them talk.

##Solution you’re providing

Once you’ve identified problems, you can look for a solution. Don’t think in term of services or features. You’ll start to copy what’s around instead of coming up with your own stuffs.

Isolate each problem and focus on its solution.

* Problem 1: They don’t have time to bake one.
* Solution: A shop where they can buy cakes right now, without having to wait.

And:

* Problem 2: They don’t know how to bake.
* Solution: A shop where they can buy cakes without having to bake.
* Another solution: A series of courses where people could learn how to bake themselves.

#Understand if your problem is painful enough

Your job is then to understand if the problem you’re solving is painful enough. If your problem is not painful, people won’t look for a solution. They won’t pay for it either.

If your problem is painful enough but your solution is bad, they won’t pay for it either.

Here’s how I went about it:

##List all the people you know

Create a new Google Spreadsheet and start typing the names of all the people you know:

[Your contact list could look like this.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18WWsMzzkSC5y4XC2wzijsMq7EZhXgUMZR-EODS7QRLY/edit)

Don’t list only the people that you know related to what you’re planning to do.

List everyone. Your uncle who lives on the other side of the World, your friends from high school, everybody.

Make sure to look at your email contacts, social network contacts, “real life” connections, so you don’t forget anyone.

Add a way to get in touch with each of them: their email, their phone number, their postal address, etc…

[Here’s an example on Google Sheets that you can view and copy.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18WWsMzzkSC5y4XC2wzijsMq7EZhXgUMZR-EODS7QRLY/edit)

##Contact them one by one

Then contact them one by one.

In three sentences, tell them about:

* Who you are
* How you’ve met
* What you’re planning to do

Then ask them for one favour: an introduction.

You should ask them to introduce you to people you want to talk to: potential customers.

You want to learn from them. About their day-to-day, their problems, the current solutions they’re using, etc…

Make it clear that you’re not trying to sell anything. Think about yourself as a researcher, not a sales person. You want to learn.

##Follow-up like a mofo

People don’t care about you. Even your own uncle doesn’t care. They have other things to do. You can’t blame them for that.

That’s why you need to follow-up. If you don’t get an answer after the first contact, get in touch again.

Once every week should be enough.

You wouldn’t believe the number of times I had to contact people before I got an answer. Don’t give up.

Add a few columns on the right of your contacts. Every time you get in touch with someone, enter the date.

##People don’t care about you

Did I say you should follow-up?

If it was easy, everybody would do it. Most people give up after one try. Don’t be like this. Keep going until you hear something back.

Vary the ways you get in touch with them: two emails, one call, one tweet, one message on LinkedIn, two emails…

##Questions

Your objective is to learn. To validate what you thought was a good idea. Your initial idea will change, I can guarantee it. Don’t fall in love with it. Fall in love with the problem(s) you’re solving.

When talking to people, ask the right questions. [This post](http://mfishbein.com/the-ultimate-list-of-customer-development-questions/) from [Mick Fishbein](http://mfishbein.com/) is a goldmine.

If you’re on your own, record the conversation. Take notes. You will forget key insights after a few minutes if you don’t.

I used Google Docs to record my notes in the past. You can use Evernote, pen and paper, whatever you want.

Just make the calls. Send those emails.

Do it.

#Refine

After talking to a few people you WILL learn a lot. Chances are, the solution you were thinking about has already changed.

That’s good.

Don’t try to convince people that your idea is the best one. Just listen.

Refine your business model.

Update your problems and solutions.

##Niche

Ah, finding your niche. How many times have I read this about Internet marketing? Too many to count.

Don’t be stressed about it. You don’t have to find a niche right now. Just talk to people. Refine your idea.

It took me months to find “a niche”, and even know I feel that we’re still tackling too many problems at once.

I’ve started trying to sell a solution for eCommerce to retain their customers. By talking to my first people I ended up focusing on conversion (making website visitors do what I wanted them to do) rather than retention (making them come back). I switched from a product to consulting.

I can’t tell you what will happen to you. What I can tell you though is to look for patterns. Follow your guts and say no.

There are three good ways to start:

* Focus on one industry, solve many problems with many services. For example, marketing consulting for the pharmaceutical industry.
* Focus on many industries, solve one problem with one solution. For example, Trello. It’s a tool that help you get organised. Whatever you do, whoever you are.
* Focus one industry, solve one problem with one solution. For example, [Winterhalter](http://www.winterhalter.biz/), selling dishwashers for hotels and restaurants. Inspired by [this post](https://nothingventured.rocks/lessons-on-the-art-of-specialisation-from-the-dishwasher-market-67384f6693ba#.6hdpclp1p) from my friend [Connor Keppel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/connorkeppel).

#First clients

Many people talk about starting a startup. They think that creating a startup means creating a product in 6 months with money that isn’t yours, sell that a year later for $100M, and get rich.

If it’s your first business, take it slow. Fall in love with the problems you’re solving. Start with a very simple solution.

A solution that doesn’t require €100,000 in investment to get off the ground. A solution that you can tweak and change as you please. A solution that you can start from your home, with a laptop and a lot of grit.

I believe that freelancing or consulting is the easiest way to go about making money.

You will be able to learn from your clients, change your offerings very fast, pay yourself, and build the foundation to create products in the future.

I started by trying to talk to eCommerce companies only. I then moved to any businesses selling products or services online.

My very first client was somebody I already knew (I was lecturing a bit at his college). He was paying me €500 a month.

The second client was a referral from somebody I knew. I worked as a consultant with them for 3 months to bridge the gap between their digital agency and their team. They were paying me around €2,000 a month.

The third client came from a referral from my accountant. They were paying me €1,200 a month.

Do you start to see a trend?

My first clients came from my network. From more than 300 people I contacted, people started to refer me.

We got 23 interesting leads in one year and closed more than half of them. Services varied from a 30-minute training session to large retainers.

Here’s the breakdown:

* 9 leads came from speaking at events.
* 8 came from referrals.
* 4 from cold emails.
* 2 from networking events.

As you can see, the vast majority of clients came from speaking (more on that later) and referrals.

##Bull’s eye

Many founders try to do everything at once. You HAVE to focus on one or two channels to get your first clients.

There are 19 in total. I refer to the book Traction for that (by Gabriel Weinberg, CEO of DuckDuckGo, and Justin Mares)

As a solopreneur, you simply can’t focus on more than two. I would advise you to focus on contacting your network and get referred.

Don’t waste money and time on Facebook Ads or SEO when you’re starting. Sell directly. Talk to people.

Yes, it’s not easy. Some people will say no. Some people won’t have time to talk to you. But you have to do what others don’t want to do.

I also managed to get clients from speaking, at a later stage. I spoke at a few events in my last full-time job and I liked it. I actually paid to speak at a big marketing event in Dublin (that deserves its own article). [Here's me speaking at my first ""big"" event last year. Notice the beautiful pink shirt](https://slicesconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/8dd04a558c7d8b52a7328bd0466c734a-768x1024.jpg)...

##Routine

Set up a routine. This is so important.

I wake up every week day at 6.45am, go to work at 8am, and leave at around 5pm most days. I cycle to work. I eat a healthy breakfast (2 eggs, porridge, fruits).

This is a marathon, not a sprint. You will be full of energy at the start. Don’t burn it. Eat well, sleep well.

I remember reading this advice before I started. I found it to be over the top. It isn’t. Your brain is your most important asset. If you feel tired, you won’t be productive. If you’re not productive, your morale will be low. If your morale is low, you won’t achieve much.

Are you ready to keep up this routine for years? I’ve been doing this for more than a year. Every week day.

Some entrepreneurs have been doing this for decades. This is what it takes.

Reflect about your business every month. Think about its strategy. Read the book [Good Strategy / Bad Strategy](https://www.amazon.com/Good-Strategy-Bad-Difference-Matters/dp/0307886239) by Richard Rumelt. Here’s a free [video version of the book](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZrTl16hZdk). I also used the [SOSTAC Framework](http://prsmith.org/sostac/) for that.

Write a weekly todo list and a daily todo list.

##Say no

That’s also something I used to hear a lot. You have to say no more often than yes.

Focus on the problem you’re solving and the battle you’re fighting. Those two things shouldn’t change much.

However, be flexible when it comes to the solution you’re offering.

If you help companies to get more traffic to their site, don’t start offering web design services. Focus on one problem at a time.

Don’t be afraid to say no.

#Evolving

By then, you should have one or two paying clients. They will most likely friends of friends. This is great. They trust you because they know you.

Others won’t trust you just yet. Once you’re making a bit of money, you can start focusing on your business.

Those actions are from the book [Get Clients Now](http://getclientsnow.com/) that I found quite helpful at the start.

It makes you focus on what’s important.

##Description of services

This is what you do and how you do it. You should have a clearer idea of the services you offer once you’ve started working with a few clients.

##Website

Some of your clients might start referring you to others. This is when you can invest in a simple website. It won’t be perfect, don’t spend too much time on this.

Buy a domain name. Build the website using Wordpress.com, Squarespace, or Wordpress.org if you’re comfortable with it.

##Brand name

We haven’t talked about your brand name yet. It’s because it doesn’t matter.

If you’re planning to be a solopreneur, your own name would do just fine. If you’re planning to create a company and hire people, think about a name.

I came up with Slices in less than an hour. I took the idea of “slicing and dicing data”, looked at domains available, and picked one. It’s not perfect but nobody ever told me that they didn’t want to work with us because of our name.

You can always change name as you grow. Most of the time, spending weeks on picking the perfect name is just fake work.

It’s an excuse to avoid doing real work (making money).

[This article](http://joel.is/how-to-name-your-startup/) from [Joel Cascoigne](http://joel.is/), co-founder of Buffer, is great.

#Closing

Closing clients is tough. I always have this adrenaline rush just before I send a proposal.

Learn not to be afraid of it.

##Personalised proposal

We use a specific template for our proposals. They are not the prettiest but they are simple to understand. They are also focused on the client, not on us.

I recommend you to read [those posts](https://doubleyourfreelancing.com/category/proposals/) from [Brennan Dunn](https://doubleyourfreelancing.com/about/) about writing proposals.

We’ve tweaked it a bit, but the idea remains the same:

###Situation

In this part you should answer the following questions: Who’s the client? What problems and challenges are they facing?

###Tomorrow

What does your client want to achieve by using your services? Does she want to increase sales by 20%? Get more visitors on their site?

The more specific the better. Before sending a proposal, make sure that you know this information.

Make them talk.

###How to get there

This is where you present your solution as way to solve their challenges and reach their objectives.

You can get more specific about exactly what you’re offering.

###Investment

How much is it going to cost? Always a burning question. This is where you can answer it.

##Pricing

Compare your cost with the the benefits you’re providing: time savings, revenue growth, etc…

We price our services monthly or sometimes weekly. We never talk about the number of hours we’re planning to spend on a project. This shouldn’t be relevant to a client if you provide value.

Always quote more than what you’re comfortable with. €5,000 might seem like a lot to you. It might seem very little for your client.

Don’t be afraid to negotiate. This is the good part. It means that your prospect is interested.

Don’t bend under pressure. Keep focusing on value.

##Competition

If you’re able to extract the value you’re providing for clients, you’ve almost made it.

This is why competition becomes irrelevant at this point. It’s not about being the cheapest. It’s about delivering value.

Don’t be obsessed with your competition. It’s a good thing. Get interested only if you lose many proposals from the same competitor.

#Growing

At this stage you should have a few customers. You might barely break even. But who cares? You’re not under pressure to give money back to investors.

I’m planning to write more about the next part of our journey: how we grow, how we hire, how we organise ourselves, etc…

A few things to remember when you’re at this stage:

##Brain

Take care of your brain: exercise, eat well, talk to your friends, go see your family, spend time with your partner.

##Stay lean

Who cares if you don’t have an office or business cards? Be yourself, don’t follow conventions.

##Cashflow

Cashflow is king. At the start what matters is the amount of money you have available in your account. Don’t worry too much about making profits. You can tweak that later.

Track this daily.

##Fire yourself

Hire people smarter than you and fire yourself from each position. This is the key if you want to grow.

I recommend you to read [The E-Myth Revisited](https://www.amazon.com/Myth-Revisited-Small-Businesses-About/dp/0887307280) by [Michael Gerber](https://www.google.ie/search?q=Michael+E.+Gerber&amp;oq=Michael+E.+Gerber&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i61&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8).

*Damn. It feels good to finally finish and publish an article.*

#TL;DR

* I went from €0 to €84k by contacting my network and speaking at events. There was no silver bullet. It was painful (and it still is).
* I had €20k in savings and burnt half of it in a few months. I didn't take any loan and own 100% of the company.
* I believe that consulting is the best way to start as a first-time entrepreneur. Build products later.
* Work hard, don’t give up, focus on a few things.
* Pick a vision and a fight.
* Talk to people. Follow-up like a modafucka.
* Avoid fake work.
* Sell value.

My problem is that every time I finally come up with an idea, I get easily discouraged from it after I sit down to get started. I have yet to complete a single project that is not homework.

For example; recently I decided that I want to make a battleship game in java. [Based of this board game](http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/4/4/1333548711318/Battleship-board-game-001.jpg) But I get discouraged easily from completing it. I think the main problem is I don't know how to make the UI for it because I couldn't figure out how to make the grid and got frustrated.

So how do you deal with frustration and discouragement. I know it is super common to feel this way while programming, but I don't know how to deal with it.

Also, if you're feeling nice, how would you make the grid for battleship in java (Not in console but within a jFrame)?"

My SO (24f) and I (23m) meet in college and have been dating for over two years now. After she graduated she moved back to Massachusetts. I am finishing up my masters in Ohio and will be done in August. Things have been fine since she moved back home. We plan on seeing each other at least every month and it has been working. Recently I had an internship in another country for the summer. We got in an argument, just like any couple does, and unfortunately her parents over heard it. We are now forbidden from seeing each other and it seems like there is no way to change her parents minds. 

Does anyone have any sort of first hand advice they could give? She is the love of my life. We have nearly planned out the rest of our lives together. I don't want the reason it ends to be because her parents have decided to ban me from her life. What do I do? I'm very lost."

Every waking moment of everyday I have songs in my head that I want to create. 

Since then, I have set up my own personal studio with the money that I made from my Software Engineering internship. I built my own PC, using Ableton as my DAW, and purchased the Komplete Kontrol s25 MIDI board as my MIDI controller. 

I have played guitar for almost 7 years now but that is not going to be my main focus around my music project. I have played some piano but am no expert. I briefly practiced drums and can play some simple beats in the pocket.

After playing with Ableton for a couple of weeks, I feel pretty comfortable creating things and developing ideas using the session view then refining them later but not sure where to begin for the mastering process. A friend of mine has learned how to master tracks and his tracks sound completely different after doing this.

I know I have a lot to learn and a lot of money to invest but just not sure where to begin. Any advice fellow music makers?"

52ljrf,5,2016-09-13,Alcohol and Xanax advice,madridista931,Drugs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/52ljrf/alcohol_and_xanax_advice/,"Hello everyone,

I have been taking Xanax daily for around a year and a couple of months for severe panic disorder and agoraphobia along with 20 MG of fluoxetine. I take around 0.25 during the day and 0.5 to sleep. I understand the daily use of Xanax is not the best solution however it has saved my life in one way or another as I was treated my anxiety with alcohol which led to serious alcoholism.

I have been on an internship abroad for 6 months now and j am going back home for a month or two where I will see my childhood friends. I used to go out a lot with them back when j was drinking but the last time I saw them I started not seeing them to be less present in the alcohol/pub scenes since I stopped alcohol.I don't want to lose my friends and I am going to put some effort to go out with them but I always have this anxiety of the excuse of not drinking. I am thinking of just ordering one beer and sip it slowly to avoid any questions, there is nothing worse for me than having to explaining why I am not drinking and I really don't want to open up about my personal problems. 

I know that I am not going to go back to alcohol it's been already 1 year and a half and I am not even interested in drinking but maybe just ordering a beer and barely finishing it can make me feel more comfortable and avoid being a total outcast

I Just wanted to know whah you would do in my place and if you ever drank a beer with 0.25 Xanax or drank a beer and then take 0.5 Xanax before sleeping. Will drinking half of it affect my health in any way, is it not worth it? 

Thank you "

After trying to get interested in other career paths and majors, I've decided that I want to pursue a career in IT for real. I've decided on two options and I'm wondering which one would be best for me in terms making IT my long-term career.

Option 1: A friend of mine joined a program called YearUp!, which basically accepts 18-24 year olds, puts them through a six month learning period, then gives students a choice of companies they've partnered with to be an intern for another six months. He graduated recently and is currently on a contract doing security for the company he chose. I've been thinking about doing the same thing since it's basically a free program(from what I've read anyway, I still think there's a catch of some sort). But the thing is, by the end of this program I won't have any sort of degree. I guess I can get some certifications afterwards but not having a degree bothers me a bit. At least right after graduating this program I'll go straight into an internship.

Option 2: Get an AA in Computer Information Systems at my local community college, get an A+ certification, and get my foot through the door by getting a help desk job and working from there.


Thanks!"
52lmmg,1,2016-09-13,"Me [20/F] with my friend [21 M] of 2 years, distance after I hung out with his GF, need advice on how to fix friendship",musicfestivalfriend,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/52lmmg/me_20f_with_my_friend_21_m_of_2_years_distance/,"I met my friend Ted at a concert the summer after freshman year of college. I was there with my BFF. We all got there super early, so we started talking to Ted and realized we had a lot in common such as the music and activities we liked. We got Ted's number to keep in contact after the show, where I would text him occasionally about music or a new song that came out.

 
I found out that Ted was going to the same music festival that I was later in June. As we were talking about our plans for the festival he asked me if I was going with anyone special, to which I replied yes I'm going with my BF. He didn't seem put off by that and everything in our friendship continued like normal. I went to the festival and managed to meet up with Ted for 1 of the days of the 4 day festival. He met my BF and we hung out around a stage for an afternoon, watching the show and shooting the shit. The last day of the festival my BF ate a shroom truffle that a random person he met in the forest gave him (smh). I lost contact with him that day while he was off tripping somewhere and met back up with Ted. We hung out at the festival, got front row for Tycho's set, and in general had a great time.


 Our friendship continued into my sophomore year of college. I would host parties at my house on campus, and Ted would come from where he lived (about an hour away) to come party and have a good time with our friends. Ted got along great with my whole crew, even my extended friends. I could tell he loved hanging out here, and I knew that he didn't have a group of friends back where he went to school that were as interested in music and festivals as our group. Me, Ted, and two of our others friends went to another music festival in September. Again, we had a great time. I eventually broke up with my boyfriend in October. Ted and I would still hangout, at this point I would consider him one of my best friends. He never asked me out in the time I was single, or made any moves.


In December, Ted moved to a different part of the US because he transferred colleges. Before Ted left he said something to the effect of we have a great friendship, nothing happened because I felt the timing was always off, yada yada, lets always be friends. I agreed. During the time I knew Ted, we were always strictly platonic, no hand holding, no kissing, nothing ever happened when we were drunk, no cuddling, etc. I treated him like my brother. 


Even after Ted moved, we were still pretty close. We would text pretty frequently, and sometimes call where he would give me an update on his life post-move. That next summer he came to visit me a couple times, again for a music festival. I too visited him twice that year, also for music festivals. The first time I visited him, he had a girlfriend and we went to the festival with his GF and her friend. I think they had sort of a rocky relationship, from what I could tell of the visit. I think his GF liked him more than he liked her, and they broke up a couple weeks after I left. 


The second visit, about 4 months later, he had a new GF, Rachel. This pairing seemed better and they seemed good as a couple. We went to a music festival together, me, Ted, and Rachel. We were all good until the last day of the festival. There was some drama because I won a meet &amp; greet and only took Ted with me to the meet the artist. Rachel also won a meet &amp; greet, and she took all 3 of us to meet the artist. She was only allowed to bring 3 people though because she knew the lady organizing the meet &amp; greet. I had no such pull and could only bring 1 other person. This started some sort of drama because I guess I was effectively pulling Ted and Rachel apart? While me and Ted went to the meet &amp; greet, Rachel was front row for some set, and the DJ that also she DM's on twitter sometimes kissed her cheek. This furthered the drama because then Ted was pissed at Rachel.  After this music festival drama, I left my visit while they were still fighting. Rachel's goodbye to me was very hurried and awkward. I felt kinda bad as I was leaving, but I didn't really feel like I did anything wrong so I didn't feel too bad about it. 


Fast forward to this summer, I was doing an internship in a new city, that happened to be close to where Rachel's family is from. She was staying there over the summer so we ended up meeting up a couple times to go to some concerts/clubs with DJs. We had a great time, totally bonded, and realized we had sooo much in common, down to the MMORPG we both used to be obsessed with. I was so happy that we got along because I thought yay now we can all be friends and it won't be awkward, we'll just be a big happy family. WRONG.


Ever since I hung out with Rachel 1 on 1, I get the vibe that Ted doesn't like it. After I posted a picture on Instagram of Rachel and I, Ted stopped liking my Instagram pictures, where as he used to like them all. And I know he still goes on Instagram because he still posts. I feel petty writing that as a reason, but Ted is not the kind of guy to openly air his grievances with someone. He keeps it inside and doesn't say anything to keep the peace. 


I haven't seen Ted since the time I visited him and went to the music festival with the drama. We had talked about Ted sometime visiting me in the city where I was interning (he claims its his fav city in the USA), or him visiting back home where we went to school and meeting up there. Neither of these happened and I'm honestly  hurt. It's not like he didn't have money for travel, he traveled across the continental US and went to like 3 different music festivals, all in different regions of the US. I really valued our friendship and went at lengths to keep it alive, like flying to visit him etc. Now its like he's not even trying. 


I'd really like to save this friendship, or atleast get an explanation why we don't talk anymore. Reddit, what should I do? Should I call him? Text him? I wish I could do it in person but I never see him and probably never will :(

 
  **tl;dr**: Became bestfriends with a guy, was one of my closest friends throughout college. It was platonic, but after distance because he moved and my interactions with his GF I feel that we are no longer friends. What can I do to save this friendship?"

I graduated from UC Berkeley but I feel like where I graduated from holds so little weight these days, especially in tech when everyone has fancy degrees. My resume/background isn't stellar with all these random jumpy gigs I've been doing -- and it seems that interns/new grads with all their fancy internships and extracurriculars that I am no match for are mostly what they're looking for. Getting into tech as a contractor is easy, because there's no long term commitment for the companies. How can a washed up early professional like myself with 3 years of experience basically doing nothing worth of value get noticed by large tech companies for a full time non-technical role (i.e. growth marketing or project management)? What can I start doing now or how can I jazz up my resume so that I can even get that first interview?"
52m3sb,1,2016-09-13,21 [M4F] - Starting Over,burnbabyburner69,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/52m3sb/21_m4f_starting_over/,"On September 22nd, 2036, a deep space probe was launched from Cape Canaveral. Its creators had designed it to detect supernovas in far away galaxies, but they had no idea that it's destiny laid in another direction. In order to escape the solar system, it had to use the Sun as a gravity assist. Readings taken from the probe as it circled the Sun were almost ignored completely, as many thought that the probe's sensors wouldn't read any significant information. Luckily though, a team of interns had no better work to do at the time and combed over the data as a way to keep their skills honed. One of them found an abnormal measurement and reported it to her superiors, but she got no word back about it. She figured that it must have been nothing. She was wrong. As soon as her superior looked over her discovery, he knew something was amiss. He went straight to the top and a small, top-secret task force was commissioned to investigate the measurement. A couple decades passed by before they reached their conclusion. The chemical makeup of the Sun was not nearly as stable as had been accepted for so long. The Earth didn't have billions of years left before the Sun blew up, it had hundreds.

President Alvarez had just been sworn in weeks before he was informed of the matter. While still keeping the veil of a normal presidency around him, he spent the entirety of his 8 year term researching the options that Earth had left. It was settled within a year that Earth was doomed. The Sun had reached the point of no return centuries ago and moving the Earth out of the blast radius was [out of the question](http://imgur.com/a/SIfaO).

Obviously, there had to be some kind of evacuation, but technology was extremely limited. Even when the other governments of the world were contacted, their pooled efforts could only create one spaceship that had could carry the resources necessary for sustaining life far enough away from the Sun. It wasn't all doom and gloom though. The research on designing the base accelerated quickly, and the spaceship itself was designed in less than a decade. The same probe that discovered the Sun's fatal flaw was retasked to scout out planets, and a small list of acceptable candidates was assembled quickly. Models suggested that the primary planet candidate could have its atmosphere be made breathable in less than a century and that the soil could be made farmable, though that would take a significantly longer amount of time.

All that was easy. The hard part came when it was time to select the people to fill the ark, as most of the people who knew of it called it. Some thought they should all be engineers, people who could manage the base well and troubleshoot mechanical problems the easiest. Others wanted a more balanced team that could manage all sorts of things, like the plants or the crew's health. A few politicians even suggested that the crew should be made of philosophers and artists to preserve Earth culture.

The decision was largely made for them though as two new problems surfaced. First, the cryogenics systems didn't develop as nicely as the others. Tests on people over 50 were catastrophic, with volunteers not lasting more than a few days before the tests had to be stopped for safety reasons. Further tests and calculations estimated that no one over 40 could survive the journey. To add onto the problems, volunteers with even average amounts of stress were much more likely to suffer heart attacks in their sleep state. The second problem was the elephant in the room that everyone tried to ignore for as long as possible. To continue the human race, the crew had to breed. But the ship could only hold six people, five women and one man to ensure long term species procreation. There would have to be incest just to create a third generation. Knowing that it had to be done, research was done on the science of incestuous breeding and it was found that only .0001% of the population had the genes necessary to sustain a healthy family tree.

With these two factors in mind, the most qualified candidates were identified from a short list. Most people who were involved in the decision wanted the candidates to be trained and debriefed extensively before the launch. However, the cryogenic scientists made it clear that the stress of knowing the fate of humanity was to be carried on their shoulders was far too much. The only plan that ensured the safety of the candidates was to sedate them in their sleep and put them into the cryochambers without even the slightest bit of warning or preparation.

Thousands of years later, the lights in the spaceship turned on. It had landed on the virgin planet just as the scientists and engineers designed it to. The cryochambers started their three day reanimation process, and once the crew members exited, they barely had a chance to speak to each other before a video played in the center of the room.

""Hello, I'm Dr. Baker. Welcome to Project Phoenix.""

***

This is obviously a long term prompt that will focus on breeding, and if the RP goes on for a long time, incest. However, this most likely isn't going to be a sex-focused RP. The main focus will most likely be on the characters themselves as they go through the emotions of knowing they're the last humans alive and the struggles that they'll face just to survive and deal with each other. I'm looking for realistic character development, with each one taking a different view on their situation. Breeding is the only truly necessary kink for this RP, but others can be discussed. Here's my [kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/ZTXuOUH.png) if you want to check it out. I'm always open to doing this prompt, so no matter when you're reading this, feel free to shoot me an orange envelope!"
52mdra,19,2016-09-13,"Korean business culture is disgusting, cruel, nonsensical, and petty. This company is a culture clash disaster and it's driving me insane.",CashingOutInShinjuku,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/52mdra/korean_business_culture_is_disgusting_cruel/,"Fuck you. How dare you look down on the American style of conducting business when the way you go about things is also deeply flawed. I've never seen middle aged men openly cower before their bosses like anxious teenagers at their first internship. The way they squirm and sweat is the most pitiful thing I've ever seen. It's so undignified that it disgusts me. You should see the way these grown men hop out of their desks and literally run to their boss' office when their names are barked in a cruel, emotionless monotone. ""Neeeh"" they say with great anticipation - that's Korean for ""yes (master)."" Some of these men are separated by only a few years of age, and just one level of superiority in the corporate hierarchy. Yet they address their betters as though they are peasants kneeling before a king.

Sorry but that's just not how things work in this country. We respect our leaders **more** when they're capable of treating everyone with respect. When an executive is humble and down to earth enough to have a conversation with a junior analyst, that's a good thing. Unlike you, he isn't worried about maintaining an impenetrable aura of superiority to support his authority. Americans aren't warm and friendly because we're superficial. It's all about showing people, no matter how you actually feel about them, that you respect them on some level and want to treat them well. That's a quality we value, a quality we judge people by. And that's why we think you're all uptight assholes. We go on a corporate outing, and even the most powerful American in this company is too far beneath you to share a few drinks with. We try to get to know you, and you push us away. 

And then there's the disastrous effect their obsessively collectivist mindset has on business proceedings. In the right context, emphasizing the needs of the group over the needs of the individual is undeniably a good thing. For example, Koreans don't say ""you're welcome"" in their native language, because in a sense, that's acknowledging that you feel that you deserve recognition. Instead they say ""no, no, it's not a big deal."" I think that's cool. 

What's not cool is that I'm pretty sure these crazy fuckers need documented approval from half of South Korea for EVERYTHING, all the way down to wiping their asses. And they'd probably have to wipe their boss' ass first. It's like the world is going to end if  approval isn't expressed by everyone who could possibly be affected by even the most insignificant decision, and then a few more people who have nothing to do with it whatsoever for good measure. This bullshit makes the typical corporate red tape issues exponentially worse. Email chains about tiny details are circulated for months, until someone has the fucking balls to step up and pull the trigger on a decision that should have been made by two people: the action owner and his boss. 

That's right. I said his boss. Because they're unbelievably sexist. There are around 100 people in this office and only a handful are women. Most of these corporate drones have wives but they're halfway around the world, and haven't been seen for months. Some of them even have not-so-secret american mistresses. They prioritize their careers over everything, to a point that I consider to be truly fanatical. They put their families through hell and joke about how unhappy their kids and wives are as though it's their fault. For example, even if their families have been dragged across the ocean to whatever foreign country they've been assigned to for a few years, they never see them. There is this fucked up rule that you can't leave before your boss leaves. And if he goes out drinking on the company dime, which they often do, you can't stop until your boss does. Even if he's a known alcoholic. Which they often are. So, if you're a younger employee, you're waiting for six or seven people to leave before you can. So you work a 14 hour day. And then you look down on Americans for being ""lazy"" because we do 9-5. I'm sorry we love our families. I'm sorry we have lives. 

The craziest thing though is that some of them TOOK UP SMOKING just to smoke with their bosses ten times per day. A rude bark is emitted from an office and six people materialize, having grabbed their coats and cigarettes at a moment's notice. It's so fucked. One of them told me that his wife wants him to quit... but he's afraid that he'll be fired. 

This is a rare case where I feel comfortable saying that an aspect of someone's culture is wrong and they should be ashamed of it. Seriously, all of this is just so horrible. Korean business culture is oppressive and all consuming. What a sad way to live out life. DO NOT work for a Korean company."

After a couple months of reading this sub, and doing my own research, I feel like it’s about time I put my plan up on here. Please give it a read, I know it’s long, somewhat scattered, and full of questions, but if you see any red flags or have better suggestions, please let me know. I’m really looking for a reality check here, because there’s a lot of excitement when contemplating something like this. I have a little under a year before I have to execute/commit to expatriating. Questions I am seeking answers to are in bold.




***BACKGROUND***:
I am a 28 year old male US citizen. I have been working for the past 6 years with cameras for the film/tv industry. I’ve spent most of my time at either rental houses or being on set, but everything I do involves a camera and light. I also have a 4 year BFA degree on the subject. So, that being said, I have a very specific set of skills, unfortunately, skills that really don’t work laterally for me. I can run your cameras on your film set, or I can shoot your wedding, I can even do some VFX and editing (but no professional experience in those), but if you want me to build budgets, write invoices, or code, I can’t bring much to the table. I can always learn those things, sure, but I don’t have a formal education in things like business or science. I also have no lineage to the UK that’s not 200 years old. My company is not an international company, so a transfer is not an option either. So, my only option is school.




***WHY I WANT OUT:***
Well, this past year and a half have been quite difficult for me. Long story short, I have lost my passion for my industry, and I want out of said industry. I moved coasts just to take a cushy job that gets me nowhere and doesn’t help me further myself (I actually spend most of my time getting paid while on reddit, this job is so stupid). Anyway, I feel stuck and stagnate. I feel like my only option is to go to grad school. This thought led me to do some research, and found out it would be cheaper for me to get a grad degree abroad vs. getting the same degree in my home state (we’re talking $17k vs $60k here). Plus, I never had the opportunity to study abroad when I was getting my undergrad (it was a super rigorous curriculum, there was no time for study abroad). I looked into some EU countries like Germany (I know, its practically free), but I honestly have no clue how I’d manage the culture and language. It would be a huge leap for me, and I’m not too sure I have the fortitude for a non English speaking country. So, this led me to look at schools in the UK. Programs I’m considering are *Journalism, PR, Marketing, and Advertising*. I’m looking to broaden my career options with my grad degree, hence why I’m looking at these subjects. I want a real marketable education that could work in both UK and the US if I can’t stay. **If you have any Uni recommendations, I’d love to hear them (currently speaking with Cardiff University and University of Salford)**. I’d really try to go for a degree that coincides with jobs that are on the UK shortage list, but to go from a BFA and an art profession to an Engineering MSc, might be quite the stretch. **What are your thoughts on this? Should I reconsider what I get my Master’s in if I want to get Tier 2 sponsorship?** So yeah, the main reason why I want out is to further my education, and change careers. But from a personal standpoint, I welcome the challenge of expatriating. The thought lights a fire under my ass, and its really the only thing I get excited about anymore. I have a newly found curiosity for the world, and I like the notion of becoming more of a global citizen. I want the adventure and the personal challenges that come with an endeavor like this. I just feel it’s the right direction for me and is needed to further myself.




***STRATEGY:***
As I said before, I’m going to do the Grad school route. I don’t really have marketable skills that can transfer to other industries. If there was a visa option for freelancers and film people, I guess I’d pursue that, but the only thing I’ve found is the Tier 5 visa which doesn’t set you up for a path of residency. **If you know something about visas and freelance work, please let me know**. So, here are my goals:



Get Accepted to uni **&gt;** Tier 4 Visa **&gt;** Relocate and get MA Degree **&gt;** Apply to jobs (internships?) **&gt;** Get Tier 2 sponsorship **&gt;** 5 years of work and residency **&gt;** UK citizenship **&gt;** Bask in my accomplishments!




Now, I don’t see getting into school and obtaining Tier 4 to be a difficult thing. Also, the thing I like about this strategy is that if I find the UK life doesn't work for me, I can always get my degree and bail. But if I fall in love with the culture and the UK life, well, I have three options. 1) get tier 2 sponsorship, 2) con someone into sponsoring me as their fiancé, or 3) actually fall in love with a Brit and do the whole marriage thing. Option 3 sounds grand, but lets be realistic, my only real option is tier 2 sponsorship. And this is the biggest question mark in my strategy. It seems like it’s almost an act of god to get tier 2 sponsorship. So, my strategy would be that I would have to start networking right away (if there’s one skill film/tv has taught me that transfers is my ability to network). I’m curious though, **how does networking in the UK compare to the US?** Culturally speaking, we’re pretty outgoing in the US, especially when we’re trying to sell something. We can be pretty aggressive. So, how would I approach network building in the UK? What are some good strategies for networking in the UK? I would try to get my face out there on days that I have off from school, and hit the pavement. I feel if people learn who I am, and what I can bring to the table, they would be more willing to go through the Tier 2 process for me.




Now I know my earning potential will be way less in the UK. This doesn’t really bother me because all US&gt;UK expats I’ve spoken to tell me their quality of life and work/life balance is way better than how it is in the US. Work/life balance is one of the main things I'm trying to find. It does kind of suck, though, willingly taking a huge pay cut, but that’s the price I have to pay, right? With that being said, **does having a graduate degree boost my earning potential?** Does it make me more valuable in the UK job market, or would I be fighting undergrads for the same entry level wages/jobs? Also, is it safe to assume that no UK work experience will ultimately hurt me in my hypothetical job hunt?




My last concern is the 2 months that the visa allows me after graduating (its 2 months for 10 month degrees, 4 months for 12 month degrees). I feel it puts a damper on most internship opportunities (internships in the US are usually 3 months). **Am I correct in thinking that with 2 months between graduating and visa expiration, internships are not an option?**




***BUDGET:***
I’m currently building a pre employment budget, so these things have also been considered, if you were wondering about that. I’m pretty confident I’ll be able to make this work from a financial perspective, but if you are curious, this is what I’m budgeting:

-Tuition

-Visa Fees

-Housing Fees (rent/utilities)

-Living Expenses

-Cell phone

-NHS Fees

**Am I leaving anything out for budgeting?** Are there transportation fees? Is this a significant cost of UK life?




**So, there you have it. That’s pretty much where I’m at right now. What do you see working for me? What do see not working for me? I know it’s still too early to say, but what are people theorizing about how Brexit will influence something like what I’m trying to achieve? Any and all feedback/advice is greatly appreciated.**




Thank you for reading, I know I’ve covered a lot, and asked a lot of questions, and I apologize if I come off as scattered. I just want to make sure I have all of my bases covered and have a good head on my shoulders before continuing pursuing this.

Hey there fellow engineers.

Does anyone have suggestions on what to ask recent grads applying for entry level civil engineer positions? I'm trying to think back to the day when I was the interviewee and keep thinking about

* What classes did you study?
* What software are you experienced in and at what level?
* What kind of work did you do at your internship (if you had one)?
* What specialty do you want to be in (if any)?
* Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

but beyond those, I'm at a loss. Any ideas?"
52mwrk,1,2016-09-13,F4A - Dark Journey To Fame,Undisclosed_Desires7,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/52mwrk/f4a_dark_journey_to_fame/,"Katheyn or what she preferred to be called Katy was the new intern at the company. A big industry in downtown Los Angeles that dealt with many movie, tv and rock stars. Basically, offering rich and famous people services to handle their careers while also giving fresh faced wannabes the opportunities.

Katy was one of them, a young girl that wasn't even 21 yet dreams of making it in music, becoming a world known star. She had tried numerous times and had many meetings with companies to try and get her talent across to no avail. Eventually the money she saved up from her part time job while she was in school dried up and she had to pick up a job in L.A she she thought why not a business in a similar field to her dreams.

Katy remembered when she walked into the office for the first time, people couldn't believe what she looked like and you think they would be accustomed to seeing gorgeous people all the time. She had worn a pair of red 6 inch stilettos and a tiny pencil skirt that would of been the shortest a woman could wear. Thigh high stockings that hugged tight to her legs that were held up by clasps attached to a garter belt. The tight blouse she wore strained her rather biggest assets, her double DD breasts that were pushed up in her black bra. They bounced around as she worked around the office, attracting the attention of many guys. The man Katy worked for was always delighted to see her, his eyes filling up with lust as he looked her body over before leading her into his office and shutting the door.

Katy regularly wore clothes that brung her attention, it was always another pair of 6 inch heels, short skirts and stockings accompanied by a tight low cut blouse. Guys around the office started to talk about Katy, about how they would love to ram her as she bent over their desk. Many guys often tried to get with her but she always refused.

Soon Katy developed a reputation for being a strong feminist supporter. She thought that all men were pigs for treating women as nothing more than a pair of tits and ass with a pretty face. That's how Katy felt in meetings, guys would get sidetracked around her and just stare at her boobs or ass. They wouldn't take her seriously and thought that she was just a slut. She thought that guys only chatted to her because they wanted to fuck her and weren't even calling her by name around the office, she overheard them calling her by her big tits.

Though what Katy did, didn't always match up with what she said. She would scold men for staring at her body when she wore revealing clothing everyday. She would also find every excuse to bend over to give everyone a good look at her, regularly dropping things on the ground. She would get angry at guys all the time for flirting with her as they obviously wanted to fuck her but she would flirt with guys all the time brushing her hand near their groin and giving them a sexy, sultry look as she walked away.

One day the CEO came to the office and went to a meeting room with about 30 other businessmen. They were all aged between 50-80 years old. After about an hour, Katy was called into the meeting room. Jason, a fellow coworker had a desk right in front of the room, he watched her strut in their, clad in her tight clothes. She closed the door behind her. It must of been 4 hours until the doors opened again, with the old guys walking out with satisfied looks on their faces. They talked about how great that was and how they must do it again soon. Out Katy stepped as they finally all left. Her hair was disheveled while she was fixing her rumpled blouse and rolling down her skirt while carrying her stilettos. As she walked she pulled out a curly hair from her mouth and wiped away a bit of stickiness from her lips. Going to her desk and continuing work like nothing happened.

---------------

I want this role play to involve scenarios following the womens career such as trying to break into the industry (a lot of time spent as the secretary), dealing with the sudden fame, hook ups with celebrities, sex tapes, paparazzi, fans, relationships, becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol and turning into a nymphomaniac.

The prompt above doesn't have to be the start or involved in it... just an example of some writing.

Can be different and have a male celebrity and their journey.

I want to play the males the celeb will encounter. I want someone to play the main lead which will be the young female starlet. I would love for the young starlet to be Katy Perry or Kylie Jenner but I like a lot of other celebs as well such as Taylor Swift, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande, Megan Fox, Margot Robbie, Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Alba. Though.. the female celebrity can be an original character that is made up would love her to look like Madison Ivy or Lana Rhoades though also into Lindsey Pelas, Emily Sears and Claudia Alende.

I prefer to roleplay on Google Docs and use messengers to chat and set things up such as K , skype, yahoo msger and google chat/hangouts. Want this to be a long term rp

If you are interested and wish to talk about this further send me a message. Please make your message to me detailed and include any character/ scenario ideas, which celebrities you like and what platforms you use.

P.S Also have a recent posting in which I mention all the rp's and things I'm interested in for a long term rp, so check that out if you want, particularly interested in doing a Marvel Black Widow RP or a Star Wars RP.

Just wanted to go over some updates, questions, etc.  Here we go!

- Between now and Monday (9/19), I'll be transitioning back to life at university.  This means that I'll be leaving my current internship, packing up all of my things, and moving into my apartment.  This means my availability on Reddit will be scarce.  
- Next week (9/19) is my first week back on campus and classes.  My calendar is extremely booked, and I'll be catching up on what I've missed while away.  Although my response time will be better than this week, I won't be quite back to normal yet.
- Over the next three weeks, our beloved /u/projectficm (Jordan) will be transitioning from her roll as Project Fi community manager to her dream job on another Google product team!  Don't fear though, her account will be taken over by her amazing replacement, Alena!  Maybe I'll have Alena introduce herself once she's all caught up.  :)  During the transition, I'll still sharing things very frequently from this subreddit to the team, and I'll help cover on announcements if needed.  I'll share one fun fact though:  she's been a Project Fi subscriber for over a year!

Finally, I wanted to start a discussion on our subreddit and content.  Please let me know in the comments if you're satisfied or not with the content on our subreddit.  We get PM's sometimes about concerns, so I wanted to make sure our community was happy with the way that our mod team was running things.

Only locals know about it and we rarely advertise.

Now, I'm totally new to this.  It's my third month of being a ""barista,"" and training literally consisted of ""this is latte, this is cappuccino, this is macchiato, go.""  And it seemed too simple.

Then this woman came in with 10 coffee orders and on the list was a small half cappuccino/half latte with skim.  I text my boss and save it for last while I make the other stuff.  All she tells me is that ""it's probably the same woman, it's our landlord's mother, and she only likes me.  Just put more foam than steamed milk.""
I'm already hating the woman.

So I do it and send her on her way.
The woman who I presume the order was for, was irate.  But she came back three hours later to complain.  She was shoving her coffee in my face.  She said that it didn't wake her up. She was livid.

Our small is two shots of espresso and our large is three.  I do time them out and she says that she didn't pay for two shots but four.
""Something is wrong here.""
I pulled up her receipt, and the list the intern brought over.

She complained the foam wasn't the same, and talking about the milk.  I had gone grocery shopping yesterday and confirmed that the milk was fine.  She wanted to see my manager, she was out of town.  Eventually, I just give her two shots straight without her asking, in the same cup she shoved in my face, and she seemed okay.

Still though, I really hate people who try to run you. I did it all with a smile on my face and agreed with her until she got aggressive and I showed her the receipts she ""lost."" There's only ever one person working in our shop and sometimes they get so demanding when I have to do ten different things at the same time. 

Or like today, when people bring their whole family into a place that doesn't even have a bathroom and the only tables are outside. They ordered five paninis (we have one george foreman grill and tell the customers it will be 15-20 minutes for that many sandwiches) 5 cappuccinos and 2 lattes and two  frappes one caramel and one cookies and cream (we have one blender and it's definitely a pain to clean).  In theory, it could be timed perfectly and I can get everything out in 10 minutes, possibly.  But if I get another customer, a delivery, or if they keep ordering more on the fly while I'm rushing between the back of house and front of house, it's going to take longer.  I tell them straight up everytime.

The woman who did that today never yells or says anything, but she snaps her fingers and drums on the glass case for pastries.  It physically pains me to hear it.  Like, my heart sort of constricts and I have to force myself not to roll my eyes or show some sign of irritation.  She also orders pastries on the fly as I'm trying to make her sandwiches.  She just points and says this one while my back is turned.    

We're a super casual place so I don't get mad if no one tips, but I did give this family more attention because they bought so much. Prebus the table, get them glasses of water (because they're free) hand out napkins when her baby knocks something over. Not only for the hope of a tip but because it makes my life easier when things run smoothly and there's less of a mess.

And even with a $40 tab, she tips the cash change of $0.06.

I am a 3rd year at GT, but I just switched to CS. This is my first semester taking CS classes, so I would be at the same knowledge level of a first year CS student. 

Does anyone know if I could still apply to these underclassmen internship opportunities, or am I just stuck in my situation. It doesn't really seem fair to compare me to CS majors who have been in this major for all 3 years, but maybe that's how it goes.

Thanks in advance for any insight."

I'm earning a second bachelor's degree in CS/SE, and I'm wrapping up my program at the end of the calendar year. Because it's my second bachelor's, I only had to take major courses, so I completed the program in just under two years (and only one summer). I chose to do a research project this summer instead of an internship in case I want to return to school for a Master's/PhD sometime down the line. Fortunately, the paper was accepted to a conference in the fall, and I'm in the process of finishing up an application that utilizes techniques introduced in the research to speed up a computationally intensive process used by researchers in a different field.

My goal now is to find a software engineering or programmer analyst job. I'd prefer to work for a larger firm to begin so I can learn best practices. I live in Seattle, so there are plenty of opportunities. My previous degree was in econ and I've worked in a variety of roles: journalism, marketing, IT, sales. I'm in my mid-30s now but look a bit younger.

How badly will I be dinged for not having an internship under my belt? Will employers care at all about the research? How should I include it in my resume? Do employers offer post-graduate internship programs for people in my situation, or will I be able to land with a major employer in spite of not having an internship? Anything else I should be doing to help improve my chances of landing a job when I graduate in three months?

Cheers, and thanks again for any insights you can provide."

These are all open for discussion and I have photos of how I would like your character to appear as. 

1) Aunt/Nephew - Ever since I went through puberty I've occasionally masterbated about my Aunt and her giant tits. One summer I get to stay over for a month while I intern at my new college job. What we both don't know is our mutual desire for each other. We both take secret peeks at each other in our moments of undress during the morning and night and I could've sworn I saw your reflection in the mirror when I was showering.

2) Wife's Cousin - My wife and I have no sex life at all which makes me look for hook ups at night using Tinder. One night I come across my wife's cousin's profile and against my better judgement I swipe right but to my surprise it tells me we are a match. That's where we can start from there with a simple message in the app which will lead to us meeting.

3) Cousins - We have always been close growing up and being close in age. I've always pleasured myself to you and your giant tits and loved the summer time when the clothing would be less and less showing off your ample chest. This prompt we are at a family reunion away from our hometown and we are up late drinking and smoking pot, getting our inhibitions lower and lower. We discuss our sexual history and get each other all hot before we decide to let our taboo desires become reality.

4) Older Neighbor - You've recently moved into the neighborhood after your divorce. I just finished my first semester at college and live in my parents basement during the summer. You have a direct view into our backyard and have taken a hobby of watching me work out in the early morning hours. Occasionally you ask me to help carry in groceries for you and today you ask if I could finish some yard work your landscapers forgot to finish....


Kinks include: incest, age play, oral, anal, rimming (giving &amp; recieving) sloppy kissing, spanking, dirty rough sex, lactation

Limits are toilet stuff, rape, any violence and animal stuff. 


Hope someone out there finds these interesting enough to send a message. This will always be open no matter how old the post is."

I went to college for 4 years and just graduated. My time there was actually pretty solid, I overall had friends and got good grades though with some of the harder classes I think I only succeeded because I got a shit ton of help from those around me. So fast forward to when I graduate and I'm ready to enter the workforce. I get a job at a small company in the city near I live. The first thing I notice is I'm having a lot of trouble picking up everything they're teaching, and second that I am absolutely miserable. I have done an internship and some camp work which I enjoyed so I figured it was the job. I wound up resigning from that job around 2 weeks later using an excuse that some other stuff came up (stupid I know). The resignation was not pretty and the boss had several choice words of course to say about it especially since I seemed so enthusiastic beforehand. That night I remember being in a nasty fog and depressed but that went away as I began to apply to other jobs. However as time has gone on all of my fears and negative thoughts are starting to rear their ugly head and I'm having a lot of trouble getting rid of them. I feel like I'm destined to never be happy with whatever job I get...or that I will never get one. As I watch everyone around me go on to great things, I'm stuck in a loop. Worst is I feel like whatever job I get I will not be adequate and not be able to learn it...and will struggle too keep up until I'm fired. This has put me in a depression the likes of which I have never remotely been in before. There's been a couple of days where I have thought about ending it, especially if I'm just destined to be miserable which makes me very afraid. I'm afraid that I might actually go through with it which would be the worst thing in the world to my parents who have provided me with nothing but love and support the whole time. I absolutely hate feeling this way and I want to get out of this hole. But I'm terrified that I will fail or never get the chance and if I fail I'm afraid of what could happen. Thanks for hearing me out if you got to the end."

The entire course is Matlab based, in which I have no experience and wasn't prepared for.

If I do end up withdrawing I would plan to take it next semester after a bit of preparation with Matlab. I feel like if I don't withdraw, I won't have enough time to study as hard as I'd like to for internships, which I'd like to prioritize.

Now my questions are these: 

How much will employers/recruiters care about two Ws on my transcript (I've withdrawn from a math class in the past) given my GPA is tending towards average (3.7)? Will I be okay for most competitive internships?

How important of a skill is being able to use Matlab well (Is most machine learning done in it or would I be better off trying to self study machine learning using something more familiar/coder-friendly like Python)? "

52o347,2,2016-09-13,Struggling with keto,magdalenasophie,keto,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/52o347/struggling_with_keto/,"Hi all,
 
First of all I want to say I am convinced the ketogenic diet is right for me. I am an overweight female (5'2 ~162lb) suffering from PCOS (polycystic ovaries, goes hand in hand with strong carb sensitivity). 
I have tried it earlier this summer but wasn't careful enough with my electrolytes so I ended up giving up early on. A couple of weeks ago I started again and kept a steady supply of broth and things in my pantry. I didn't get any drowsiness, I had reasonable amounts of energy and about 4 days in my keto sticks showed a pink tinge! So that was good. However I was SO hungry all the time! I had such a huge appetite it was insane and I couldn't stop stuffing my face! This happened almost every day, but even more so around days I was exercising. I wasn't even craving carbs initially, I was just eating everything keto and then after 5-6 days I craved fruit and other carbs so bad that I fell off the wagon. I think some of it was mental as well, because I had been dieting (low carb with some fruit) for a few months prior to that as well, having lost some weight, and I got sick of obsessing with food and my intake all the time. So I just caved.
I have to add that I'm going through a really stressful time at the moment as well as I am finishing an internship and applying for graduate school.
I guess what I am asking is this: 
Can keto help me stop thinking about food all the time? I obsess about it, and then I lose motivation because it just gets too tiring and takes over my life. I don't mind preparing food for the days ahead, I'm really quite organised, but it gets to the point where I start thinking about food first thing in the morning and last thing at night. I don't want this. Ideally I wish I could never think about food until my stomach rumbles and tells me I'm hungry. Can keto help with this?

How can I stop missing fruit? (I really love fruit)

Will these insane cravings stop? 
And will I lose a bunch of weight? 
I really, really, really need this to happen. I've lost about 10lb and I'm happy about that but I want to lose another 30 or so. 

I'd appreciate any experience/advice you can share. Thanks so much!


EDIT: By the way I realised that things are much better now that I'm eating more meat. Before I was eating lots of eggs and cheese and just the odd bit of bacon once in a while (because I currently dont have access to a kitchen). Has anyone noticed this too? "
52o5du,2,2016-09-13,[M4F] Lucky Tuesday Night,BreakFromReality,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/52o5du/m4f_lucky_tuesday_night/,"*(Thanks to everyone who has responded to my previous roulette posts. I've decided to retool some things, and I hope you enjoy!)*

Good evening, and welcome to DPP Casino! I'm your host, BreakFromReality, and I'll be accompanying you in your journey to find a fun, erotic roleplay.

Please check your ID with the security guard -- all potential RP partners and their characters MUST be at least 18.

So now that you're here, how do you get started?

First, you'll sit down at our [single-deck blackjack table](https://www.random.org/playing-cards/), where you'll be deciding the kinks of the RP. You'll be dealt eight starting hands of blackjack, with each total matching up with a specific kink. (For example, a 20 is for cheating.)

Here's the full list of kinks:

* 4 -- Dealer's Choice
* 5 -- Light Bondage
* 6 -- Group Sex (MFMF, MFMFMF)
* 7 -- MFM Threesome
* 8 -- FFM Threesome
* 9 -- Interracial/Raceplay
* 10 -- Anal (Woman Receiving)
* 11 -- Filmed
* 12 -- Clothed Sex
* 13 -- Dirty Talk/Name-Calling
* 14 -- Rough Sex (Hair-Pulling, Spanking, Light Choking, etc.)
* 15 -- Public Sex
* 16 -- Creampie/Risk of Impregnation
* 17 -- Facial
* 18 -- Risk of Getting Caught (i.e. ""hold the moan"")
* 19 -- Uniform/Costume
* 20 -- Cheating
* 21 -- Player's Choice

Once eight unique hands are drawn, you will choose two kinks that you would like to include in the RP. You will also eliminate two other kinks that you would not like to include. The dealer will then choose two kinks of the remaining four.

The Dealer's Choice and Player's Choice can not be excluded.

*(To play: draw 2 cards from 1 shuffled deck. Make sure all cards except jokers are included. Repeat this eight times until complete.)*

Once the kinks are decided, you'll decide if you want to stay on the main casino floor or head over to The Den. *(While I will absolutely play with everyone, those choosing to go to The Den will get VIP status.)*

If you choose the main floor, you will head to our [roulette wheel](https://www.random.org/sequences/), where you'll help decide the character you'll be playing. The women listed on the wheel will be character models only (with one exception).

The list is as follows:

* 0 -- Player's Choice of Anyone on the List
* 1 -- You, because you're always #1 at DPP Casino!
* 2 -- Bella Thorne
* 3 -- Dove Cameron
* 4 -- Laurel Coppock
* 5 -- Alison Brie
* 6 -- Kendall Jenner
* 7 -- Candice Patton
* 8 -- Margot Robbie
* 9 -- Vanessa Hudgens
* 10 -- Scarlett Johansson
* 11 -- Taylor Swift
* 12 -- Miley Cyrus
* 13 -- Ariana Grande
* 14 -- Emma Stone
* 15 -- Milana Vayntrub
* 16 -- Nina Dobrev
* 17 -- Rihanna
* 18 -- Sarah Hyland
* 19 -- Lily Aldridge
* 20 -- Mila Kunis
* 21 -- Stella Maxwell
* 22 -- Dianna Agron
* 23 -- Chloe Grace Moretz
* 24 -- Katherine McNamara
* 25 -- Victoria Justice
* 26 -- Carrie Underwood
* 27 -- Jennifer Lawrence
* 28 -- Selena Gomez
* 29 -- Emilia Clarke
* 30 -- Emily Ratajkowski
* 31 -- Meghan Markle
* 32 -- Jourdan Dunn
* 33 -- Katy Perry
* 34 -- AnnaSophia Robb
* 35 -- Nicole Beharie
* 36 -- Ariel Winter

You will spin the wheel six times (12 for two-female scenes and 18 for three-female scenes). You will then pick three characters (six for two-female scenes and nine for three-female scenes). The dealer will then choose the character he would like you to play (the Player's Choice may get excluded).

*(To play: Set the smallest value at 0 and the largest value at 36, and keep it in one column. Take the first 6/12/18 numbers in the list.)*

Finally, it's time to ""role"" the dice at the [craps table](https://www.random.org/dice/) and see just what you'll be playing. The roles are below:

* 2 -- Role Not on List
* 3 -- Coach's Daughter
* 4 -- Friend's Wife/Girlfriend
* 5 -- Student
* 6 -- Sister's/Daughter's Friend
* 7 -- Incest (Daughter, Sister, Cousin)
* 8 -- Friend's Sister/Daughter
* 9 -- Work Scenario (Secretary, Intern, Co-Worker, etc.)
* 10 -- Wife's/Girlfriend's Friend
* 11 -- Celebrity
* 12 -- Bully's/Bullying Victim's Sister

*(If Celebrity is chosen, you will be playing the actual celebrity from the wheel instead of a lookalike. For 12, I am giving the option of playing either the bullying victim's sister or an interesting revenge plot with the bully's sister.)*

You will roll the dice four times. Of the four unique roles, you will then discard one. The dealer will discard one of the remaining three, and you will then choose one (or both, if possible) of the remaining two.

*(To play: simply roll two virtual dice. Repeat until four different roles are picked.)*

After that is done, we will have the RP with the characters, roles and kinks!

Now if you choose The Den?

Here's the list of characters for the roulette wheel:

* 0 -- Player's Choice of Anyone on the List
* 1 -- You, as a woman age 40+ (if you're not one already)
* 2 -- Rena Sofer
* 3 -- Nigella Lawson
* 4 -- Christie Brinkley
* 5 -- Eva Longoria
* 6 -- Rashida Jones
* 7 -- Jane Seymour
* 8 -- Elizabeth Hurley
* 9 -- Jennifer Lopez
* 10 -- Julianna Margulies
* 11 -- Patricia Heaton
* 12 -- Cheryl Hines
* 13 -- Jordan Ladd
* 14 -- Jennifer Aniston
* 15 -- Giada de Laurentiis

* 31 -- Kim Cattrall
* 32 -- Ellen Barkin
* 33 -- Sharon Stone
* 34 -- Paula Patton
* 35 -- Mary Steenburgen
* 36 -- Courteney Cox

And here are the roles:

* 2 -- Role Not on List
* 3 -- Coach's Wife
* 4 -- Friend's Wife
* 5 -- Teacher/Principal
* 6 -- Mom's Friend
* 7 -- Incest (Mom, Aunt, Grandmother)
* 8 -- Friend's Mom
* 9 -- Work Scenario (Boss, Co-Worker, etc.)
* 10 -- Wife's Friend
* 11 -- Celebrity
* 12 -- Bully's/Bullying Victim's Mom

That does it for our tour! We can't wait to play with you, and we know you'll have a good time; others have! 

If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. And from all of us at DPP Casino, have a winning night!"

Tim Cook walks on stage to loud applause. He steps before the crowd of nerds and takes a deep breath before shouting, “Shut up! Shut the fuck up! And sit down!”

An immediate silence rips through the crowd. Bewildered reporters look at each other. Someone amongst the crowd lets out a nervous bout of laughter. Tim responds promptly with “I SAID Shut. The. Fuck. Up. Did I stutter? Not another goddamn word.” A solitary but unnecessary photographic flash is the last sign of rebellion. No one else dares to push their luck.

Wearing the expression of a man who’s one traffic jam away from annihilating his entire family, Tim raises his hand far above his head. Held within his furious grip is an iphone of some model or another. The monolithic projection screen behind him lights up without warning, a close-up view of the device enduring his crushing grasp appears for all the room may see.

Tim throws the phone to the ground. He jumps on it. He kicks it so hard that it goes flying off the stage where it hits some geek reporter in the head. A small drop of bright red blood trails down from his brow. More from hurt feelings than anything else, the reporter finds himself resisting the urge to cry, deciding to save his tears for the 101.

Tim races to the edge of the stage, just barely resisting the urge to leap into the crowd and continue his abuses. He recomposes himself with an obviously false sense of calm before whispering into his wearable microphone, “Give it back…… GIVE IT THE FUCK BACK!”

Spittle falls from his mouth.

An anonymous and shaking hand raises the phone back to Tim who wastes no time in snatching it back. He looks somewhere off stage. “Come on. Come the fuck on already.” A nervous (and faintly bruised) intern rushes on stage with a glass of water in one hand and a stool in the other. He sets one atop the other. The feed on the projection screen settles in on the glass.

Tim paces around the stool, sighing. Finally, his lips pursed, his jaw working like he’s chewing his own tongue like some men might tobacco, he whispers into the mic, “Fuck all of you,” before dropping the phone into the glass of water.

The iphone continues to operate without showing any signs of physical trauma or technical distress. The smallest amount of blood floats within the glass like red ink correcting mistakes of the past. “And what do we say to that, Siri?”

Like from the nebulous lips of a soulless woman having just learned the meaning of fear, electronic words echo from beneath the water, “Thank you, Timmy. May I please have another?”

Many wondered if the AI’s voice hadn’t actually shaken the slightest bit.

Tim looks out over the crowd. “Jobs… And all of you… Can suck my dick.”

After Tim Cook marches off the platform and kicks open the emergency exit nearest him, the stage speakers ring out one last line before being powered off: “I want my fucking stock’s worth back to what it should be before I reach my car or I’m cancelling the whole damn line.”"

One of their points under 'Qualifications' is 'Must be currently pursuing a Master's or Doctoral degree. Preferred fields of study are statistics, math, economics, or related discipline.'

This presents a few problems. Namely, that I'm a junior undergraduate studying CS.

That said, I have more experience than the typical undergrad (and, from what I've seen, the typical masters student with respect to data science). Here's what I've got going for me:

* Very proficient using Python, R, and SQL (among many other data analysis/science tools).

* Just finished a summer internship at a well-known tech company as a data science intern. Built the company's new anomaly detection system in R from the ground up and deployed it.

* Just started a fall data science internship in NYC with an e-commerce company. Will be working on customer segmentation with some SQL reports and machine learning.

* Taking two data science masters courses.

* Tutoring for a masters-level algorithms course.

I know I don't fit their exact description, but do you think I should apply anyways? I'd love to intern here and would appreciate any tips/experiences any of you have had on applying where you don't necessarily meet every single criteria.

Thanks!

1. Continue with my networking with smaller firms and try lateral to a bigger firm

So this year I was rejected from UC Berkeley, along with a number of other UCs, after applying to the college of engineering. As Berkeley was, and remains to be, my number one choice of school to pursue my career path (Electrical Engineer and Computer Science) I decided to go to community college down in SoCal at Moorpark. I have looked at the class requirements and as I understand there are certain courses I need to complete and a number that would significantly strengthen my application. My question for any transfer students currently attending Berkeley, or any students who may have any information or tips in general, is if there is anything I should be doing outside of the classes I am taking at Moorpark and hoping to get a perfect GPA in the classes I'm enrolled in. I'm currently taking some introductory C++ courses and I plan on doing some introductory Electrical Engineering and Java courses. Do you guys think getting a high GPA in these courses would give me a significant chance of transferring into Berkeley's engineering department? Would anything else be necessary? Maybe an internship or some form of involvement in an engineering would be helpful but I do not see how I could get involved in the field with such little knowledge. Any tips, recommendations, or advice is greatly appreciated. Also any advice on preparing myself for the rigorousness of the Berkeley engineering program is welcome as I am hoping to succeed during my time at Berkeley and the time thereafter. I hope to join you soon! Go Bears! (I'm putting most of my eggs into this Berkeley basket)"

I completed an internship this summer at a GC and can already sense this field isn't really for me even though I could be very good at it. I love math and science and the prospect of using both at work is exciting to me. I could spend this last year getting mechanical engineering prerequisites done and then transfer to CS Mines and do ME there. It would take me 3 extra years and cost me at most 100k in student loans. There are perks to both paths except that one is SIGNIFICANTLY more expensive and rigorous and the other would most likely be underwhelming and unfulfilling. If I did ME I would graduate at 25/26 and be suffocated with debt and possibly not even get into the industry I want to be in for another few years. If I stick with CM I can have a decent salary at 24 but I'd be pigeon holed into the construction industry and I'd have to cross my fingers that 10 years down the road I don't get hit with a wave of regret....

It was 30 minutes, we spent most of it talking about my past projects and experience. My interviewer seemed very interested the whole time. 

Then it came to a coding question, towards the end of the interview. It was a relatively simple question, and I ended up coming up with the correct solution algorithm instantly. 

I spent some time talking through my approach, and some optimizations I'd have liked to make, but I didn't realize how limited my time was, and I ended up not being able to actually fully implement it in code (there was a text editor I was supposed to type in). 

He said something along the lines of ""Oh, looks like we're running out of time - that's basically what I was looking for..."" but I remember him seeming a little less enthused after the question than he was before.

He briefly mentioned some stuff about next steps, but I was too shocked and caught off-guard to pay attention. 

I feel pretty terrible about not being able to implement the solution fast enough and think that'll reflect badly. Should I be worried about this?

Edit: He also said that my ""experience would be taken in to consideration"" - I feel as if he meant that as if he was saying it could 'make up' for poor interview performance."
52pqi4,7,2016-09-14,[How To/AMA]Driving instructor in Belgium,R3dw0lF,motobe,https://www.reddit.com/r/motobe/comments/52pqi4/how_toamadriving_instructor_in_belgium/,"A few of you were/are interested in knowing how to become a driving instructor and what not. I currently have 'brevet II (car)' and 'Brevet IV (motorcycle)'. So here's a small explanation of what to expect and how to go about it. 

There are 2 ways to become a driving instructor: self study and by taking (theory) classes in a recognized school (not persé a driving school, Syntra does classes too). What's the difference, well one's free the other you have to pay BUT you get a reduced number of intership hours you have to do. I took classes and feel like it's actually worth it. You get classes from decent teachers who explain the finer details and nuances in the laws and help you on your way. Prices vary for the classes but i recon you'll be set for 500€ or less. 

You have to pass several exams in which the classes prepare you or you can study on your own for:

* a written theory exam on the road code/law and mechanics of the vehicle you want to become instructor for (motorcycle/car/truck/bus/...)
* if you pass the written examen you get to go to the next round: an oral theory examen on the same subjects: road code/low and mechanics. This exam will go more in detail as the written exam.

If you pass both the exams you can start your internship in a local driving school, you get a document 'stage toelating' which is valid for 3 years. you have to take your final exam (more on this later) within this period or you have to do the 2 previous exams and your internship again. During the intership you have to do min 250 hours of unpaid/low paid hours (more on that later) or more depending on if you took classes or not. The internship is generally divided in phases:

* Phase 1: you follow experienced instructors and take not of how they teach, how the student responds, ... and also where to drive around for what experience/knowledge level of student.
* Phase 2: you get to teach the student but the experience instructors tags along, corrects you when wrong and gives tips and pointers where needed.
* Phase 3: You get to teach the student without anyone following you.

Depending on how good you are and if the driving school director and your mentor trust you, phase 1 and 2 can be pretty short with a minimum of i forgot how many hours. YOU have to keep track of everything btw. In most drivings schools you **don't** get paid if a licensed instructor has to accompany you, the moment you go out on your own you get paid at about 50%. 

If you've done sufficient hours of intership you can apply for your third exam: the model class. This is divided in 3 parts: 

* Here you have to draw a card and this will give you the theme of your class (each license has a specific set of classes set out that you have to be able to teach). This can be: starting/stopping, turning, parking, specific maneouvres, preparation and check up of the vehicle, ... Of this you have to do a written preparation in a certain amount of time (i think you get an hour or so) and then you have to hand everything over to the judges. 

* After the written part you have to actually teach the theme you received, you're student will be an experienced examinator playing the bad student and you will also be joined by a pedagoog looking for methodogical errors and such. 

* if you get this far there a final part: you and your judges get to go on the road. The examinator will be driving the vehicle which you want to teach. You will be following him or sitting next to him depending on the vehicle. The pedagoog will be next to you watching your every step, judging you and staring at you. The 'student' will do errors in his driving (technique and things such as speeding/wrong position/...) you have to correct him correctly. You also have to have a route prepared to take of about 30 minutes which included: zone 30, roundabouts, bigger roads, town centers, ... a bit of everything. (you have to hand in your prepared route at the start of the day. 

If you pass all these exams and steps then and only then you get to receive your license and work at a licensed driving school. 
For my first license (car) i started taking classes in September 2011 and received my license a year later in October 2012. Mind you i have a full time job so i did take about 3 - 4 months to complete my internship and apply for the 'model class'.  For motorcycle it also took me about a year as it take me longer to reach my intership hours (weather conditions/...). I never failed an exam (yet) so i didn't have to retake an exam, but quite a few have to retake certain exams. 

**important notice: for motorcycle instructor you have to take a 4 day course on motorcycle driving and how to teach driving a motorcycle. This is pricey but if you're lucky and already have contacts/work in a driving school they may pay it for you (they did in my case as i already worked there as car driving instructor). I think it's about 600-700€ depending on certain factors.**

Another important factor : pay. You won't get rich teaching. We have a fixed income so you can't ask for a raise. The pay is fixed by the goverment and at the moment is around 13,96€ per hour (gross :-( so take into account taxes you might get 10€ or something like that). People with the license to teach theory classes get extra (about 14,18€/h or something similar)

**Why do i do it?**
I like the social contact with people from all types of classes/types/... and interacting with them AND trying to get through to them so they can actually learn something. Not everybody picks stuff up at the same pace and with the same explanations. How you teach will change how they learn and how fast they learn. 

When I started I had a lonely desk job with few social contacts and this was a welcome change. Now it's more like a (badly) paid hobby. I already work full time at my regular job (40 hours min. per week) and do about 6 - 10 hours per week. (some weeks more, some weeks less depending on my personal schedule). In my time of it may go to 20-26 hours per week. Depending on the month i earn about 200 - 500€ on top of my regular wage which is a nice extra. 

Personally i wouldn't do it full time as i think it'll get boring too fast too furious/soon but well that's just my opinion. It's also my back up plan for when i should loose my regular job, i'm pretty sure i can get full time at the school where i work pretty soon. 

During 2016/2017 I will study and try and get a new drivers license and then my 'brevet/license V' for teaching trucks (C+E) so i have to take the written and oral exams, intership and the model class. In time I might actually try to get my 'Brevet III theory' and 'Brevet I (director)' which would allow me to start my own driving school (never say never).
I also take courses 'bochtenstages' and such once in a while to improve my own level (never good enough) and perhaps I might do stuff like that on my own in the (distant) future. At the moment my own level isn't good enough in my opinion. 

*side note: legislation concerning the procedure has slightly changed since i started so (more internship hours than when i started) the hours i stated above should be correct. I think...*

So if you've got any remarks/questions or whatever: ask away! (people who want to take private classes pm me ;-))

1. Sucky Job Market

Most of my 20-something and 30-something-yr-old artsy fartsy friends (and myself included), have notoriously been stuck in the same, lowdown-dirty-shame situation for some period of years. The 9-5 hustle-bustle. That is, until we're somehow able to ""break free"" Ariana Grande-style, and say ""goodbye"" to the 9-5s and ""hello"" to hopefully anything else. And I do mean mostly ANYthing. There's a few reasons why this issue has been a one-way ticket to struggleville for this generation.

Unfortunately, many of us went to school with high hopes of successfully migrating into the real world. And this, after 4 years of arduous work at a University or 2 years at a mediocre community college for a creative degree, where mom and dad could comfortably helicopter-parent us to a fiery, WWE choke-hold-like, christian-summer-camp-similar death. All that, only to find out that the jobs we could seriously qualify for, were ones that were already taken by those that were fortunate and unfortunate enough to precede us. 


The skills we amassed while in our utopic collegic land, were nothing short of $100,000+ worth of mostly-empty promises of an okay to moderately-okay 3 person, 1BR, 1Bath, 1 disreputable landlord kind of life. The inevitable is that most of us would end up on our parents couches or some fratty parallel version of that, directly after graduation; maybe slumming it for 6 months to a year, and sending out literally (I know) hundreds of jobs applications and resumes to places where we don't even know what we'd actually be doing, but we do it anyway. Then once we get that prized internship or coveted entry-level position where there are ""opportunities to grow with an upbeat, budding company"", you realize the fullest extent of your dead-end situation. You continuously push toward management opportunities and you're fought with, ""Yeah, don't expect to really 'grow' here. This isn't that kind of place."" I was literally told that once at a job a few years ago - how reassuring! And this is after you've sweated out half of your 2010s businessperson, ""I'm a go-getter"" haircut, and invested several months of no-sleep, early days, late days, weekends, and little-to-no social life into a job where you will never be anything more than the youngling that should be ""thankful to have a job"". Sounds oddly familiar to that 4 years and $100,000+ right?! In no way would I expect to plunge into the CEO's chair and expect to run the company. Duh. However, I take issue with the fact that once you're in, you're just in. And there's basically no chance to move up and better yourself in hopes of being financially okay one day.

2. Short Attention Sp- Ooh a butterfly!

Our attention spans are much shorter these days, and therefore dead-end jobs lack the ability to even remotely stimulate us. We end up becoming robots in the same system we've been trying to win over for years. Several years ago, very quickly after starting a soul-sucking job in customer service (I know, we've ALL been there.), I realized the fullest extent of the suckage that is what we call our current job market. But not to be a completely entitled millennial, there were perks. It was cushy. There was a nice 9am-10am window for arrival-time in the mornings. There was a fully stocked kitchen, with TONS of snacks,  juices, breads, candies, you name it, it was there. And if it wasn't there, don't fret. It would be budgeted into the list of kitchen snacks for the next month. I love apple juice! Yeee!

Yes, it was nice. Really nice. But the truth was, none of that cushy, snacky, juicy beautifulness overshadowed the fact that I was still working a dead-end, not-movin-up-to-the-east-side kinda job. Daily, I'd come in, chat over coffee for maybe 10 min while I wipe the sleep out of my eyes, then plop myself onto the same office chair where I did the same old tired a** thing. Every. Day. All. Day. -Talk to disgruntled customers, and manage to make them even more disgruntled by the end our transaction. There's no denying the fact that this job required little-to-no brain power or creative bone in one's body, and boy did I lose sleep when I seriously became aware of my empty reality.

3. Rock-a-bye bae-bae.

Here's my truth. Baby Boomers and Generation Y say that as millennials, we're entitled. While that can be debated, many of them fail to note the fact that many of us millennials were coddled by parents, and given a false sense of reality by the educational system, in hopes that it would in fact become our reality. We were told that we'd have a fighting chance in this wishy/washy economy and flighty job market. However, they were only partially correct in that notion. Im speaking specifically to the creatives. Creatives in this day and age have more than ever, much more and much less of chance to be successful in a field centered around creativity. Our school system didn't do the best with letting us know all this. Let me explain.

4. Oversaturation - Eek!

Honestly, there's an abundance of ""creatives"" out there, and the job-market has simply become over-saturated where creatives were thought to have previously been able to flourish. Not to deny the fact that previous generations had their own list of struggles, but an oversaturated market tended to not be one of them. Social media has become our best friend, and also the bane of a 21st century creative's existence. Feel free to jump on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, or any other social media outlet of your choice. You'll find the singer, the writer, the MUA (Make-Up Artist), the hairstylist, or some other type of ""guru"" that has managed to pop open a YouTube channel in 5 min, garner ""followers"" with a less-awesome version of what once was greatness. Taking the internets by storm! Nuuuuuuuuuuuu!

We're forced to compete with an entirely new, very complex market. One, where someone can technically be less-skilled, however just their presence can taint and oversaturate the creative market for the remaining persons on the same plane. Thus, making it extremely difficult to nearly impossible to be recognized for creative talents, and therefore making an attempt to make money and become successful in our respective fields, more of a foolish ambition, rather than an embodiment of a dream. 

5. Liar, Liar, Pants are gently smoldering.

To put it bluntly, we were told that we were special. EVERYONE LIED. They lied terribly -in jest. The truth is, is everyone different? Yes. But a better question to ask is, ""How different are you from the remaining billions of people that currently inhabit the Earth? Not to mention the estimated 108 billionpeople that have ever lived (that we know of). Each with their own set of skills, abilities, and talents. The answer to the latter question becomes much more complex.

Regarding physical appearance, most of us, have similar features. 10 fingers, 10 toes. All the parts of the ""Heads, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes"" song, etc.- Not to discredit anyone that does not fall comfortably into those bounds.

As a species, we are sentient and emotionally complex. Maybe regrettably, we have more in common with our fellow brother or sister human, than not. We get mad when someone pushes us down. We get sad when someone we love dies. We get happy when we see a person we care about. We get annoyed when we see a person we're not such huge fans of. -Looking at you, Becca.

All in all, we have lots of differences, but way more similarities. General abilities to do a widespread amount of things, fairly well. See the problem here? We end up being very similar, and therefore diminishing the rumors of uniqueness we've been fed all these years. This notion so carefully bleeds into our creativity and our ideas of such. Yes, you can sing, but do you sing well? Or better yet, do you sing better than a large percentage of people? And who is the audience? Are they qualified to deem such? Do I believe art is mostly subjective? Yes. However, there are some basic principles that can also be used to state that scientifically, a persons artistic abilities will be more favored by a larger number of peers, than maybe another. This idea is not concrete however, and there are some exceptions that simply do not fit the mold. 

In any case, We all assume we're this special, amazing, extraordinary, larger-than-life human being, that the world is simply waiting to experience. And in this day and age, because of the interwebz, everyone can show everyone else just how ""special"" they think they are all the time. In reality, statistically you are most-likely more average, normal, boring, and not really larger-than-life than you think.  But you most definitely are special to a few people on this Earth, and that's important. Seriously, all sarcasm aside, you are important to someone. Just maybe not the entire world though.

So, this is root of my exhaustion. - Having spent the last 5-8 years after high school trying to become a successful creative in the job market I was introduced into as a budding 20-something, *Throws temper-tantrum* because frustration.

Realizing only now, that those dreams of being a truly successful creative, are still very valid. However there is much we haven't learned. Only on this journey, am I figuring out all the quirks of trying to become a successful creative in the business world. But that's just life for anyone trying to do something, or be someone larger than life I guess, right?

Despite everything, go for your dreams and strive to actually BE one of those larger-than-life creative people. It doesn't hurt to try. I look to my spirit animal, Tina Fey, for inspiration on melancholy days like these. Her, and also several pounds of processed meats and cheeses, and refined sugars that reside within arms reach of wherever I am stationed in my apartment. 

On a positive note, as a creative millennial group, we are first and foremost, dreamers. I love that about us. Preceding generations will probably continue to call us crazy, naive, entitled, pretentious, and a whole laundry-list of other negatively descriptive adjectives. But, with the same breath, we are us. And we will always be us. There's room out there for us in the deep vacuums of the job-market. Guess it's time we all become CEOs and start creating the jobs where we see deficits. Hmmm... *Signs off*"
52qo3v,32,2016-09-14,"[Advice] Thank you, /GetDisciplined",Chadakoo,getdisciplined,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/52qo3v/advice_thank_you_getdisciplined/,"Hello,

I would just like to thank this community for what could possibly have been a major turning point in my life.

For some background I am a college student in the U.S. at my second institution (was kicked out from the first after being placed on academic probation for poor grades), who has taken a passive approach to everything about his life, until fairly recently. I was overweight, lazy, chronically unproductive, and on what seemed like a beeline path for being a disaster in all aspects of my life.

I have made drastic changes in a short time period, and while I know many say to make one change at a time, I have decided to just dive in and see what happens, as I do not think I have ever tried any self improvement on my real self. (I have been surprisingly motivated to improve my digital characters, however).

As a computer science student with no extra projects or internships to his name (which /r/cscareerquestions would make out to be a cardinal sin), I decided to begin making Android applications so that I may have some resume fodder, learn a popular, in demand skill (or start to learn it, I am definitely a rookie still, and will be for some time), and not spend another summer in front of video games (&gt;3000 hrs in Dota 2, probably a similar amount in HS, &gt;500 days in WoW). During this time I have also begun exercising regularly (it wasn’t much, however I followed one of the guides on /Fitness and did what I could.) and watching what I eat much more carefully. Gone are the days of drinking soda and eating frozen pizza’s almost daily.

Thus far I have lost 14lbs of weight, and while I don’t think I look or feel different I am sure that the change will come as long as I am consistent. The one thing I have noticed is that I do feel ‘jigglier’, which other people seem too as well when losing weight so that’s okay.

Thanks to the resources provided by reddit (specifically /GetMotivated, /GetDisciplined /depression, /Fitness, /learnprogramming, /u/TheCourageWolf’s posts, as well as a few others.) 

While the apps I made aren’t much (and likely will be inconsequential), the habits I developed and work ethic that I displayed, if carried forth, will definitely set me up for success in the future and I am certain I will be able to secure an internship for next summer.

Changes I have made:

-	2 hours of video games per day, MAX (While this seems like much I was playing north of 10 hours a day.

-	Follow C5K running program (https://www.reddit.com/r/C25K/)

-	Follow Starting Strength fitness program (fortunately my stepfather had a lot of the equipment lying around as I could not afford a gym)

-	Cut out soda/energy drinks on weekdays

-	Cut out pizza on weekdays


I am not comfortable posting progress pics, yet, but I guess I just wanted to make this post to thank everyone in these communities for their help, motivation, and kind words. Seeing all of the other people in similar situations as yourself makes you feel less socially isolated and as part of something bigger, which I think every human craves.

52qtat,2,2016-09-14,"Me [20 M] with my gf [20F] of 2 years, cut me out of her life in 2 days.",LazerhamLinkon,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/52qtat/me_20_m_with_my_gf_20f_of_2_years_cut_me_out_of/,"Me and my girlfriend ""Sally"" had been dating for a little over two years. We started our summer just after high school and agreed to a long distance relationship when we went to college. She was on the east coast, while I was in Ohio. We managed to make it work by flying out to one another every so often and the relationship was everything and more. That summer after college was also great as we were back in our home town again. She even agreed to transfer to my college next year which made me the happiest man alive.


Sophomore year of college everything was smooth sailing until a few months in. I noticed she rarely wanted to go out with me and stopped initiating sex with me. She also got very shy towards showing public affection; granted I wasn't asking for full on sex in the parking lot but a kiss goodbye after i drop her off at work didn't seem like much for me. I told her these things were hurting me, and because I felt like she didn't want me, I started questioning my feelings. She obviously was sad but promised me that she'd work on it and low and behold we communicated and conquered an obstacle in our relationship! We even both decided to join a fraternity and a sorority to go out more and meet new people. I was 100% happy with where we were at and we even started to go out more.


Fast forward to this summer 2016, we finish our Sophomore year at college and I'm looking forward to another fantastic summer with my gal pal. One striking issue is the fact that she kinda lost all of her hometown friends... whether it be to internships cross country, sororities down south, or just lost communication. She always had a few close friends but it seemed like they just up and vanished which made Sally quite sad. Shed always talk about how she cant make friends, how no one likes her except me etc. and because of this we would always hang out, borderline 4-5 times a week. But hey I loved this girl, Id invite her out with my friends and always tried to include her in everything I did to which she happily obliged. Then it happened...we went back to school just this past week.


Sally didn't get tickets to our first football game the next day, and I was searching for some across campus. I called her 4 times with possible tickets but she never answered to which I was pretty disappointed. When she did finally answer she called me screaming at me, saying I should have known she was with her sorority friends before the game, she went as far to call me a clingy crazy boyfriend, and said that she needed space and time to think about this ""ordeal"". This kinda shattered my life at this point. This girl is the most low key, kind loving girl in my life and I felt like I just got smacked in the mouth by her. I put it off as she was having a bad day, and tried to work things out with her.


I talked to her the next day about the fight and she immediately started crying about how she needs to find herself, and she doesn't know who she is. I started asking her what that meant, and she just answered that she is not her own person anymore. I asked how I could help, told her that we could work together to find herself, but she went on to say that she ""may"" be able to see me ONCE a week when we live a ten minute walk away from one another. At this point I was losing hope, so i took her out to dinner and tried to freshen things up. We had a good night, loving sex, and a good talk, in which she admitted she needed to slow down, I was at ease for the time being.


Then all shit went to hell. We texted every day before this matter, she then didn't answer me for a day, and with a one word answer at that. I asked her to watch the stars on a football field, and she said she actually was baking cookies for another dude at his house. She said shed be back at 10pm and maybe we could...she got back at 2am. After 3 days of fighting she then told me her feelings changed for me. I broke up with her because of the pain she was putting me through, not because I wanted to. I still love her and we haven't talked for about 6 days. What the hell happened reddit? Sally turned into a new person that cut me out of her life in 2 days time. How is a human being capable of doing that to someone they love? And if she didn't love love me why was she so selfish about not telling me and putting me through this. Just feeling lost. Supposedly she already got with another guy as well.

  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My girlfriend changed when we went back to college one year in strange fashion and cut me out of her life after i did everything to include her.  "

I managed to get my break in south coast when a student turned his nose up a job (an intern position) so I took it up albeit I was a graduate.  That was a pretty luck break during the sub prime housing/finance market crash in US.
52qxwq,0,2016-09-14,"Me [20 F] with my BF [20 M] 2 months, I broke things off, but I'm very concerned about him and the aftermath",Bibi53,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/52qxwq/me_20_f_with_my_bf_20_m_2_months_i_broke_things/,"We only dated for 2 months; but we were exclusive and serious. A few days ago he started to ignore me for 2 days, after he mentioned discussing some baggage from a previous relationship. Then, he finally says he was going to call me; instead I receive this long text about how he has strong feelings for his ex (despite the fact that she ""f*cked him up""). Additionally, he did mention that he want to continue things with me. I told him that I don't want to see him again, since he is talking to her and accidentally sent me an ""I love you too"" text intended for his ex.

Now, I still care about him very much. But, I definitively don't want to pursue a romantic relationship anymore. I understand that it would not be a healthy relationship, since I wouldn't be able to trust him.

I'm mostly worried about him, because he is still talking to his ex (which seems to be toxic), has very low self-esteem, and has trouble dealing with his emotions. For instance, he would name call himself (sometimes in a joking manner); but it was still sad. One time he got into an argument with his parents about him not doing much for an internship, so he went to a friend's house and drank.

I was thinking about meeting him in person to discuss this break up better rather than through text. Furthermore, I still want to be a friend, since we have mutual friends, will run into each other frequently, and help him heal.

Lastly, this is my first serious relationship and rather brief. I'm wondering if this too naive of me to do. 

  **tl;dr** Should I suggest having an in person conversation with him to discuss the break up better and share my thoughts and worries, like a friend would have."

The work would include two parts: (1) analysis of existing media coverage of global catastrophic risk and (2) formulation of strategy for media engagement by GCRI and our colleagues. The intern may also have opportunities to get involved in other aspects of GCRI.

All aspects of global catastrophic risk would be covered. Emphasis would be placed on GCRI’s areas of focus, including nuclear war and artificial intelligence. Additional emphasis could be placed on topics of personal interest to the intern, potentially including (but not limited to) climate change, other global environmental threats, pandemics, biotechnology risks, asteroid collision, etc.

The ideal candidate is a student or early-career professional seeking a career at the intersection of global catastrophic risk and the media. Career directions could include journalism, public relations, advertising, or academic research in related social science disciplines. Candidates seeking other career directions would also be considered, especially if they see value in media experience. However, we have a strong preference for candidates intending a career on global catastrophic risk.

The position is unpaid. The intern would receive opportunities for professional development, networking, and publication. GCRI is keen to see the intern benefit professionally from this position and will work with the intern to ensure that this happens. This is not a menial labor activity, but instead is one that offers many opportunities for enrichment.

A commitment of at least 10 hours per month is expected. Preference will be given to candidates able to make a larger time commitment. The position will begin during August-September 2016. The position will run for three months and may be extended pending satisfactory performance.

The position has no geographic constraint. The intern can work from anywhere in the world. GCRI has some preference for candidates from American time zones, but we regularly work with people from around the world. GCRI cannot provide any relocation assistance.

Candidates from underrepresented demographic groups are especially encouraged to apply.

Applications will be considered on an ongoing basis until 30 September, 2016.

To apply, please send the following to Robert de Neufville (robert [at] gcrinstitute.org):

* A cover letter introducing yourself and explaining your interest in the position. Please include a description of your intended career direction and how it would benefit from media experience on global catastrophic risk. Please also describe the time commitment you would be able to make.

* A resume or curriculum vitae.

52rpji,10,2016-09-14,Rare for freshman to get internships?,throwawaycauseprep,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/52rpji/rare_for_freshman_to_get_internships/,"My school just recently had a career fair with hundreds of employers, and I was really excited to go. I was looking forward to getting an internship for the summer instead of working at the restaurant I normally would work at. I had a resume prepared, reviewed by one of the career counselors, I looked up which companies would be there, I got all dressed up and such, but when I got there, half of the employers said they didn't offer anything for freshman. Not sure if this is relevant, but my major is computer science, so I was mainly looking for companies that would be relevant to my major. I guess I should have been open to other options, but that ship has sailed. So, here are my main questions: Is it rare for freshmen (especially in CS) to get an internship? What would you recommend for me to make myself more marketable? How is this going to affect me when applying for an internship sophomore year?"

I was so hopeful and eager to start, get good grades, and continue on after to med school and hopefully one day be a surgeon. It's something I've always been interested in, I've done internships and what not and nothing really gets me as excited as learning about the human body and being able to first hand fix it's issues. Of course I still know nothing about it but it's what I have my eyes set on. 
Fall quarter last year I was septic, on and off antibiotics and pretty much sick the entire time. I wasn't able to put school first and I got the flu at the very end which then caused me to be bedridden all of winter break. I should have known at this point that taking a quarter off would be beneficial but I wanted to power through and not miss any school. 
I ended up being hospitalized again and was just so distracted that once again I got terrible grades. Spring quarter was a new turn, but I had no study skills yet and it was pretty much my learning how to deal with college stress quarter so my grades were solid b's, but obviously not what is needed for med school. 
I now have a 2.85 GPA going into my sophomore year and I will be starting bio classes (something I am actually interested in and enjoy studying, whereas the chemistry classes I took freshman year I was not interested in and have never clicked for me) and I do not know what to do. I can't guarantee myself A's for the rest of my college career obviously, but my work ethic has drastically improved and I know I will put the work in at least. But med school needs a 3.7 GPA (bare minimum) and I just do not know if by the end of senior year I will be able to get it up that much. What do I do? I don't even know if it's possible to get it up that much after such a terrible first year and I feel stuck thinking that I might have thrown my dream out the window because of a bad first year."
52rqtm,6,2016-09-14,Unhappy in engineering,Lvutera,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/52rqtm/unhappy_in_engineering/,"I'm a 1st semester Junior in Mechanical Engineering and I'm coming to a realization now that I really don't enjoy anything I'm doing at school. Not a single class interests me and regardless of how much time I've been putting in or help I receive I still come up short. My entrance to major classes were already hard (Calc 1-3, Diff EQ, etc.) and for some reason my head has been up my ass thinking it would be easier. At the heart of it all at the end of all of it I'm tired of my major's extraneous classes (endless bunch of non ME classes that I do terribly in) and I don't get anything out of it and after having done an internship over the summer it doesn't really seem too exciting. The ideal engineering jobs are the ones that you need a straight up PhD for but right now that isn't even on the table.

So really I'm just coming to my wits and realizing that I've been genuinely unhappy for the last 2 years. I've reached a point where I don't really care how happy I am when I get out of school because right now I feel like crap with what I'm doing. Shitty thing is I have no idea where to go from here. A junior with a bunch of engineering credits doesn't let me move around too much. I'm also mad at myself for not realizing this sooner. 

Maybe I'm just not trying hard enough but regardless the stress really starts getting to me after a while. And I guess at it's worst I fail in a blaze of engineering glory. So really I guess I'm asking the gigantic question of how do I stay happy in engineering?"

I start my first programming job next week. It's a junior position with a Healthcare IT firm (not Epic). As the start date gets closer I'm starting to lose it a little bit, racking my brain just thinking of all the ""what if"" horror scenarios.

What if they're expecting more than I can deliver? What if I'm nervous and awkward around people? What if I get fired in a week or a month or two or three months? I just signed a one year lease, I'd be completely SOL if that happened. 

I looked at the LinkedIn pages for people in similar positions at this company and they all just have so much more experience and knowledge than I do. They have research projects and internships from school that I don't have. I'm a Java programmer up until now, the job is in C#. I think what is contributing to the anxiety is that they didn't make me whiteboard or anything in the interview, so I feel like they don't know I'm under-qualified.

I know these worries are not productive, but it's all I can think of. If anyone here has gone through a similar thing, how do you fight through it and not sabotage yourself with these negative thoughts?"

I already feel awful because the third year group games project and other modules looked like fun and I wanted to work on it alongside my friends. Now I'm thinking of shortening my 4 year MEng to a 3 year BSc, where I'll be doing an individual project instead of the group one.

I'm thinking of applying to some internships and such, as a kinda last minute sandwich course, but I'm not sure how many would like a failing student. Well, if I pass my resit and push for a 62 average in third year I can still get a 2:1. But regardless, most people would've applied last year for a year in industry. 

What other options could you guys suggest? I'm really lost right now and I don't know anyone in the same boat as me, as my friends are all first rate students.

52sh4k,3,2016-09-14,Starting a new job in Data Analysis tomorrow. Options?,DirtyStanBoozie,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/52sh4k/starting_a_new_job_in_data_analysis_tomorrow/,"Hey everyone.

A little about myself: I graduated about 9 months ago with a degree in Finance. Initially I struggled to find work, and I came into a wonderful internship opportunity that really opened some doors for me as far as furthering my career. As the internship was finishing up, I found myself speaking with a contracting firm that wanted me to place me in Data Analysis role within the healthcare field.

So, I became interested and intrigued by the opportunity, and decided to take it. It is a six month contract, and after asking around the office on the day of my interview, a lot of people get hired full time afterwards. Of course, a little part of my brain is already thinking about what I will do afterwards should it not work out/not the type of work that I want to get into. It all seems like somewhat of an opportunity to get a taste of the business.

My thinking is basically this: experience in anything is good for me where I am currently. That is the bottom line, and I will take all the chances to gather more knowledge at the cost of my time as I can. However, if I am not careful, this role could easily shift my relevant experience to something outside of Finance could it not? It is all about how I can form the work I will be doing to be relevant to any job in the future, but at the very base of it all, this job seems to have an IT flavor.

At this point, I do not know what it is that I want to do more. There is part of me that says ""You have spent the last half decade of your life doing what you can to get your life on the path that you are on. Why would you walk away from that?"" But at the same time, I am interested in IT and the lifestyle that it supposedly has. I am not opposed to working 60 hour work weeks, but the 40-45 hour weeks in IT surely isn't a negative. The negative of the IT option is that I will have to start over from nearly scratch. I will do what it takes to be successful in the industry if that's what it comes to and it's what I want to do, whether that be make new friends inside the field, teach myself programming languages, whatever. It really does not matter, but as I said before, I will have pretty much ""wasted"" my entire collegiate career before I even really got started. That seems kind of silly to me.

I have had big plans for myself and my future -- it's always been work for a couple of years and get a good base of knowledge, go back to school, get sought after certs (CPA most likely) become a manager, controller, exec, etc. Now how I get there is suddenly unclear to me. Before, it was always going from Point A to Point B to Point C to Point D and THEN, I will have made it. I should have known that wasn't realistic.

Life is exciting. I am finding comfort in the uncertainty. I will accomplish what I want to either way, so a big part of what I need to do is to do the best that I can in any circumstance, and set myself up for the next step, skip, or hop that comes my way."
52sll2,5,2016-09-14,Learning programming on my own. How early should I start applying for internships?,marbles12,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/52sll2/learning_programming_on_my_own_how_early_should_i/,"Hey all, 

So I'm teaching myself programming through Odin Project (focuses on Ruby on Rails). I just got through the HTML/CSS section and the JavaScript/JQuery section and started the Ruby section. 

I think it's still waaay to early to even think about applying anywhere with my current knowledge/experience but I do have a goal of getting and internship sometime in the Spring next year, so that gives me another 5-6 months of learning. 

Even though I think it's too early to apply, I'm assuming it takes time to land anything. Specially for a 26 year old with a B.A. on Psychology, so maybe I should consider applying now and seeing what happens.

I already have a Github account with 2 mini projects in there and it will be filling up with more projects as I progress through Odin. So that'll help with my resume but still, is it too early to apply to internships?

At what point do you think I should even consider sending applications? Is it risky to apply to a company and try re-applying later if I get rejected?

Any thoughts and suggestions are very appreciated.

52spof,2,2016-09-14,I [28/M] feel obligated to stay with her [26/F] because she hosted me during the summer and host her back.,yawaworhteht1234,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/52spof/i_28m_feel_obligated_to_stay_with_her_26f_because/,"I [28/M] have been dating my girlfriend [26/F] for 7 months. We are having a long distance relationship and we live in different countries. I finished my internship this June (yes, I know I'm old for internships), and my permanent job didn't start until end of August, so I had the summer free. I spent the summer with my gf who lives in her own apartment. She's still studying so also her summer was free, apart from 1 exam. We also made two trips during the summer, and I went back home 1 time (by myself, since it was an emergency and it's expensive), so we weren't all the time at her apartment, but we were together, nevertheless. 

I've never lived with any of my SOs before, so this was new for me. After a few weeks, we both started feeling the pressure of living with one another and there was a lot of tension. From my side, I like having a personal space, and some hours a day of just me doing my stuff without being bored. For her, our daily habits didn't match that well i.e. sleeping schedule, eating habits, day to day activities. You get the idea. After a while, we talked about it and we solved the tension. But despite that, I kept feeling that my end of the relationship was deteriorating. She changed her way of behaving in a relationship, at first she was more playful and teasing, a little emotion here and there, but everything felt ""fresh"". And I liked that. Now, she is more attached, and wants me to be sweet all the time, and saying sweet things and what not. I tried telling her that I didn't like it, but she was not very receptive and told me that I was cold, even though she said she used to be cold like this in her relationships.

Then, we had some problem with sex, since at the beginning we were doing it nonstop and after some weeks, I was not horny all the time, so we took it down to 1 daily and she was not very happy, and sometimes it felt like a chore. I started losing attraction to her the more time I spent there, and also started developing a kind of cold attitude regarding feelings. At first, the I love you's came easily and after a while, I didn't feel them so much. In the last weeks, I was really looking forward to come back and just be by myself, decide what to do by my own, what to eat, when/where to go out, etc. She was sad that I was going back home and I was not that sad. When I came back, the texting was not the same or we were not constantly looking to Skype. 

The point of all this is that in December she graduates and I will have my Christmas break, and she would like to go with me to my hometown and spend it there, or at least we talked about this during the summer. The problem is that we should be buying the tickets soon so they are cheaper, but I don't know if the relationship will last until that time. I feel obligated since she hosted me all summer, I should host her on Christmas and also show her around like she did. I also feel that if I break up with her, she will think that I just used her as a summer love and now I'm done. I've told myself that I should try to put myself in the relationship and make it work to December (maybe she did the same in the summer?), and then see what happens after. Note, that I would love to bring her home, and I don't doubt that it will be a fun time regardless of the state of the relationship. I care a lot about her, and she is having a rough patch right now with school and family, and I don't want to add an asshole boyfriend or a break-up to that.

She's coming to visit in the next weeks, so I thought I should talk to her about how I feel, but I don't know how to explain myself since sometimes I've said things the wrong way and ended up making things worse. Also, should I talk to her at the beginning of her visit or at the end? Should I tell her about this before? 

------

TLDR: My girlfriend hosted me almost the whole summer in her apartment during my job break, we talked about spending Christmas break in my hometown, and now I feel obligated to do so, even though I am not really sure about the relationship. She is going through a rough patch with school and family and I don't know what's the right thing to do."
52stwg,1,2016-09-14,I Hate Being A Lawyer. Enter: My Exit Plan.,UnemployedJD,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/52stwg/i_hate_being_a_lawyer_enter_my_exit_plan/,"To get all the way out on top – mired in adult responsibilities like rent and car payments – and THEN to realize that you want a complete change in direction – is completely horrifying. 

Since other lawyers or law students will inevitably ask about these things, here is the basic picture. I turn 30 in two weeks. I have a JD and went to a Top-20 undergrad for a liberal arts degree. I passed the California bar exam. I got B grades in law school, was an editor on a journal, won a few moot court competitions and other awards, and did a lot of public service internships. I have two years of public interest law experience vis-a-vis internships. I've got 2.5 years of experience as an associate. All in all, my resume sits somewhere in the proverbial pile between lukewarm mediocrity and slightly above average. 

Before law school, I had a wide variety of customer service jobs, some with managerial titles. I worked through school and never accumulated debt until I went to law school. Bonus – community college and my public university were very, very cheap.

I don't have any kids, mortgages, or any other sort of responsibilities aside from a small car loan and Fedloan law school debt. Luckily, every square inch of my $150k law school debt is eligible for IBR/reduced repayment plans and the 25-year forgiveness mark, as well as low interest rates. I pay $200-400 a month or so for these, less (or nothing) if under/unemployed. It’s safe to say that, but for the expensive city I live in, I would be very OK with making very little money.

Perhaps most importantly, I have little if any desire to have a mortgage, kids, or much by way of material things at all. I grew up poor, which shaped my idea of financial success as a relatively low bar of comfortable sustenance a few notches above my childhood station. My financial dream always consisted of being my own boss and making just enough to fund the next adventure; money was a means, not an end goal. All of my dreams always revolved around experiences, not things. I considered my accumulation of material things to be complete when I got my car and TV. 

SuperEgo: “What other stuff do you want to buy, self?” 
Id: “Well…nothing really.” 
SuperEgo: “Nothing? Not a house? Not gagdets? Not a boat? Not fancy clothes?
Id: “Nah, I’m good.”

I went to law school for a few different reasons. Firstly, I graduated with my bachelor's in 2008 and I had no idea what to do with my life. I had wanted to change my major to nutrition and dietetics, but it was too late when I decided. I desperately wanted out of customer service. I took a few constitutional law classes and was interested in law, specifically constitutional law. The choice came down to pursuing a second bachelor's degree in science, which felt like a step backward, and the choice to go to law school. I ultimately decided on law school because I liked to idea of using my passion for research and writing to make a difference on a policy level in the health and nutrition field. I also went for all the dumb reasons people go: to feel successful, to prove myself, to do something that seemed important, to help people, to have prestige, to have a set career path with some sense of certainty, and to feel like I was moving closer to adulthood.

I never got any of the jobs related to health and nutrition law that I dreamed of. I applied to the few that came along, but it never really happened. Moreover, the practice area I thought I wanted doesn't really exist. The city I am in never had enough public interest government positions open up for someone in the middle of the stack get hired.

So I ended up in civil litigation and business transactions at small firms, the general catch-all that most end up in.
I should also mention that I am a fighter. As in MMA. I have been for over ten years. And this is the thing that unequivocally owns the real estate of my heart.

As you can guess, in the past several years, lawyering has caused me to stop competing altogether – and that has become the main thing that’s killing my happiness.

The past two weeks have been very strange. Nothing in particular is wrong; I’ve been living alone in my apartment for almost three months, I have a new kitten, I’m making ends meet, and work is not particularly stressful. Nor am I underperforming in any distinct sort of way.

I think the difference is really only noticeable to me. I know I am not all that focused at the moment. There is a creeping, almost panic-like anxiety in me. It’s become too obvious to avoid.

SuperEgo: “I don’t like being a civil litigator / lawyer. I need to come up with a reasonable exit plan. Let’s find a viable way to financially support fighting again.”

Ego: “I REALLY don’t like being a civil litigator / lawyer. I don’t care how, I want to be a fighter again.”

Id: “I can’t stand / hate / loathe being a civil litigator/lawyer. Also, give me a damn cookie and let’s go lay in bed and never come out and ignore all adult responsibilities. Only leave said bed to train and face punch people!”

So there it is. The truth. And now, to come up with the exit plan.

Today in ENGR131 we were given a presentation by the industrial engineering department and I was intrigued. Although I love computers, I also love problem-solving and making things more efficient, along with the business factor of engineering, which is why I think I connected so much with the presentation. I was especially interested in the human-computer interaction side of IE.

What's the course load like for IE? I'm written down for a CS course next semester, should I still take that if I want to pursue IE? What are internship and study abroad opportunities like?

I'm just now starting my major courses(intro to programming, discrete math, etc) and even with a year of self learning, I don't feel anywhere near being internship ready. 

I plan on taking all of my AS units here as well as a decent chunk of my BS units in order to save money. My issue is that on my current course, I'll be here another year, then only have 2 years at university (hopefully UCI,CPP, or UCSD). I just feel like I'm learning how to program too late and therefore will only be internship ready in my senior year. 

Do I start applying for internships while I'm still at CC and have very limited knowledge on programming or do I only apply once I have a good foundation on it (i.e. Senior year)?"
52t7le,3,2016-09-14,I'm moving out in 6 months!!!!!,Onmyown7,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/52t7le/im_moving_out_in_6_months/,"I know . It may not seem like a big deal to most people.

I’ve been trying to move out of my home for 6 years and never even got close to having the opportunity.  I know it’s still a long time away but this is literally my life goal and I want nothing more then just to have a place to call home.  I cant live here anymore. This home of mine has caused me to develop a number of anxiety and depression problems. I never had a room of my own. I always had to share it with my sister (who moved away years ago) and my two older brothers. One of my brothers is 34 and has no degree, friends ,jobs, and is mentally unstable. I shared a room with him for way to long and when my father passed away, I decided to move into my mother room and share a bed with her. That is what I do now. So now I don’t even have a bed. I guess it’s better then that tiny tiny room that was for all 4 of us at one point. My mother is an at home baby sitter at our small 2 bed room apartment my morning begins by being woken up by screaming children at 7am. I cant get up because im so tired . I fight with myself until the screaming gets me out of bed. I feel so much anger during this time that my chest begins to hurt and my anxiety sky rockets.  I’ve never been happy. I’ve never been content with the place I am in my life. I want that . I want to feel it. Living in NYC , it’s impossible to live in your own apartment .

I had a really bad summer 2 years ago when I stopped caring. My father had passed away when we were on vacation … my exboyfriend had sexually manipulated me and tried to get me to have sex with him although I didn’t want to . He then decided to turn around, leave me , and say things about me a week after my dad passed because I refused. I reached out to my ex best friend who decided she wanted nothing to do with me for sure at that moment regardless of me picking her up through out most of our friend ship…. To sum it up, things were bad. I ended up getting kicked out of school due to already low grades. I had majored in biology to try and become a vet but I couldn’t do it…I failed chem 4 times. I changed my major to psychology because I just wanted to graduate and get a job I could live off of. I then got kicked. I had no direction in my life and battled with heavy depression, I lost weight….gained it..I was a mess.

I found about a free 3 month program in my area that provided IT training and I decided, why not?
I didn’t have much expectations but the program was pretty hard . They required a lot of commitment and I ended up failing both parts of one certification.  I was broken. I felt so stupid but not surprised. 

But

Then I decide to try again and study hard and ….I passed! I received my certification! After that I took a brief job and completed an internship and just accepted a job offer I will start very  soon. I’m so excited because this job will finally let me move out! I even applied to school again, got in and currently attend night classes and will work in the morning. Next semester will be my last . Many people laugh about someone working in IT getting a psychology degree but I don’t care. I want a degree and it’s something I worked so hard in. I lost my grant and paid for this semester and took a hard hit to my account. I want this degree. Yeah I live in poverty but at least I would have completed a degree
The job will pay around 36ish K .  That’s a little over 2 k a month I think. My current boyfriend has agreed to move in with me ! I’m so excited. He is still in school therefore he will be working part time and going to school fulltime and I will pay most of the bills. 
Most 1 bed rooms around my area are about $1,200- 1,400 a month. We will go half on the rent . He is even bringing his car with him which we can also afford. I’m so excited. We set the date to 6 months from now so we can start saving . I cant wait! It’s all I dream about.

I want a dog too.  I’m nervous but excited and if by the end of 6 months he decided he cant do it then ill find a roommate! 24 years old and I want to begin my life 

Sorry Reddit. I had to tell someone! I worked so hard for this !!

I have a friend of a friend who is trying to pass on their lease. It's a 2 bedroom 1 bath apartment about 5 minutes from campus. It's 825 a month and she said her utilities usually stay under 100 a month. It's gated, and all the appliances, wiring, tile, and everything it's new. For about 450-475 per person it's quite a steal. The lease is up in May, so it's great for the school year.

A little bit about me, I a super senior with a majoring in Liberal studies. I sing, play music, and write. I do alcohol promotions and work as a research intern. I enjoy cooking and adventuring... and yeah we can talk if you want to know more, cause I find describing myself very cheesy lol. I'd prefer a male roommate but open to all.

I'm 23. I had an internship 2 weeks after I graduated May '15 from college. I made that a full time job 1 month later. I was laid off in a round of company-wide layoffs at the beginning of August. Got 2 weeks severance + vacation pay, so about a month of salary.

I spend 5 days a week, a few hours a day applying to jobs I can see myself at - so about 2-4 jobs a day. I'm not going to be one of those guys applying to every job I see, because I can't be unhappy at work hating my job or I won't be a good employee. I like to spend my time crafting my resume/cover letter to fit the company and role, too. I've reached out to recruiters I know. I've reached out to people in the field or that may know people in the field. 

I've had a couple of interviews, one of which has rejected me after the 2nd round of interviews, the other of which I had round 2 today, but I really think I'm under-qualified and probably won't get the job.

I spend the rest of my days apartment hunting. I still live at home, so I've saved a shit ton of money, but I don't want to live in LA anymore and am working on a move to SF or Seattle ASAP. But that has proven difficult to find a place, as CL people want to meet you tomorrow, and apartments want proof of income to lease.

I work part time - a couple weekends a month plus a weekday or two here and there - at an overnight camp that I grew up at and worked at for 5 summers to keep my working and on my feet and to get some income along with unemployment. I love it there. I work my ass off for less than minimum, because I know I'm GREAT at that job (it involves logistics and coordinating, and manual labor - whatever), and I get more thank you's and gratitude and support in 48 hours than I did in 14 months at my ""real"" job. If my ""real"" job taught me how NOT to be a manager, this camp has taught me how to be the best manager you can be.

My parents are driving me into a deeper depression/lack of motivation. They keep telling me I'm not trying hard enough. I'm not doing enough. I get no support from them. They accuse me of ""running away"" to work at the camp over weekends, or that I'm ""running away"" to my friends cabin with him and his family on other weekends. It's killing me. Making me feel like a failure. and I'm only 23. I'm young. I have time, right? 

Sorry I just needed to vent for a minute. I know this kind of shit gets posted all the time, but I needed to let it out. 

Anyone who has been through this before - Am I wrong? Am I going about this all wrong? Or - how the fuck do I get my mojo, my motivation, my positively back about this whole thing?"

There's still a lot to learn and I don't want to pretend I'm qualified for something I'm not, I'm 100% junior developer.


Sorry I don't have much time to format this post, I'm getting ready to travel city to city to job hunt soon."
52ti5m,3,2016-09-14,I wish there was a reset button.,thoughtscribbler,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/52ti5m/i_wish_there_was_a_reset_button/,"That is my most recent thought. 

I feel like I could have done much better in the past, so that I am in a better position today. I'm bored and my life feels colourless. My 25th  birthday is approaching, and as always I am not sure I can be bothered doing anything for it. I've been spending them mostly alone for as long as I remember anyway. 

I spend my time fighting for something. I get it. Then after a few months I get bored and wish I had something more. At first I had no job. Nothing. I get an internship. Now I am wishing for a paid job. And after that to pass my driving test, and after that to maybe moving out or travelling. Then  I am going to wish for more money. Maybe a place to call my own. And as I move from one goal to the next life is going to pass me by. 

But will I be happy? I don't know.

My family has done so much for me. So I feel ungrateful writing this. But  living with them can be intense. The amount of worrying and love that is sometimes expressed in quite fucked up ways. The smothering. But I say nothing. I shut up, because I know many people have actual real shit to deal with, like an abusive father or siblings. I was abused a little a long while ago, but most of the damage done has been to myself because of my own stupidity. The rest is in the past. 

Any woman that shows a romantic interest in me I push away. I get nervous as hell, I don't feel ready, I feel embarrassed being with my family and my background makes me feel like it would *never* work out. So I push them away. Sometimes I hurt them. I remember once, as I walked home, a man and woman walking side by side. She reached for his hand and held it and I just felt this pang of loneliness that I didn't expect. Then a wall came up, my thoughts were saying *you would just be vulnerable and it's not worth the headache* - and I moved on. I  thought no strings sex would be fun...I just don't know. 

...But one thing that can never leave my mind is a friend far away. How she went through some terrible things, and revealed to me that she was raped earlier in her life. And her parents blamed her for it. I don't know if we would work out, but when she told me over the phone I wanted to cry, and had this need to hold her.  A need to comfort her. To look after her, even if I feel like I don't know how. Never really felt like that with anyone before. But she is in a far away place, turning heads and living her life now. She reaches out, and now and then I am responsive. But then I go quiet, I get scared of getting attached. It's like I keep her at arms length and it's very difficult for me to do. 

Everything feels difficult. 

I feel like I have not actually been through much pain in my life. 

So why am I so unhappy? "
52tpj2,1,2016-09-14,New job jitters or do I need a career change?,TreadLightlyBitch,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/52tpj2/new_job_jitters_or_do_i_need_a_career_change/,"Good evening (Central US time), 

Currently freaking out about the work world. I went to school for 4 years of Civil Engineering where I specialized in structures. I actually focused on Construction Management, but after a CM internship I wanted to make sure I had my bases covered and switched my specialization to structures. My logic - that I could use my internship experience to get me a CM job and if I needed to do structures I'd have the degree to go back to school.

I took my fourth year of structures, and it was difficult, but I loved it. It was lots of math and satisfying to design something; I enjoyed it. But early in my year I got a good offer from my internship for a CM job. Fast forward a year, and I end up taking the CM job (I had no experience interning for structures so I couldn't get a structure job or internship, and I didn't get far with other CM jobs). To be a real structural engineer, I need 5 years to get a masters.

To highlight the difference between these fields, its night and day. I did four years of engineering in school. Structural engineering is designing buildings to last and whatnot; an office job working with software and specs. CM is in the field managing of procurement and schedule of construction. Really nothing I learned in school. I took the job because I thought it'd be fine and I liked my internship.

Now that I really work there full-time, I don't know anymore. Its been two months, and I got to work on the project I was at with my internship. Those were great; I had a really solid team of people I could rely on. My peers could help me learn what I didn't know; I felt like I had a good relationship with the clients and fellow coworkers.

Now I got put on a new project where it's just me and my project manager. He is no where near as helpful for when I have questions. Remember, we're tasked with actually fully building things and I have no knowledge or experience with any of this so I feel like I'm drowning. Not to mention I don't feel like I have a good relationship with the architect on this project and I feel like I can't ask them questions when we need to. 

Above all else, the hours are not ideal. I'm constantly working minimum 50 hours, which I feel like I am a 40-50 hour guy. I've got nights coming up so now I will end up doing late night work so its impossible to schedule a social life outside of weekeneds (I also know there will come a time when I need to work Saturdays I'm sure). And because we work on projects I feel like I will always have to drive to different locations.

I feel like I fucked up hard. I see myself as an engineer; a ""smart"" math guy who can help design buildings and shit. Work in an office and do some site visits once a week. I could go back but I'm terrified of quitting and I also don't know if I would hate structural engineering and I'm just scared of the pressures of working.

To be honest, I just feel like working these late shifts may be getting to me at this new job. I feel unsafe without a net of coworkers to help teach me the ropes; it's me and another employee who doesn't help me a lot and we're surrounded by demanding employees from other places who need things from me that I can't provide. I jsut want to cry a little.

What should I do? I dunno, maybe I jsut need someone to talk to but I am a grown man and I wanna cry.

tl;dr Instead of finishing my structural degree and maybe getting a structural job (only requiring another year) I took a job as a construction manager when I am a fish out of water. Should I keep on keeping on or should I consider going back to school? Remember, this conversation may be biased cause I feel overwhelmed this week."
52txbt,34,2016-09-14,"Internship @ Cisco wasn't what I expected, looking for advice",YRN-YSL,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/52txbt/internship_cisco_wasnt_what_i_expected_looking/,"Background: I went to a small liberal arts school with a CS program that was pretty easy to me, which now seems like a bad thing in hindsight. Few of our CS grads go on to become SWE's without a masters. I didn't intend on being an engineer (and was complacent) until Nov of my senior year when I started to code more intensively, take online courses, and attended 3 MLH hackathons.

After graduation, I decided to take a risk by forgoing two full-time offers (tech consulting + IT @ a non tech company) for a front-end dev internship at Cisco in the bay area. I figured the tech community and environment here would be more conducive to learning, and that I would be able to find a full-time job even if things didn't work out at Cisco. I suffered a lot to make this happen- took a very low wage and lived in a bad housing situation to make things work.

Fast forward 3 months, and the job hasn't been what I expected. The people I work directly with are all remote, so all of my work is done remotely. My mentor was great at first, traveling to meet me weekly etc, but he weaned off his communication and support to me, citing 'crunch time' reasons. Things have gotten busier, so I have had to really push to get any mentorship back. There was a long period of time where they would tell me to train / learn myself for a small project, and then as soon as I would need anything more than passing support, it seemed they would put me on something different. 
Now, the lead engineer is taking a more active role in mentoring me (I think because I sort of went over his head to ask for more work). Because of all this, 3 months in I am still not consistently contributing to the code base. When I do, it is with a ton of help/skyping with a team member (I went in with minimal web dev experience, but understand MVC etc).

The code base is a frankenstein of frameworks and systems, and our development process is virtually nonexistent. There are more people writing specs (project managers and BAs) than people writing code. I feel as if exec level management in charge of our product all specialize in hardware, so there is a disconnect between top leadership and engineering efforts. There is huge disconnect between our U.S. (mine) team and the India team, and they rarely get along.

Now, I am wondering when if ever I will be able to contribute on the level that I was hoping/expecting. They've given me a more serious responsibility (Program Management between India/US) which I am grateful for, but it is not development. I'm not sure if I will ever contribute like I want to, and I don't really want to sacrifice pay and experience by coming onto Cisco as a non-engineer. I feel as if it will stunt my career in many ways (though I'm willing to move to product management in the future).

I just enrolled in a class at Berkeley and begin tomorrow (EECS 169). I am desperately trying to bridge the gap in all ways and become a real dev. I've tried the DS/Algos stanford coursera course, but have difficulty implementing everything! I feel as if I'm trying everything and excelling at nothing. Hopefully this course at Berkeley gives me the structure I'm hoping for.

Any advice? What do I do? Stay? Leave? Study? If so, any guidance on what? DS/Algos or more web dev? (I know they're not mutually exclusive, but I feel as if I always spread myself too thin!) I'm also a little disappointed that Cisco isn't as respected in the Bay Area as I originally thought.

Thanks so much for any advice."

52u4vm,2,2016-09-14,Recent college grad seeking career advice,iluckychizarms,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/52u4vm/recent_college_grad_seeking_career_advice/,"Background about me: Recent college grad, bachelors in IT, associates in Business admin. Completed an internship at a local, but very large Unified Communications company. I worked in support, taking calls, creating tickets and troubleshooting the issue until it was resolved. I'm also in the Army National Guard where I do IT work. Helpdesk/NetOps type things. Configuring routers/switches, setting up VPN tunnels, hooking up telephony services etc. nothing too in depth but decent amount of experience. No real IT job other than what I've listed above. 

Certs: CCENT, CCNA R&amp;S, ICCE (in house cert for UC company I interned for) 

So I've been applying for a crap ton of jobs. Helpdesk, junior net engineer type gigs. No real luck until today.

Job #1
I had an interview with a very large, global, and well respected company. They are huge in the world of HealthTech. The position I applied for was a Field Service Engineer. This position would be traveling around to different hospitals around the state (maybe further) to install and service these healthtech systems. Great pay (for a brand new college grad), company car + gas. However seems to be a large amount of travel, with a not so appealing on-call system (basically on call 24/7/365). Be pretty much on my own all the time doing what needs to be done. Advancement seems possible but seems like it would take a very long time and things don't seem too structured.

Job #2
I had an interview for this job the same day as job #1. This job is working as a VoIP associate engineer at a very large hospital corporation who has hospitals all across the state. Work will be focused in the city I live in, no real travel, office type job. Implementing phones and troubleshooting as well as some backend stuff. Advancement seems more likely here and they seem to be more engaged when it comes to getting you exposure to what you want (i.e. If you eventually want to be a network guy, they push you in that direction). 

Job #1 has offered me a position the very same day as the interview. During the interview for job #2 (I already knew I was offered job #1) I used this to leverage a quicker interview process (since job #1 would need to know if i accept the offer ASAP). Job #2 told me I was the leading candidate for the position and I'm feeling very confident that they will offer me the position. 

Where I'm stuck: do I take job #1 or job #2(assuming they actually offer it to me)???? Both jobs offer pretty much the same amount of money. Job #1 is hourly with good chance of OT. Job #2 is salary with no OT. Job #1 offers company car + gas but you must travel often. Job #2 doesn't offer these things but is local and short drive from my house. Other than that the benefits are good and very similar between both jobs. Traveling around interests me but I don't want to me on call all the time.

Does anyone here work as a field service engineer or a VoIP engineer tell me a little about what they like/dislike? I'm mainly curious about the field service engineer because I don't really know what to expect other than long days and working alone. 

Any advice or input is welcome. TIA"

He mentions that before an interview even begins, say something to the effect of
&gt;I'm very happy to be here, and I want to answer all the questions you have for me, but before we begin do you mind if I ask you a question? Why did you ask me here today? What was it about my resume that caused you to invite me in?

His reasoning is that it encourages the interviewer to see you in a positive light from the get-go, and therefore everything else you say after that is helping reinforce their already positive thoughts about you.

I have an interview for an IB fall internship tomorrow, and am interested in trying this out. Before I do though, I want to hear some opinions on whether this would work the way it is intended – or would it be a *negative* question to ask, as I found online.
&gt; You risk seeming unaware of the value you bring or what the company’s needs are—it’s a rookie move.

Thoughts?

tl;dr lol no"
52ub8h,1,2016-09-14,[Event] Education in Scotland Act,Ceannaire_Cogadh,Geosim,https://www.reddit.com/r/Geosim/comments/52ub8h/event_education_in_scotland_act/,"##The Education in Scotland Act of 2035##

**Overview**

The Democratic Republic of Scotland's highest spending area is in education, and there is a reason why: without education, the country will be doomed. Education breeds lawyers and carpenters, mathematicians and politicians, generals and teachers, engineers and artists. With that in mind, the D.R.S. has allocated £8,771,875,000 to the education budget, so that a comprehensive educational system can be planned out and provided to the students of Scotland. 

**Scheduling**

The school year for public schools will last from late January until mid December, split into four terms with two-week breaks in-between. All non-primary schools operate on an A-Day/B-Day schedule, allowing for eight classes total in a year.

**Introductory and Primary School**

Children are first received into the public school system through two optional grade levels: Playgroup, which receives children ages 2-3, and Nursery, which receives children ages 3-4. In these grades, children will be acclimated to cooperating and communicating with others, and they will be given activities to do, as well as a supervised recess outdoors. Activities include a nature ""scavenger hunt"" (where teachers introduce the children to native fauna and flora), learning the alphabet, colors, and numbers, and playtime. These two grades last every weekday from 8AM to 5:30PM, which allows their parents to work.

From there, all children in the public education system must begin Reception, which receives 4-5 year olds and acclimates them to a proper learning environment. Here, the children begin a proper education, beginning basic mathematical concepts, English grammar, scientific foundations, and basics of Scottish government. Reception also lasts from 8AM to 5:30PM, just like the prior two grades.

Next, students begin primary school. These are separated into six grade years: Year 1 receives students 6-7, Year 2 receives students 7-8, Year 3 receives students 8-9, Year 4 receives students 9-10, Year 5 receives students 10-11, and Year 6 receives students 11-12. In addition, it is in Years 1 through 6 that students are taught Scots as part of a mandatory cultural program which leads into the upper levels of education. However, it is not all work in these schools - children are given an hour for breakfast, an hour for lunch and two separate one-hour recesses - teachers may also conduct classes outside (but still on-campus) with administrative approval on a class-to-class basis. Beginning in Year 5, students take competence tests and interest inventories to begin deciding on what type of school they will go to. By Year 6, the student's counselor will have decided whether to send the student to a Regional Vocational School, a High School, or an Academy

Note: Commas note separate classes available to that grade level.

**Regional Vocational School**

Although seen as ""incompetent"" in some school systems, the Scottish government understands that not all people want to continue with academic studies. Regional Vocational Schools are four-year public schools where students can learn up to two trades of their choice, and can graduate certified in those fields. Possibilities include carpentry, masonry, electrical wiring, plumbing, mechanics, welding, landscaping, and cosmetology. In addition, students will take applicable core classes for their first two years, in order to ensure that the students graduate as well-rounded citizens. After completing two years of English, students may choose to take two more years of Scots, but this eliminates one of their ""free blocks"". School runs from 8:00AM to 3:30AM for Regional Vocational School students, with an hour lunch at noon. Year 9 and Year 10 students who do not take Scots may leave early and come in late - students who take Scots must come in at 8:00AM. These schools encompass years 7-10.

**High School**

The standard for Scottish students, high schools are four-year institutions that focus on a mix of vocational or interest ""electives"" as well as higher-level academics. School lasts from 8:00AM to 5:30PM, with an hour for lunch at noon. Scots is no longer a required language, but becomes one of the mandatory language electives. After the four years, students may either proceed directly to college or university, attend a conservatory for theatre or music, or they may enter a two-year military academy and graduate as an NCO in a branch of their choosing (pending government approval). Students here are years 7 through 10. Physical education classes are a mandatory class which happen every other school day. 

Note: Year 7 students must take Fitness and Wellness and Personal Finance.

**Academy**

The Academy is for advanced-level students - those erudites, statistically few in number, who strive to achieve academic perfection. Academies are the pinnacle of public academia in Scotland, and the schools are few and far between. School hours are from 8:00AM to 6:00PM, with a three-hour recess from 11:00AM to 1:00PM. Typically, musical classes and vocational classes are in the mornings, with academic classes extending from the afternoon into the evening. Academies are six-year institutions, with the last two years consisting primarily of college/university/military/conservatory prep. Years are designated by ""class"", beginning with ""Class 6"" and ending with ""Class 1"". Students pursuing the military route may join a military university, which will allow them to graduate as a CO in a branch of their choosing (pending government approval). Students pursuing musical, literature, or performance art will go to a conservatory, which encompasses refined arts such as art, drama, literature, and music. 

Note: The ""Scientific Study"" class allows students to choose a field and conduct independent research - the only graded assignment is a 10,000 word scientific research paper, due at the end of the school year.

So I had a phone interview last week with Target for a management position.

The other position was for a Logistics Manager position but it has not been posted on their job board online yet. 

Yesterday, I received an email that I had not been selected for the Loss Prevention Manager position. However, I haven't heard anything about the other job and I have no way of tracking it since I didn't apply myself and it isn't listed.

Its creators had designed it to detect supernovas in far away galaxies, but they had no idea that it's destiny laid in another direction. In order to escape the solar system, it had to use the Sun as a gravity assist. Readings taken from the probe as it circled the Sun were almost ignored completely, as many thought that the probe's sensors wouldn't read any significant information. Luckily though, a team of interns had no better work to do at the time and combed over the data as a way to keep their skills honed. One of them found an abnormal measurement and reported it to her superiors, but she got no word back about it. She figured that it must have been nothing. She was wrong. As soon as her superior looked over her discovery, he knew something was amiss. He went straight to the top and a small, top-secret task force was commissioned to investigate the measurement. A couple decades passed by before they reached their conclusion. The chemical makeup of the Sun was not nearly as stable as had been accepted for so long. The Earth didn't have billions of years left before the Sun blew up, it had hundreds.

President Alvarez had just been sworn in weeks before he was informed of the matter. While still keeping the veil of a normal presidency around him, he spent the entirety of his 8 year term researching the options that Earth had left. It was settled within a year that Earth was doomed. The Sun had reached the point of no return centuries ago and moving the Earth out of the blast radius was [out of the question](http://imgur.com/a/SIfaO).

Obviously, there had to be some kind of evacuation, but technology was extremely limited. Even when the other governments of the world were contacted, their pooled efforts could only create one spaceship that had could carry the resources necessary for sustaining life far enough away from the Sun. It wasn't all doom and gloom though. The research on designing the base accelerated quickly, and the spaceship itself was designed in less than a decade. The same probe that discovered the Sun's fatal flaw was retasked to scout out planets, and a small list of acceptable candidates was assembled quickly. Models suggested that the primary planet candidate could have its atmosphere be made breathable in less than a century and that the soil could be made farmable, though that would take a significantly longer amount of time.

All that was easy. The hard part came when it was time to select the people to fill the ark, as most of the people who knew of it called it. Some thought they should all be engineers, people who could manage the base well and troubleshoot mechanical problems the easiest. Others wanted a more balanced team that could manage all sorts of things, like the plants or the crew's health. A few politicians even suggested that the crew should be made of philosophers and artists to preserve Earth culture.

The decision was largely made for them though as two new problems surfaced. First, the cryogenics systems didn't develop as nicely as the others. Tests on people over 50 were catastrophic, with volunteers not lasting more than a few days before the tests had to be stopped for safety reasons. Further tests and calculations estimated that no one over 40 could survive the journey. To add onto the problems, volunteers with even average amounts of stress were much more likely to suffer heart attacks in their sleep state. The second problem was the elephant in the room that everyone tried to ignore for as long as possible. To continue the human race, the crew had to breed. But the ship could only hold six people, five women and one man to ensure long term species procreation. There would have to be incest just to create a third generation. Knowing that it had to be done, research was done on the science of incestuous breeding and it was found that only .0001% of the population had the genes necessary to sustain a healthy family tree.

With these two factors in mind, the most qualified candidates were identified from a short list. Most people who were involved in the decision wanted the candidates to be trained and debriefed extensively before the launch. However, the cryogenic scientists made it clear that the stress of knowing the fate of humanity was to be carried on their shoulders was far too much. The only plan that ensured the safety of the candidates was to sedate them in their sleep and put them into the cryochambers without even the slightest bit of warning or preparation.

Thousands of years later, the lights in the spaceship turned on. It had landed on the virgin planet just as the scientists and engineers designed it to. The cryochambers started their three day reanimation process, and once the crew members exited, they barely had a chance to speak to each other before a video played in the center of the room.

""Hello, I'm Dr. Baker. Welcome to Project Phoenix.""

***

This is obviously a long term prompt that will focus on breeding, and if the RP goes on for a long time, incest. However, this most likely isn't going to be a sex-focused RP. The main focus will most likely be on the characters themselves as they go through the emotions of knowing they're the last humans alive and the struggles that they'll face just to survive and deal with each other. I'm looking for realistic character development, with each one taking a different view on their situation. Breeding is the only truly necessary kink for this RP, but others can be discussed. Here's my [kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/ZTXuOUH.png) if you want to check it out. I'm always open to doing this prompt, so no matter when you're reading this, feel free to shoot me an orange envelope!"

I took summer classes each year, and ended up working for a catering company, at a cafe as customer service as well as a little bit of social media/marketing, and for a delivery company recently. Now that I'm a graduate with no real work experience, I feel like I'm totally unprepared for a decent job in my field of interest. I mean sure, I took a bunch of classes over the years that taught me key concepts, but I am yet to really apply any of them in a real setting nor can I remember at least half of those learned over the years!

The only language the school has taught to this point involves Python and only teaches some C# in a C and Systems class.

After my internship I got hired by a company for a python position but every developer at my company quit so I consequently lost my job and I have to move at the end of this month!  

I don't want to stay at the city I'm in because that's not where the jobs are.  They underpay people, cut people easily and just there's too much competition.  (100+ people for every job position.)  

Is there any place I can guarantee employment even though I'm effectively junior level (just a bit above intern level.)?  

I have worked on about 10 projects during my rails internship, doing full-stack work.  

I am not above average, but I at least know the fundamentals and I got a good grasp of some computer science concepts (I'm self-taught though.)  

Am I effectively screwed or is there hope?  It took me over a year to get my first contract, and I don't want to job hunt where I'm at anymore so I'm going to travel to job hunt.

1) [Is this a good reference regarding internal cross linking?](https://blog.kissmetrics.com/commandments-of-internal-linking/) She's been poking around [our articles](https://chroniclevitae.com/news) looking for natural opportunities to link between them. I know at one time there was talk that you could affect the perceived value of different pages this way (this is mentioned in the kiss article linked) but it sounds like that isn't really an issue anymore. If that's true, she should be able to cross-link with only adding value/uncovering relevant content in mind and secondarily improve SEO. Is that true?

2) I'm being told that I no longer need to worry about repeating keyword phrases a few times (title, headers, alt tags) for the sake of SEO. My googling this is bringing up conflicting answers. Thoughts?

In the first interview, I was able to solve the first question I was asked on my own. It certainly wasn't easy, but I remained calm and figured it out. Then, after the interviewer added a follow-up which made it go from medium to hard, I had no clue how to approach it. I talked out loud about a few ideas I had, but in the end, the interviewer had to provide some hints to help me formulate an answer. I didn't finish, and he even said he didn't expect me to finish and its good that I got the first correct.

Second interview, I got the second best solution to the question by myself, but not the best (which I found out after the interview). He asked if I could improve it, but I honestly didn't know how I could, so I tried brainstorming a few ideas, but in the end I said that I couldn't :(

After that, there was time remaining so I got another question which I was able to work through. I had to backtrack once and fix my approach, and then finally got the solution with a very small bit of guidance (mostly on my own).

Throughout this, I surely explained myself pretty well, drew out examples, and thought out loud.

I (F/23) have been in the process of applying to studying abroad in the UK. (I'm American) At first I was really excited at the opportunity, I've always wanted to truly be immersed in the culture of the UK, and I've heard from so many people what an incredible life-changing experience it can be! Plus, I really want to experience more of the world before I start  my career. But now that it's seeming more ""real"" I'm having second thoughts...

First off, it would most certainly put me into debt. My semester abroad would be my last before I graduate. Right now I have zero student loans, and I don't know if it's the best idea to take out loans right before I set out into the ""real world"" (I definitely want to move away from my the town I've been living in once I'm done with school.) 

Also, I've experienced pretty bad anxiety before. The one and only time I went overseas before, I had panic attacks and anxiety throughout the whole trip. That was a couple of years ago, and I have since lived away from home for 6 months (I did the Disney College Program and loved it!) and I was fine, but I am still nervous that being in such a new and different environment will seriously trigger my anxiety again. The past couple days I have felt so much anxiety just at the thought of it actually happening. Plus, if I decided to go home early, I wouldn't be able to graduate. So even if I ended up hating it, I would be absolutely stuck there. 

And the last thing. There is a guy who is from and lives close to London. We met while we were both living in the US. We have had sort of a long distance relationship thing over the past 6 months or so. This guy really isn't good for me though, I've been trying to keep my distance from him in an effort to kind of get over it... I really love him still though. I guess it could be both a good and a bad thing, him being there: at least I have one person I know; but on the other hand, this guy has hurt me in the past, and I wouldn't want it ruining my time there. (I know, it's stupid.)

I am applying to the University of Hertfordshire in Hatfield.

If I choose not to study abroad next semester, I was thinking about trying for a summer internship in London through BUNAC's program. Does anyone have any experience doing something similar?

I just feel so conflicted, it's driving me crazy! If anyone could offer me any advice or input at all, I would greatly appreciate it! Thank you!"

The problem is that the boringness of the internship seems to have completely killed programming for me, I haven't coded at all since may (classes haven't required it yet this semester, cs=math now). 

I'm in this weird place where my first internship bored me to death and my long term plan doesn't include programming (want to move into management or politics or something eventually) so I just have no desire to keep learning and improving. My GPA isn't great (lack of doing homework and attending class, not programming ability/ability to learn) so I feel like I won't be getting a job at a good company when I first start out anyways, and in my mind that means I won't have any really difficult interview questions (within reason obviously). Even if I'm wrong on this point I don't think that preparing for interview questions alone will be enough to bring me out of my funk. 

 I think that the possibility of getting a job at an awesome company (nasa, google, SpaceX, etc) when i graduate would help reignite my passion for programming, but my GPA (about a 2.8 now, can probably get to 2.9 when I graduate) makes me think that I won't be able to land anything great. This combined with the fact that I plan on going into management  anyways (I like money and making big decisions) leave me with little desire to be an outstanding programmer. Right now I'm just doing enough to get by, but I want more than that. 

So tell me where my thinking is wrong and convince me to refine my programming skills, I could use a kick in the ass."

This is my first year in my major as a Software Engineer (2nd year uni) and our university is holding it's annual career fair. I'm in the process of designing my resume with PS/Illustrator and reached the experience section and...literally have nothing to put down (related to computer science). I really am a hardworking student and will go above and beyond for what I love to do which is applying and challenging myself. I knew nothing from the beginning of the July and managed to build 3 websites from scratch (no pre-made templates made) using front-end code I learned (HTML5, CSS3, JS) and also learned how to use and incorporate APIs/Ajax/back-end languages into some small projects by the end of the August. What do I put down for my experience section? I really want to get an internship and get some real-life experience but the thought of not getting a single interview due to no previous experience is making me pretty sad. :("

52ya5k,1,2016-09-15,I (F/23) can't decide whether I should study abroad in the UK or not?,masterpretender_,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/52ya5k/i_f23_cant_decide_whether_i_should_study_abroad/,"Hey guys! I (F/23) have been in the process of applying to studying abroad in the UK. (I'm American) At first I was really excited at the opportunity, I've always wanted to truly be immersed in the culture of the UK, and I've heard from so many people what an incredible life-changing experience it can be! Plus, I really want to experience more of the world before I start my career. But now that it's seeming more ""real"" I'm having second thoughts...
First off, it would most certainly put me into debt. My semester abroad would be my last before I graduate. Right now I have zero student loans, and I don't know if it's the best idea to take out loans right before I set out into the ""real world"" (I definitely want to move away from my the town I've been living in once I'm done with school.)
Also, I've experienced pretty bad anxiety before. The one and only time I went overseas before, I had panic attacks and anxiety throughout the whole trip. That was a couple of years ago, and I have since lived away from home for 6 months (I did the Disney College Program and loved it!) and I was fine, but I am still nervous that being in such a new and different environment will seriously trigger my anxiety again. The past couple days I have felt so much anxiety just at the thought of it actually happening. Plus, if I decided to go home early, I wouldn't be able to graduate. So even if I ended up hating it, I would be absolutely stuck there.
And the last thing. There is a guy who is from and lives close to London. We met while we were both living in the US. We have had sort of a long distance relationship thing over the past 6 months or so. This guy really isn't good for me though, I've been trying to keep my distance from him in an effort to kind of get over it... I really love him still though. I guess it could be both a good and a bad thing, him being there: at least I have one person I know; but on the other hand, this guy has hurt me in the past, and I wouldn't want it ruining my time there. (I know, it's stupid.)
I am applying to the University of Hertfordshire in Hatfield.
If I choose not to study abroad next semester, I was thinking about trying for a summer internship in London through BUNAC's program. Does anyone have any experience doing something similar?
I just feel so conflicted, it's driving me crazy! If anyone could offer me any advice or input at all, I would greatly appreciate it! Thank you!"

I'm the president of my school's computer science society, and for our next meeting, we'll be discussing why internships are important as well as how to get them. 

I've gotten a few internships, some with established companies and some with start ups, so I have insight from my perspective, but I'd love to have a few points of view on this.  If you are hiring an intern, what are you looking for?  What resources do you use (LinkedIn, indeed, looksharp, etc)?

Sorry if this isn't where this kind of question goes, I just want to give out the best possible information.  Thanks everybody.

**What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better.**

My buddy wants to get a new PC for AutoCAD work. He's an intern at a architectural firm. He was about to buy a pre-built but I convinced him that a build your own is a better choice. I'm a little out of my element here though (I know gaming PCs, but not AutoCAD PCs). I was hoping there were some folks here on /r/buildapc that know more about the best kind of rig for AutoCAD.

A quote from him about what he will use it for:

&gt;It's all just 2D site planning linework; however, we oftentimes have xrefs brought in, as well as PDF underlays and raster images, so that can cause CAD files to be pretty sluggish.

&gt;Also, some of the illustratives we work on in Photoshop can have a ton of layers and be huge, so it tends to run slowly sometimes.

There's room in my build higher cost / higher performance parts. If he can spend more money and get real performance out of it (aka value) then please let me know.

My fucking parents do nothing but hound me about finding work, which I'd be fine with if they were more supportive and less disappointed about it. I WANT to work, but they have it burned into their heads that I don't because I get really depressed and lose the motivation to do anything after a few weeks of looking for work and getting fuckall in return or getting jerked around by people. For context, I've got awful luck getting work. I've gone to places that have not only forced me to do two interviews, but had the GALL to fucking say ""oh well we never had any positions :)"" or ""Oh well you were too serious"" in a fucking job interview no less after making me waste my time going to both fucking interviews. In the past four years, I've managed to get one job, a position working at a game store which was my fucking dream entry job, and I was let go from it after maybe three weeks of working there last year. My fucking parents WONT. SHUT. THE. FUCK. UP. ABOUT. IT. Literally all they do when they talk about work is ""Oh, well you only worked 3 weeks of your life, we've been telling you to get a job for almost four years."" Gee, thanks. That's SOOO FUCKING MOTIVATING, I JUST WANT TO HOP IN THE CAR I DON'T OWN AND DRIVE AROUND TOWN RIGHT NOW BECAUSE OF YOUR *AWESOME* MOTIVATIONAL SPEECH, YOU REALLY HELPED ME OUT THERE MOM AND POP. It's so fucking draining and depressing that I'm slowly starting to sink back into where I was in Highschool and I'm starting to contemplate suicide again. They just have to remind me every day that I'm getting older and still don't have a job and whenever I try to tell them that it's not helping, they get pissy and ask ""what else are we supposed to do?"". Hmm, I don't know, maybe say ""Hey look, it's tough, but we're on your side and we know you can do it."" Nah, that'd be supportive instead of damaging. That's not how conservatives work, we have to damage our children beyond repair and then bitch about how they don't function right! 

It's not like I'm not trying, because I am. They have their fucking hissyfits over my lack of a job so much these days that I'm too afraid to ever talk to them and now all I do is look for work, from the moment I wake up to when I go to bed. I have days where I hop in the car and look for places with help wanted signs, often getting places that ""just keep the sign out front"" and don't actually have positions which completely waste my fucking time.

AND IT'S STILL NOT FUCKING GOOD ENOUGH.

I don't know how to fuckin deal with this anymore. Not only do they want me to work a 40 hour a week job, which is reasonable, but they want me to do a full schedule of school AND do like 20 hours of intern work a week AND they're not willing to give me transport because they're too busy running the failing fucking business they weren't prepared to open. It really makes me just want to take a gun and splatter my brains against the wall just to think about all of this. And every single day I get worried that I'm going to get too old to get a fucking entry level job. Every single fucking day I wake up and think ""gee, i'm a quarter of the way through my life and i'm not working, i'm going to be fucked at some point."" I've already made it a promise that I'm not ending up as a 40 year old loser in their parents' home, I'd rather commit suicide by cop than let that happen.

Quite frankly, I'm ready to commit suicide now. I'm pretty sure if I can't find a job before I hit 21, I'm just going to fucking end it. What's the point in continuing if nobody's ever going to fucking hire me at that point."

How do you choose your first (or next) role? I'm a senior interviewing for full-time positions. I've been struggling with the following questions, and was hoping someone could provide some insight.


* How do you know what part of full-stack (or subfield of CS) interests you? 
* Should I be worried about getting pigeonholed into a role? For example, will joining an iOS team limit my future opportunities in non-iOS work?
* In college &amp; job interviews, we constantly practice algorithmic problems like tree-traversals, DP, etc - I've rarely used these skills in internships, and have trouble seeing this ""algorithmic"" process in some job descriptions. This makes me worry about working on non-challenging / boilerplate code. Is this irrational? I would love to hear some diverse examples of your work that are fulfilling / challenging.

Any other tips for deciding on a first team would be awesome - thank you!"
52zem4,1,2016-09-15,[Conflict] Czechoslovakian Expeditionary Force begins Anti-Insurgent Operations,loltimetodie_,ColdWarPowers,https://www.reddit.com/r/ColdWarPowers/comments/52zem4/conflict_czechoslovakian_expeditionary_force/,"Following permission from the Polish government, [Czech forces](https://www.reddit.com/r/ColdWarPowers/comments/52nwx4/event_military_exercises_in_northern_slovakia/) have crossed the Northern border into Poland to begin anti-insurgent operations. The 1st Expeditionary Army's headquarters will be located outside Krakow, though will likely move north as the Army's operations do. 

____________________
##Part 1: Intelligence Operations

[**Firstly**, the StB will engage in its largest operation since its inception. StB cells will relocate to every major &amp; middle size city, each to be given a certain ""district"" to cover. These cells will co-operate with Polish law-enforcement, intelligence, and military officials to engage in ""oil spot"" tactics (Occupying an urban area and expanding operations from there into the surrounding area), expanding slowly outwards from their central base. The StB is advised not only to use the utmost secrecy when engaging with civilian populations, but also to avoid as much as possible committing any *overly questionable* acts such as torture, public killings, etc. that may drive poles into the arms of the insurgents.](#secret)

Though they will be given a good degree of local autonomy in deciding tactics, cells will primarily focus on the following tasks (Ranked in order of importance):

* [Locating Insurgent safehouses, stockpiles, strongholds and meeting places](#secret)

* [Ascertaining the size, organization, and armament of both local Insurgent groups and the Insurgents as a whole, information which will be provided firstly to Czech military officials, and then to Polish officials when necessary.](#secret)

* [Infiltrating and subverting Insurgent groups](#secret)

In the south, such information will be put to use as soon as possible by the Military, in a manner outlined below. Further north, and even in southern areas the Expeditionary force will not yet be operating in, [StB agents will engage in slower moving oil spot tactics. When the Military is ready to move into a district, and the StB has completed operations, the StB will conduct synchronized raids/arrests on all ascertained individuals, meeting places, and smaller stockpiles and safe-houses. The Expeditionary force will immediately then move in to engage larger strongholds, such as controlled towns, training camps, or armouries.](#secret) They will do this in the manner outlined below.

Note, Reconnaissance versions of the JU-88 will be utilized in rural &amp; wilderness areas to locate structures for investigation 

**Propaganda**

In terms of propaganda, the Czech StB will aid in the distribution of any Polish made propaganda, and we will rely on the Polish government to conduct the bulk of such campaigns. The StB will also be implementing Czech-sponsored/produced propaganda, to be co-ordinated with the Polish campaigns. This propaganda will present the narrative of the insurgents being envious Fascist leave-behinds and exiles, capitalist running-dogs hungry for any power they can seize, and willing to do *anything* to get it. [Naturally, a few incidents will be fabricated to support their supposed vicious nature, though any guerrilla operations they conduct will also be cast in this light.](#secret) They will be shown to be agents of the capitalo-fascist empires which desire once more to wrest control of the population of Poland from the true and proper instrument of the proletariat's will, the Polish government, and exploit the land and people for their own ends. Possible appeals to nationalistic sentiment will be especially attacked, emphasizing class struggle, working class solidarity, and the struggle for socialism above national struggle. Czechoslovak troops will be portrayed as friends, as part of the eternal brotherhood of man who saw their neighbors suffering and are reaching out a helping hand. Small gifts of chocolate and toys are authorized to be given to locals when troops pass through populated areas, and Czech troops will be instructed to view Polish citizens as (possibly treacherous) friends, who are to be treated well, if at a bit of a distance.

________________________

## Part 2: Military Operations

Military operations will be as follows:

The Military will wait for a period while the StB concludes operations in the southernmost intelligence districts, as outlined above. Upon said completion, the expeditionary force will immediately move into the area and surround whichever major compound is located there. 

Should said compound be located in an urban area, the following tactics will be utilized:

* 70% of the armoured units will block major routes out of the area, and reconnaissance JU-88s will circle the area

* Infantry will be divided into ""cordon"" troops, and ""kick"" troops. Cordon troops and Kick troops will be issued AH-IV tankettes at a 70:30 ratio. Kick troops will also be accompanied by 30% of armoured units

* Tito guns will be placed at major exits to the urban area, and used to ward off attempts to escape attempts

* All vehicles exiting will be searched. All will be denied entry.

* Those who flee will be searched for indication of allegiance, and interned briefly. All individuals will be denied entry. StB agents will be lying in wait at safehouses that have been already cleared, and homes of individuals not yet arrested, in case any Insurgents make it out of the cordon and attempt to contact allies.

* Messerschmitt Me 323 E-2 Cargo planes will conduct a leaflet-drop run. Leaflets will inform the reader that the area cordoned off has been marked as a terrorist stronghold, and will be assaulted imminently. They will be advised to lay down arms and surrender to surrounding forces. They will inform the reader that if they remain in the zone, they will be subject to search and seizure, and may be mistaken for a terrorist combatant during firefights.

* After a period of time long enough for any recipients to exit the area if they so choose, ""Kick"" troops will enter the area the ""cordon"" troops are surrounding. They will converge on the estimated stronghold location and engage any armed individuals. They will be authorized to breach through buildings to protect themselves from fire if need be. 

* Armed individuals attempting to breach the cordon will be shot, a section of infantry will be on hand to converge on breakout attempts to assist cordon troops

* Once at the stronghold location, they will kill all combatants and arrest all non-combatants

* The Cordon troops will then assist the Kick troops in clearing up any resistance, and anyone arrested during this process will be handed over to the Polish government.


Operations in Rural/Wilderness areas:

* Troops will be split into ""Cordon"" and ""Kick"" groups.

* There will be a 60:40 split in AH-IVs between the Cordon and Kick troops

* There will be a 40:50 split in Armoured units between Cordon and Kick troops

* These troops will take up positions in a wide area around the target *as quickly as possible while retaining the ability to close the cordon effectively*

* All available artillery will take up positions outside the cordon

* JU-88 recon planes will survey the area, and circle while the operation is conducted. They will report positions and breakout attempts to the Cordon HQ, who will relay important information to Kick leadership and support units.

* Cordon troops will be backed by a small contingent of motorized troops, and 10% of armoured units used. This group, designated ""Clear"" will have the task of quickly responding to any threats that have been recognized and engaged by Cordon troops.

* Upon completion of the cordon, Messerschmitt Me 323 E-2 Cargo planes will conduct a leaflet-drop run. Leaflets will inform the reader that the area cordoned off has been marked as a terrorist stronghold, and will be assaulted imminently. They will be advised to lay down arms and surrender to surrounding forces. They will inform the reader that if they remain in the zone, they must realize the area will soon be saturated with bombs and weapons fire. The pamphlet will guarantee anyone who lays down arms good treatment (This is to get any civilians out of the area before the next stage).

* An appropriate amount of time will elapse to allow anyone to leave. Anyone leaving is to be searched and interned.

* StB agents will be in any other safehouses or known gathering locations in case any insurgents escape

* JU-88 tactical bombers will begin engaging suspected insurgent formations, fortifications and structures. 

* Kick troops will converge on the Target, fully supported by artillery, armour, and airstrikes.

* Kick troops will arrest and intern any who surrender. Kick troops will kill any combatants. 

* Kick troops will clear the target stronghold completely

* Kick troops will thoroughly comb the area to locate any remaining insurgents.

* Kick troops, backed by artillery, will thoroughly burn and demolish any Insurgent-created structures, and confiscate any weapons, vehicles, ammunition, cash, Identification, or other important items

Note how I do not specify *Amounts*. This is because it will be at the individual commander's discretion to decide numbers. That said, the entirety of the expeditionary force will be in one intelligence district at a time, so if they wish, the entire force may be on standby to assist, or may be engaging in general anti-partisan operations.

It is not expected for there to be a stronghold in every district, or even sufficient numbers to warrant anything more than StB collaboration with local police and Garrisons to put down insurgents. Accordingly, such operations as outlined above may not even be necessary. 

The Expeditionary force will generally sweep upwards from the southern border into intelligence districts declared ready by the StB.

StB will remain in a combed districts post-Expeditionary operation in that district, in order to manage any trailing aftermath.

_____________________________________
##Exit Strategy

Upon reaching the Baltic, and officially clearing all districts, the Expeditionary Force will hand over garrisoning/further hunting operations over to Polish troops. Intelligence operations will be formally transferred to Polish intelligence. A number of advisers will remain to aid in both these efforts, but in the wake of these operations, all major bulwarks and strongholds should be smashed. What remains, if anything, will be a scattered few embittered ideologues, which local authorities will surely be able to handle. Czech troops will then return home, as will any other foreign troops engaged in these operations. 

______________________________________

Overall, the guiding principles of the campaign will be:

* Separate the guerrilla from sympathetic layers of the population, or areas they are supported in.

* Occupy the zones that the guerrillas previously operated from, making the area dangerous for the insurgents and turning the people against the guerrilla movement; and

* Coordinate actions over a wide area and for a long enough time that the guerrilla is denied access to the population centres that could support him.
_______________________________
**MILITARY ASSAULTS AS OUTLINED ABOVE WILL ONLY TAKE PLACE IF THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATION OF INSURGENTS, INSURGENT  CAMPS, OR A GENUINELY INSURGENT-CONTROLLED SECTION OF TERRITORY. OTHERWISE GENERAL ANTI-PARTISAN TACTICS WILL BE USED, NOT NECESSARILY THE OUTLINED TACTICS**

____________________________

Finally, Czechoslovakia would like for the DRG and Poland (And the USSR, if available), to contribute a similar amount of troops, and appeal to any other communist nations who wish to see these terrible insurgents put down once and for all. These troops would be nominally under control of an ""Eastern Bloc Expeditionary HQ"", which would co-ordinate all forces in tactics as outlined above. If anyone else contributes troops, multiple districts can be assaulted at once. The more troops committed, the more lighting-fast our operations can be.

Forwards to the International Revolution, comrades!

We've been good friends for over 5 years (since the first day of freshman year of high school), and now we're 19 year old sophomores, going to universities about 5 hours apart.  We're starting our 2nd year long-distance, and it's been tough, of course.  But I really like our relationship, I love her, and now at 2+ years it's clear we have something going for us.  


One thing that we've always stood by is that we owe it to ourselves to act in our own best interests in terms of seizing opportunities.  We had a chance to go to school together, and we agreed it would be a bad decision because we both had different schools that were good fits for us.  So we made the sacrifice to go long distance instead.  Last summer, when we were finally back in our hometown together, we had jobs that kept us out of the house at opposite hours of the day, so our precious summer together was severely limited.  But we were determined to spend our summers in ways that were best for us - we compromise on a lot of things in our relationship, but we've always said that if we're meant to be then these things are just bumps in the road.


2 days ago I interviewed for another internship, and I feel pretty good about my chances of getting it.  The problem is that it's 14 hours from home.  It's undeniably a great opportunity - it's in my prospective career field, dealing with a subject that I think I'm really interested in and want to learn more about.  It pays well.  It's perfect, except for the distance.  If I get it, I'm going to accept.  I have to.  But man, it fucking blows.  It feels selfish to take it, and honestly I'm just tired of being apart from my girlfriend.  We keep pushing, telling each other that it's only for a limited amount of time.  That after this it's going to be such a treat to be able to see each other on a daily basis.  But I'm tired of waiting.  At some point, we become serious enough that we both weigh in on these decisions, right?  At some point, you have to stop being selfish and start doing what's best for the both of us.  And I know in my head that 19 years old is not the time to be doing that, but man I wish it was.


I should also tell you that I have a serious travel bug.  I love going new places, and as often as I can squeeze in adventure I do.  Recently this has meant road trips with my best friend (because my girlfriend has family issues that keep her at home.  That's a different story.)  I'm working hard at school and I stay busy in the summers, so I don't have time for much, but my goal is that as soon as I graduate I'm going to take off for a while - hopefully several months, and hopefully with my girlfriend - before I start my job.  And after that I just want to travel as much as I can with her.  It's a literal ache though - not a lecture goes by that I don't daydream about traveling somewhere new.


All of this just has me tied up in knots.  I desperately want to travel, and honestly there's a large part of me that just wants to ditch school altogether and go - to take my girlfriend, and make it a reality right now.   Part of me feels absolutely shitty that we insist on dating when we both have so much else going on.  She doesn't know that I interviewed, and if I do get this new position I know it's going to be more shitty times for both of us.  I could make that easier by just giving up right now, and freeing up both of us to do our own things without having an emotional commitment to someone hundreds of miles away.  And part of me is trying to hang on, in the hopes that things will go according to plan.  In 4 years I could have a great degree, work experience, a beautiful girlfriend, and the opportunity to travel the world.  It sounds too good to be true, and that brings me back to wondering if I need to seize the day and go now.

What I am looking for:

So basically, I'm having trouble emotionally handling everything that is happening around me.
I am here asking for emotional support, and how the HECK I can keep my chin up?

Did I grow up in an abusive household?

How is my outlook on all this?

Am I crazy?

Am I a bad person?

Am I a bad daughter? 

Am I just 'taking shit' about them?

Should I be scared? Because I'm just so scared.


I've learned that I have a positive outlook compared to them, and all my friends (who know my family) do not like my family members. My best friend of 10+ years, who has grown up with me, has been great with giving me honest opinions on if I am correct when I say that my family members are miserable, sad people, or if I am being too harsh on them (hint: she thinks they are miserable, sad people and that it's not my fault). 


Short background of the issue?..:

Ever since I can remember, my parents have had a bad relationship. I can only remember seeing them kiss once. I'm not sure if they stayed together for the kids, or because my mother is afraid of being alone and always hoped that my dad would make good money again. I think now she just feels stuck. 
I've normally always been able to handle their rainstorm relationship- in a 'it is what it is' kind of way. But I have a very small family, and only one set of grandparents. Now that my grandparents are in an Assisted Living Facility and are dying, its causing SO much more negative energy around us. I have a mother and father, one younger sister, one set of grandparents[late 80s], one aunt and uncle[late 60s], and two older cousins in their 30s. 


Everyone in my family has always been very negative. There was never a happy day in the house when I lived there, and still isn't now that I am back here, visiting for two months. They never smile, do not talk to each other, even the house is always dark- they don't like to turn the lights on. They claim that they cannot afford to go to a therapist, and instead they just do the same thing every day, in our dark house (they draw the curtains closed even if its a beautiful day out, like it was today!). They don't speak to each other very nicely, and I've learned how to have a healthy relationship by trying to NOT be like them.


Ok. Let's start with mom. This will be THE longest one, and all after them will be very short, I promise. :)


Mom: 

My mom grew up in an abusive household. She was the youngest of like 8 kids, and she says that she doesn't know if they were all even born to the same father, because her mother always had different boyfriends. She has always been vague with her answers about how exactly it was abusive. My sis and I, while growing up, always tried prying out of her what exactly happened to her as a kid...what the heck was so terrible that she doesn't talk to anyone anymore? I have never met my mother's parents, I don't even know their names. Her mother died when I was around 10 I think. Of our family, only she went to the funeral. Also, her father recently died- and she wasn't able to go to the funeral because no one told her about it (her father left her mother when my mom was young. He got remarried, and years later tried getting in touch with my sister and I. My mom gave me letters that he had sent us, but I personally refused to write back to him because he abandoned my mom when she was little. My mom found out that he died, because the ONE sister that she still keeps in touch with found out through Facebook that he had died. His new wife (the one that he married after he left my mom's mother) did not tell any of his 'other' kids (my mom and her siblings) about his funeral. 

When my mom was 13, she ran away, because all her siblings had moved out of the house. The police found her a years later, and when they tried to bring her back to her mom, my mom's mom said ""if you bring her back I'll kill her"" so my mom went into foster care.

If you've seen the movie White Oleander, the daughters journey with Foster Care families is exactly like my moms (as my mom has said). All bad, abusive, etc. She moved out of her last one at 18, never had much money, and spent over 10 years graduating with her bachelors cuz she couldn't afford to live and go to school. Met my dad in her 30s, got married, had two kids.


When I was growing up, my mom was always a very anxious person. My sister and I used to jokingly make fun of her, because she was always afraid of us 'getting raped'. We weren't allowed to do anything. She was very strict with what we did and where we went- but it was in a ""my mother is very, very scared something will happen to us"" kind of way. As teenagers, the reason why we couldn't go to a concert was not because we were too young, but because we ""would get raped"". Things like that. Now, as an adult, I see it's no joking matter, and I don't know why she always had such fear. She would always jump from 0-100 with anything. If we fell, she would scream. I became a very dramatic teenager, and my sister and I both developed severe anxiety. We were constantly afraid of doing anything. My mom has a sick sense of humor, and now sarcastically jokes that she grew up always thinking she was just a worrywart, but it turns out it was anxiety. ""Whoops!"" She'll say. My sis and I have told her she should get therapy, but she always makes up an excuse not to. 


Also, my mother has made clear to us, and my father, that she married him because she wanted kids and he had a good job. She wanted to be a stay at home mom, and blamed him for the fact that she ended up having to work, and now she REALLY blames him because she is in her 60s and is the sole provider of the household. She has always ""hated her job"", with every job she has ever had. She always encouraged my sis and I to marry rich, that way we would never have to work. Surprise surprise- my sis and I love working and are both in the Human Rights sector and love working and learning. But when we were teenagers, she was always impressed if a boy drove up with a nice car. Or was from a good town. Her reasoning behind this was ""Marry him and you'll never have to worry about a thing!"" 


I guess I'll also say that I feel like she always takes other peoples problems, and makes them her problems. When my sis actually came out as Lesbian, my mom blamed herself and said it was because my sis was bullied in school and that my mom didn't do enough to stop it. When I was diagnosed with Tourette's Syndrome as a child, my mom thinks its her fault and has apologised my entire life for it (it does NOT affect my life whatsoever! I have it only lightly. People don't even know unless I tell them.) My mom blames my father for all of her problems, and blames herself for her childrens problems. All my life I've always heard her say ""This isn't how I wanted my life to be"". 


My analysis:

 I think, bottomline, my mom should have gotten therapy before she got married and had kids. I think my sis and I developed issues growing up because of her. Looking back on my childhood with adult eyes, I realise now that she overreacted with any issue that my sis and I had. I once got mad at her that I couldn't go out with my friends, and so she threw herself on the ground, started pounding the floor with her fists (exactly like a toddler) and cried. It really scared me. It was like she never expected having teenagers to be difficult. Sometimes I blame her for her own issues, sometimes I blame her for my own issues growing up, and sometimes I feel its not her fault at all and she's just a child trapped in an adults body, who never got to grow up.


Dad:

Dad is a loser. I love my dad, but he's a loser. I always went back and forth on whether or not I thought he was a shitty dad or not, but now I realize he has always been a great dad, but a bad husband. 


My dad never says anything bad about my mom. To this day, he says that he loves her, but I've never heard my mom say that to my dad. He always says that my mom is SUCH a good mom, and that she loves us. Constantly praises her. Once when I was younger, I woke up to them fighting in the morning, and he was yelling at my mom, saying ""You won't even hold my hand anymore!"". Now, my dad also hates working. He lost his job because of the economy crash when I was younger, and ever since then he couldn't hold down a job. I grew up not realising that- I just thought my dad had all these cool jobs. He was a bartender, worked at concert venues, invested in Start-ups, and worked a lot of blue collar jobs that teenagers worked. He makes me mad, because he'll try to open up to me, and tell me about how he hates working and just doesn't want to anymore. Yet the same day, he'll tell my mom that he can't WAIT to start working again and was looking for jobs all day. Additionally, I've learned that he is a kiss-ass and is very gullible (finally I know where I got that from!). He always thinks something is a good deal, is easy to fool, and gets way too excited about the possibilities of...any potential job/scenario that could bring in a lot of money. My father is a dreamer and doesn't realise he is dreaming until he is rudely woken up. He also has a BAD temper and tries to solve anything by yelling. He's been fired for saying 'Fuck you' to his boss. When my parents found out I was watching porn as a teenager, he screamed at me and foamed at the mouth (it was, of course, only spit! He was so busy yelling I don't think he remembered to take a breath and swallow), and threw a chair across the room. He has never hit me, but I bet its because my mom didn't let him. He has shook me very hard before, and tapped his fingers against my head very hard when asking me ""What were you thinking?"" My dad doesn't raise his voice, he screams. If he is on the phone with some kind of customer service, he has a 'spiel' of some sorts that he does, where he thinks he can get the best service by belittling the person on the other end of the line, yelling, calling them stupid, and asking to speak to a manager. Its gotten to the point where I know what he's going to say next.


Sis: 

Sis is doing okay, now. And I say that cuz I have faith in her. She always had issues growing up- she was apparently raped (forgive me- I say 'apparently' because she had lied about a lot before but I will get to that part soon!), came out as bi as a teen, then came out as Lesbian. She did a lot of drugs, but not anymore. I really don't think she was ever addicted- I think she just experimented. She always did great in school, then went to a good college, graduated almost top of her class, and is now working as a waitress in a nice little hip city, in a cute apartment, trying to find real work. She says that she's happy doing what she's doing and may not try to find a real job anytime soon. This concerns my mom, and not so much my dad (that's typical). But I do feel she's doing great, and she'll get a real job when she's ready. She's smart and not lazy.


My sis first went to a psych ward when she was 16. I was in college and no one told me. She threatened to kill herself. Did the same thing a year later. She finally told my parents that she was raped, and my mom said it was her fault(my mom said it was my MOM's fault). She was diagnosed with depression, and was on meds at 17. She still did drugs, despite being on anti depressives. She snuck out a lot, lief about a lot, and stole sometimes. Then, when she was in college, she self diagnosed herself as manic depressive. Recently, her college psych properly diagnosed her with Bi Polar disorder. I don't see it- but I feel that a psych of course knows more than I do. My sis is hoping to get mood stabilizers soon.


Growing up, she was always very combative and would threaten to kill herself if my mom didn't let her hang out with her friends, or buy her something. I always felt that she did this because she knew how to take advantage of our vulnerable mother- who was so afraid of my sis killing herself that she would give in and give her whatever she wanted. (An ipod, new clothes, a haircut).


My sis and I barely speak, but I think that's both of our faults. I hated her when I was growing up for how she caused so much drama in the house, and I refused to speak to her. So I think she just got used to it, and that became ""our way"" of being with each other. It's getting better now- I'm not as immature, and I feel she's becoming...healthier. I really do have faith that we can have a healthy future together. Her and I even get together sometimes to talk about our parents and try to figure it out together. I really appreciate when we can do that- it makes me feel like we're figuring out the puzzle of our childhood, which is not something we can do alone. I still think I have to give her more time though, because she still needs to get a handle on her emotions. She still can go from 0-100 very quickly, just like my dad. But I have faith that that'll change because I know I was still like that when I was 22 as well.




Me:

Sometimes I think I'm doing great in life, other times I think I'm a loser as well. I have never had a family that supports me and what I do. They are willing to let me fall back on them if needed (which I have never, so far) but they will never tell me what I'm doing is good. 


Basically, I grew up REALLY angry, yet walked on eggshells around everyone at home. I've never been able to talk to my parents about any emotional stuff, because they can't handle it. Mom either freaks out, or dad yells. I couldn't go for advice on boys or anything. I always felt guilty for anything- bad tests, grades, saying something that would make mom go lay in bed all day, being alive, anything. Then, I wanted to travel and see the world. I wanted to go after high school, before college. Mom talked me out of it, saying it was dangerous and I'd get killed. I graduated college, and went anyway (Still, the only thing I regret in life is NOT travelling right after highschool. I would have had a different life route.) I'm not going to get into how miserable and unsupportive my family was of me travelling after college- but basically I was talking to a guy online (dangerous, yes.) who lived in another country. He helped me get a job, apply for a visa, and I went. Him and I ended up dating for almost three years, and he was a blessing. I kept travelling with him and he helped me grow up and learn that the whole world isn't trying to rape and kill me.

Him and I broke up because I grew up so much, that I learned who I was, and that I wanted to get another degree, and eventually settle down. He didn't want that, so we ended. (still a wonderful man) I am now studying for my Masters abroad in a different country, speak two languages, and am learning a third. I think I do great with communicating with people, relationships in general, and building up my resume and networks. I feel very mature and can't wait to be done with my graduate degree and get a job somewhere, GET THERAPY, and settle down. Folks still make me question my life choices, but I just hope I'll end up okay. Sometimes I'm afraid that I'm too old to have only had ONE real job. I'm afraid that I'm running out of time. I get my masters degree in July 2017 and I'm hoping to work find a real job either before that, or immediately after. I already have an internship lined up in another country, which I go to in 2 months!


  **tl;dr**: Family members are an emotional mess. Are very depressed and have big issues (I feel). This has been making me question my sanity, and I can't handle the emotional stress. I go into detail about what they're like to maybe get advice on how I should go about everything.


Thanks everyone!"

I always went back and forth on whether or not I thought he was a shitty dad or not, but now I realize he has always been a great dad, but a bad husband. My dad was prom king, football quarterback..Mr. Popular growing up. Very good looking. Was a meathead, funny, all that jazz. In the 80s he did a lot of coke (who didn't?) but it kinda got a hold of him and he sold his business for 30,000 and blew it all on coke. I only know because my sis got that out of my mom, who is always keen to make my dad sound like a bad person.


My dad never says anything bad about my mom. To this day, he says that he loves her, but I've never heard my mom say that to my dad.

My father is a dreamer and doesn't realise he is dreaming until he is rudely woken up. He also has a BAD temper and tries to solve anything by yelling. He's been fired for saying 'Fuck you' to his boss. When my parents found out I was watching porn as a teenager, he screamed at me and foamed at the mouth (it was, of course, only spit! He was so busy yelling I don't think he remembered to take a breath and swallow), and threw a chair across the room. He has never hit me, but I bet its because my mom didn't let him.

She says that she's happy doing what she's doing and may not try to find a real job anytime soon. This concerns my mom, and not so much my dad (that's typical). But I do feel she's doing great, and she'll get a real job when she's ready. She's smart and not lazy.


My sis first went to a psych ward when she was 16. I was in college and no one told me. She threatened to kill herself. Did the same thing a year later. She finally told my parents that she was raped, and my mom said it was her fault(my mom said it was my MOM's fault). She was diagnosed with depression, and was on meds at 17. She still did drugs, despite being on anti depressives. She snuck out a lot, lief about a lot, and stole sometimes. Then, when she was in college, she self diagnosed herself as manic depressive. Recently, her college psych properly diagnosed her with Bi Polar disorder. I don't see it- but I feel that a psych of course knows more than I do. My sis is hoping to get mood stabilizers soon.


Growing up, she was always very combative and would threaten to kill herself if my mom didn't let her hang out with her friends, or buy her something. I always felt that she did this because she knew how to take advantage of our vulnerable mother- who was so afraid of my sis killing herself that she would give in and give her whatever she wanted. (An ipod, new clothes, a haircut).
My sis and I barely speak, but I think that's both of our faults. I hated her when I was growing up for how she caused so much drama in the house, and I refused to speak to her. So I think she just got used to it, and that became ""our way"" of being with each other. It's getting better now- I'm not as immature, and I feel she's becoming...healthier. I really do have faith that we can have a healthy future together. Her and I even get together sometimes to talk about our parents and try to figure it out together. I really appreciate when we can do that- it makes me feel like we're figuring out the puzzle of our childhood, which is not something we can do alone. I still think I have to give her more time though, because she still needs to get a handle on her emotions. She still can go from 0-100 very quickly, just like my dad. But I have faith that that'll change because I know I was still like that when I was 22 as well.


The rest of my family:

Uncle is my dad's brother. Did a lot of crazy stuff in his life (boxer, Air force), made some bad investments and lost his house WHILE he had a wife and two kids (my aunt and cousins). He has his first stroke right afterwards. I only have memories of him being in a wheelchair, talking crazy. My Cousin Matt, the oldest child, had a tough childhood because of the finances and that he wasn't able to have a 'real' dad. Things are better now, and he's got a job. My Cousin Lisa, the younger child, is now a nurse and is also doing good. But neither of them talk to us, really. None of us are close.


Grandparents:

Grandparents are madly in love. Healthiest relationship ever. Grandma got Alzheimers and is in stage 7. They both live in an Assisted Living Facility because of this. I visit them literally every day, now that I am home, and Grandpa says every time how he is depressed and hates living there. They WERE rich, and we all had honestly HUGE big ass inheritances. Those are now gone, since all the money has gone towards taking care of my grandparents. They tell us they want to die every day.


Me:

Sometimes I think I'm doing great in life, other times I think I'm a loser as well. I have never had a family that supports me and what I do. They are willing to let me fall back on them if needed (which I have never, so far) but they will never tell me what I'm doing is good.


Basically, I grew up REALLY angry, yet walked on eggshells around everyone at home. I've never been able to talk to my parents about any emotional stuff, because they can't handle it. Mom either freaks out, or dad yells. I couldn't go for advice on boys or anything. I always felt guilty for anything- bad tests, grades, saying something that would make mom go lay in bed all day, being alive, anything. Then, I wanted to travel and see the world. I wanted to go after high school, before college. Mom talked me out of it, saying it was dangerous and I'd get killed. I graduated college, and went anyway (Still, the only thing I regret in life is NOT travelling right after highschool. I would have had a different life route.) I'm not going to get into how miserable and unsupportive my family was of me travelling after college- but basically I was talking to a guy online (dangerous, yes.) who lived in another country. He helped me get a job, apply for a visa, and I went. Him and I ended up dating for almost three years, and he was a blessing. I kept travelling with him and he helped me grow up and learn that the whole world isn't trying to rape and kill me.
Him and I broke up because I grew up so much, that I learned who I was, and that I wanted to get another degree, and eventually settle down. He didn't want that, so we ended. (still a wonderful man) I am now studying for my Masters abroad in a different country, speak two languages, and am learning a third. I think I do great with communicating with people, relationships in general, and building up my resume and networks. I feel very mature and can't wait to be done with my graduate degree and get a job somewhere, GET THERAPY, and settle down. Folks still make me question my life choices, but I just hope I'll end up okay. Sometimes I'm afraid that I'm too old to have only had ONE real job. I'm afraid that I'm running out of time. I get my masters degree in July 2017 and I'm hoping to work find a real job either before that, or immediately after. I already have an internship lined up in another country, which I go to in 2 months!


tl;dr: Family members are an emotional mess. Are very depressed and have big issues (I feel). This has been making me question my sanity, and I can't handle the emotional stress. I go into detail about what they're like to maybe get advice on how I should go about everything.


Thanks everyone!"
52zvnf,1,2016-09-15,Might be getting a job offer with a company without benefits. What should I know?,throwawaybenefits999,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/52zvnf/might_be_getting_a_job_offer_with_a_company/,"Hello everyone! I'm using a throwaway here.

I'm a recent college graduate with an associates degree. I'm only 20 years old and I have been interviewing with a small company of only 11 people. It has been EXTREMELY HARD to find a job despite having a degree in computer programming when I only have an internship, a small portfolio hosted on LinkedIn and no work experience. I've also been out of college for 4 months.

I have sought the help of a tech recruiter through LinkedIn who had told me about the company. He told me over the phone that they're willing to pay anywhere in the $50,000 to $55,000 range, but because they are a small private company they offer no benefits. I live in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, so I believe that range for salary is the average but I have no idea how to budget for the various insurances I need.

I have found out today that I'm getting my 2nd interview with the company, and the tech recruiter I've been working with says they really want to hire me and might give me an offer on the spot. The job seems really like a great fit for me, but I'm still somewhat concerned by the fact it offers no benefits. I'm still under 26, so I am covered by my parents health insurance for now. I don't have a car nor a driver's license, so I don't need car insurance yet (and the company is about a 10 minute walk from where I live, and the apartment I want to move into is also about that same walking distance). But I'm worried about things like 401k's and retirement planning, car insurance and health insurance for the future, and renter's insurance for when I eventually move out of my parents house. On top of this, I want to be able to afford going back to school to get a bachelors degree, and still make a decent living.

If I am offered a job on the spot, how should I handle negotiating for a salary that can both give me a good wage and help me pay for the benefits I will need to get on my own? How do I get insurance on my own? If they offer something extremely low, how can I counter or know when to walk away?"

My background is Scottish and I am as white and pale as anyone you have ever encountered. I attended university in my early 20's and entered the construction field where I earned great money for my age allowing me to purchase my first home. Like alot of young people I realized that what I thought I wanted as a career just wasn't what I could see myself doing for the rest of my life so I rented out my home and decided to follow my dreams in the US. After getting my student Visa I attended school in Manhattan. The way it worked was I had to prove that I had enough money available so that I wouldn't have to work while going to school, and that's what I did. I would wake up at 8 in the morning to head to school, finish by four and then head to an internship program where I'd work from four until 11 at night. I busted my ass ever day not getting paid a dime just to learn. The day came where I had to think about going home, but I love the US and I loved my time in NY and all the friends I made. So I started talking to a immigration lawyer. The first thing he said to me was ""you would have a better chance being a Somalian cab driver that can't speak a word of English than a Canadian if you want to be here"" and that is the honest truth. I had already put at least $100,000 of my own money into the US economy between schooling and living expenses. I had already proven I wouldn't be a burden. But I had to return home. Now I own a business here and am about to open another. As Americans you need to get out and vote. You need to be hard on illegal immigration because the ones that don't want to be a burden are the ones that don't want to break the law. Get angry. I know I am angry everytime I see someone who can't speak the language. Everytime I see someone who leaches off the system. Everytime I see someone committing crimes. Because I wanted to be productive and so do many many others. "
5308n0,1,2016-09-16,21 [M4F] - Starting Over,burnbabyburner69,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5308n0/21_m4f_starting_over/,"On September 22nd, 2036, a deep space probe was launched from Cape Canaveral. Its creators had designed it to detect supernovas in far away galaxies, but they had no idea that it's destiny laid in another direction. In order to escape the solar system, it had to use the Sun as a gravity assist. Readings taken from the probe as it circled the Sun were almost ignored completely, as many thought that the probe's sensors wouldn't read any significant information. Luckily though, a team of interns had no better work to do at the time and combed over the data as a way to keep their skills honed. One of them found an abnormal measurement and reported it to her superiors, but she got no word back about it. She figured that it must have been nothing. She was wrong. As soon as her superior looked over her discovery, he knew something was amiss. He went straight to the top and a small, top-secret task force was commissioned to investigate the measurement. A couple decades passed by before they reached their conclusion. The chemical makeup of the Sun was not nearly as stable as had been accepted for so long. The Earth didn't have billions of years left before the Sun blew up, it had hundreds.

President Alvarez had just been sworn in weeks before he was informed of the matter. While still keeping the veil of a normal presidency around him, he spent the entirety of his 8 year term researching the options that Earth had left. It was settled within a year that Earth was doomed. The Sun had reached the point of no return centuries ago and moving the Earth out of the blast radius was [out of the question](http://imgur.com/a/SIfaO).

Obviously, there had to be some kind of evacuation, but technology was extremely limited. Even when the other governments of the world were contacted, their pooled efforts could only create one spaceship that had could carry the resources necessary for sustaining life far enough away from the Sun. It wasn't all doom and gloom though. The research on designing the base accelerated quickly, and the spaceship itself was designed in less than a decade. The same probe that discovered the Sun's fatal flaw was retasked to scout out planets, and a small list of acceptable candidates was assembled quickly. Models suggested that the primary planet candidate could have its atmosphere be made breathable in less than a century and that the soil could be made farmable, though that would take a significantly longer amount of time.

All that was easy. The hard part came when it was time to select the people to fill the ark, as most of the people who knew of it called it. Some thought they should all be engineers, people who could manage the base well and troubleshoot mechanical problems the easiest. Others wanted a more balanced team that could manage all sorts of things, like the plants or the crew's health. A few politicians even suggested that the crew should be made of philosophers and artists to preserve Earth culture.

The decision was largely made for them though as two new problems surfaced. First, the cryogenics systems didn't develop as nicely as the others. Tests on people over 50 were catastrophic, with volunteers not lasting more than a few days before the tests had to be stopped for safety reasons. Further tests and calculations estimated that no one over 40 could survive the journey. To add onto the problems, volunteers with even average amounts of stress were much more likely to suffer heart attacks in their sleep state. The second problem was the elephant in the room that everyone tried to ignore for as long as possible. To continue the human race, the crew had to breed. But the ship could only hold six people, five women and one man to ensure long term species procreation. There would have to be incest just to create a third generation. Knowing that it had to be done, research was done on the science of incestuous breeding and it was found that only .0001% of the population had the genes necessary to sustain a healthy family tree.

With these two factors in mind, the most qualified candidates were identified from a short list. Most people who were involved in the decision wanted the candidates to be trained and debriefed extensively before the launch. However, the cryogenic scientists made it clear that the stress of knowing the fate of humanity was to be carried on their shoulders was far too much. The only plan that ensured the safety of the candidates was to sedate them in their sleep and put them into the cryochambers without even the slightest bit of warning or preparation.

Thousands of years later, the lights in the spaceship turned on. It had landed on the virgin planet just as the scientists and engineers designed it to. The cryochambers started their three day reanimation process, and once the crew members exited, they barely had a chance to speak to each other before a video played in the center of the room.

""Hello, I'm Dr. Baker. Welcome to Project Phoenix.""

***

This is obviously a long term prompt that will focus on breeding, and if the RP goes on for a long time, incest. However, this most likely isn't going to be a sex-focused RP. The main focus will most likely be on the characters themselves as they go through the emotions of knowing they're the last humans alive and the struggles that they'll face just to survive and deal with each other. I'm looking for realistic character development, with each one taking a different view on their situation. Breeding is the only truly necessary kink for this RP, but others can be discussed. Here's my [kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/ZTXuOUH.png) if you want to check it out. I'm always open to doing this prompt, so no matter when you're reading this, feel free to shoot me an orange envelope!"
530a34,4,2016-09-16,CorpSINS Episode 29 Recap,Demmalition1,HyperRPG,https://www.reddit.com/r/HyperRPG/comments/530a34/corpsins_episode_29_recap/,"Hey all, a short recap of S1-E29 for you.

&amp;nbsp;

The night opens with the team finding themselves in the hospital after the near-deadly ambush by Scarlet Fyre.  Though Scarlet Fyre killed their mark, Emile Corrigan, they did manage to save District Attorney Dana Oakes.  The team is licking their wounds, Cromwell and Fang took the brunt of the beatings.  Interestingly, Cromwell believes in reincarnation and hallucinated for a bit that he came back as an owlbear, much to the nurse's humor.  Fang, on the other hand, wakes up shackled to her bed and has to be spoonfed her jello by Ma1n.

&amp;nbsp;

Once regrouped in the hospital (and Fang is freed from her bed), the team heads to meet Dana in her secure wing of the hospital.  She then works with the Draco Foundation (Miss. J) to pressure the group into getting information on Scarlet Fyre.  In order to do this, they must send Fang undercover back into the prison that she was previously in.  Though Fang initially objects, she relents when they would just send her back for her actual crimes of 4 parole violations in the 2 or 3 months since getting out of jail and joining MMFEC.  In return, all of the team will receive 10k Nuyen and Fang will have her Criminal-SIN erased.  Elsie also joins in and poses as an intern Social Worker for the prison.  As a side note, we find out that Fang's last name really was Glasgow (and possibly that her real first name is Shell/Michelle, but not confirmed) and that only 3 of the 4 members of MMFEC are considered friends (my bet is on Elsie being the non-friend)!

&amp;nbsp;

Meanwhile, the rest of the team goes back to the apartment complex from earlier to retrieve Cromwell's grenade that he hid in the hopes of remote detonation.  He intended to kill Corrigan himself once Oaks' interrogation was over.  In the van, Ma1n has the brilliant idea of dressing as a Lone Star cop Detective Jo Lord, working alongside Cromwell's disguise of Charlie Hammer, Knight Errant detective.  Mordecai also joins the fray as a bounty hunter in a poncho named Casper Bartholomew.  Mordecai reveals that he was adopted and that although he never knew his real parents, though the fact that the same Spirit of Man always shows up to help him means that it must be his father.  Unfortunately, he can never know the truth due to the fact that they can't speak to one another.  Ma1n reveals that her birthday is June 20th.

&amp;nbsp;

They make it past Seth, the guard, and head up to the apartment.  Once there, they quickly defeat a guard spirit put there (by the police?  Humanis?) and take a mysterious device that was attached to the computer.  Ma1n's contact reveals to the audience that Ma1n was once a UCAS citizen (the same contact from earlier who talked to Ma1n about her parents, so this is either a close childhood friend or a family member).  Once in a clean room, the device is revealed to take any file sent to it, plant a high-level databomb, and send it to the database of First Corporation Bank (which has close ties to Humanis and Brackhaven).

&amp;nbsp;

Returning to Elsie and Fang's prison extravaganza, Fang discovers that Orange is indeed the new Black when she meets her mark, former Scarlet Fyre member Lotte Sokolov.  She has cybernetic legs and a mean attitude backed up by a thick Russian accent.  Though Fang and Sokolov have issues connecting at first, they eventually agree to work together to survive in prison.  Fang, through the use of crayon drawings, relays to Elsie (who is now in the prison under her guise as a Social Worker and has both Fang and Sokolov's cases thanks to the help of Ma1n) that Sokolov wants Bliss.  The first meeting between Elsie and Sokolov is rocky at best but goes better the second time when Sokolov receives her drugs.

&amp;nbsp;

Back in her cell, Sokolov reveals that the rest of Scarlet Fyre abandoned her after the Dzhugashvili rescue.  Her mission was to secure the safehouse with explosives, but once the team was busted she was abandoned while they escaped, leaving her with bad blood between them.  Scarlet Fyre consists of:

- Fiero:  Spirit Summoning Mage and twin of Rosa. Favors fire spirits and can summon Spirit of Man too.

- Rosa:  Mage Face and twin of Fiero.  Is never the same person twice and can also summon fire spirits.

- Tigh:  Street Samurai who is HEAVILY augmented and prefers melee combat. Cromwell considers him the worst.

-  Rebecca/""Becky""/""Queen B."":  Decker and Rigger who favors heavy combat drones and wasp-persona based attacks.  Is literally the wurst!

&amp;nbsp;

Now with everything in place, how will the team get Fang out?  Will the detectives get to the bottom of the case?  Find out on September 21st when we return!

I'm not posting it in dating_advice, since I imagine that skews mostly Western. I'm being really vulnerable here, so please be nice? If this is inappropriate to post here, please let me know.


My ex is a native Korean that dropped out of a Korean university, studied in Russia for a year, then got her degree at UCLA. She speaks near-fluent English. She's 24 (int'l age). She moved back here after graduating with a major in communications and a minor in film. She lives with her parents, as is custom, though they've agreed she should move out once she has income due to interpersonal strife. She's currently job searching. She had an internship at an advertising agency, but she couldn't handle the culture and work.


I'm an American, born and raised in south Florida, having lived in Atlanta, Nashville, San Francisco, and LA, in that order. I'm 28 (int'l age). I just moved to Seoul, and I'll soon be working for one of the chaebols as a software engineer. I only speak English, but I'm learning Korean, if slowly. I decided I wanted to move to Seoul someday before I even met her, but meeting her made me realize someday could be now. Mostly a ""why not?"" feeling.


Story time.


We matched on Tinder in January or February while she was at UCLA. I recently learned that I look like the Western version of her most recent ex. We went on our first date March 27 after numerous delays due to sickness and travel and whatnot. After that, things went very quickly, as I usually tend to rush things. There was some strife around being ""official,"" mostly I was pushing. Beyond that, things started excellently. We went on several adventures. Lots of dates. Intimate life was incredible. We got to know each other's friends. Everything was good. 

I made several mistakes early on, but they ended up mostly okay. On our third date, I took her to dinner at my company. My goal was to introduce her to my coworkers. We sat next to a group of them, and they were talking about compensation in a very heated manner. I tend to get hyper-focused on things, and I was searching for an opportunity to interrupt the conversation, change it, and introduce my date. I was so focused on that, I ended up not talking with her. Eventually, someone else came and sat with us. I introduced them, and we chatted a bit. After only a minute or two, he started asking me about work stuff. I tried to gear the conversation back to the three of us, but no joy. Eventually, we finished eating, and she called an Uber home, clearly unhappy. A short time later, I called her, and she explained things from her point of view. I understood, apologized, explained my thought process and how I wouldn't do it again, apologized profusely even more, and she forgave me. 

I'm friends with most of my exes. I had been dating my most recent ex for 2.5 years, ending in October. She also had a long relationship that ended in October. Not being over our exes was a concern of hers, but I wasn't worried about it. Occasionally, either a habit of mine or an object or something came from an ex, and I'd notice it and mention it. To me, it's just like talking about a memory of an old friend - no big deal. Obviously, I'm an idiot. She eventually asked me to stop mentioning my exes like that, and I complied. She also told me to stop watching porn, which I had issue with.

I still talked to my most recent ex about once a month. We were best friends, regardless of the relationship, and we didn't want to lose each other as friends or get back together. The once a month phone call was a perfect compromise. My girlfriend knew about this but largely put it out of mind. 

After a short time, I started feeling paranoid. I felt like she was always assessing me. This didn't help with my anxiety of over slip-ups during dates. I didn't feel like the relationship was secure. I felt like I was always walking on eggshells. I mentioned this to her, and she told me I had nothing to worry about. I still had the sense that she would drop me at any moment. It was suffocating. 

By this time, June was rapidly approaching, when she was going to move home. She managed to finish a major film project of hers, and her mother was coming to see the screening and help her and her sister prepare to move home. I ended up meeting her mother. She didn't like me, but she didn't necessarily hate me either. It's just that I was neither Korean nor Christian and dating her daughter. My girlfriend was super anxious the whole time, as she and her mother fought very frequently. I was basically her escape. She'd come to my place, or we'd go out. I'd comfort her, and we'd go out to help her de-stress and have fun. 

We decided we'd try to make long distance work, and I decided I was going to move to Korea. She had anxiety that I was moving there for her. I told her I'd wanted to move there, and she was the catalyst for it happening now rather than ""someday."" Her anxiety didn't go away. She didn't want to feel a sense of commitment towards me as a result of moving there. I assured her time and time again that even if she broke up with me, I'd still move there. I explained that she just helped me realize there was nothing stopping me from living abroad now rather than someday. It ended the conversation, but she kept bringing it up again and again.

I went to visit in July for a week. It was wonderful. She taught me many things, showed me around. We went on several dates. I also worked from my company's Seoul office and managed to interview for a role there. I didn't get it, but they introduced me to an SVP at one of the chaebols. He guaranteed me a job. Everything was looking up. Going back to the States was painful, but I told her I'd visit her again in a month and move there shortly after.

We managed to do pretty well over long distance. We chatted every day. I setup a Minecraft Pixelmon server that we played on together. We found a mobile app for couples to send each other dares that we used. We figured things out really well. My feeling of paranoia that she would drop me was still there, though, especially with her mentioning a fear of commitment from my moving there. She was concerned about me leaving my job, and we ended up deciding I wouldn't visit in August. I decided I'd move there end of September, when I expected the job to start. We decided this was okay.

My ex and I wanted to see each other one last time before I left the country. It'd be the first time we saw each other since October, pending when she dropped off something of mine for only a minute once. I talked to my girlfriend about it. She wasn't happy. I didn't see any danger in it, so I felt like she was trying to control me. Again, I'm an idiot. We came to the compromise that I could only see her with a group of people.

I'm still an idiot. She and I met up. I didn't expect this to happen, but I remembered the time when we were dating. In past encounters with exes, that had never been a problem for me. I felt solace in those memories with how suffocated I was feeling in my current relationship. I felt safe. We joined my roommates and some other friends at a nightclub. My ex and I both really like dancing, and things got really heated on the dance floor. Too heated. We managed to chill out, but we'd already danced in manners I'd deem inappropriate. At the end of the night, we said final goodbyes, and she kissed me. I didn't stop her. It was her way of saying goodbye, and I didn't want to ruin it for her.

I didn't tell my girlfriend right away. She had just gotten an internship and was struggling. It was incredibly taxing on her, and she vented to me every day. A couple days after the event, she had decided she was going to quit the job and was feeling good. I brought up the dancing. She was furious. She kept asking me more and more info, and I told her about the kiss. She was even more livid since I wasn't going to volunteer that information. She said this was the worst thing she feared in our relationship. She asked if I felt like it was cheating - my definition of cheating is if you feel like it's cheating, it's cheating. It's not a physical act but a conscious decision of acting disloyally. I told her it did feel like cheating. She asked me why I did it. I didn't have an answer immediately; I didn't know. I told her I could figure it out given a couple of days. I asked if I could think about it and tell her. She said okay.

I thought I had come up with the answer the next day. I'm a junkie for physical affection, and I felt comfortable with my ex. I told her this the next day, and I made an oath to never do it again. She said she had wished the person she had cheated on in the past had given her a second chance, so she was willing to give me one. I was grateful and overjoyed, and I made that evident. 

Over the next couple of days, I resumed business as usual, as if the event had never happened. To me, the matter was closed. After several days of this, she said she couldn't just keep going like nothing happened. I asked her what I could do to help make things better. We never really came up with an answer, but we kept going. She said she felt like she was losing her feelings for me. I asked if it had to do with the distance, and she said yes. I moved up my move date to two weeks from that day and started preparing.

Things were looking up again, for the most part. Then the week before the move, she told me she couldn't do this. We broke up. She cited the cheating, the pressure of feeling commitment, fading feelings - a slew of reasons. I asked if we could still be friends. She said she didn't want to be friends with me. I felt that if I wasn't the kind of person she wanted to be friends with, then why would I want to date her? 

We cut off contact, blocking each other on everything. I couldn't handle it. I ended up contacting her, saying I wanted to at least keep in touch. She didn't really say yes or no. On my way to the airport, she said she would meet me there and help me figure things out, since I only knew one other person, and he was busy. After much back and forth, I said okay and thanks. 

On arrival, I saw a message from her saying there was an old friend who only had one day off from the military and wanted to see her. She had confidence in my ability to take care of myself and figured things out. No problem on my part, and I told her so. I got to my airbnb just fine. 

We maintained contact. We talked like friends. I kept telling her I wanted to see her. She'd respond saying she didn't think it was a good idea. I'm not one to push things, so I didn't. At several points, I became paranoid jealous. In my head, if she was intimate with others during this time, it said to me that she no longer loved me. Any time she mentioned hanging out with friends, the feeling kicked in. It wasn't healthy.

Throughout this whole time, I'd been thinking about the cheating and why I did it. I realized the reason - that sense of paranoia and suffocation. I told her. She interpreted it as putting the blame on her. She called me. I tried to explain that wasn't what I was getting at. I was still at fault, since I should have called things out and fixed them rather than always acquiescing. She was already angry. I told her I still loved her, and we said we'd cut off contact again.

She called me the next day. She apologized for being emotional with me. I told her I needed to see her in person. She said okay, and we met the next day.

We tried to find a public place where we could have privacy, but we couldn't identify any excellent spots. We ended up eating near my place and going back to my airbnb. We chatted some things out. I tried to convince her that we could make things work. I could tell from her body language and how she was approaching things that she missed me. She said she was hurt and felt betrayed. I understood. She said she needed time to heal. I told her we could heal together. She wasn't convinced, but she was taking solace in being near each other again. We ended up sleeping together. After post-coital cuddles and a shower, I thought of something. I knew she wasn't interested in other people - she needed time to herself. That made my jealous paranoia go away. I had a plan. I told her I would wait for her to heal. It would give her the time to heal her wounds and give me the chance to show my loyalty. She didn't like the idea. I told her I was going to do it anyway. She called me an idiot. She said she didn't know how long it would take and wouldn't guarantee anything afterwards. I said it was worth it to me to find out. She called me an idiot several more times. We said goodbye.

I'm still an idiot, so I messaged her the next day. The implicit understanding between us was that we would have time alone, but I couldn't handle it. We resumed talking like friends. The other day, she called me since she had resume work to do but not enough time to do anything meaningful. I was overjoyed to hear her voice again. At the start of the conversation, I told myself to simply be thankful she's comfortable talking to me and not to look a gift horse in the mouth. Everything started fine, but I told her I wanted to see her again. She again told me she didn't feel like it was a good idea. I asked why. She said it would be painful. I asked her why she was still messaging me if talking to me was painful. She said she'd stop messaging me. I called her out and asked for a real reason. She said messaging me was still painful, and she thought the understanding was that we weren't going to talk while she healed. I agreed to not message her. I haven't since. This was Sunday.


It's killing me. Any spare moment of thought I have, I'm thinking about her. The jealous paranoia is coming back. I worry that abandoning her feelings for me will be part of her healing. She said she still loves me, but she doesn't want to. I want to know why so I can fix it, but I don't feel like I can go back on my word of saying I won't message her. A part of me is trying to move on by taking an interest in other women, but I want absolutely none of that. A western buddy of mine here has a Korean girlfriend who's been correct about my ex's behaviors once in the past, and I want to get her time to ask more, but I feel like that's awkward, so I'm turning here. I've been reading and watching videos about eastern philosophy and Korean culture in the hopes of understanding what's going on in her head. I'm desperate to figure out a way to make things work or at least get answers.

I'm being really vulnerable here, so please be nice? 


My ex is a native Korean that dropped out of a Korean university, studied in Russia for a year, then got her degree at UCLA. She speaks near-fluent English. She's 24 (int'l age). She moved back here after graduating with a major in communications and a minor in film. She lives with her parents, as is custom, though they've agreed she should move out once she has income due to interpersonal strife. She's currently job searching. She had an internship at an advertising agency, but she couldn't handle the culture and work.


I'm an American, born and raised in south Florida, having lived in Atlanta, Nashville, San Francisco, and LA, in that order. I'm 28 (int'l age). I just moved to Seoul, and I'll soon be working for one of the chaebols as a software engineer. I only speak English, but I'm learning Korean, if slowly. I decided I wanted to move to Seoul someday before I even met her, but meeting her made me realize someday could be now. Mostly a ""why not?"" feeling.


Story time.


We matched on Tinder in January or February while she was at UCLA. I recently learned that I look like the Western version of her most recent ex. We went on our first date March 27 after numerous delays due to sickness and travel and whatnot. After that, things went very quickly, as I usually tend to rush things. There was some strife around being ""official,"" mostly I was pushing. Beyond that, things started excellently. We went on several adventures. Lots of dates. Intimate life was incredible. We got to know each other's friends. Everything was good. 

I made several mistakes early on, but they ended up mostly okay. On our third date, I took her to dinner at my company. My goal was to introduce her to my coworkers. We sat next to a group of them, and they were talking about compensation in a very heated manner. I tend to get hyper-focused on things, and I was searching for an opportunity to interrupt the conversation, change it, and introduce my date. I was so focused on that, I ended up not talking with her. Eventually, someone else came and sat with us. I introduced them, and we chatted a bit. After only a minute or two, he started asking me about work stuff. I tried to gear the conversation back to the three of us, but no joy. Eventually, we finished eating, and she called an Uber home, clearly unhappy. A short time later, I called her, and she explained things from her point of view. I understood, apologized, explained my thought process and how I wouldn't do it again, apologized profusely even more, and she forgave me. 

I'm friends with most of my exes. I had been dating my most recent ex for 2.5 years, ending in October. She also had a long relationship that ended in October. Not being over our exes was a concern of hers, but I wasn't worried about it. Occasionally, either a habit of mine or an object or something came from an ex, and I'd notice it and mention it. To me, it's just like talking about a memory of an old friend - no big deal. Obviously, I'm an idiot. She eventually asked me to stop mentioning my exes like that, and I complied. She also told me to stop watching porn, which I had issue with.

I still talked to my most recent ex about once a month. We were best friends, regardless of the relationship, and we didn't want to lose each other as friends or get back together. The once a month phone call was a perfect compromise. My girlfriend knew about this but largely put it out of mind. 

After a short time, I started feeling paranoid. I felt like she was always assessing me. This didn't help with my anxiety of over slip-ups during dates. I didn't feel like the relationship was secure. I felt like I was always walking on eggshells. I mentioned this to her, and she told me I had nothing to worry about. I still had the sense that she would drop me at any moment. It was suffocating. 

By this time, June was rapidly approaching, when she was going to move home. She managed to finish a major film project of hers, and her mother was coming to see the screening and help her and her sister prepare to move home. I ended up meeting her mother. She didn't like me, but she didn't necessarily hate me either. It's just that I was neither Korean nor Christian and dating her daughter. My girlfriend was super anxious the whole time, as she and her mother fought very frequently. I was basically her escape. She'd come to my place, or we'd go out. I'd comfort her, and we'd go out to help her de-stress and have fun. 

We decided we'd try to make long distance work, and I decided I was going to move to Korea. She had anxiety that I was moving there for her. I told her I'd wanted to move there, and she was the catalyst for it happening now rather than ""someday."" Her anxiety didn't go away. She didn't want to feel a sense of commitment towards me as a result of moving there. I assured her time and time again that even if she broke up with me, I'd still move there. I explained that she just helped me realize there was nothing stopping me from living abroad now rather than someday. It ended the conversation, but she kept bringing it up again and again.

I went to visit in July for a week. It was wonderful. She taught me many things, showed me around. We went on several dates. I also worked from my company's Seoul office and managed to interview for a role there. I didn't get it, but they introduced me to an SVP at one of the chaebols. He guaranteed me a job. Everything was looking up. Going back to the States was painful, but I told her I'd visit her again in a month and move there shortly after.

We managed to do pretty well over long distance. We chatted every day. I setup a Minecraft Pixelmon server that we played on together. We found a mobile app for couples to send each other dares that we used. We figured things out really well. My feeling of paranoia that she would drop me was still there, though, especially with her mentioning a fear of commitment from my moving there. She was concerned about me leaving my job, and we ended up deciding I wouldn't visit in August. I decided I'd move there end of September, when I expected the job to start. We decided this was okay.

My ex and I wanted to see each other one last time before I left the country. It'd be the first time we saw each other since October, pending when she dropped off something of mine for only a minute once. I talked to my girlfriend about it. She wasn't happy. I didn't see any danger in it, so I felt like she was trying to control me. Again, I'm an idiot. We came to the compromise that I could only see her with a group of people.

I'm still an idiot. She and I met up. I didn't expect this to happen, but I remembered the time when we were dating. In past encounters with exes, that had never been a problem for me. I felt solace in those memories with how suffocated I was feeling in my current relationship. I felt safe. We joined my roommates and some other friends at a nightclub. My ex and I both really like dancing, and things got really heated on the dance floor. Too heated. We managed to chill out, but we'd already danced in manners I'd deem inappropriate. At the end of the night, we said final goodbyes, and she kissed me. I didn't stop her. It was her way of saying goodbye, and I didn't want to ruin it for her.

I didn't tell my girlfriend right away. She had just gotten an internship and was struggling. It was incredibly taxing on her, and she vented to me every day. A couple days after the event, she had decided she was going to quit the job and was feeling good. I brought up the dancing. She was furious.

530hss,3,2016-09-16,What would you do?,aaronphillips66,Firefighting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Firefighting/comments/530hss/what_would_you_do/,"Hey everyone, I'm new to reddit completely. So hopefully I'm doing this correctly! 

I have always had the lifelong dream of becoming a firefighter, but during September of 2015 this dream was halted. I was only 19 years old at the beginning of all of this, with no knowledge of workman's compensation laws, or anything with this nature. I was employed at the worlds largest retail chain we all know of at the time, and sustained an injury on the job. 
Just two weeks before this happened, I began my journey towards my dream career through schooling. I was enrolled in EMT-B classes at a local community college. This made it very difficult to perform in this class, as it has physical requirements! I did my best though, and passed, while still being employed at this chain, driving an hour for class 2 days a week, and studying constantly. 

Months passed, and I was terminated from this job for missing days because of the injury. This was April, 1, 2016. I moved on from that and was offered an internship in a small town about 3 hours from home doing computer work, and inventory. Soon after I was offered this position I received news I would be having surgery on my back. I was now 20 years old, I'd never had any type of surgery in my life. So this was very overwhelming to add on top of my life as it was. It was scheduled for June, 27, 2016. My girlfriend's birthday of all days! 
The time came for me to travel to Wichita, Ks for my surgery. I was to have a spinal fusion at L5-S1 with rods and pedicle screws, and a laminectomy of a free floating fragment in my spine from this injury. 
I hope what I have so far isn't too long, boring, or not how reddit works!
But anyways, continuation! It's almost over I promise.
The surgery went well, no complications. I was pretty much in my bed for about 2 weeks after the surgery and continued work from home as I could. I have to wear a back brace any time I am not asleep or sitting in a well supported position (so basically always). As well with my wonderful belt of glory, I cannot lift over 10 pounds.
Now currently I live in Lawrence, Ks working 3 jobs and not in school yet, as I have no idea what I can even do with my future. So my reason for being here is general advice from people on what they think the best route in life for me would be! This experience so far has been the hardest thing I've ever done, and am running out of options on everything. Should I go to school in an other field? Should I wait until I'm cleared by my doctor (no idea when that will be) and if any firefighter/EMT's are out there, would you ever hire someone with this past, or even try to continue in this field? 

Any and all responses are much appreciated! Thanks everyone!"
530oky,2,2016-09-16,I think I screwed up my internship this summer.,ps1203,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/530oky/i_think_i_screwed_up_my_internship_this_summer/,"I'm feeling so much guilt, disappointment and worthlessness. As my last day approaches, I received more negative feedback than I expected. I didn't realize how bad I screwed up. I could have done so much better and used my time much more wisely.

I think I was okay for the first month, but then I ran into a creative block in the last six weeks and I wasn't getting any further on my secondary project. I couldn't even bear to talk to anyone about my projects because they were going nowhere and I hate to disappoint anyone. My slump is probably coming off as lazy, but I do have several health problems that affect my ability to function at a normal pace and stay focused.

I have always had a problem with being on time, and I let my body get the better of me by sleeping in too long and coming 2-3 hours later than usual without prior notice more than a few times. My dad said I abused my privilege of being allowed to work from home. I did that about 3 times because my body was just too exhausted. I also missed a lot of meetings I should have been to because they were in the morning. A meeting is a meeting and there is no excuse, but I put myself in a bad position and now I have to face the consequences. I missed a lot of opportunities to network at the meetings and that is my fault.

I was lost for several weeks that I ended up giving rushed products at the last minute.

I hate the projects that I submitted because I know I did a bad job and I am now putting myself in a horrible situation.

My secondary project was apparently what wasn't expected, but I thought that I had discussed what the changes would be. I thought my report was agreed upon, but apparently I was expected to be more patient and work harder to find another solution and provide a more comprehensive report.

I know I was expected to show regular results consistently, to get more feedback and have a better product, but I failed to do that because I was internally panicking about having nothing to show for my projects. I wasn't just supposed to show a product at the very end. That was wrong.

I didn't realize that I would be pointed at today for lack of communication. I thought I was doing fine in the beginning, but when I started to get stressed out, I almost stopped talking to everyone because I was so overwhelmed. Now I'm getting feedback that I should have gone around every day and talked and did more networking. I'm pretty sure this didn't happen because I was too exhausted and stressed out about my projects. I also now know that I should have been networking more and talking about various topics. I don't really know what topics are off limits. I was also supposed to share more about my professional interests and classes. Again, too stressed to think about socializing and nervous because I had nothing to show for myself. I was told to communicate if I was stuck on my projects, but my perfectionist self was too afraid to say anything. I wanted to look like I was fine, but I obviously wasn't and everyone could tell.

Although I thought my projects were fun, I felt detached from the real work that was being done. I think that would have been more practical to do.

I can't go back anymore. I can't redo my internship and do it right. I probably deserve what is waiting for me if it is bad news. I have so much regret. I wish I could change how the bad weeks went and just did work the right way.

I won't be surprised if my return offer is revoked tomorrow. I put myself in a position to fail and I didn't realize it. I don't know if this is going to affect my ability to be hired again in another company (I have a feeling that it won't work out again with this one). I feel awful and horrible, and I always seem to screw myself over with every opportunity. That's why I never get anywhere in life. Why don't I ever learn?

I don't think anyone will respond but I can't stop thinking about everything that happened. I have to shake this feeling away but talking to my parents didn't help. I think talking to an outsider would help me think more practically."
530syf,5,2016-09-16,Post Graduation Prospects,csdizzy,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/530syf/post_graduation_prospects/,"Hi guys,

I'm a CS undergrad in a top-20 to top-10 depending on where you look CS program. I started out studying Neuroscience, but after deciding before my senior year in Fall 2014 that I didn't want to do grad school or medical school, I decided to pick up a second major in CS to help my job prospects.

So, in the last two years I've flown through the CS program here to the point where I'm graduating in December. It's been a rough road, and throughout most of it I've been struggling with depression and anxiety due to a number of external factors that I won't delve into. I've also felt WAY behind my peers since I started so late. But I have managed to get through the program.

The problem is I haven't had an internship, and don't really have any projects that I've done outside of class. It's been a struggle just finding the mental fortitude to power through class. 

Things are definitely a lot better now, but I'm finding myself looking ahead to our career fair next week, and I feel like I don't really know what to put on my resume/am doubting my prospects of finding stuff since I haven't had an internship/a big external portfolio. 

Any of the resume building stuff I did during my 4 years of studying Neuroscience doesn't really apply directly to a job in CS. I've been working an IT job for the last year and a half, but obviously that doesn't really encompass CS. My best bet is putting CS class projects I've done I guess, but most of them were generalized things that everyone who took the class had to do. I've only had really one big group project that was completely our own idea/thing.

I guess I'm just wondering what I should be looking for. Should I be going after an internship first before something full time? Can I expect to be able to get one? I'm confident in my own abilities for the most part, as I've gotten through a lot of difficult CS classes and ultimately will have a degree come December, I just don't really know how to express it in resume form, and I still do feel behind a lot of my peers. I'm a first gen college student which is something a lot of people have said I should play up, but the side I'm worried about is actually displaying the CS skills I've gained. 

Appreciate any advice!

I'm a respected industry manager and I never had an issue like this. 

I have an artist that I really like the music of- the sound, the vibe and the personality- and I believe he has so much potential to be huge. 

How can I convince an A&amp;R person that isn't too sure about meeting with him to meet him? 

I currently do not have the bandwidth to kickstart a career for him without the backing of a label so I'm trying to get him signed. 

Is there any sure-fire way to convince someone to meet him? 

I was speaking with an A&amp;R intern about him, which I was at some point. Would telling him that signing him would probably get him promoted to A&amp;R/Director of A&amp;R because he WILL be big? I would've been convinced by that in the 90s if someone told me that at that stage.

I really want to get him signed and I need tips.

Thanks.

My original plan was to attend law school, but I decided to hold off because I don't want to spend thousands of dollars on something I'm not absolutely sure about. I'm also interested in potentially going back for a second bachelor's in computer science, but I can't really say that one outweighs the other. 

I thought maybe working some entry-level positions would help pass the time and maybe put me on a path to something else I enjoy. But I've had trouble getting any positions(other than some unpaid internships) because I'm not really sure what to look for with a Polisci degree. 

I've avoided part time jobs that wouldn't add much to my resume, but I'm starting to wonder if I should just be taking anything at this point.

It's beginning to seriously stress me out and make me feel depressed some days. I've stopped hanging out with friends as much and I don't even think about my dating life,which is something that has always been pretty active in my life.

I know that nobody can make a decision for me or decide what I want to do, but I'm just curious if anyone has any general advice for passing the time of uncertainty about what you want to do with your future."

531fkg,1,2016-09-16,34M4F - A few scenarios to pick from,2468_throwaway,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/531fkg/34m4f_a_few_scenarios_to_pick_from/,"Hello, looking for an RP to see out the day with.. I'll put a few RP prompts but these aren't set in stone so we can vary them.

My kinks - Leather/PVC clothing, boots, rough sex, anal and assplay, big cock and cumshot, deepthroat, athletic girls

The RPs will involved most of, or all of, the above kinks. Limits - Hardsports, incest, anything under 18

Indecent Proposal - one of my favourites, all the details are here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3wyd43/34m4f_the_indecent_proposal/ - also I've combined this with the office roleplay in the past to some success so I would be interested in exploring this more, such as

* the intern gets a special offer
* staff member needs to make a deal to save their job

Office Muck Up - this worked out well, all details here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3sfmkc/33m4f_office_mistake/

The Guitarist/Backing Dancer - In this one I'm backing you up, either your guitarist or one of your dancers. On this tour, there's a section of the show where you are basically singing on me, wrapped around me, dancing sexily in front of me. As the tour progressed we're getting hotter and hotter until the last night of the tour I whisper in your ear as you finish ""I want to fuck you tonight"" before carrying on with my job. This obviously lends itself to celeb play.

Escort Roleplay - I've had some great roleplays with this scenario - you are an escort and I'm your client. You can play anyone from a street hooker to a high class/exclusive/celebrity escort. I've also been exploring an 'Old West Brothel' RP - you'd play a girl working in a brothel above an Old West bar, your clients could be the sheriff, the mayor, an outlaw?

Stalker - I've been following you for a while, and watching you. That's the basic premise but we can work out the exact details. This could be quite a dark RP if we both wanted it to be that way. Do you know I'm watching? Are you enjoying it? Do I break in one night?

Damsel in distress - I have a log cabin in a remote mountain range. You get stuck on my doorstep after getting lost and racing to shelter from a snow storm. You have no choice but to spend the weekend with me, which isn't a bad prospect on first impressions as I'm a typical romantic novel woodsman - strong, sexy, fit etc.

A gym affair - I run a gym, you are a member. We're both married, but we are both crazy about each other. Ultimately this will end up with us in the gym after hours making use of all the equipment. Actually, I'd pretty much consider any roleplay that involves sex in the gym - sexy ladies in gymwear are a thing for me

Celeb Play - I absolutely love celeb roleplay and if my writing partner fully commits to the character, it can be amazing. Really open to anything with this one.

Unless you want to play yourself, or if we're doing celeb roleplay, I usually like the women in my RP to be picked from one of the following subs - AthleticGirls Hardbodies TrashyBoners FestivalSluts"

Last night I had an interview for an unpaid internship that will start at +- 17th of October in Auckland. The company is located at this adres (https://goo.gl/maps/M6J8R5sLAZn). I have a few questions about Auckland and NZ:

- What are the nicest student area's (to live) in Auckland? By nicest I mean still affordable (600 AUSD/month (?). I prefer an area between the city centre and the office where I intern.
- How much do you pay per month for a NZ sim card with about 2 GB internet per month (100 minutes or even 50 is enough for me)
- Is the public transport any good? Is it affordable to use 5 times a week for lets say 2x15 min trips?

The reason why I ask these questions here is because I like the fact that the answers come from people that are living in or near Auckland and that I can reply them if something's not clear.

Thanks in advance! :)"

Does anyone have any experience or knowledge about pursuing a masters or second bachelors in a very different field while working? I would like to broaden my skill set, since I do not feel like becoming a 'technical expert' and often feel like I don't fit in with the 'techie' culture.

I made a design using G code and then used a CNC to mill it in a wax block

Designed a somewhat complex circuit of logic gates and switches.

Created an airfoil out of styrofoam and tested it in a wind tunnel.

The thing is, all these were in high school, and I've barely done anything relevant in college. I feel like all the upper class men are going to get the internships by default.

Do I bring a paper copy of my resume? I heard they'll just throw it away and I've also heard its very good to bring one.

5321js,2,2016-09-16,I [22M] am unsure if this girl [22F] at my internship is crushing on me or creeped out,creepornah,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/5321js/i_22m_am_unsure_if_this_girl_22f_at_my_internship/,"Hey everyone, so I started this internship in my town a few weeks ago. A couple people flew in from out of town (some abroad, some within the US). She flew in from a different part of the US and is here for the duration of the internship. I noticed her when we first had orientation and thought she was pretty, but I didn't think much of it. However, I started noticing her staring at me more.

I'd catch her staring at me and turn to look towards her. I'd see her quickly turn away as soon as I caught her, so that was the first clue. Also, when we were all grabbing lunch one day, she was with one of her new friends and they were chatting about something random. They messed up something in the line and so the girls switched positions, but I noticed that she got a little close to me while we were in line. I kinda hurried up to get my food and got out of line. I planned to sit with her, but then my immediate coworkers called me over to sit with them so I was out of luck.

Cue a few days later, I was sitting in the main area of the internship working on some assignment. I yawned and stretched for a bit, then looked around the whole vicinity to see who was around. My line of sight was lowered for some reason, and I caught a glimpse of her adjusting her skirt. I quickly looked up because I didn't want to give the wrong impression, but then my eyes and hers locked for a moment. I don't remember her having any particular expression, but I remember after that I quickly turned back towards my work.

This whole time I hadn't introduced myself to her yet. We had an internship gathering, some sort of icebreaker event last week. I finally got to introduce myself to her there and, even when I introduced myself, she hesitated to shake my hand and shook it in a really weird way (as if she was trying to keep contact away from me as much as possible). We talked a bit at this event, but it was maybe five minutes total. It honestly felt somewhat like she was avoiding me. There was another opening for me to talk with her when we were at a bar as a group. The first moment we had to move chairs and tables together to sit, and I remember the girls got together to do it and specifically I heard her talk about how ""she doesn't need a man."" That kinda threw me off a bit. Later at the bar, I was getting to know some other people, but when she tried to talk to me I was in conversation with this other dude and was more interested in what he was talking about so I kinda just went ""Yeah, that's cool"" and kept talking (yeah yeah... stupid, I know). I remember she looked kinda sad and not too long after the group called it a night and split off.

Cue this week, things are just as weird. I saw her at lunch again and invited her to eat with us, but she said she already talked to someone about reserving a table for them. She said she doesn't know the girl's name and mentioned some name I'd never heard before, so I said that I didn't know the person. She said ""yeah you do"" and kinda gave me a cold shoulder while sitting at the other table faced away from me. I thought it was really weird, but then saw that she was talking about another friend at the internship who I was sitting one on one with at lunch once. The second girl... let's call her S. During that time I sat with S, the other girl walked by and I could kinda see her looking at us. This makes me think that she was mad that I was sitting with her (but we're just friends!!!)

So I've been getting a lot of the cold shoulder from her. When I'm looking, she doesn't look at me, kinda freezes up, does all of that. But then sometimes I'll see that she's really close to me and I get really confused. I don't know any other reason she would act like this, because we really don't know each other. It's still bothering my mind though. I don't want to pursue a girl who looks uncomfortable (on the chance she doesn't like me, I'll be that dick that couldn't take a hint).

  **tl;dr**: Cute girl at my internship displays signs that she might like me or might not want me to be around; not sure how to move on from here."
53251k,0,2016-09-16,I feel like I have no direction,_Dopethrone_,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/53251k/i_feel_like_i_have_no_direction/,"I'm currently a CS sophomore at University, and i'm taking 2 programming classes. One that deals with C/Unix(which has been a lot of fun so far) and one that deals with advanced OO concepts(mostly been review so far).

Now I get that the school year has just begun, blah blah. But I feel like these classes aren't giving me enough. There have been like a total of 3 assignments so far in the past 2 weeks in both classes combined. And the assignments were absolutely trivial.

So the next logical step would be to start working on a side project. Great, i'd love to. I'd like to think that I know my way around Object Oriented programming and Google search.

My problem is that I don't want to waste my time on something that won't actually improve my skillset. I can make classes and functions that do specific tasks all day, but i want to go deeper. I want to prepare myself for the job market through side projects until I land an internship. You're probably going to ask, ""well, what are you interested in?""... Well, i've found that I enjoy systems development definitely, but as far as I understand for most developer roles these days, webdev/appdev is becoming more and more the norm.

What do you guys suggest I start working on? 

Edit: I'm thinking setting up a Linux server for my network, maybe? Would that require a dedicated server(like a physical machine)?"
532ieu,2,2016-09-16,F4M Some Fun Scenes!,[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/532ieu/f4m_some_fun_scenes/,"Hey there DPP, tonight I have a couple scenes for you all to choose from and/or work out with me!

We can discuss specific prompts in private and please, do not message me with a scene already started, that’s the easiest way to get blocked. The same goes for one line/word messages.

I'm fairly open with my kinks with my only hard ""no""s being scat, unrealistically huge cocks, 3rd person writing, and vomit.

Without further ado, here are some of my prompts:

**The Lawyer and the Con**: For this one, I was thinking I’d play a young and up and coming lawyer tasked with defending you. We can discuss the specifics in PMs but one thing is for certain, I’ll be taking my payment in the form of cock.

**Breaking the Law**: For this one, the roles are reversed, I was caught committing a crime and you’re the officer/journalist/detective who caught me. Where that leads? Well that’s up to you.

**Wrong neighborhood**: What happens when me, a young and sexy girl finds herself in the wrong neighborhood? Do you help me find my way or decide you want to take advantage?

**Sports Star and Reporter**: A classic scene were I’m a reporter and you’re the sports star, that can only lead one place, right?

**The intern and the boss**: Fairly self explanatory, I’d love to be the intern at her dream job who meets you, her boss and potentially so much more.

**Opposite Sides**: For this one, I want to play a FBI/CIA/DEA Agent who is tasked with infiltrating your organization, now what that organization does we can discuss in PMs but I basically want you to turn me from righteous agent of the law into your slut.

**I’m gonna fuck your sister**: For this one, you’ll play my little brother’s best friend, I’ll be his big sister who is now recently single and back in town. You guys always joked that you would fuck each other’s mom/sister only this time, you’re not joking.

**Giving back**: In this RP, I’ll play someone  famous be it an actress or singer or sports star. You’ll be the person tasked in helping me set up some sort of event to give back to the community, only you want me to give you something more than this event.

**Bullies always win**: In this one, you’ll be as the title suggests, you’re a bully who grew up terrorizing my son (or brother), only unlike the stories we tell our kids to make them feel better, you know better. You get what you want, when you want it, in this case, me.

For those of you so inclined, I do like playing celebs in any of these roles so we have visual aids, if you’d like me to be any, just ask!

As for celebs I’d play, here are a few, feel free to ask about ones not listed:

Celebs: **Mary Elizabeth Winstead**, **Maisie Williams**, Anna Kendrick, Selena Gomez, Hailee Steinfeld, Taylor Swift, Willa Holland, Daisy Ridley, **Melissa Benoist**, Emma Stone/Watson/Roberts, Hayley Williams, Alison Brie, Alexandra Daddario, Aubrey Plaza, Bella Thorne, **Alicia Vikander** Jennifer Lawrence, Keri Russel, Neve Campbell, Jennifer Connelly, Scarlet Johansson, Sophie Turner, Oliva Munn, Olivia Wilde, **Miranda Kerr**, Jessica Biel/Alba, Victoria Justice

YouTube/Social Media: **Meg Turney**, Lia Marie Johnson, **Alli Speed**, Barbara Dunkelman, Ashley Jenkins, **Bree Essrig**, Maude Garrett, Trisha Hershberger, Datev Gallagher, Lindsey Stirling, Christina Grimme, Dodger, iJustine, or Meghan Camarena.

Whew, that was a lot. Hope to get some dirty orangereds soon!

532v2n,34,2016-09-16,Introducing my ILs and why my Husband is the way he is.,Polyprobsyo,JUSTNOFAMILY,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOFAMILY/comments/532v2n/introducing_my_ils_and_why_my_husband_is_the_way/,"In my last post I introduced my Kinda-SIL1's kids.  This will go into the history of my Husband and why I am not the biggest fan of his parents.  Some of this may belong on r/JUSTNOMIL but this includes my FIL so I will post it here.

DH is a child of a failed marriage.  MIL and his bio-father split before DH was out of a womb due to lots of drama.  DH has never met his bio-father because he is a dead beat and MIL doesn't have a single photo of bio-father around.  When DH was about 2 years old MIL met FIL and they ended up getting married.  FIL adopted DH (one of the kindest things I think FIL has ever done) and in all ways except DNA FIL is DH's dad.

The first horror story (imo) was from DH's 3rd or 4th birthday.  He was a very quiet and withdrawn child that loved his legos, books and anything with technology.  During his birthday party he did not want to come out because he was scared or sleepy or whatever and MIL forced him to blow out the candles on his cake and open presents in front of friends and family.  While the group was singing him happy birthday DH turns to MIL and says ""Mommy, the eyes. I don't like the eyes. They are watching me.""

Now if I had a child tell me that I would be talking to their doctor at the next appointment.  Did MIL or FIL? Nope.  They just said it was one of DH's little oddities.  

MIL and FIL end up having 2 kids and DH slowly becomes the black sheep of the family.  He is cared for a loved in their own way but nothing he does is quite good enough.  Video games?  They are the devil.  Learning how to code?  Nope not ok.  Excelling in math and science?  Yeah but DH isn't doing well in sports.  BIL and SIL ended up being the GC for everyone but DH's maternal GFIL.  DH ends up graduating high school at the top of his class and getting into a great engineering program.  FIL and he have a very rocky relationship at this point due to butting heads pretty much all the time.

I meet DH at University and we hit it off lovely.  I meet his family and he meets mine and everything seems to be going great until DH gets a 6 month internship near his parent's and moves home.  First things first.  His childhood room had been changed into a rec room with a pool table and all.  When DH moved back they set up a bed, dresser and desk in one corner of that room for him.  During the weekends FIL would often come in to shoot pool and it sucked because DH and I had no privacy when we were there.  As the months went on MIL and FIL started treating DH much like a child, demanding chores get done, he help his siblings and general parents being parents.  Mind you DH was 22 at the time and was pretty much living in his room because he was doing what any computer nerd would do, playing WOW.  He did help around the house but he seemed to get the majority of chores because ""Oh you don't have any sports or things after work."" Exact MIL quote.

The final straw for DH was when FIL demanded he replace the fog lights on SIL’s car for her driving test.  At the time DH was packing his shit up to move back to University and get away from his family.  They end up having a spectacular fight when DH said “No, she doesn’t need those lights to work.  If its that important SIL should do it herself.” I think by the end of it FIL disowned DH.  FIL was even more pissed when DH was basically like “That’s fine, I play for my own schooling anyway,” and packed up his shit and left.  I think DH didn’t talk to FIL for months after that.  MIL was all “BUT FAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMILY” and was pissed at both of them for years.  I will note BIL and SIL thought their dad was being insane and agreed with DH.

Then about 5 years ago maternal GFIL passed.  MIL when nuts because her father went from ok to dead in about a week.  She tried to get DH and I to move into GFIL’s house, tried to connect us to her sister (who is a total narcissist), didn’t understand when we told her fuck no and equally didn’t understand when DH was a wreak for months after.  GFIL was the only family member that took DH for who he was and loved every inch of him.  They would talk tech and wood working and DH would even call GFIL on a regular basis (which is a fucking feat).  

After GFIL passed, DH slipped into a major depression.  He got laid off from 2 different jobs within a year of each other, and I think this is when his mental illness came to the forefront.  DH’s GF and I were both worried, encouraged him to get help and generally supported what he needed.  He was (and still is a bit) self-medicating with alcohol which we later learned is one of the reasons why MIL left bio-father.  It was a long uphill battle but DH did get help.  He got onto meds, did talk therapy, DBT and is doing much better on the alcohol front.  He has a job that supports him and his medical needs and finally has an accurate diagnosis. 

DH was talked to his parents about his mental illness and looked for their support pretty early in his journey because that is what parents are support to do.  My parents listened and offered advice and basically told him do what you need to do and if you need help we will be here for you.  MIL and FIL on the other hand immediately asked “So when are you getting off the meds?”  

DH and I were like “Um…..most likely never.” 

“But most people go on meds to get off them again”

At this point DH is looking at them bug eyed.  “Mom, Dad these meds are like insulin or blood pressure medication for me.  My doctor’s think I am going to be on some form of medication for the rest of my life.  When I am on these I am able to function, hold down a job and have happy relationships.  I just want your support.”

“But when are you getting off the meds?”  *face palm*

Around this time I find out UIL who is related to FIL is schizophrenic and is un-medicated because the family doesn’t think he needs it.  “UIL is just a bit odd”  No UIL is crazy and kinda scary and I don’t want to be in the room alone with him.  Ever.

And that folks are my IL’s.    BIL and SIL are pretty ok.  There are family members on that side of the family I like quite a bit, but if I had my way to never talk to MIL or FIL or UIL or AIL again….I would be totally ok with NC or VLC.

ZERO.

I was promised to be given an internship certificate of completion and also internship evaluation form.

Fast forward 2 months, completed internship but didn't get those 2 papers. I was assigned to do unrelated stuffs. I felt cheated.

Then a week ago, I decided to extend my internship to develop an mobile app for my final year project and also the same internship company. Not a good decision at all.

Things didn't go down the way I wanted as the company's vision and expectation of the app are different from mine. 

So now, what is the best way to quit? On the contract it says that I have to give 2 weeks notice. Do I still have to serve the 2 weeks? Should my approach to quitting be a peaceful one or a somewhat aggressive one? Should I still ask for the 1 week's pay that I have served?

Please advice."

533386,5,2016-09-16,Afraid that the constant stress and anxiety have permanently damaged my brain,TechnialyItsOneNacho,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/533386/afraid_that_the_constant_stress_and_anxiety_have/,"Im 21 years old and currently in my junior year of college. Ive always had a little bit of an anxiety problem but its never been as bad as the levels it reached within the past few year. Looking back on highschool I cant remember i time when i was really anxious or doubted my intelligence in anyway. I was an outgoing funny guy ,sometimes a little too outgoing due to adhd , but my friends loved being around me so thats all that mattered. I stopped taking my adhd medication during my senior year of hs because my schedule was so relaxed and honestly I had doubts that i even had adhd( or that it was a real thing for that matter). Then right before I came to college i told my doctor that i wanted to get back on the meds. I started taking them the summer prior to going to college and each month i told him i needed my dosaged upped until i got to the max dose. I didnt really think i needed this high of a dose, and honestly hadnt been taking the meds, but I had just started to hang out with some shadier people and wanted to seem cool so i decided to be that guy who always had uppers. Then i got up to school and without hesitation started taking the medication. I remember it made me very introverted and zombie like during school but as soon as i got on the shuttle to come home I was like the energizer bunny. I can account this to the meds wearing off or the fact that i sat with my friend everyday and maybe I finally felt comfortable enough to let all my thoughts out. A few months go by and im still taking the meds like their candy. Taking them to get over hangovers, drink more, snort with people at parties, you name it. I convinced myself that i was addicted to them and accounted all my adhd related symptoms to withdrawl. So i would give myself little breaks from it then get back on them. This went on until i finally transferred to the school I had been aiming for. The curriculum here was alot more demanding and really tested my abilities. I started taking the meds more regularly but still abused them on the weekends. Got through sophmore year with a coupled failed classes but nothing too serious. Came home after first summer semester and proceeded to party my ass off. Near the end i started using my dads boat and the week before i school started back I drank way too much out on the water and hit some stuff on the way home (with my car, not truck with trailer). Car still drove so i went immediatley home. Unfortunately i live in a very small community so ( and it was only 9pm) so there were people that saw the accident and recognized my car. So im sitting outside my house staring at the hole in my windshield and all the other damge, trying to digest what just happened. My friend pulls up talks me down a little and gets me to get into his car. As were pulling off a cop car comes cruising down my street. I immediatley know im fucked. This suspicion was confirmed when he stops even with my buddies car who hadnt pulled out yet. I get out the car and proceed to tell the cop that my sister backed into my car the other day and that i hadnt been driving my car that day( all the while trying to keep myself from falling face first into the pavement. My sister sees the lgihts and comes out the house and asks whats happening(she already knew, small community, eye witnesses were her friends and had texted her before i even got home) cop says go back inside. Another cop pulls up and then things start to get interesting. Whats the he has in his hands? The dismembered boat keys? with all the registration information including my dads name address ? thats right i left them on the hood of my car right before driving off and committing a hit and run. Great. (just realized this wasnt the focus of this post so ill wrap the story up and get onto the point) Mom comes outside and lets out this unworldly shriek then barges back into the house letting out every curse in her vocabulary. Even the cops looked sad for me. My dad comes out, gives his spiel about how im in college in a very tough major, not a dumbass yadda yadda. The cops do a field sobriety test just to show how drunk i am. humiliating. im crying at this point cause my mom (the women whom i spent my entire childhood with and looking up to because my dad was never home) had just let out this terrifying shriek signifying how much of a fuck up i was then proceeded to come outside and ask them to send me to jail. im rambling.... long story short i got a leaving the seen and a speeding ticket. This got the entire family dropped from the insurance and forced me to get sr22.

Week later i went back up to school and continued to take the medication but something weird was happening. The medicince was giving me SEVERE anxiety. Then the panic attacks started. Calling my gf freaking the fuck out. Driving to the hospital an hour away only to turn around when the anxiety subsided because I knew i would only be giving the doctors a laugh. fucking torture.

Some how managed to land a paid internship for the upcoming spring semester. I was tired off all this fear and anxiety so when new years came around i decided it was time to figure myself out. I decided to really try and get my adhd medication dialed in correctly and start seeing someone about my anxiety. (2016) Went through 3 different medications and they all made my anxiety way worse. This anxiety made me think i didnt have adhd and that all i was doing was frying my brain, which was further reinforced by how sporadic and unfocused i was off the meds. 

end of summer 2016 and i decide fuck the meds i dont need em. Quit for a month(right before school starts back up ..brilliant). Finally came to the realization that i do need them so now ive been trying something for about a month now. 

everyday the anxiety comes back in new form. Today in class i had a friend say something to me looking for an intelligent response and all i could muster was some thing superficial. The look i was met with in response to this mediocrity was one that i can only explain as futile, or  the sudden realization that i was incapable of deeper thought. My response was an effort but my brain hit a ""wall"" i literally could not think of anything else to say.

so .... im worried all this long term stress/anxiety has fried my brain. Leaving me stranded and unable to complete my degree. i have my first round of tests next week and im terrified....

TL;DR : Abusing meds, Stupid decisons resulting in ptsd? , ultimatelty feeling deserted and betrayed by the people i trusted the most. this caused panic attacks/ persistent stress and anxiety for a year, on top of a prexisting anxiety disorder and adhd. So now im worried i fried my brain and am incapable of finishing my degree .


sorry for the rambling and jumping around



edit : left out some pretty relevant stuff.....the panic attacks didnt start during my sophmore year. They started the second semester of my freshman year. After i got kicked out of my housing for smoking pot in my room. so an entire year and half of pretty severe panic attacks went by before i had the hit and run..... so 2 and half years of panic attacks and severe stress....."

I've been studying up a lot, but mostly conceptual stuff.

On my resume, I have my skills listed like so:

&gt; Highly skilled: Java

&gt; Experienced: Python, C, .....

&gt; Familiar: .....

The idea was that Java is the only language that I'd be comfortable using in any situation, but I've written somewhat complex code in both Python (chat bot for Discord and a Django website) and C (heap manager and kernel for school assignments) so I listed those as ""experienced"". I know lines of code isn't always a great indicator, but with my relatively concise coding style I've written &gt;300k LOC in Java and ~10k LOC in Python and C each, so there's a pretty big disparity there in terms of experience.

As a college undergrad, will I be asked specific questions about languages I list other than my main language? For example, specific questions on the language (like ""what is the string pool"" in Java, except questions for Python/C). Or questions that require using something besides Java (""do ___ and return the pointer""). 

I'm comfortable coding in Python/C with the internet as a quick reference so I don't feel at all that I was dishonest on my resume, but at the same time I don't think I'd be comfortable handling interview-level questions outside of Java. Certainly even my ability to just structure projects is far superior in Java than in any other language."

It was around 2001, so that's a while ago, but I feel like I would never forget if I found out my son was (he's a toddler now, but you know what I mean, in the future).

I've been breaking up with my husband for the past year, and I've explained it to my mom 4 times.  Yesterday, I was talking to her on the phone, and she said, ""You know, if you're not careful, things are going to get really bad between you . . . "" meaning, we're going to get a divorce, and I lost it and told her I'm done talking to her about it.

The DAY BEFORE this, I explained to her how we're living like friends for now, and she said, ""That's good; so are you dating anyone?"" and I told her of course not since I'm in school, don't have time, and am technically still married (haven't filed papers yet).

She's really oblivious and can't remember anything about me.  She was here for 2 weeks to ""help"" me with my toddler, and she kept asking me how she looks, does she look okay, and even if I begged her to leave me alone, she kept busting in to ask me stupid questions.

My sister and I are really very certain that my dad has NPD.  Growing up, I always thought I was close to my mom, even though she never really hears me.

It's like, I'll have this great conversation with her, and feel like, wow, she knows me, and then 2 days later, it's like it never happened.

I told her on the phone yesterday that, when I talk to her, I feel like it goes in and spins around a bit and then flies out the other side.

I feel like she's just a total idiot child.  I hung up on her yesterday and texted her to apologize, but I told her I need a break from her and please don't call me for a week.  She said okay.

So, she hasn't called me, but she's texted me 3 times.  I feel guilty.  I'm so angry with her.

She's always been obsessed with my dad, even though he cheated on her for over 30 years.  He is objectively an asshole but, like everyone else, is not without redeeming qualities.  I find him easier to get along with than my mom at this point.

My dad date-raped my mom (this is India in the 1960s) and then his mom found out and made him marry my mom.  That's the story, anyway, what my mom told me when I was maybe 13-years-old.  My sister told me that my mom's parents were going to set her up with a nice dentist, but that my mom refused to marry anyone but my dad because she loves him.

They divorced ten years ago and my mom still can't get over it.
She disgusts me.  She has no self respect.  She watches romantic comedies and thinks that's what real life is.

Sometimes I think science has not yet developed a name for whatever the fuck is wrong with her.

My sister thinks she might be a form of NPD or some kind of autistic sometimes.  I don't know.

I guess I'm wondering if this sounds familiar to anyone else, this combination.  Of course I could say more, but I'm supposed to be writing a personal statement for my internship application right now, and anyway this is already too long.

Thank you in advance for any help at all, and thank you for reading this.


UPDATE: She just texted me to ask her to take pictures of my son in the shirt she gave him when she was here.  I have been telling her repeatedly that I have to write my personal statement, do all my regular homework, and take care of my toddler son mostly by myself this weekend, so I just wrote her back to remind her I have no free time.  She always says, oh, I'm sorry, I love you, I pray for you, so why, if she hears anything I say to her, why does she not remember anything, why does she not take me seriously AT ALL.  I wish she would just leave me the fuck alone.

I have interviewed (and failed) for internships at Microsoft (1 time), Google (3) and at a US unicorn that's in my city (1). Neither Facebook, Twitter or Amazon got back to me after I send them my Resume.

I made it to host matching at Google once, but no manager ended up selecting me for an interview. At the Unicorn I was the only one from my school to made it to the last rounds of interviews.

The thing is I know I am close to actually getting an offer because my background usually brings attention (Full Stack Dev who got press coverage for a prize and some notable things not related to coding) and I was really really close at Google and at the Unicorn. I can probably do the work these companies ask interns to do just fine (from what I've been told).

The thing is, I always fuck up in the detailed implementation of algorithms. I always have problems figuring out if an index start from 0 or 1 and usually that blocks me. Simple questions like, compress a string or add two arrays representing numbers always cause me too much problems. Discussing tradeoffs or implementations are not an issue for me.

I have spend a significant time preparing interview questions and at this point I'm starting two think (1) I'm doing something wrong and (2) it will just take me too much time to successfully prepare for interviews and I have to look for other companies.

In the long term I see my self starting a company and I thought spending some time at big company could be good for experience and networking. But if I have to spend too much time mastering algorithm questions instead of doing real-life problems I'm questioning if it's worth it. 

Yes, I did use the ""Cracking the coding interview"" and after some progress I got stuck with the same problems. (My interview at Microsoft was a disaster and I realized a year later)

Thanks for reading this post - I'll try to keep it short and simple.

I am currently a Field Service Engineer Intern in a large medical devices multinational (50,000 employees worldwide). So far I've got nothing but praise on my work but I've been told there will not be a permanent position opening up soon due to headcount issues so I am on the hunt for my next challenge. 

Now, I've told my previous employer (smaller multinational in medical IT, ~500 employees) that I'm looking for new challenges and have been offered an Account Manager position in one of their UK office. 

I've also reached out to the UK division of my current company and I'm in the midst of interviewing for a permanent Field Service job and, according to the Hiring Manager, I should have no issues getting the job. 

Now, my question is, given the two options and that the salaries are equivalent, which one would you pick? Account Manager is a nice step up in the direction I was hoping to go but the big multinational company is very well known and seems to offer more career choices - although I wouldn't be moving to an Account Mgr position any time soon.

Whatever advice you have would be absolutely fantastic! Thanks for reading this far!

tl;dr - Would you rather bid your time in a big multinational and climb that ladder or move to a smaller company and skip a few steps in said ladder?

Thanks again!

Whoa! After our post on /r/kotakuinaction the other day, we've seen some excellent growth! Take a look for [yourselves](http://imgur.com/5AdxjWz). 

For those of you who can't access Imgur for whatever reason, here are the highlights:

* Subscriber count grew from 151 to over 500. That's an increase of more than 360 subscribers and 240%! Not bad for a small subreddit. 
* Over the past two days, we've had a total of 615 unique users and more than 1100 pageviews. That puts us over 700 uniques and 1,500 pageviews for the month. 

So, for everyone who's new (which is, uh, the vast majority of you), here's how the subreddit has been working so far:

To avoid violating Reddit's self-promotion rules, this account posts articles dealing with liberal/progressive bias and abuse in American higher education. We post articles not only from *Campus Reform,* but also from *Daily Caller, Heat Street, Red Alert Politics, The Federalist,* and *Reason.* We do this by pulling the RSS feeds for those sites through IFTT; their domains are caught by our automod so that we can filter out things irrelevant to the sub (such as [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/CampusReform/comments/531hg2/the_electoral_college_still_makes_sense_because/) one, which has nothing to do with the focus of the sub despite dealing with a college--in this case, the electoral college). 

We've had only a handful of user posts, and if memory serves, they've all been self-posts. Nothing wrong with that, of course, but we'd love to see a lot more user engagement and content. That means links to stories of liberal bias/abuse from smaller, local outlets, links to pages on school websites promoting outrageous events (say, a white privilege conference), etc. It also means discussions amongst you guys about various different topics, or your own stories of liberal/progressive bias and abuse. Let's get posting and keep the party going!

##Decent looking place, but a bit of a fixer-upper, isn't it?

You may also notice that we have a relatively barren sidebar and our wiki is pristine. We also have no flair. Unfortunately, the staffer who handles the subreddit only took one coding course in college before quickly deciding the comp sci life was not for them. Our CSS for the sub was handled by an intern, believe it or not. So, if any of you have any expertise in such matter, ***please*** message this account. We'd like to get the sub as nice looking and as functional as possible!

##Rules?

Well, we've got a handful of them in the sidebar, but they're pretty sparse and deal primarily with asking you not to submit links from certain domains since we already handle that. In the next few days, we're hoping to flesh out some more rules to keep this place a happy, healthy, and growing community that is in line with Reddit's policies. 

When it comes to moderation, Reddit has traditionally been a bastion of freedom of speech; as such, we intend to keep a reasonably light hand with the moderation. Plus, y'know, we've got day jobs and we can't spend all day browsing Reddit at work (though this raises the question about whether it's wasting time on Reddit when modding the subreddit becomes part of the job)!

This is the first time any of our staff have ever moderated a subreddit before. We appreciate your patience. But we also want to know what you think! Do you have any suggestions for how we could improve this place? If so, please let us know in the comments below!

1. Just in general, curious to know what you would do if put in my situation.
1. Which is worse in terms of future employment? (a) a longterm gap in employment, or (b) downgrading to a much lower paying job below my skill set
1. What kinds of careers value programming knowledge mixed with science/health? What programming languages in the health field (or in general) do you think are most worth learning?

**What's going on now**

Seven months ago I finished my fellowship job and moved to a small town with my husband. There, he's working on a postdoc, which seems to be going great, but I'm struggling with what is best for me to spend my time pursuing. Two years from now, my husband will finish his posdoc and we plan to move someplace else. 

I sort of fell into the field of public health as a way to not have to do biology anymore. I also am pretty ""over"" working for a huge government institution. I've also tried tutoring in the past, which taught me I do ***not*** want to go into teaching/tutoring. Where we live now doesn't seem to have any great job options for me. I'm basically twiddling my thumbs, and feel like I would like to work on my career, but am not sure where I should focus and which direction I should head. 

**Previous trials and tribulations**

I am have BS in biology and masters in public health. I have worked for large government institutions as a fellow (which, though competitive, honestly felt like one step above intern in this case), doing things like project management, qualitative research, hand holding, running meetings, team building, and strategic planning. All in all, it was OK.


Before that, I've been a research assistant, either in biology labs, or for a consulting company writing scientific reviews/summary reports. Doing huge systematic reviews of scientific literature and drug trials was OK, though the process is pretty tedious. Everyone tells me coming from a scientific background is valuable, but I don't want to work in a lab again.


**What I've been doing since moving:**

* Applying to local public health department is proving slow and unfruitful. The only interview I've gotten was for ""data manager"" which I was not qualified for since my last job was more writing and managing. (not to mention hour + commute, which I'm not sure is worth it for a job I'm not too interested in)

* **In July I began training in HTML, CSS, and currently Javascript through free online programs.** I have my good days and bad days, but overall I love it and hope to continue getting better. Javascript is a bitch, though. :) I've been looking into maybe getting into public health informatics, or just change careers completely and become a developer of some kind. (if I can build the right skillset) I guess it's discouraging because on the one hand, I feel like there are 15-year-old programming wizards or at least the countless CS-undergrads who have a massive advantage over me. Then again, it's not like I need to work for google or build the next IBM Watson. I just want to find a job that pays me for doing something I kind of enjoy sometimes. lol I also get mixed reviews of how valuable learning programming is these days. But I mean...it's such a huge field, so even within that it's a little overwhelming to figure out where to set my goals.

* I've been playing piano a lot more. Growing up, I took lessons for ~13 years and played gigs through high school playing background music at art galleries openings and events like that. During my days sitting at home, I start to wonder if I want to try advertising for gigs if I can build up a repertoire again. Then again, I also like this fine as a hobby/stress releiver, and it may take time away from finding a more lucrative and stable career.

* Hesitating to apply for jobs in town, because the only things I see available are secretary/staff assstants, or PhD-required nuclear physicists. But then I also worry about having a &gt; 2 year gap in my resume. 

P.S. I'm also reluctant to go to school again, mainly because I accrued some massive debt that we're aggressively paying off, and at this rate will be debt-free (given we don't buy a house or have a kid) in two years. "

So, I have a bit of an issue that has gotten out of hand. I am an international student enrolled at an university and i moved recently to a city in Bavaria for my internship. Everyone knows the housing situation and so I found one pretty far away from work. Landlord is a 62 something year old who seemed nice, friendly until I signed the contract. Following things happened.

1. He said to me, I am not allowed to bring any friends or visitors for an evening or a night's stay. ""Fremde Menschen sind nicht erlaubt"" are his words in the email.

2. He makes explicit sexual comments, gets drunk everyday, told me to marry him and asked if I have ever slept with a German before. He is always in the kitchen when I am cooking in the evening after work. He also caused issues with my Stadtanmeldung.

3. He imposed rules like cooking time, making me pay rent for another room which was eventually given to a 32 year old Hungarian he is enamoured with. He also kept showing me pictures of her in a bikini during lunch and asking my opinion. 

4. He said, my boyfriend when visiting from Scotland, must pay 10 euros per night. 

5. He stole and ate a huge pot of food that I had cooked for work. I leave for work at 6 and come home at 8. He never apologised, instead insulted me for even being mad at him. This is where it all went downhill. Because I refused to put up with his stupidity.

6. He has sent me openly racist texts, being extremely rude and well, has said no one can come in the house to help me move tomorrow. Also, he plans to sleep at 11 am; that is when I am moving out and I must be quiet. It's the second floor and i have backache issues.

None of these stupid rules are mentioned in the contract. Also the cancellation period is 1 month but he insists that it is 3. 1 is written instead. He also harasses me by switching off the stove when I am cooking or moving my things or worse, sending away a DHL packet.


Lastly, I have been to the police for advice with help from the company but he will create issues tomorrow and refuses to return my kaution. I know I need a lawyer for that but I really could some help dealing with him and what to do next. The police said they can only intervene if something serious happens, but they warned me he would cause trouble. It's been barely 20 days since I moved in and I am tired of this guy's openly racist comments, sexual comments and rudeness. 

He has also asked me what I think of him and if I am interested in him. Also, he is renting the house from someone, and is now starting his own prison with all germans and 1-2 foreigners.

Any advice for me, Reddit? I'm stressed out about tomorrow and haven't slept in fear of him since over a week. He is also aggressive and gets in my face to shout if I am walking barefoot around the house or cooking for more than 30 mins etc..."

AMA!",dreamsaremade,ApplyingToCollege,https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/534nrl/im_kat_clowes_independent_educational_consultant/,"Hello Reddit!  My name is Kat Clowes and I’m an independent educational consultant for March Consulting, meaning that I help students with college admissions and career planning.  I’ve been doing this for six years now (going on my 4th full time, as the first two were during graduate school) and hold a BA in Communications from Santa Clara U, an MBA from Mt. St. Mary’s University in LA, and my consulting certificate from UC Irvine.  

I’ve worked with a variety of different schools and students across the board. Mostly, I focus on helping a student develop who they are, communicate that clearly, and plan for the future.  Students of mine have gone on to graduate early from high school and start college, have been admitted to various prestigious colleges, but most importantly have made themselves stand out in the world by developing their own projects and expertise.  I’ve had students intern at NASA, start successful businesses, create their own non-profits, and tinker with cool robotics projects.  

My mission is to bust through the same misconceptions that I had when I was applying to college back in 2001.  Mostly, I want you to learn from all the mistakes that I made when I was applying to college and while I was in college.  Below are a few tips that I tell most of my clients and, although I know it's a bit of a novel, I think will help you in your journey.  

***TL;DR: I gave you a bunch of tips for admissions and life.  AMA!***

Here are a few tips for college admissions:

**A college/university is more than architecture, town, and prestige.**  Yes, you want to be happy in the area, inspired by campus, and (maybe) be the student who can say they got into a prestigious school but you are also buying a product.  Almost every school has study abroad, claims small class sizes, and looks great in the brochure.  Look instead at the classes you’ll be taking, the professors who will be teaching you, and how the university will help you develop as a person.  Read their mission statement and values.  Investigate their traditions and the extra academic and career options they will offer you.  Ask how often it is that students do research or internships, get help from the tutoring center, or what kind of projects current students are doing to make them stand out in their majors.  Don’t get sucked in by rankings and pretty buildings.  Do your research.  Ask questions.  

**Create a list of things that you want admissions officers to know about you.**  Your application is not a collection of documents, it’s an entire picture of you as a person.  You’re going to be evaluated like all of the other students applying to that school, so make sure you cover everything about yourself that you want them to know.  Your essays and your letters of recommendation are sometimes the only aspects of your application where the admissions office will be able to see who you truly are apart from your grades and your test scores.  Make it count.  Think of your application as a whole.

**Please, PLEASE spend time on your essays.**  I highly recommend that you get help from Ethan Sawyer, the College Essay Guy.  He has amazing resources for students. 

**Start now.**  There is nothing stopping you from starting a business, becoming an expert in a particular area, shadowing current professionals, or simply starting a project that is your own.  While I say that, don’t start a project just because it “looks good on college applications.”  Everyone will be able to tell that your heart isn’t in it (including admissions officers).  If you’re interested in business, start something small and learn from it (selling on ebay, start a lemonade stand, sell t-shirts online, start an etsy shop, become an amazon affiliate, etc).  My most successful students started something small and built it up over time, providing themselves with opportunities they never would have had in college and high school otherwise.

**Finally, talk to admissions officers.**  Talk to faculty members and current students.  Don’t be afraid to ask questions about the environment and tell them about yourselves so they might recommend other programs and opportunities their school has for you.

Here are a few tips for **life** after college admissions:

**You can’t find yourself in college.** I’m sorry to burst a lot of bubbles, but nothing is going to magically happen.  If you’re not LOOKING for yourself, you’re not going to FIND yourself.  Sitting in your dorm and taking classes tells you nothing.  You need to have goals (SMART goals), expose yourself to different experiences, and start building your network.  Read extra books, try new things, and step outside of that proverbial comfort-zone.  No one goes to college and has it all figured out by the time that they leave.  What they do is work on it one bit at a time.

**Don’t let fear rule you.**  Yes, this is a terrifying process.  You’re submitting a part of yourself for someone else to judge and it is the next four years of your life.  However, success comes from experimenting and failure.  If you don’t make any move, you’re only going to stress yourself out more.  Make a move and go with it.  If it’s not the right one, change course.

**College is a conduit for your future.** It is what you make of it.  You’re paying a lot of money for resources and opportunities, so use them.  Also, I’ve found that saying you’re a college student can sometimes get you through doors that are closed to you as an adult.  I created my own path by using the resources at my school to get me there.  My most successful students are able to do this too.  Here are a few to consider:

**Join professional organizations.** Every industry has some sort of professional organizations (heck, reddit has subreddits dedicated to different professions) where people who are interested or in your industry meet and talk about...you guessed it...that industry.  These are the people who will be hiring you.  Also, you can grab a nifty student discount from that organization, get scholarships to their conferences, and network/get to know the people who will soon be hiring you.  Why wouldn’t you join in college?  Gain mentors from those who will be hiring you?  Get great advice and know what’s going on in the industry to rock your interview?  Join.

**Life doesn’t work by major.**  You’re not going to be in one field for the rest of your life.  In fact, most of us will have anywhere from four to seven careers in our lifetime.  

While majoring in communications in college, I thought I had it all figured out in a cookie-cutter type way.  Unfortunately (or fortunately), the benefits of my liberal arts requirements came into play later, and I was glad that I was exposed to a variety of different subjects and topics, because I could always relate with someone.  If you’re looking into medicine, don’t be afraid to minor (or major, as medical schools increasingly are looking for variety in their applicant pools) in business.  The likelihood of you running your practice is high and without business experience, you’re not going to get very far.  The same goes for engineering and computer science.  You can have the best app or software in the world but unless you know a bit about marketing (or enough to hire someone awesome at it), you’re not going far.  

You get what you put into it.  Just like an entrepreneur, you have to create what you want.  NO one is going to hand you anything.

**The system isn’t as rigid as they make you believe.**  I graduated high school a year early and started community college with two signatures from administration.  The same goes for college; do you want to create your own research?  Start a business?  Do something cool?  Someone on your campus will give you approval and money, if you start fishing around and asking.  

**Use your alumni.**  I can’t stress this enough, thinking that the alumni house was merely for after I graduated college.  The main reason people go to prestigious schools is for the alumni connections.  At your school (no matter where it is), you have access to thousands of other people that you already have a common connection to--some of which were in your major.  Have the alumni office connect you to them.  Take them to coffee, ask them questions, ask to shadow them at work--they’re one of the richest sources of information you’ll have.  Thinking about your future engineering career?  Why not ask an engineer?  One of the best questions you can ask:  “What would you  have done differently when you were my age?”

**Begin building your brand.**  You’ll need to know who you are, what you want out of life, and what signals you’re broadcasting to the world.  What type of friend are you or will you be? Employee?  Boss?  Significant other?  Start working on developing your brand now for the professional world.  Get business cards, start your LinkedIn profile, and start dressing the part.  You can completely reinvent yourself in college, so go for it.

If you’re looking for more tips, I wrote a book called *[Put College to Work: How to use college to the fullest to discover your strengths and find a job you love before you graduate](https://www.amazon.com/Put-College-Work-Discover-Strengths/dp/161035253X)* that’s available on Amazon and other major booksellers.  Pick up a copy.  I created a step-by-step timeline for each quarter of college through senior year for you to follow.  

Also, my other consultant and I are launching a podcast called [The Almost Everything College Podcast](http://www.mymarchconsulting.com/almosteverythingcollegepodcast) where we talk about everything we wished we would have known about college, college admissions, and life in general.  We’ll be answering questions like:  what do you do with a degree in English?  and other quandaries.  We'll be live September 23rd on iTunes and Stitcher.

With that said, AMA!"

I work with front-end and back-end but I'm especially good with back-end. I was just wondering what to expect as a junior developer because during my internship, I never worked with a team. Everything I did was a project that my supervisor designed for me that I completed solo. I have no idea what to expect task wise and wanted to hear some tales of your guys' junior position experience."
5352n2,23,2016-09-16,Journey from Depression to Landing Job,willthrowaway029,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5352n2/journey_from_depression_to_landing_job/,"I had always believed I was a smart student but after the first year of college the way I perceived myself had changed. At the end of the first year, I had 2.3 GPA overall after never getting a grade lower than a B in high school. I always worried that I wound’t get the job I wanted, as it was already hard to get any internships. 

That summer I felt very depressed and had always lied about my academics when friends or family asked. I felt I was lacking many skills and self-confidence.   I decided to do something about it instead of worrying about it all the time. I started reading more, changed my habits, and zoned in. Another year went by, got better grades but still no internship so again I was worried. I didn’t know what I was doing wrong. 

My biggest problem was I didn’t know the key to getting an internship or job were side projects. That year, I decided to take on a few side projects. I was starting to feel more confident in my programming abilities so I created a mobile app and got a few more projects on my github and I was able to land my first internship at a small startup as an Android Developer. That was one of the most exciting moments in life. 

The next year, I decided I wanted to get into web development so learned MEAN stack and built a high-quality web app. After having a hard time getting interviews in the previous years, I had no problem this time. My self-confidence had grown tremendously and I learned how to pitch myself to people better. I went to the job fair the final year of college and I was able to land more than a handful of interviews. I went through interviews and I was able to get the best job I could’ve imagined mid-way through the school year. 

Although I didn’t end up with the best GPA, a 3.3, I couldn’t have cared less because it didn’t define who I was and what I could do. As I’ve started working now, I reflect on those down days and realize what a long way I have come. So the lesson to be learned is that SIDE PROJECTS are essential in getting a job so keep learning, stay engaged in the work you do,  and don’t lose hope."

I come from very ambitious driven background but made many poor decisions in college and after that resulted in me not having a job until i was much older, and a minimum wage one at that. In addition to not having a social life or being able to meet girls, I'm trying to land a job and build something where i can get a job, build a career and establish a nest egg. I'm fortunate to be supported by family but they won't be there for long.

I'm based in the bay area and need to enter a career that can be financially successful but i'm having trouble finding a path as I'm used to school where everything is defined. I feel every career path is locked out for me since I didn't take advantage of prestigious internships and jobs in college and don't have a high gpa.

Is there a field i can enter in something quick to get me out of my rut? I've already graduated college a long time ago and my degree isn't going to land me a job directly, what's a job i can go into and a clear path to get there and ensure financial success? I'm a person who's used to steps to reach a defined career, and i'm so used to college, i have a tough time navigating or entering the working world, there's plenty of tech companies around me but I don't know how to enter without a engineering background? Is there a post-bacc program i can enter, a master's program? What can i do in my area and in my situation?"
535opc,1,2016-09-16,"Can I keep this ""break"" from turning into a breakup?",Insertcleverpun_here,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/535opc/can_i_keep_this_break_from_turning_into_a_breakup/,"So about two weeks ago my boyfriend of nearly one year (by nearly I mean we were less than a month away) broke up with me. I freaked out (as women tend to do) and we ended up agreeing on a break instead. Basically, giving each other space because he definitely doesnt know what he needs and I did a lot to turn him off. I'll give you a run down of what I realized I was doing wrong and what Im doing to fix it: 1. I was really clingy and dependent on him, always wanted to be around him, couldnt be by myself, in other words, the world's biggest turn off. I've been talking about this with my therapist and part of it stems from OCD and part from childhood abandonment issues. To combat this I a) told him (and am actually keeping up with) no contact for a full week (no texting, calls, seeing each other, nothing. Only thing I messaged him about was an important email of his that got sent to my account because I was still logged into my email on his phone) and b) Ive been focusing on being more comfortable depending on myself. Ive been getting through panic attacks on my, keeping up with my health the best I ever have, being independent monetarily and transportation wise (he would help me out by giving me a ride if I needed it), and just overall finding ways to be self reliant, not something Ive ever done before. 2. I talked to much about whatever future we had together (stemming from number 1). He felt pressured and I can see why, we're too young to be thinking that far down the road, we both have no clue where we're ending up in life, but I didn't realize that since I was so dependent on others for security. We had been discussing an apartment for the summer next year because I'm currently homeless (my parents and I dont speak and the woman I was sharing a house with moved out of state and I cant afford the rent alone. I'm looking for an internship and it was my backup plan (obviously thats no more). Now Im making plans that dont revolve around a partner (starting with volunteering at my old scout camp this summer and dropping off the map for a few months to reconnect with myself and get in better shape). I've also been working out, started figure modeling for some colleges in the area, focusing on school work, etc. to put it in my mind that I'm responsible for my own life and no one else. 3. I was really critical of things and asked more of him than I had any right of say over. For example, I had asked him to quit smoking weed because it was an expensive and frankly unhealthy habit. He agreed but didn't like it. I also really didn't like it when his facial hair got too long, etc, etc. it was a lot of little things that got continually more smothering the more time went on for him. I've gotten the thought out of my head that its my place to change him, especially when hes not doing something seriously detrimental to himself (its not like hes not going to class or skydiving without a parachute) the things I was bothered by just dont matter in the grand scheme of things. Hes happier if he can smoke now and again, he likes his beard, and honestly Ive come to appreciate him for the man he is, not my ideal of him. Those are the primary things I did to negatively influence his opinion of me, but another factor in this breakup is his need to work out things in his own life. He's a senior in college and now is stuck between grad school or getting a job right away. Personally I think grad school is a good idea for him for two reason, one being that it gives him a chance to not be entirely responsible right away and take this next summer as a break to spend some much needed time with friends and family before adulthood really starts, and two being that he can go for free at his college since he has a research assistant job, and opportunity that he may never get again. He's overwhelmed by adulthood because he has just kept going and going and going with no time to just be young and carefree, and I think having a little downtime would be great for him. Either way he does genuinely need space to himself, and Im giving him that. I realize I did a lot of things wrong but I'm really doing my best to improve my life and my attitude. I guess what Im asking here is, would any of you men here, after seeing my readiness to realize what Ive been doing wrong, how to fix it and do better overall as a person, would you think I still have a chance to try again in this relationship. He's a very nice guy and while he made mistakes in our relationship a lot of them were a result of me acting desperate when I didnt know any better. He's funny, we got along great when I wasnt acting all nervesy, and we found each other quite physically attractive (we had a passionate sex life right up until the day we broke it off, so at least that wasnt one of the problems). I dont need him in my life, I could definitely survive without him, Im not trying to be one of those desperate ""Ill never live without him"" sort of girls, I just genuinely respect him as a strong human being and enjoy his company a lot, and I want him in my life if I can have him, and if he's willing to have me. So from the mouth of a woman to the ears of the dudes on reddit, please tell me how Im doing."
535su0,4,2016-09-17,The Intern and The Executrix [mF][oral][toy],ReallyJulianne,eroticliterature,https://www.reddit.com/r/eroticliterature/comments/535su0/the_intern_and_the_executrix_mforaltoy/,"As the phones rang outside her office, Charla Fox sat behind her desk texting away on her phone.

She texted, ‘Are we still on for tonight?’

He answered, ‘Yes.’

‘Can you get kinky?’

‘How kinky?’

‘Ben Wa balls.’

Charla waited and waited for his response. He was probably using a search engine to find out what Ben Wa balls are.

Finally, his response. ‘In you, right?’

'Of course.’

‘I can accommodate that.’

Thomas Keller was a good looking man with strong looking hands and a great smile under his hipster beard. At least that how he looked on his profile picture.

“Ms. Fox?”

Charla looked up to see her summer intern Jason Graham standing at the door. A twenty three year old kid with charming good looks, the senior from Columbia had been her gopher all summer in her investment banking department. He stepped in with a three inch thick manila envelope.

“The contracts from Wassermans are here,” he said, setting the envelope down on her desk.

“Good. Thanks. Have a seat. I want to talk to you,” she said, setting down her phone.

He sat looking a bit anxious and confused. He should. She was wearing her power suit for her breakfast meeting she had this morning with executives in from the firm’s west coast office. And though her jacket hung on the coat rack and her blouse was delicate and lady like, she still had the aura of a boss with her keen deep blue eyes set in an alabaster face framed with lush dark hair. Jason took a seat across from her.

Charla said, “Well, I just wanted you to know that I think you did a good job and I appreciated your efforts.”

He looked relieved. Charla pushed an envelope his way saying, “You’ve earned this letter of recommendation.”

“Thank you,” he said, taking it and pocketing the letter in his jacket’s breast pocket. “I was going to ask but I didn’t want to push it.”

“Can I take you out for lunch? Show you my appreciation for all of your coffee runs.”

“Uh, yeah sure. Thanks.”

The two walked to a noisy steak house where she and Jason got a booth in a dark corner where the ordered lunch and drinks. The two never returned to the office, drinking the afternoon away, as she shared her tips on how to succeed in cut throat corporate America. When Charla saw the orange light of a sunset glaring through the one shaded window, she realized how late it was. The crowd was becoming more raucous and women in tight dresses were now mixing with the men at the bar. Her buzzing phone skittered over the table. She picked it up, tapping the screen to read the message.

From: Thomas Keller ‘Sorry. Can’t make it.’

Translation: ‘Sorry, I found a hotter woman.’

“Shit,” she said, slamming down her phone.

“What?” he asked.

“That was my date for tonight. He can’t make it. I’m about to lose a bet.”

His brows furrowed in confusion. She sipped her drink and thought what the hell, tell the guy. The shock value alone will be worth it.

“My girlfriends and I give each other sex toys, you know to spice up our sex lives, and we take pictures of using them as proof that they were used. If you don’t, you have to buy the girls a gift. We meet tomorrow. I need to prove that I used my gift.”

“And what did you get, if you don’t mind me asking?”

Charla looked both ways before pulling the box from her bag and handing it to him. She had planned to go straight to her date after work and had brought them along. Jason opened the box and looked at the heavy silver balls.

“What are these?” he asked.

“They’re Ben Wa balls. They’re used to tighten and stimulate your pussy.”

He quickly closed the box and handed it back to her. His eyes lingered on hers before looking down in submission. He grabbed his beer.

He asked, “So you just going to shove them in?”

“My date was going to do that and take the picture.”

“So, you need help?”

She looked at him and laughed. He looked dejected and she stopped laughing to reach out and touch his hand.

“You’re my intern. There’s this thing called ethics.”

“As of four p.m., I’m no longer your intern.”

The executrix and her former intern took a ride share to the lower east side where they walked up a flight of stairs to her apartment. He looked around her airy modern apartment three times larger than his with teak wood floors, plush rugs, well placed artwork and streamline furniture.

“Drink?” she asked.

“Sure. I’ll have what you’re having,” he said, sitting on a butter yellow leather couch.

She stepped into her kitchen and sliced some lime before throwing ice into two tumblers, splashing vodka over them and garnishing the drinks with lime wedges. She handed him his drink and sat beside him, drunkenly kicking off her shoes.

He said, “Nice place.”

“Thanks,” she said, gazing at him with a silly grin on her face as she played with her hair.

“I’ve got to be honest with you. You made my day when you walked by my desk. The way your ass flexes under those tight skirts, it made me chub every time. I mean I’m not sick, and I was taught to respect women, but you,” he said, biting his lip. “You, with that dark hair and those blue eyes and that body. I just wanted to get up in that.”

“You watched me walk by?”

“Every day.”

She giggled before kissing him again and again until they were making out like horny teens in the backseat of a car. His arms pulled her against him until her boobs smashed against his body. Panting, she pushed him away and he opened his eyes to see her flushed face.

“The balls,” she said. “I need to get a picture.”

He sat up as she reached for her purse and pulled out the box and her phone. She set the phone on the coffee table before removing one ball from the box which she raised between the both of them. He kissed it with his bow shaped lips which brushed her fingertips. She handed him a ball before standing to her feet to unzip and shimmy out of her pants. She stepped out of her panties and stripped off her top as well, to stand in front of him dressed only in a black scalloped lace bra. He couldn’t take his off the neat strip of sable fuzz on his boss lady’s pussy inches from his nose. The steel ball was warming in his hand as she leaned over to loosen his tie and unbutton his shirt. She kissed his waiting lips, straddling his lap to sit her naked bottom on his thighs. She took his face in his hands and kissed his lips before drunkenly falling over onto the couch. She giggled, flexing her pedicured toes, lazily gazing at him as she watched her handsome young assistant get up.

“You want to take pictures, Ms. Fox?” he said, getting up to aim the lamp light her way. “Let’s make a movie.”

Jason picked up her camera, aimed it at the couch, and propped it up against a candle before pressing on the video recording button. He plucked the second ball from its box as Charla became comfortable spreading her legs a little to accommodate him.
The camera recorded as he bent to lick her clit. Her fingers roamed in his soft hair as she pressed his head into her moist private warmth. He looked up into the camera before kissing the silver ball, then backed up to insert it inside her wet fold. Charla moaned with pleasure. Her head sank into plush pillows as she processed the feeling of heavy cold steel inside her. Jason backed away to make sure the camera caught it all. He stared at his former boss writhing and hissing like a cat in heat, knees up, cunt out, her swollen pink nub peeking out from between her controlled fuzziness. The sight made him very hard in his pants which he’d take off only if invited. He still thought of her as the boss lady but he couldn’t take it anymore. He dove down between her legs to suck on what teased him the most.

“Oh, Mr. Graham,” she said, enjoying the weight of the ball inside her as his tongue tripped and slopped over her clit.

She contracted and relaxed her Kegel muscles over and over, feeling the steel ball against her soft accommodating insides as Jason planted his palm on her inner thigh to spread her legs and lick a little deeper inside her. He took the second ball and popped it into her pink moistness. She arched her back against the couch as he nuzzled the secret flesh he was privileged to kiss. Charla panted out, “Okay, turn off the camera.” Jason reached over for the phone, fumbling with it until the screen went black.

He asked, “You want me to take them out?”

“What’s the rush?”

He returned to his obsession, burying his head between her legs once more. Charla clutched her knees around his shoulders as she sighed in absolute heaven at the tongue bath he was giving. It went on all night.

Charla awoke in her bed to the grey morning light with Jason beside her. She nearly panicked when her arm hit his back curled up beside her. With an overwhelming sensation to pee, she got up, wrapped a robe around her and walked into the bathroom. She peed as she held the Ben Wa balls still in her. She wiped and rose a little, steadying herself into a squat to take out the balls. She was just about to insert a finger to fish them out when she thought about it. Maybe her pussy does need a little tightening. After all, the ex-husband was a stud with a solid nine inches of girthy length. Four years of his kind of pounding would make any girl wonder if her pussy will snap back into shape. Hmmmm. Maybe she’ll wear them a little longer.

Alright. We've all seen the recent drama post. If not, to summarize, someone wanted multiple recent pledges refunded, there was confusion on CS's end due to the mentioning of a chargeback. CS responded to that by closing his account.

Now, you can argue about whether or not this was justified on CIG's part or not. I replied in there, so you can check my reply history if you want my personal opinion on it. However, one thing the OP mentioned was this:

----

Just a heads up, /u/wleverett_cig did reply to that post and say there was confusion and that they'll get things sorted. Seeing as he's a Game Support Manager, he's basically the highest authority, so he'll be able to sort things out.

UPDATE: The poster has gotten his recent pledges refunded and his old pledge and reward returned to him. Please see below.
----

&gt;In the face of such a rejection, these articles advised and encouraged backers to reply that they would be willing to start a chargeback if they did not receive a refund.

This, ladies and gentleman, boys and girls, is why **we do not believe everything we read on the internet.** This is absolutely *fucking* wrong. The thing is, ""threaten chargebacks"" has become a common response to any situation in which you're trying to get a refund and the other side is dragging their heels, and this is probably an honest mistake that others can make too.

That's why I'm making this post. Its only tangentially related to Star Citizen, but honestly I believe it could help anyone else who needs to get a refund and might be considering this tactic.

----

#Alright Prof, what is a chargeback, and why do they have it?#

A charge back is [""a process that allows debit and credit card holders to reverse transactions when **there is a problem with the goods or services they've purchased using their cards.**""](http://www.choose.net/money/guide/features/chargeback-visa-mastercard.html)

Please note the bolded text. Yep, that's right, its only when there's an issue with the goods or services purchased. That same site has a bit more info:

&gt;Breaches covered under chargeback include situations like the following:

&gt;* The cardholder has bought a TV. As soon as they get it home they realise it has a serious electrical fault but the retailer refuses to help.
&gt;* The cardholder orders an item online but it never arrives and the retailer refuses to refund the cost.
&gt;* The cardholder was overcharged for an item as the result of a technical fault.
&gt;* The cardholder looks at their statement and sees that there's been a clerical error: the account was debited twice for one purchase.
&gt;* There's an unexplained and possibly fraudulent charge to the account.
&gt;* The trader goes bust before they can provide the goods already paid for.

Alrighty, so that's what a chargeback is meant for. If a request for chargeback doesn't fit any of these, your bank will likely say ""No, fuck off"" and just charge you a fee for wasting their time. Does the situation in the post linked in the intro fit any of these categories?

/u/SC_TheBursar posted this:

&gt;Another reason for not requesting chargebacks unless they are truly warranted is they can be recorded in your credit history (although typically not displayed on most traditional short form credit reports!). Perform a few (or even just one if it is denied) and now you are a problem customer - kind of like vexatious litigants or particularly clumsy/unlucky people (when it comes to insurance) these are people companies don't want to do business with. It can damage your chances of being approved for future credit.

Excellent info, and something to keep in mind.

#Would the situation linked in the intro actually be legitimate grounds for a chargeback? If not, what happens?#

**This is a hypothetical: a chargeback was not begun, and while it was mentioned, the intended message was that it would happen if they failed to live up to their ToS i.e. not done within the two week max period. There was misinterpretation on CIGs part, which they've apologized for.**

No, it doesn't, as no part of the Terms of Services was broken by CIG. Let's go to those, shall we? First, the bit that says you can cancel the pledge within 14 days.

&gt;Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Terms of Service, you may cancel your Pledge for any reason within 14 days of the date on which you made your Pledge if your Pledge is for Virtual Goods (as defined in Sec. 11 below) (“Cancellation Period”). RSI Intern. Terms of Service 1/2015_Draft Final 

&gt;To cancel your Pledge during the applicable Cancellation Period, you simply need to notify us in writing of your decision to cancel your Pledge. The easiest way to do so is to complete and submit to us our cancellation form which can be found here. You can also cancel your Pledge during the applicable Cancellation Period by emailing us at support@cloudimperiumgames.com.

This is fairly cut and dry. As long as there's nothing else in the ToS they can point to, you may cancel a pledge within 14 days of the date in which the pledge is made, by notifying CIG support. This was done by the poster in that thread, and everything proceeded fine.

The problem is, they have this bit in the ToS as well:

&gt;If you cancel your Pledge during the applicable Cancellation Period, we will without undue delay, and in any event within fourteen (14) days from the date on which we receive notice of your decision to cancel your Pledge, fully refund to you the amount of your Pledge. In accordance with applicable financial control and banking rules, we reserve the right to refund you using the same means of payment as you used to make your Pledge.

As long as they make sure the refund goes through within 14 days and that there was no ""undue delay"" (which, considering the workload they have, is probably easy enough), they have not broken the ToS.

----

#Why did CIG refund his entire account, if the chargeback would have failed?#

Because of an error, and an apology has been issued. CIG's Ray Roocroft stated [""may I apologise for how this has been handled. You are completely right in your request, that you are entitled to a refund for any pledges made within the 14 day statutory period (as your request was within 14 days of the purchases) and your account should not have been fully refunded and closed down - this was done in error.""](http://imgur.com/ZurcNEM)


----

#So, I shouldn't ever threaten to start a chargeback?#

I'm not saying that! Chargebacks do have their purpose, which were listed way back up top. If CIG were to have taken over a month to get back to that poster linked in the intro, a chargeback would have been perfectly justified!

If Star Citizen were to release and it only worked on a MacBook Air, **and they refused to refund you**, you would be justified in beginning a chargeback.

The key thing is, think of chargebacks as a weapon. Arguments change drastically when one side pulls a knife, and you should not be surprised if the person you pulled a knife on doesn't want anything to do with you afterwards.

----

#Conclusion#

I hope this helps some people understand what exactly a chargeback is, and why it shouldn't be thrown around willy nilly. Please feel free to ask questions, correct me on a mistake, or anything else.

TL;DR: I spent 40 goddamn minutes typing this, you can spend the time reading it if you actually care.

I'd also like to take a moment to say that this was never meant to be a slam post against the original poster of the drama post, but that honestly after rereading it a few times today it definitely came off that way even to me. Therefore, I'd like to issue an apology to him for my mischaracterization. 
----

However, my point stands: Chargebacks are not to be used lightly."

as i have always been into design on the compute, my dad recently came at me with the idea of maybe exploring user experience/design. so ive been reading up on it. which also got the idea of web design/development in my head.  after playing around with these ideas and reading about them, i figured its something i could really get into, as i am also a very visual person. a few years back, before my life really changed due to some unsuspecting circumstances, i used to be really into this whole design thing - photoshop, illustrator, indesign, dreamweaver - so i am familiar with some of the basic. 


so, i decided to go BACK to my community college and take my first  intro class, ""Website design"". i really have no clue where to get started in this field, how to get a job, etc., so im hoping this class will just lay down the basics of design and development. the class will also introduce me to html, css and javascript, which is good because i have never, ever used those before let alone done ANY coding in my life, so that is the only part that I am not too familiar with. can anyone else tell me what to expect? i am still somewhat new to the whole thing, so any helpful links or advice on web design/development in general would be much appreciated. 

like i said, i really have no clue where to start"

And I don't like it when the two mix.

As a kid, I was always the one who would either break his arm or his leg, or I would sprain something, etc. You know how it is. Stupid kids doing stupid things that get stupid consequences.

But it was one particular day that made my childhood something that I don't wanna look back on.

It was February 10th, 1997. My fourteenth birthday. I had always loved going outside and playing in the snow, and then coming in for my traditional birthday hot chocolate. My mom would always make it special. Put one of those big jet-puffed marshmallows in it with a candle on top.

But that year, my driveway had been covered inch to inch in a thick layer of ice. After I was done sledding, I had been walking up the slanted walkway on my driveway, when I tripped over my own feet and fell flat on my face. I immediately lifted my face onto my gloves, and when I pulled my hands away, there was a stream of blood coming from my face. Copious amounts.

I yelled loud enough through the red river covering my face so that my mom could hear me. She ran outside, took one look at me, and I saw all the color drain from her face. She's never been to good at looking at blood.

But she shoved the feeling aside just for me, to help me into the house, get me a towel to put on my face, and immediately drove me to the ER. 

When we got there, the line for people waiting to get help was amazing. Some of those people didn't even look like they needed help, and most of them were women or children. My mom grabbed my arm and pushed me through the crowd of people to get to the desk where the interns were trying desperately to get everything situated. My mom took the bloody towel off of my face, put it on the counter, and ordered me to be taken to a room immediately. The intern who was looking at my mother like she was insane just kind of gave me back the towel and lead us to a room.

I held the towel against my face for a good two hours while we waited for a doctor to come in. During that time, my mother had started switching channels on the TV and stopped at the weather channel. A loud clap of thunder went on overhead as the screen displayed a terrible snowstorm heading our way. Then, when the doctor came in with his clipboard, the lights flickered. 

That was not a good sign.

The doctor removed my towel, cringed, and took me into the x-ray room. After they had been taken, my mom got a phone call from my brother and had to step out for a few minutes while we got the x-rays back. The doctor came back in and showed me them, and said that I was really lucky. The break was so bad that one of the larger fragments was just a millimeter away from piercing my brain, which means I was just a millimeter away from instant death. He then asked where my mother was, and I told him that she had just stepped outside the room to make a call. He said he hadn't seen her, so we both came to the conclusion that she had gone to get something to eat or drink. He left the room without another word.

About five minutes later, the lights flickered. 

And then all of the power in the hospital itself went out.

I kind of panicked, but my lack of blood and high dosage of various medications kept me from freaking out too much. I decided to get up and make my way somewhere to grab a flashlight and ask what was going on. I guess the snowstorm had gotten really bad and caused everything to lose power.

I got up, pressed a clean wash rag up against my nose, and walked into the hallway. The entire place smelled like shit, literally. It smelled like decaying carcasses, of what, I really didn't know. When I walked out into the hall, however, everyone was gone. Everything that made the ER resemble an ER was gone. There was nothing except me and the disgusting smell.

By now, I just wanted to get out of here. A roar of thunder rolled over the unfamiliar building, and I was starting to fear my surroundings.

I walked down the hall and tried to see if any of the doors would open, but they wouldn't. They had the paint scratched off of the outsides of them, and every time I went near another one, it smelled even more of shit and dead things. 

And then, at last, one of the doors opened.

But it's contents were disturbing.

There was a dim light coming from a small window next to the ceiling in the very corner of the room, so I could barely see. The smell of rotting things was the strongest it had been the entire time I was there, and there was a pile of something. I went over and kind of nudged it, and it made a sloshing noise. A wet slap sounded throughout the room as I kicked the pile. A disfigured spherical object rolled towards me, where I was standing. 

Then I realized what it was, and ran out of the room to go puke in the hallway.

Who would put a pile of dead, mutilated children inside an emergency room? What kind of sick fuck would do that? It still makes me sick. I have to move on from here, no more details about that. 

Anyway, I finally found a flight of stairs. I tried to make my way down it as fast as I could possibly go. I just wanted to go home. I've now seen things that shouldn't be seen by a fourteen year old.

When I reached the bottom, I found the exit doors. I ran over and tried to open them, but they were locked. Looking around for something to smash the doors with, I heard a groan from one of the closets.

It was a demented sound, something that sounded like it should belong in a horror movie. Then it walked out of the shadows and into the dim light.

The thing had a slender figure, and was crooked. You could hear every bone in it's body grind up against one another as it slowly shambled into view. It was pitch black, and looked like it was covered in oil, the black liquid dripping out of it's gaping maw as it's white eyes glared into my soul. My heart stopped. 

Then I saw it.

A chair, five feet away from the creature. I ran over and grabbed the chair, and ran back over to the door, throwing the chair through the glass. The creature shrieked, and started moving more quickly towards me. I jumped out of the door and looked around for a vehicle or something, something to get out of the place.

A pickup truck out of the corner of my eye caught my attention. I ran over and busted the window with my bare hand just to unlock it. With my bloody knuckles and dried bloody nose, I climbed into the truck and fortunately, found the key. The creature was crawling on all fours towards the vehicle, and I was shaking as I put the key into the ignition. When it started, I floored the gas pedal and drove away.

When I finally made my way home, I got out of the truck and went inside my house to see my mother crying at the table. When she noticed that I had entered the house, a large smile grew on her face.

A few months after my traumatizing experience, I decided to look up what the building was that I had been in. I gave details about the place, and what came up shocked me.

It was an abandoned insane asylum, that held everyone. And one type of person it held was liable for raping and murdering children. And the strangest part? It was at least forty miles away from where the ER was, and I had been missing for approximately six weeks after that. 

Now I don't know what happened during that snowstorm, or what it meant when the lights flickered. But all I know is that I have a true hate for that hospital and snowstorm mix. It truly was my living nightmare."

This FU did not happen recently, but I am writing it now because I finally found it in myself to uncurl from the corner and not force my sadness down with ice cream. 

___________________________________________________________________________________________

Going back to about 8 months, it was my junior year of high school and summer was coming up. Most kids are excited about this time of the year, as they can Neflix, game, or screw around for 2 months. However, seeing as how it was my last summer before I applied for college, I really wanted to do something meaningful. I know it's probably not a surprise to many to hear that I aspire to pursue medicine as an Asian, but it is just what I'm genuinely passionate about. I spend a few weeks researching online for medical programs and finally decided on a few to apply for. Within the pile of rejection letters, I was accepted into a summer volunteer program by a well-known hospital. Needless to say, I was pumped and felt as if I had already become a doctor. 

Fast forward a few months, I finished the orientation and training and had been placed into the Pediatrics department. The placements were random, but to be honest I was really hoping to land in a surgical department. Weeks pass and I get pretty comfortable with the floor staff and begin to really enjoy my time there. I take this chance to talk to the department manager about my interest in surgery. To my surprise, she was really supportive and hooked me up with a Pediatric Neurosurgery PA. 

On the first day, I wake up at the asscrack of dawn and got there an hour early to make a good impression. For clarity sake, let's call him Stavis. Stavis asked me a few questions I had expected beforehand, such  as: ""why do you want to be a doctor?"". I guess he liked my answers because his stern countenance gradually became friendlier. After that, he introduced me to the team and I followed them on their rounds. On the way, the physician seemed really curious about me and kept engaging me in conversations. Usually, I'm pretty natural at these things, but I was extremely intimidated by this guy. Mind you, Stavis showed me the neurosurgery book that the physician wrote and told me about how he invented his own surgical procedure, so it's hard not to respect this man for his mad intelligence and feel like a puny tick in his presence. I overhear the nurses joking around, calling him ""Mr. Sunshine"" on the way to the patient rooms. I only wish I found out the reason sooner.

The whole experience felt so surreal, going room to room and seeing real life situations of people. It's one thing to see it in movies and shows, but to be there in actual person and witness the pain that these families had to go through brought out a whole new level of compassion. The team went into a break room after the rounds and they started joking around and gossiping. The physician turned his attention to me and asked me questions about school and my interests. It was at this point I discovered the meaning behind his name. I told him about my robotics team and he shot everything down in the most negative way possible. Every year the competition that our team competes in releases new game rules which teams have to design and build a robot to compete in. Halfway through my explanation, he cuts me off and tells me he's only interested in our robot. So I describe our robot and the capabilities we incorporated into its design. He responds be saying, ""So you don't build actual human-like robotics? They're just little cars that go around shooting balls? That's disappointing."" I understand that he's smart and all, but does he really expect high school kids to be building androids? After this I was pretty much speechless and gave short one word answers, wishing I never said anything in the first place. 

The team had to go into surgery and I guess that's where my day was gonna end because I didn't think I would be allowed in the operating room. I waited for them to let me know it was time to part, but I didn't believe my ears when the RN told me Mr. Sunshine asked if I wanted to join them. I was at a loss for words and all I wanted to do was give her a hug and thank god bestowing me this opportunity. She told me I needed to complete an MRI training and she'll schedule me to come whenever there are good surgeries to watch. Fast forward a few weeks, my volunteer program had already ended and I confirmed with the program director that it's okay for me to shadow the surgeon. It was also complicated to work out my school schedule with my counselor, but that also worked out in the end. Everything was going so smoothly, it felt like all the stars perfectly aligned for me to be able to do this.

Finally, the scheduled date comes and I'm rolling around in my bed all night waiting for the asscrack of dawn once again. I debate for a while what I should wear and ended up choosing a pair of Khakis and a Black and white plaid shirt on top of a t-shirt. Little did I know, this 10 minutes of time would fuck up everything. 

Once again I arrive about an hour early and look for the RN. I've mainly been communicating with her about scheduling and training so I thought it would only be appropriate to meet up with her first. She sent me the code for the lobby door and told me to meet up with her in the x-ray room. I start punching in the numbers to the lobby door but I guess I entered something wrong so I pull out my phone to check the code again, but right at that moment Mr. Sunshine appears from the corner and gives me this suspicious look. I greet him and he opens the door for me, giving me a gesture to welcome me in but at the same time sending a suspicious look. 

I walk down the hall trying to locate an ""x-ray room"", but no luck. I walk back to try to find Mr. Sunshine and when I approached him, he stopped me before I can say anything and asked, ""Why are you here? Who are you?"" I felt my heart skip a beat and I wish time froze because I did not see this coming and didn't know how to respond. I guess it's no surprise he forgot about me after a few weeks, so I tried to calm myself down and explain the situation to him. I begin by going back to how I was a part of the volunteer program and shadowed this department. Then about how the RN had told me he offered to let me in the operating room. Before I could finish, he cuts me off again saying, ""Nono I don't care, why are you dress like that? You can't be here dressed like that, you should be arrested."" I was so confused at this point because the RN had told me I could wear anything since I'll be wearing scrubs anyways. I continued to attempt at maintaining my composure, but at this point, the ruckus had brought the department manager out of his office and he too started to question me.

 I felt my knees starting to feel weak at this point and started panic inside. I tell them to let me call the RN so she could help me clear things up. Turns out, the RN is relatively new and I found out she might lose her job over this. The department manager calls the RN and tells her to come over immediately and he scolds at both of us. While he is scolding, Stavis and Mr. Sunshine walks by with the team and I heard Stavis saying, ""It's not that bad, he's just wearing a torn up shirt."" I've been through a lot of bullying before, but that single sentence literally crushed me. At that point, I just kept my head down and waited for everything to be over. The RN apologized to me after all that and I let her know that it's okay and I should be sorry for risking her job. I told her I'll never show my face there again and left. When I arrived home, my parents had just woke up to go to work and asked me why I had come home so soon. I couldn't find face them and went straight to my room wishing I could just fall asleep and wake up to a bad dream. But in the end, reality is reality and I had to face the fact that I just did the biggest FU of my life.

TL;DR: Got offered a chance to intern with a genius surgeon as a high school student, didn't find out about the dress code, told to never show my face there again.

How can I avoid getting friend zoned and get her involved?,Thaaz,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/53739y/i_26_m_fell_for_coworker_23_f_how_can_i_avoid/,"Actually it's the 2nd time I ask a question about this girl - previous topic is titled: 'This girl at work [23 F] was looking at me [26 M] for months, now I started to pay attention. What next?'

To make it short, she started internship in March and gave me hundreds of smiles and cute looks, but we've been talking only since last week. First we used internet communicator, but I understood she won't open without having a REAL conversation.

She agreed to talk during work hours, in a secluded place outside building. We had 3 such meetings, each lasting ~60 minutes, so that's great. I learnt she will work here at least for another 3 months, and I told her - I'm very emotional and nervous in such situations - that I enjoy her looking at me, that I want more of that, and I'm interested in having a date in near future. She said she'll think about it, smiling.

Now I'm a little anxious she knows perfectly well I fell for her and she can toy with me. I don't know if she has a boyfriend, probably yes, but hell - as long as she's talking to me, it doesn't matter. I just want to avoid getting friend zoned. On one hand, she seemed interested for many months, she keeps eye contact and is nice to me. On the other, my gentle attempts at touching her didn't work out, she's very secretive about herself (although opened up a little yesterday), and she doesn't give me any clear signs of attraction.

I don't know what it means, maybe it's just fun for her and she isn't taking me seriously (=friend zone). Or maybe she has a BF and weighs her 'options'. Or plays hard to get. I'm confused.

Bottom line: I leave tomorrow on delegation and won't see her (or text) for more than a week. I'm losing my mind about it and I'd love to know she feels the same. If not, well, I must do everything to change it, because it's my no. 1 priority. But how can I avoid discouraging her? How to keep her interested, when to ask her out, how to act without drama and read her intentions? Lots of questions, but I was 'out' for so many years that it's hard to grasp.

However, the dynamics of getting back together can be so different from relationship to relationship.

I've been in two relationships now where we've been apart for three months. The first was in undergrad where we had different internships in different states. Things seemed to be going well and we communicated a lot but kept ourselves busy and totally trusted each other. When she came back, I was so excited, but something immediately felt off. She seemed cold and distant and wasn't eager to be alone with me. She seemed to just acknowledge me while going on about meeting up with friends and her new roommates and how much she wanted to see them all. Needless to say I felt a little lost and especially neglected. 

Things were rocky ar that point and I eventually found out part of why. Within a couple weeks of some tense and frustrating time we had kind of a heat to heart because I was fed up and basically the gist of it was this: I missed her more and more over time and basically wanted to binge on her when she was back. Make up for lost time. She was never really a relationship oriented person so to her she was still adjusting to being back and getting into the rhythm of school again. So she felt like she was fighting me off from smothering her. Basically what I got out of it was she would have expected to pick things up date by date again and not just dive into each others arms. I sympathise and know she did nothing wrong but it still hurt to experience. We never really recovered fully, we tried, but she ended things some months after, but there were other reasons as well.

**Anyway I'd like to hear others' thoughts or experiences with reuniting and what things went as expected and what was different. Was there anything scary or exciting or comforting about how you and your partner changed over time? What was it like getting back to a physically close relationship? How did things change or what stayed exactly the same? Please bring up whatever tale or ideas you want to share!**

That last relationship crushed me for a while because of how it seemed to fizzle out, and there was nothing I could do about it. But I'm proud to say this time with my current girlfriend it succeeded! We were apart for three months this summer, and have had a lot of fun since we got back together. Things did pick up as they left off, no surprises. Frankly I had been worrying a lot because of the past but the signs were better. For example she changed her initial plans for getting to her family home from the airport a few hours away from here, and instead told me ""I want you to be the one to pick me up and I'm staying with you before going home the next day."" Not that significant, but in my situation it meant a lot. If you've read this far have some [success](http://i.imgur.com/3MoAIhG.jpg) [selfies](http://i.imgur.com/UrIMDnU.jpg), you've earned it!

**TLDR getting back together can have unexpected challenges. People think of reuniting differently. What are your thoughts or stories?**"

53875g,3,2016-09-17,Advice on dealing with an (increasingly) worse job,enginthroawa,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/53875g/advice_on_dealing_with_an_increasingly_worse_job/,"I took an internship over the summer across the country from where I lived with the federal government.  The department which I am in does engineering but they also do several other things very different from engineering.

During the time I was there several people left and the management structure changed.  So totally different management than the few months before.  But the old management seemed pretty good so when the new management offered me a position I said I would take it.  (I transition from intern to regular hire quite soon.)

Increasingly, under this new management, this job has gotten steadily more awful.  When I interviewed I was very explicit that I had a date for my FE exam set and that I expected to receive the sort of training which would lead to my PE, eventually.  I handed my boss the requirements of the kind of work that is expected and as far as I could tell, there was a pretty explicit understanding that this is the sort of work I would be doing.  My bosses boss even had a discussion with me about exactly how they planned on doing it.

Until about two weeks ago when someone else in the department decided to take another job elsewhere and I was told I would fill in for her duties indefinitely.  This wasn't even told to me directly.  My boss said I was doing it ""For now."" and then when he was talking to someone else in the field about my duties he said I would be doing it ""indefinitely.""

When I complained to him about the difference between expectation when I accepted the job and the expectations now and how they had changed so drastically he pretty much said ""Tough shit.  You can transfer out after your probation period.""  My probation is 2 years.  he also said I could get work in engineering eventually and pretty much I had to be patient about it but I was doing this other thing indefinitely.  So I'm not sure how that translates into fulfilling anything I asked for.  It seems more like ""We didn't lie to you, because you'll get one of the few things you asked for in your interview, eventually, at a time of our choosing.""

In addition, he hasn't told the person who is training me work completely unrelated to engineering that this is neither my field nor my interest so I had to explain this all to her, because she couldn't figure out why I wasn't showing that much interest in what she is training me in.

In addition to this, my boss often makes inappropriate jokes about women in the workplace, often to my face.  And maybe this would be less of a problem for me if the office I am in made it clear in any other way that they cared about my career goals.

I plan on quitting in 3 months if I don't have any other job offers, move back home, and do nothing but job search and study for my FE (if I don't pass it the first time).  Also, I was taken on as a regular hire, not in the recent graduates program.  Any other advice on how to deal with this situation?  Also, advice on applying to other federal jobs now?  (I have a couple of interviews coming up so I'm hopeful I won't have to do this.)"

538iyk,3,2016-09-17,THE BOOK OF POOK: Lesson 3,unorthodox-solutions,RedPillReadingGroup,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillReadingGroup/comments/538iyk/the_book_of_pook_lesson_3/,"Judge by actions, not words.

We create so much mental activity revolving around women - be it expectations, assumptions, justifications - that we no longer see the women for herself but our mental activity about her, which is most often falsely created from a limited perspective.

Men communicate overtly. We say what we think, mostly. Women communicate covertly, they do what they think and say what needs to be said to ensure they're not rocking the boat.

Look at her actions, not her words.

***
First off, I apologize for bitching during my last field report.

A friend here has a fuck-buddy, let's call her M. M's cousin sells social media likes, an old business of mine that did really well which I've been looking to get back into for years now. I met the M at a club and asked her about her cousin. He was at the club and she introduced me to him on the noisy, crowded dance floor. I was able to get his number after telling him I'm in the industry and would like to have a conversation about business.

The next day I send him a text and ask him to meet up for a beer to discuss business. He instead invites me to go out with him and his friends. I show up at his apartment to pre-game, and after some discussion realize we're on two different models of the business and I don't have much to bring to the table on his model of business.

His company has 8 million Euros in the bank, and he was telling me his new business model that's brought in the capital. He's sort of like the Genghis Kong of the app store, buying hundreds of app one-by-one and increasing their profitability. He's too legit now for my old ways of doing business, but he did hint at the fact of future opportunity when he said that recruiting new interns, partners, and employees is the hardest part.

Some of his employees showed up - really top-notch people, but comfortably informal kids in their 20s who mostly dropped out of school to learn a hard skill and apply that skill as part of an entrepreneurial venture.

I then met his friend who owns a company which sells CRM systems to Italian banks, along with a few other companies. I was talking to him about entrepreneurship, success, and the like. ""If you want something, you must take it. Don't think of money as the goal. The money is a means to an end. What you're working towards is the feelings and emotions money brings. I don't like to clean my house, so when I work I work so that I don't have to clean my house - I hire people to do that for me - I never work for the money. When a client is threatening to close a contract, I say, ok - go ahead. It's not about the money.""

We went to a club for a couple hours, and I said goodbye and left after 2 whiskeys and this terrible concoction called ""Negroni.""

I had no idea how to get home at that point - the metro was closed and only trams and buses were running. I asked some people outside the club who gave me complicated directions my non-sober self wasn't exactly capable of following. I jumped on the first tram I saw and started talking to this girl on her way home from going out. I was laughing having a good time as I asked her for directions, teased her, did my thing. I got her number and I'll take her out for drinks in the area tomorrow.

I pretty much dropped my plate. I don't really desire her anymore - she was a step down from what I was used to but I was on a dry spell and needed to hit the reset button. As it stands I have two girls I think I can fairly easily convert to plates.  I could do better but I have better things to direct my time and energy towards. They're 6's or so, good fuck-buddies both nothing more... unless they can cook, in that case they'll be over every night.

My friend in Miami real estate hit me up with some sort of a promoting-type opportunity with his friend who is expanding his real estate operations into this Italian city. We'll see what comes of it. Tonight I'll meet with a guy who works for what's probably the most popular club in town, to discuss promoting work. After my last promoting gig really blew up in my face, I didn't want to continue with this position, but I got some new, fresh ideas today as to how to promote; might as well try it and see how it goes.

As of now I have 50 Euros left and change, with no steady source of income. I hate to ask my parents for money but it's come to that for the time being. It's expected - I'm a first year student in college. However, my dream is to make them wonder ""how come he never asks for money? and why haven't we heard about rent?"" and fly back home completely on my own dime, show up at the front door and surprise them.

I was losing grasp of my discipline of working out and daily meditation for a few days after crashing at a friend's place and having a few long days of classes. I was on a lazy, high-stress streak for a few days where all I wanted to do was sleep. Today I finally manned up and went for a run, which motivated the hell out of me. I got home, did a proper workout, and listened to *Self Reliance* in the shower.

That gave me the inspiration to love fate and love where the ""gods"" have brought me. So, in that case, I will work very hard at what I am doing. I will work doubly hard, however, to ensure that I can do some business ventures on the side, in order to learn new skills, explore what I like, and learn valuable lessons.

538osc,0,2016-09-17,[California] I believe I was fired from my internship unjustly,firedthrowawayunjust,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/538osc/california_i_believe_i_was_fired_from_my/,"I am looking for assistance as to the next steps that I can take as I was fired from my internship for what I believe were unjust reasons.

I was interning at a newspaper. It was made clear to me that we were to get the story at all costs and to put our body on the line if needed and even under threat of arrest to do whatever we need. I was not working at the time, but I came upon a car accident that was obviously a hit and run.

I was in the process of taking photos and making notes for about 15 or 20 minutes when a woman driving by also stopped. She told me she was a cop but wasn't in uniform and threatened to ""smash my phone"" because I was taking pictures. She called other cops and ambulances.

The cop asked me where I worked and called my boss and I got fired. Among the reasons were disobeying a police officers order to stop and step back and not calling 9-1-1 and instead taking photos of the people inside the car and the damage instead of helping. Apparently one them died. They were both still breathing the entire time I was on the scene and I had nothing to do with causing the accident or the death. The other person is still in the hospital. The hit and run driver was arrested not far away and he was impaired.

Now the family wants to sue me, I got fired and the police want an interview about me obstructing and disobeying an officer. They already took my phone before I could back the photos up to my cloud. I know the law says I am under no obligation to render assistance to strangers and since I didn't cause the accident or the death I don't get why all this heat is on me.

I'm looking at my legal options under American and California law. What sort of a lawyer do I need? I have never had to get one before, and I'm not sure if I need a litigator, an employment lawyer or a different kind. Any assistance in helping me choose a lawyer would be appreciated. "

I may have posted on here about a month ago about how my parents stabbed me in the back over a computer I wanted to build.         
The jest of the story was that I had worked an internship during the summer and saved enough money to buy a computer + monitor worth ~$800. However, my NDad had forcefully put my checks into a short term CD from which I couldn't withdraw from (too much saving to the point where I had to work overtime just to pocket enough cash to buy business clothes).                    
Midway through the summer I correctly predicted that they wouldn't allow me to buy the computer and yet I went against my better judgement and trusted them by ending all of the counter-measures I had created to hide the purchase (i.e making my own bank account, automatically doing a direct deposit to this bank account so that they won't be shown on my checks to my parents, etc). Nearing the end of the summer I trusted them to be understanding towards me buying it as long as I said it was for productivity. Then what happened is what typically happens here on RBN: they turn me around and backstab me. Called me ""disrespectful"", fought me, etc.                                 
Well, it has been a month now and I've finally sneaked the money away to buy the PC!!! And it is AWESOME!!! I've played games at 1080p AND done excel homework. I call it ""Parental Advisory"". I have also the parts list found below.              
I just want to say that your parents are now an all-consuming force. They are fallible just like you and me. Even if they shout nonsense like ""We are doing our best"" or ""we are just doing what is best for you"" know that as you get older you have more autonomy, even if they don't want that for you. If you have done something amazing, even if they want your results to be put into a certain area, don't be afraid to say no, sneak away or do anything to put your rewards to whatever area you want.

I'm currently a high school senior that has UCLA as my top choice of college. I've decided that I want to major in Computer Science, but I've heard that getting into UCLA CS is difficult, and I'm afraid of getting rejected. I have a 4.36 weighted total GPA, and a 3.98 unweighted total GPA (not including senior year). I got a 35 on the ACT, and got seven 5's on AP Exams, and one 4. I got an 800 on SAT 2 math, but only 700's on US history and Biology. My extracurriculars are also strong, with over 1000 hours in volunteering, and two internships this past summer. My questions are:

1. Will the two 700's on the SAT 2 subject tests significantly hurt my chances at getting in, and should I retake them to try to get higher?

2. If I applied to UCLA for computer science, what are my chances at getting in?

3. Is applying for computer science and engineering easier to get in than just computer science?

4. My brother who goes to UCLA suggested to me to apply for bio as a major so I have a higher chance of getting in. He told me that if I got all A's the first year, then I would be able to transfer majors into CS. Is this a viable plan?

Thanks for any advice/suggestions, and let me know if there are any questions."

I'm fresh from receiving my MAT, where I did a field experience and full time internship at an inner-city high school and another field experience at a middle school. Loved both experiences, loved both age groups. I'm entering my 8th week at my dream job, teaching 7th grade ELA at a quality middle school, but I'm having serious confidence issues that I need some clarity and feedback on.

I've read the research. I've studied Wong, Jones, Marzano, Tovani, Gallagher, Schlechty, Payne, Wormeli, and others tirelessly. I've done my absolute best to implement these practices as effectively as possible, but I'm still struggling, particularly with classroom management, which was NEVER an issue during student teaching. I spent my high school placements working with very difficult kids with very tough backgrounds, and my calm and persistent demeanor combined with a caring attitude kept everything running smoothly, but almost none of my tricks are working on my behavior problem kids. I would say that out of my 85 students, about a dozen are serious problems, but man that small bunch is rocking my world. At the start of the year, the school counselor informed me that since my team had 2 male teachers, we were the official ""dumping ground, where all the turds go."" 

The same calmness, politeness, and persistence that worked at my previous schools draws ridicule and defiance from these particular kids, who can be very abrasive and loud, completely distracting the rest of the class from getting things done. Instead, I tried mimicking what I saw other teachers doing around the school, barking orders. Not yelling, not screaming, but certainly raising my voice and dropping the friendly attitude. I not only hate what this does to the tone of my classroom, but I hate what it does to my nerves. I also started resorting to written referrals and removal of privileges at the behest of my team leader (something I never touched as a student teacher). These actions would draw total indignant reactions, creating shouting matches in the middle of my classroom. If I try to remain calm, they angrily rant, if I try to respond, they argue louder. This would also draw in friends who would either join in to rise to their defense or create even further disruptions. They feel completely persecuted by me, as if I'm this unfair, tyrannical monster. The thing is, I bring these concerns to my team teacher, and she feels I'm not being strict enough. 

I need to say that I love my job. I think about it 24/7. I love my kids and I love what I do, but I cannot help but feel inadequate at it. When these problems occur, they completely throw me off of my rhythm, causing me to bog down into low self-esteem and make me disappointed in my performance by the time I leave. I've also had to experiment, find a classroom structure that works for both me and my students (going from 95 minute classes to 50 has been quite difficult), and get an understanding of my curriculum and how best to teach it. I admit this has created some inconsistency in structure and that's sure to frustrate the kids, but I can't know what works until I've tried it. My issue is that I'm feeling bad that the students have to receive a mediocre education for a year while this new guy is up here trying to figure his job out. I can't help but feel this is unfair to them. My team leader is a 20 year vet, very successful and well-liked at the school, but when I come to her for feedback and support, I get the impression that I'm just lowering her opinion of me. Three weeks into school she told me that she was ""officially worried about me"" after going to her to vent about areas that I was struggling with and wanted to improve on. I thought this was a key aspect to having a mentor, at least it was at my previous schools. 

Then there's the curriculum. My school requires a LOT of pre-assessment the first quarter for ELA, because they scored the poorest in these areas. It is full of (dull) writing prompts and lengthy assignments that are way outside of the context of what I'm otherwise teaching. This causes animosity from the kids who are starting to vocalize their boredom and comparing me to their other teachers on the team who teach tons of fun stuff, but I can't help that their upcoming benchmark will cover mostly grammar, which is difficult to make exciting every day. 

I guess what I'm struggling with is the fact that I'm not amazing out of the gate, my students have to receive a substandard education while I figure things out, and I'm working alongside veterans and feel expected to deliver the same quality of instruction as them. I'm not typically a person without confidence, but this has been a real struggle. I will say that my inclusion teacher, who works with me during my first (and best) class, thinks I'm doing fantastic for a first year, but none of the students I have difficulty with are in that class. 

Thank you for those willing to listen to me vent. Any feedback, encouragement, and smacks upside the head are more than welcome. "

This morning I spoke with a Math professor about what the school can do for students trying to become actuaries. He told me that an insurance company with a local headquarters near the college asks him for candidates for internships every year, and he sends them a list of the best students. He also said that company has a very good relationship with the university and usually hires students right when they graduate. 


This sounded amazing to me that the professor already has connections and would be willing to help set up internships. I thought about it a little more and had a question about possible issues that you all might be able to help me with.


If I go to this university, will other insurance firms see me as marked for the one company the college has an agreement with? I don't want to be locked in and unhirable if I decide later to move to another region.

I'm also worried that the university might teach specifically for that one insurance company, to make candidates for them only, so I might learn things wrong for another firm.

Also it's a small, not widely known school so Im slightly concerned that other companies might not recognize it.


But to be honest I have no idea if these are legitimate concerns, so if I'm wrong please straighten me out. Thank you for your time."

A big industry in downtown Los Angeles that dealt with many movie, tv and rock stars. Basically, offering rich and famous people services to handle their careers while also giving fresh faced wannabes the opportunities.

Katy was one of them, a young girl that wasn't even 21 yet dreams of making it in music, becoming a world known star. She had tried numerous times and had many meetings with companies to try and get her talent across to no avail. Eventually the money she saved up from her part time job while she was in school dried up and she had to pick up a job in L.A she she thought why not a business in a similar field to her dreams.

Katy remembered when she walked into the office for the first time, people couldn't believe what she looked like and you think they would be accustomed to seeing gorgeous people all the time. She had worn a pair of red 6 inch stilettos and a tiny pencil skirt that would of been the shortest a woman could wear. Thigh high stockings that hugged tight to her legs that were held up by clasps attached to a garter belt. The tight blouse she wore strained her rather biggest assets, her double DD breasts that were pushed up in her black bra. They bounced around as she worked around the office, attracting the attention of many guys. The man Katy worked for was always delighted to see her, his eyes filling up with lust as he looked her body over before leading her into his office and shutting the door.

Katy regularly wore clothes that brung her attention, it was always another pair of 6 inch heels, short skirts and stockings accompanied by a tight low cut blouse. Guys around the office started to talk about Katy, about how they would love to ram her as she bent over their desk. Many guys often tried to get with her but she always refused.

Soon Katy developed a reputation for being a strong feminist supporter. She thought that all men were pigs for treating women as nothing more than a pair of tits and ass with a pretty face. That's how Katy felt in meetings, guys would get sidetracked around her and just stare at her boobs or ass. They wouldn't take her seriously and thought that she was just a slut. She thought that guys only chatted to her because they wanted to fuck her and weren't even calling her by name around the office, she overheard them calling her by her big tits.

Though what Katy did, didn't always match up with what she said. She would scold men for staring at her body when she wore revealing clothing everyday. She would also find every excuse to bend over to give everyone a good look at her, regularly dropping things on the ground. She would get angry at guys all the time for flirting with her as they obviously wanted to fuck her but she would flirt with guys all the time brushing her hand near their groin and giving them a sexy, sultry look as she walked away.

One day the CEO came to the office and went to a meeting room with about 30 other businessmen. They were all aged between 50-80 years old. After about an hour, Katy was called into the meeting room. Jason, a fellow coworker had a desk right in front of the room, he watched her strut in their, clad in her tight clothes. She closed the door behind her. It must of been 4 hours until the doors opened again, with the old guys walking out with satisfied looks on their faces. They talked about how great that was and how they must do it again soon. Out Katy stepped as they finally all left. Her hair was disheveled while she was fixing her rumpled blouse and rolling down her skirt while carrying her stilettos. As she walked she pulled out a curly hair from her mouth and wiped away a bit of stickiness from her lips. Going to her desk and continuing work like nothing happened.

---------------------

I want this role play to involve scenarios following the womens career such as trying to break into the industry (a lot of time spent as the secretary), dealing with the sudden fame, hook ups with celebrities, sex tapes, paparazzi, fans, relationships, becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol and turning into a nymphomaniac.

The prompt above doesn't have to be the start or involved in it... just an example of some writing.

Can be different and have a male celebrity and their journey.

I want to play the males the celeb will encounter. I want someone to play the main lead which will be the young female starlet. I would love for the young starlet to be Katy Perry or Kylie Jenner but I like a lot of other celebs as well such as Taylor Swift, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande, Megan Fox, Margot Robbie, Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Alba. Though.. the female celebrity can be an original character that is made up would love her to look like Madison Ivy or Lana Rhoades though also into Lindsey Pelas, Emily Sears and Claudia Alende.

I prefer to roleplay on Google Docs and use messengers to chat and set things up such as K , skype, yahoo msger and google chat/hangouts. Want this to be a long term rp

If you are interested and wish to talk about this further send me a message. Please make your message to me detailed and include any character/ scenario ideas, which celebrities you like and what platforms you use.

P.S Also have a recent posting in which I mention all the rp's and things I'm interested in for a long term rp, so check that out if you want, particularly interested in doing a Marvel Black Widow RP

I'm currently studying for my Masters in Information Systems. My undergrad was in Health Administration. I have no IT experience, but a willingness to learn and the belief that I should have the aptitude to learn this field. I'm taking some prep courses as part of my degree to make up for what I missed in the bachelor (it's required to take these classes). I'm taking a class in C#, and will be taking classes dealing with database design, systems analysis, etc.

Anyways, I'm a realist (and also a worry-wort!) and know that I can't exactly trust the department head when he says I'll be making $80k after graduation. However, he says that internships are usually the way to go when it comes to getting jobs. I will probably get one next summer after finishing my prep courses.

Okay, to the point. What can I feasibly accomplish (as in, certs and  other opportunities) having no IT experience in these next two years while I finish my degree? In what order? Will my degree hold some weight on it's own? 

As for what I want, at some point I would like to get into security, but I'm at the point in my life (age 23) where I have to start getting my career together. My naive mind thinks that a possible path would be starting as maybe a network/sys admin then database admin, and so on. But really, I just want that first big boy job I can make a solid living off of. I'd like to be making at least 45-50k before I turn 30!:(

53a5bw,5,2016-09-17,I [22m] don't know how to break up with my 2+ year long-distance relationship love of my life [20f] and desperately need help.,basedgunners,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/53a5bw/i_22m_dont_know_how_to_break_up_with_my_2_year/,"Me and my gf (April) have been in a relationship for almost 2 years. We had both dated around, but this is both our first major relationship.

Our relationship has been pretty great, but the only problem is that I go to school on the east coast and she goes to school in my hometown 12 hours away. I'm currently in my last year, and she has 6-8 more years of med school and residency. The only time I get to see her are during all the major breaks, and we've been long distance for maybe 2/3 of our relationship. We've broken up a couple of times (mainly over miscommunication), but we always end up making things work. It seems like we've been through so much together, and she's helped me to grow into a better person. I love her very much, and when we're physically together, we're inseparable. I love almost everything about her, and I've thought in the past that she's the one that I want to get married to and spend my life with.

However, lately I've been thinking about all the things that I wanted to do in college, and feel that I've really missed out. I turned down certain job opportunities and opted for internships with smaller companies back home just so that I could spend the summer with her. I really wanted to study abroad and completely forgot about it last year because I was so madly in love with her. I still am, but lately I've started to remember all of these things that I wanted and planned to do before I met her. I also want to be able to go out with my friends whenever I want and it kind of sucks missing out on things because I have to worry about being reckless or having a skype date or something scheduled. I also never really got to experience the single life for the majority of college. 

As for her, I feel like she's made incredible sacrifices just to see me. She barely goes home to see her family, and during most of the major breaks, she'll cut her time short with them so that we can spend time with each other because those opportunities are so scarce. I am so grateful for all of that, but I feel incredibly guilty that she's sacrificing all of that for me. I know this sounds selfish, but if we didn't get to see each other during those breaks, I would not  want to continue a long-distance relationship, because it would be too hard. Lately, there have been talks about how she's planning on going to grad school in another state, and that she might not be around this summer, because she wants to go home and work for her parents. I don't blame her for wanting to spend time with her family, but for my selfish reasons, I just don't think that I could handle not physically being with her.

I feel like I want to be free in my final year and not have any responsibilities when deciding my next step in my life (whether its career-wise or grad school). I can't make long distance work for another few years if we don't end up in the same place (which seems likely). I also believe that even if we do end up in the same place, she'll be stressed out from grad school all the time and she's not exactly someone who handles that very well, which would be a difficult living environment. Either way, it seems like the future is incredibly cloudy, and I'm not sure that I see one with her because of all of the uncertainty. I'm not sure it's fair to either one of us to push through this relationship in our final years of college if we're just going to end up breaking up anyways.

The big problem for me is that I've never broken up with someone before, and I'm not sure what it's supposed to feel like. Every time I think about breaking up with her, I feel like throwing up and my heart feels like shattering into a million pieces. Logically, I feel like breaking things off seems like the right thing to do for both of us, but for some reason the thought of it makes me weak. It destroys me thinking about what it would do to her, especially after all the incredible moments that we've shared. I just don't know if I'm being impulsive, or if I need this, or what. I'm lost right now because I really do love her and I care for her so much. Has anybody been in this situation before, or something similar? I've been thinking about this for the past month and I feel like it's eating me up inside.

  ---   

tl;dr: Been in a long-distance relationship for the majority of college with the girl of my dreams, but I feel like we're holding each other back. I'm not sure if I'm being impulsive or if this is actually what I want and should do. Logically, I think this is the right choice, but it's so hard to bring myself to that point."

I broke my 6 year previously long distance relationship this week, I'm feeling very confused and I'm not sure if I was unfair to him. 


**Background**

We met when we were both 18, on the internet. He was a very troubled guy, he had issues with depression and had already tried suicide. He was obese, had problems with his family, had no money, no job, and had stopped going to school that year. He was a really, really bad boyfriend at the time, very emotionally demanding, very fragile in general (if something bad hapenned, his first thought was suicide). That was a VERY unhealthy relationship for a 18 year old to get into, but I went though with it despite my mother being absolutely against it, with reasons. 

For the first 4 years things didn't improve much for him, the exceptions being: he lost a lot of weight and finished high school. But that was it. For me, things improved a lot - by that time I had saved a good amount of money, was at university and was off to spend a year studying abroad. 


**Beginning of the problems**

When I returned home last year, I asked him if he didn't want to move to my city. He was scared but I was insistent, because he always said he had no future there at his city, and he didn't like to live with his family. He said he couldn't because he had no money, so I figured I'd help him by covering all his expenses until he got a job. So he got a job and spent literally 2 days at it because they'd lied to him about what he'd had to do, plus the place had sanitary problems (rat urine and feces all around. it was a local supermarket, ew). So I said ""okay, let's find something else"". The next month he found another job, and spent another 2 days at it because he had an anxiety attack over having to talk on those walkie talkie radios. So now I was very disappointed already but said ""okay let's find some therapy for you"". But before he started therapy he was at my house and I was talking to my mom about a friend that got married and didn't have a job and her husband neither, and they lived off my friend's parents. Then my mom said something about it being wrong to live off somebody else's money and my boyfriend took it personally and thought it was directed at him. He got mad, left my house and later we got into an argument because we were talking about someone else and not him, though probably my mom's comment had a bad timing. So I broke up with him and he went back to his city. Later I regretted breaking up with him and asked if we could be together long distance again. He started going to therapy there and became a whole new person, his anxiety and depression were under control and it was like a dream come true for me.


**Current problem**

Fast forward to 6 months ago. This time he took the initiative to move again to my city, but he still had the money problem. I said I could help him until he got a job. We were not living together, he rented a room and I was still living with my family (where we live, it's not weird at all to live with your parents even when you're ""old"" like me). We planned on moving in together after we both had stable jobs. So he moved and started looking for jobs. I saw it, he really tried to get a job, he was called for a couple interviews but he couldn't get a job. Eventually he didn't know where to look for a job any more so he kind of just left it at that. To be fair, he would ask all the time if he was being a burden for me and I'd say no, because I wanted him to feel secure. It would bother me that I had to pay for everything alone, but I had the money so I figured why not continue helping him. 2 months ago he managed to get a scholarship at a private university (government scholarship, not good grades scholarship). That was a huge victory because he'd be the first one on his family to go to college, and that would mean he'd finally have some qualification. Then he said he couldn't get a normal job anymore because now he had classes to attend at night and most normal jobs work hours were in the afternoon until night. I said ""well okay, so look for internships"", so he applied to a few, but no answers. And it was left at that. 

Then we had an argument last week about something random. After he moved to my city we were having arguments over everything really. I figured we were raised very differently and many things I find important are unimportant to him, and vice-versa. Plus, I didn't feel like he could complain about me because I had to put up with a lot of things I didn't like in him while having to pay for everything he needed (probably I was wrong in thinking that, because in relationships we always have to put up with some things we don't like about the other person). Anyway, when we argued last week, he said he was done and wanted to go back to his city. So I said ""you know what, I'm done too"", and said he could go back to his city. After that I thought about many things that were not making me happy in this relationship. I remembered all the stuff my mom pointed out during all these years and I chose to ignore so I could stay with him. I'm going to list a few things that were bothering me:

* He kept asking me for my stuff. I know we were in a relationship and all but it made me really uncomfortable that he wanted me to give him my stuff all the time. Sometimes I would give it to him and he would sell it and keep the money to himself. We had an argument about this once and he said I was being petty and everything we had separately should be ""our things"". He has tried to sell me some os his stuff, though. 

* He had no manners at my (my mom's) house. He would come in and talk loudly, sit on the sofa as if it were his house (becase ""he was family, so why couldn'd he sit like he wanted""), munch loudly on the food, grab my butt in front of my house which made me really uncomfortable. I called him out on the manners many times because I know my mom notices these behaviors and would think poorly about him, but he wouldn't listen because he thinks manners are stupid social rules, basically.

* He had a dish he really liked to eat on Sundays, so he would come here before lunch time and prepare it. He didn't want to get up early on Sundays though, so I had to leave things halfway done for him to arrive and just finish it. He claimed there was nothing wrong with that because it was just a favor he as asking, but I think that if he's the only one that really wants to eat it, he should come here and prepare it himself and not involve anyone else.
  
* He'd be unpolite at times and make some rude comments in front of my family (I believe it wasn't on purpose but it was bad regardless)

* This one isn't really his fault but was a problem regardless: we have very mismatched sex drives. He feels like it all the time and I never feel like it, especially because I was always kind of upset at him so it killed all the mood. He couldn't keep his hands off me even in inappropriate places, which pissed me off because I was always worried about other stuff (such as if he would ever get a job) and he was thinking about sex. We had discussions over this dozens of times, and I realize I was the problem here, but I just can't feel like it at all with so many worries on my mind.


**How I feel right now**

Despite all that, he was very sweet and loving, I feel he really loves me and I do love him back, but I don't feel like putting up with this anymore. I think maybe we could talk everything through and come to an agreement, but I just don't feel like sticking around anymore. He made tons of improvements over the last year and was finally getting somewhere in life after he started attending university. When I said I wanted to break up he blamed it on my mother, because  she thinks he's not good for me despite all the efforts he's made to become a better person. He also said that he feels lied to, because I said I would help him until he got a job and suddenly (to him) I said it was a problem that I have to cover all his expenses. I kind of feel that he thinks I should have no problem in paying for everything for who knows how long, just because I have the money. 

I'm confused, I don't know what to think. Sometimes I feel relieved, sometimes I feel worried that he'll get depressive and suicidal again, sometimes I regret I gave up and miss him so much, sometimes I regret I ever started it. I don't know anything anymore. I'd appreciate to hear some thoughts.  

Thanks for your time.

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: Broke up my 6 year relationship because I had to put up with a lot of things that made me uncomfortable, but I'm not sure I did the right thing because I sticked around during all his depressive bad times and decided to break it now that things seemed to be getting better. I'm confused and don't know if I did the right thing."

It was also very much a two-way conversation"". And the next step of the interview is to go to SF. This sounds great but the blog was from 2012 i wonder if is still true."

Instead of going through the curriculum, basically use it as a guide as to what to learn?",pozarni,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/53ay9y/is_it_possible_to_learn_web_development_faster/,"Link to [FreeCodeCamp Here](https://www.freecodecamp.com/)  

It's a great service and cirriculum, but I am finding that I learn a lot more sometimes when I branch off on my own after getting a basis of some things.  

For instance, I've learned a bit of bootstrap and how to handle github after hitting our first project which is to make a tribute page.  The alternative involved using codepen instead.  

Is it feasible to simply use code camp as a guide instead of actually going through it?  Would I be severely missing out on a lot of good material if I don't just go through FCC vs. being self taught with other resources?  

It's more of a matter of time for me - I'm trying to learn enough to be able to start applying for internships at this point and the curriculum, while good, takes a while since I'll cover it and a lot of side material.  Am I better off learning on my own?"

We started young, but we had one of the most dedicated, fun, and amazing relationships I've ever seen.
After a couple years I began to realize this is the type of girl I could spend my life with.  We talked about getting married and sharing a life together, and we kept those dreams alive for many years... 
This summer she picked out a ring (which I happily bought) and I was just waiting to finish college before proposing.  We had everything planned, and we were so so happy.  She told me every day I was her everything and she couldn't wait for our life together.

Then suddenly things changed.  She did an internship this summer where she met a few new friends and found a job she wants to do the rest of her life.  Suddenly her feelings about me seemed to fade.  She told me that we weren't right for each other and that we had too many differences.  I learned that she had a couple incidents in the week leading up to the breakup where she cheated on my with one of her close friends.  She is now pursuing a long-distance relationship with him.

My whole world has been completely shattered.  I loved her with all my heart.  She was my best friend and closest confidant.  She was the love of my life and I looked forward to our future every day.  Now she's gone.  I am utterly broken.  She made so many promises and we had such a good time and a good future.  Now I'm struggling so hard for motivation and for meaning.

Every night when I finally fall asleep I dream about her.  I dream about us reconciling, about waking up from the nightmare I'm living.  I've done all the cliche things on the checklist... I started working out, I keep my head up during the week and I don't let anyone know I'm bothered.  I don't talk to her or look at her social media.  But I don't feel any better.  I'm trying to put my life together and move on, but all I want is for things to be like they were.  I thought after a month I would start seeing some light at the end of the tunnel.

Every morning I wake up and wish that I hadn't.  Every night I don't care if I never wake up.  I have no passion for anything that interested me before.  I feel like I ruined the relationship with the one person who I loved more than anything.

How do I move on from someone who has moved on from me?"

Quick intro: I'm a 29 years old male, studying Computer Science. I started my college year on a High Profile Public College at my country, but, had some issues about it, so, i studied there for 8 years and now i'm finishing my degree on a private college. The issues mainly consisted on me being quite unmotivated and very very very(did i say very?) unhappy about my ""gifts"" for programming and IT stuff overall. I feel like i'm just a mediocre programmer, and that my skills will not be enough to provide a living for me =/

During the last 3 years, i took some violin students. I play the violin since i was 8 years old, but when i expressed the will to do it as college carrer, my mom backlashed it thoroughly. I was 15 years old when it happened, and it was quite convincing at the time. Mostly because i didn't see myself as Violin Teacher (Money stuff and, because i won't work on Sabbath, i would hardly be able to play at an Orchestra)

My mom profile: Nurse, PhD in Public Health Care
My brother profile: Mechanical Engineer, Speaks 4 languages and work on a Consulting company as low level consultant.


That being said, i mostly want to warn that i hold no grudge for my mom breaking my will to go for Violin Major and stuff. Past stuff is on the past and so.

**--The real issue--**

I've decided that, after i finish Computer Science, i'll work on it until i can pass the Music College exams. I'm working towards it and I've already 5 students under my wing, and looking for expanding this number. But my brother and mom are really annoying about it. They just see problems with that, keep insisting that i should get an internship ASAP (Which i'm doing, it's not like it will fall on my lap. I'm currently participating on 12 different selection programs. I **believe** I'm bound to pass at least one. So that's no an issue i can control every detail)

My mom just ask me when i'll get a real Job. All my brother talks to me is if ""Have you signed up on this Internship already?"" They start to stick their's noses on my classes ""You are taking to much time with this student's class"" (When it took 20 minutes more to finish a class) ""This student is trying to teach you how to teach"" (Because my student that have hand issues on left hand). They both gave a hard time because i took a violin to the Luthier for a student ""This is not you Job. You put too much effort on this thing."" and other stuff

It gets on my nerves because i never say a thing about their jobs/careers. My brother worked so hard that he developed stomach issues because of the stress. My mom is already retired, and works at my uncle's clinic and developed some depression stuff over the years of work. They don't know squat about violin teaching and playing. They just seem to think ""Violin teaching is not a Job."" This whole situation is ruining my mood lately. I know i'm at fault for not being graduated, to not liking Computer Science and stuff. But it does not give me 1% of the Happiness of Teaching Violin. They always seems unhappy about their line of work, and they want me to follow the same path. My brother always complains about his job and the whole ""office companies eco-system"". I know money is something we need to survive, but, why can't they let me go for what it want? And what i believe i'm actually good?(Or at least not mediocre).

I'm flustered about it, and it destroyed my weekend. I just hope this situation gets better on the happening of getting an internship. But i feel like i'm just giving up on my goals to please them. Plz, give me some light and help on this matter.
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I'm 29, giving violin classes, although i'm in college for Computer Science for 9 years and want to go to Music Major afterwards. Mom and Younger Brother getting on my nerves and meddling on my classes. I feel they don't see being violin Teacher as a valid line of work/Career Path. What should i do to A)Let them not ruin my mood; B)Make them accept my choices"

The thing is, I really enjoying programming. It feels great to finish a project after working on it for a while. However, I'm super stressed about the technical aspects of CS because I'm having a tough time grasping all of the material.

I can dedicate at least 3 hours a day to FCC and I'm confident I can move that number up to more.  My goal is to push through the front and back end certifications (data visualization is something I feel that I can pick up later)."

I have a request for you, one of my foreign ex girlfriend sent me a very dirty story one day, that she wrotte specialy for me.. I like to read it sometimes, and few days ago i thank about Gonewild Audio.. I would love to hear some of you girls reading it while you touch yourself.. it could turn me on soooo much !
by the way i'm French and she is spanich ;)
So here is that dirty story, feel free to change or add different things ! I'm hurry to listen you..

""It was a hot day on summer, the beginning of July, warm and sunny day. I was in the office, in my glamorous study with the air conditioning very loud. I love my job, I feel goosebumps when I am in a reunion with lot of those men that thinks they own the world, but at home when they come back knows who take the control, and here is the same. Maybe they feel some reaction in their underwear when they see me come to the center of the table with my tight skirt and my blazer, with my deep eyes and my cold and distant character but sarcastic at the same time. Sometimes I like to think that they think in me one time at day, but just to make me feel desirable, because they know they are out of my league, and is not because I’m with someone, is because I’m very selective with men. Normally the man is not enough for me, maybe is not too good in the bed, maybe he bores me, maybe he is not big enough… Today I have to do a selection of people for internship, the department of Human Resources do the dirty job but is me who take the finally decisions. This time there is people from other countries, I like to see the pic profile, who knows… I make the decision in five minutes, is very easy for me, I look first the age, younger I could squeeze them as I can, then the profile pic, I take this very serious I don’t accept ugly people in my office sorry, and finally the hobbies of the person, this can say you lot of thing about the person, and of course I’m sure that the Human Resource Department only accept people prepare. I pause two seconds over the odds to see a photo, is a French man of Normandy, what the hell is that city, but he looks nice, I can see something very interesting inside his eyes. Maybe he will be my new guinea rabbit, we will see. I use to wear sexy lingerie, even in the office, is because one day I caught out of this, I was reviewing some reports and the boss of the other department of the central in New York comes to visit me, but unfortunately my secretary forgot this fact, of course I dismiss her at the second, and I didn’t wear the right lingerie but anyway it was and amazing fucked. This time I had the adequate underwear, black and sophisticate. I had black tights with light, a black culottes and bra with lace and silk in some parts. And I had a very tight skirt grey with a companion blazer, sexy and serious at the same time. And of course, I have more pants in my bag, is very important to have spares for a women like me, I used to have sex at the office, is very important for my job because is very stressing. This morning the candidates will come to my study and I have to do the corresponding interview. The first one is a girl, I just select girl less smart than me, the competition is the competition, and of course less beautiful. She looks me with a Bambi eyes, she just end her degree two months ago, and when I asked her the first question I can see that the left eyelid trembles. Too weak for this company, you will need nerves of steel. The second one is a guy, I think, he looks very feminine, at the beginning he seems very hustler but I can see under the table white socks with a black shoes, sorry but I can’t stand this sacrilege to fashion. Get out! Finally the last candidate, is the French guy I remember his face. He seems very confident, smiling and he transmits good vibrations, nice beginning. I can see inside his deep eyes, I find something disturbing, he doesn’t look me like the other men, he looks me with a mixture of concern and curiosity. Usually I caused a barrier between the men and I, I think is due to the power that I emanated. As I do questions to him, he doesn’t stop to looking at me straight at the eyes. I like this, I like the way he looks me, is very sexy, I notice something in my pants… Maybe is the hot day or maybe is me, but I start to sweat, and after a shiver runs my back. I think I’m getting horny, come on Sara, he is just an internship partner. He realize of my discomfort and he suggests to open the window a little… Is not necessary we have air conditioner I answer him, but he says me that sometimes natural air is better than artificial, suddenly I don’t know why I’m thinking in my vibrator, and I’m agree with him, is better natural things… I realize that I have a month without fucking, I can understand now this reaction, is not only him presence what excited me, is me… In the middle on the conversation I have an idea, maybe is too much bold but never mind, is summer and I’m exhausted… I ask to Simon what position he prefers in the bed, and I can see that him is not red or surprised, he has a half smile in his face! INCREDIBLE! I just found a good candidate, I say to him that the job is for you! And also that I was kidding before, it was just an strategy to see him reaction to the puzzling.. .I’m a professional at all! But I need to take some fresh air and I need some distraction to this busy day, and before he close the door I ask him, stop Simon, lock the door please! He doesn’t ask why just do what I say… He is in front of me, waiting for something and I ask to him, Simon can you clean the hard drive? He is confused, so I ask again with and this time I’m more effusive with my look and eyebrows… Can you clean the hard drive? He is smiling and very quick he says, of course, I’m very good with this!! Ok, we will see I think…. He comes slowly to my table, him eyes are very shine, I’m impatient to have him mouth in my cunt, I start to be very wet… I sit in the chair with my legs very open, he is on the floor and starts to take off my pants with his eyes on my eyes, very concentrate, and when he looks my thing he realize of my lingerie, he is very happy I can see in him look… I feel him wet tongue on me, oh my god, I’m getting more and more horny now, he take my legs with him arms and start to eat me very deep… I start to make some noise, Oh I can see you are really good, I told you he says… Suddenly someone knock on the door, oh no! I say one moment but the door is lock, so I call to my secretary to open it, Simon is under the table… is the boss of the department of Human Resources to ask me if I did the choice of the candidate, and I answer yes, the candidate is suitable, he has good skills!!!! And after he left my study, thanks god! And my secretary ask me if I need something, Oh no I’m perfect now!! I look to Simon and he is laughing a lot… but I’m saying continue with my eyes… He takes me again to eat me, I am so wet that I say Simon come here, and I give a passional kiss to him, I like him sweet lips, so good, is a good and slow kiss! And after I surrender something in him ear, just what I want…. And what I want is that him take a rule that I have in my box and spank my ass very hard! Come here Simon, just take off my skirt and my blazer (because under my blazer I just have my bra) and give me a strong spanks in my ass… Ok like you want!! Ahh ahh ahh!! I like this! Continue… al little more!!! More strong Simon, more strong!!! He is so excited I can see in him eyes, there is a fire!! So I take off him pants to see him dick! Is very hard, I take it with my hand, and I start to touch him, very slow with my eyes in him eyes… hi is more and more hard! And I put my tongue on the top of him dick, umm nice taste! I want to fuck your mouth he says!! I’m your boss are you crazy? I am speaking very loud! But after I take him dick with my mouth, inside my mouth! Umm I like this… I start to suck slowly, touching him balls at the same time!! He is swearing of pleasure… faster Sara… shut up or I will spank you fucking French! Ok, and he takes my hair to suck him faster, I like to feel his hand in my head!! Is so nice!!! I will not stop until to cum in me, I’m saying very loud… and I have an idea, I lie on the table so him can fuck me very hard…. I throw everything in the table, but I don’t mind I need to feel him strong dick inside me!!! Simon is fucking my pussy very hard, and kissing my boobs at the same time, he is hard and sweet at the same time…. I like him parfum, is so virile!! I like to have him very deep in me, so I turn and I put my ass in front of him… he is touching my ass with him hands, and he wants to fuck my ass, I can see in him looks… I take him fingers to put in my pussy and I say I want that you fuck my ass… Ok I will fuck you beautiful ass boss…. He is very good with him dick, umm he will make me cum soon! Ummm so good now! Come here and take my boobs I want to do a blowjob so you cum ok?? Of course, he is screaming of pleasure… and he cums on me….on my mouth! Os fucking nice taste!!! I put my clothes and him take him things very quickly… Ok so see you tomorrow at eight … But I don’t answer, I’m just in front of my window thinking in other thing … And after few seconds I hear the door close.""

I've been doing these for a while now and I'd love some feedback. What do you enjoy the most about these articles? Do you think it's worth me putting the extra effort in and having a short write up or is simply detailing the genre enough? Is there anything you think I should add?

Also, I've included a few releases on here by users of this sub and intend to continue. If you release a mixtape or album (doesn't have to be hip-hop, I'm open to all music) that you would like me to cover then PM a link to stream or preferably download, and if I like it I'll include it."
53d492,1,2016-09-18,Does anyone have experience reneging a job offer in the oil industry?,prk2215,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/53d492/does_anyone_have_experience_reneging_a_job_offer/,"I am a graduating senior in engineering, with an advanced coding background. I have done three internships with large, international company A, and I have great contacts there. I also know the VP of company B (he left company A for a higher postion, salary, etc.), where company B is a smaller, more start-up oil company with a lot of growth potential. Company A was aware company B was trying to recruit me, so they unexpectedly sent me a full time job offer a month before anyone in their intern pool in an attempt to prevent company B from having time to send me an offer. I immediately informed company B of the timeline, and they were not able to give me raw numbers until a week after I signed with company A (they were 100% aware I had signed with A but were hoping that I would renege the job offer). Company B's offer was roughly $25k more a year, with better benefits, in a role I was far more interested in. 
Through my internships and scholarships, Company A has roughly dropped $80k on me throughout college, but has made me extremely angry in the past because they paid me $3k/month less than all of the interns because I do not have a petroleum engineering background. Additionally, my full time offer at company A is less than those with petroleum engineering degrees simply because of my degree, not because of my contributions (I build oil software that has saved the company several million). In spite of this, I feel a lot of loyalty to my team at Company A, who are not in charge ultimately of hiring/salary, etc., and they give me a lot of very advanced projects to work on. They will hate me for reneging, especially since company B has already poached several members of their team.
I'm internally torn. Does anyone have experience with this in the oil industry? I partially blame myself for not handling the situation better."
53dq6z,4,2016-09-18,"My mentor/""big brother"" has turned on me and I'm upset and confused",mylittleweirdo,MomForAMinute,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomForAMinute/comments/53dq6z/my_mentorbig_brother_has_turned_on_me_and_im/,"Hey Mom, I wish I could talk to you about this irl, but I've always had to be the strong one in our relationship. You always turn things around with things like ""You being sad is making me sad!"" and somehow I end up comforting you and my problems get cast aside. I can't handle that right now, I need you to be the strong one and help me.

I started working at a company as an intern in my last year of film school, and I hit it off right away with one of the partners (the company is co-owned by three guys). When I graduated from college he hired me as his personal assistant (to run errands for him and his other businesses), with the promise that I would get work as a sound editor as well. We shared an office and we became good friends. He stayed true to his word, and slowly transitioned me to working fully as a sound editor, helping me every step of the way until I had the skills and confidence to handle it on my own, at which point I was moved out of his office into the group room with the other editors (and I no longer had to do assistant stuff, either).
But even more than just work stuff, he was there for me for anything. My pet rabbit got sick, so he drove me to the vet. I had nowhere to go for New Years, so he invited me to spend it at his house with his family and their friends. I had a panic attack at a work party, in front of everyone, and he immediately pulled me into a big hug and held me and told me jokes until I'd calmed down, no judgement or fuss. And there's so much more. He's always been there for me, like the big brother I always wished for. I am acutely aware that he's not perfect (you don't share a small office with someone without discovering at least some of their secrets), but he always treated me with respect and kindness.
I've been at the company for over 4 years now. They recently helped me get into a union and transition to working as a freelancer (but I still get to stay at the company, even if I'm not technically staff any longer). Everything was working well, but then one client was being particularly difficult about the sound design for their movie. I was doing everything I could, but I'm only one person and I was working incredibly long hours and still couldn't keep up with their insane demands. My boss arranged to have a conference call between our sound team and the client (who is in another city), with him sitting in to moderate. But when we got in there he took over the conversation, and completely threw me under the bus, blamed everything on me and wouldn't let me get a word in edgewise to explain myself. He completely humiliated me in front of not only a client, but my coworkers as well. I was blindsided and so hurt, and when I tried to talk to him afterwards he was flippant and condescending and wouldn't have a conversation. So I sent him an email saying very clearly and tactfully that I was upset by what he had done. He never replied, and has stopped talking to me altogether (with one exception, a slightly nasty email a few days later telling me I was being pulled off the project because he and the producers felt I was ""being too difficult""). 

I just don't get it Mom. How did it get to this point? I can't rationalize this person who's treating me like garbage, with the man who took me to see Wrath of Khan with him and his two best friends, and had me over for dinner with his family on several occasions (his daughter even invited me to her birthday party once), and always knew exactly how to cheer me up when I was depressed. I'm tough, and I know I can get by without my ""big brother"", but I miss him horribly. I don't know what to do. I feel like if I'd just left it alone and not sent the email sticking up for myself, maybe things would have blown over. But because I called him out on what he did my relationship with him is not only ruined, but irreparable. Where did I go wrong? What do I do?"
53duuv,9,2016-09-18,Breaking up with him over the phone or text is the best option but i feel like shit about it.,NYU4U,OkCupid,https://www.reddit.com/r/OkCupid/comments/53duuv/breaking_up_with_him_over_the_phone_or_text_is/,"Just a bit of backstory: I've been dating the same guy for just under three months now. We lived about a 5 minute drive away from each other when we first met and saw each other multiple times a week. We'd go out and do fun things like amusement parks, grab coffee, hang out, etc. Then we fell in to a routine of just going over to his place, watching netflix, and having sex. Then, one time when we actually went out and were on a date together, he had a seizure for the first time. Because of that, his license was taken away for 6 months as a precaution and he could no longer drive. Which is fine, because I drive. But then it just perpetuated me just driving over to see him, doing nothing and just sitting at home. I didn't really mind, but it started to get a bit boring. 

Then, I moved downtown for school, which is about an hour and a half commute for him to visit me using public transit because he doesn't drive. I wasn't able to come up town to visit as much as I would like because I was starting an internship, as well as being in school full time and working, but he would offer to come see me, since his schedule was more free. He would often ask if he could sleep over because the commute took a while, and I felt bad about not visiting, so I would say yes even if it's not what I wanted. I live somewhere really exciting and still all he would want to do was sit in my apartment. I started kind of making excuses for why he couldn't come because I was tired of doing nothing but having sex. My sex drive was going down because it was just so routine and expected. 

Last week, he came to visit me between classes, and I was planning on walking with him to a park near my apartment that I really liked. As we were walking to the park, which I was clearly excited about, he told me he didn't want to over-work himself for fear of having another seizure, and asked if we could go back to my apartment. They were doing some electrical work in my apartment, so we couldn't, and he seemed kind of disappointed. I ended up just sitting with him on campus and we talked for a few hours. When he left, I just felt disappointed because it seemed like all he wanted to do was come over to my apartment and have sex. 

Yesterday, I just broke. He asked if he could come sleep over at my apartment tomorrow and I just basically told him I was tired of feeling like he didn't want to do anything but come over and have sex, that I'm bored, etc. He basically guilt tripped me by saying he's ""happy to see me regardless of what we do"" and that he can make more of an effort. I was kind of confused because I feel like it was less about how I feel and more about how I was being needy when he's cool doing nothing with me.

Today, I texted him asking how work was going, and he told me he went home because the stress of our conversation last night made him nauseous. Once again, I felt like he was trying to guilt-trip me for just explaining how I feel. He was trying to say all the right things, how he doesn't want me to feel like it's all about sex because he doesn't feel that way (even though that's how he's been acting), and he really wants to work through it. 

Honestly, at this point, I'm just turned off and no longer attracted to him because I don't feel listened to. I feel like trying to fix it isn't something I want to soon in to a relationship when I'm busy with life and can't see him more than once a week because of school anyway.

The only thing is, while I'd prefer to break up with him in person, I feel like a grade A douche having him come all the way downtown, an hour and a half commute, only to have me break up with him and have him turn around. I can't figure out which is worse, breaking up with him over the phone instead of face to face, or largely wasting his time. "

My major was before Math, and after I failed few classes on required theoretical math courses , I decided to switch to Computer Science. This cause that my CGPA is 2.98, however with A's on programming classes. 



I'm planning to apply for few internships closer to December, for the Summer. But with my CPGA, I want to know honest opinion.


 On other hand, before joining University, I was in Finance field, mostly derivatives trading, commodities trading and arbitrage with about 4.5 years of full work experience. I decided to start working right after high-school, due to big financial problems in my family. And only 2 years ago finally managed to get into good university (University of Toronto).




So, what are the chances, that my work experience, even not in software development field will balanced my poor grades for internships?



Thanks a lot in advance!"

Hi, I'm H_bomba, Creator of CLASS4. 

  

Class4 is an ongoing project i'm working on, destined to be a sci fi/horror motion comic.
Class4 is set in the Somewhat distant future, of 2039. 

---

You see, This is set in the real world. Or, at least, before the timeline diverged at some point after now.


 In this world, There is an invention known as SABER, The Self-activated-Bomb-Eradication-redundancy.


Which, in essence, when installed on a nation's borders, will cause any ICBMS That cross the border to immediately shut down, and crash without detonating. 


This is installed over all major powers that can afford the massive million dollars per fifty square miles price tag. 


Anyways, this effectively nullifies the idea of a global nuclear war, as no nation can launch a missile to destroy the other, and any bombers can be intercepted with jets. 


This spurs the development of a new kind of deterrence; Biological ordinance. 


There was a Research firm, Entitled Kaelon Biotechnics. 

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

They Used the cumulative knowledge of hundreds of geniuses to produce novel technologies, and were particularly good with biological engineering.


 They patented the first ever total gene therapy serum. Able to completely change your appearance over the course of a few weeks.


 You could change your natural hair or eye color, make yourself taller, Give yourself a genetic resistance to disease, etc.

&amp;nbsp;

&amp;nbsp;

 Well, Unbeknownst to the general public, they were also a massive weapons firm.

&amp;nbsp;

 Pumping out advanced weapons such as Rail-guns, Laser Anti aircraft weaponry, and other systems. 


They were approached by the united states government, and tasked with 3 things. 

&amp;nbsp;

First, a biological method to turn a countries populous against each-other, to wreck infrastructure and create instability. 

&amp;nbsp;

Secondly, To produce a way to bring near death, or recently dead soldiers back to healthiness.

&amp;nbsp;

And Finally, To produce a Super soldier, that regular humans can become without needing to be born that way.  
And So they did. 


First, Using a combination of various viruses' DNA, such as, but not limited to:


 Ebola,


 Rabies,


 Human Hyperlibido syndrome,


and Human Immunodeficiency Virus. 

&amp;nbsp;

The result, Was Tereus. Named after the son of Ares From ancient Greece Mythology.

&amp;nbsp;

The Results were quite... Horrifying. 

&amp;nbsp;

When infected, often through injection or a aerosol Gas Bomb, Subjects began having violent seizures; along with muscle spasms, Blood pressure Ramping up Highly, the veins in their eyes and septum Burst.

&amp;nbsp;

 The eyes Turn a vibrant  scarlet Red, and subjects will begin to foam at the mouth, showing extreme signs of aggression. The virus can only be spread by bodily fluids, and bites will not work.


 The method picked, was one to be so incredibly horrible, that people would think twice before attacking.


 The infected persons will attack and attempt to rape any non infected mammal they see. 

&amp;nbsp;

A demonstration was Shown, So in an underground chamber, sat an underground test facility, with one male death-


Row inmate as the Dependent variable, and several other of varying sexes and appearances as the independent variable. 

&amp;nbsp;

The moment the auto injector on his wrist activated, he dropped to the ground and began thrashing about... 


Roughly thirty seconds later, The inmate who will be now referred to as 01, climbed to his feet.  

&amp;nbsp;

He then Charged the nearest inmate, grabbed her by her throat, and tackled her to the ground.


Slamming it's fists into her head, until she stopped resisting, tearing her clothes off, and engaging in copulation to the horror of the other inmates.

&amp;nbsp;

They tried to run, but the armed guards trained rifles on them, barring their escape.

&amp;nbsp;

 After 01 had apparently had it's fill, for a brief moment it had a look of calm on it's face...

&amp;nbsp;

 Before Locking it's eyes on another inmate...


 The female who will now be called 02, Then began to spasm in the same manner 01 did, before standing and joining 01 in attacking the others.

&amp;nbsp;

 At the end of the test, they were shot,it took an average of 8.7 bullets to bring a single one down in a timely manner.

&amp;nbsp;

 They did not seem to experience pain, Seeing as they did not wince when shot, even slightly. 


 Another observation yielded they were unusually docile when they were not aware of any non infected nearby. Often just standing around, sitting down; or sleeping on the floor. 

---

This turned to be a great success, with the Company getting a $3 billion dollar grant to continue operations.

&amp;nbsp;

 A new research center was built, Beneath downtown Cincinnati, Ohio. 

&amp;nbsp;
&amp;nbsp;

Then, they made the next. Using a concoction of various viruses, bacteria and fungi, they produced a virus that when inserted into a corpse, would return to life, although, rather incomplete.


 They were completely unresponsive to their names being called, and when approached, showed signs of aggression. The decay seemed to continue regardless of state.


  They would eat various things that would be inserted into the test chamber, from ordinary food, to raw, and even rotting meat. They did seem to have a preference for fresh meat.  

&amp;nbsp;

The true nature was only discovered when an intern dropped a test tube containing the virus, and it shattered. 


Triggering a lock down, the virus was inhaled by roughly 8 people.  There was another 6 people in another room when it happened. 

By the time the guard staff had donned gas masks, they entered the sealed sector to find the infected people apparently having died, and reanimated, and killing and cannibalizing the uninfected staff.

 It was determined that due to the nature of the virus, subjects would reanimate  over and over until their nervous system was destroyed. 


Bearing a striking resemblance to the pop culture monster known as ""Zombies"".


 The cannibalized subjects later reanimate in the morgue and were promptly incinerated. 


More testing and manipulation needed. 

&amp;nbsp;

The final project yielded beings known as chimeras.


 People with a genome, roughly 8 times longer than most people's.


 Incorporating All the genes of every human on earth, and that of various creatures such as;


 Tyrannosaurus Rex (DNA Reconstructed by a remarkably preserved bit of bone marrow)


Eagle, Gorilla, and many others.

&amp;nbsp;

They have the ability to ""Shift"" as in transform into a larger, stronger, and more defensive version of themselves.


Complete with a long, reptilian tail, Large, Bladed Spikes growing from their vertebrae, the rears of some joints, and finger and toe tips.

&amp;nbsp;

  They often grow roughly 60% taller, and have a weight increase of roughly 943%.


 This is accomplished using Incredibly efficient fat, that is mineral and vitamin-soluble.


 When they shift, They instantly turn this fat into energy and raw materiel, and though a very complicated chemical process, turn that energy into matter, and then into usable mass for their growth, It is also reversible. 


But this isn't some ugly Frankenstein with limbs of various creatures.


 They were custom made to look visually appealing always, though when they shift, it is substantially less.


 They are made to turn every person into a living, breathing tank. 

&amp;nbsp;

Their abilities include incredible strength, higher stamina, and the mental capacity to process their actions at roughly 8x the speed of a normal human.


 Being able to literally dodge tank shells fired at them, if they're willing.

&amp;nbsp;

 Otherwise, their bones no longer incorporate calcium. 


Instead, it has been tweaked to use titanium in place of calcium, making the bones strong enough to support this weight. 


They also have an ability to regenerate at a massive rate, capable of regrowing a destroyed arm in little more than a day. 

&amp;nbsp;

They can tolerate overheating to a massive degree, at times even getting so hot their blood will glow red hot, and their sweat will boil off the surface of their skin.

&amp;nbsp;

Their hide is thick and can resist most small arms, the smallest round capable of even piercing it is .50 BMG AP.

&amp;nbsp;

The muscle also has this effect, so really, the only way would be to hit one with a Railgun square in the heart, to destroy the blood's ability to flow and carry minerals to regenerate.

&amp;nbsp;

 Due to the law of conservation of mass and energy, when they regenerate, they will become slimmer, and must eat meat to regain the weight.

 They are able to digest incredibly quickly and efficiently, though.


 It is spread in such a way that it cannot be stolen, due to it requiring cooperation, and a special method.


 It is spread through sexual interaction, to be specific, sperm cells. Once inside the body, a bite must be placed on the subject without killing them, which will inject a serum to activate them.


In which case they'll immediately dig into the bloodstream and break apart into millions of Gene-spreading molecules, somewhat resembling viruses.

Another opportunity exists. I have a phone number of a higher up in a company that also hires in my field. He's a family friend, and has said that I can call him any time. I'm thinking of calling to ask him for a job, and what kind of technologies his company uses so that I demonstrate proficiency in them in the event of an interview.

The issue is, I don't really know how to make this kind of call. Is this normal? ""Hey man, I know you said I could call anytime, but now that I need something...""

53ezbc,25,2016-09-18,Tweaks/Changes to the 4-3-3/4-1-4-1,dwabn,chelseafc,https://www.reddit.com/r/chelseafc/comments/53ezbc/tweakschanges_to_the_4334141/,"Based on our recent performances I don't see Conte drastically changing Chelsea's system of play. However, I think we can all agree there is definitely room for improvement. I would like to use this thread to open a discussion on what tweaks or changes people would like to see to the current 4-3-3/4-1-4-1 formation to improve play.



I for one feel that one of the biggest problems with the current line-up is the positioning of the fullbacks on each flank. I believe their positioning and attributes are causing problems with both the positioning and selection of our midfield three and the linkage between our attacking trident. I think these problems were best illustrated in the Liverpool game and can be clearly seen in Chelsea's passing map from the match:

https://twitter.com/11tegen11/status/776891794487447552

By overloading Ivanovic's flank and pressing high up the pitch, Liverpool caused our midfield triangle to invert wherein Oscar had to drop extremely deep to try and get on the ball and to protect Ivanovic from overloads. This left Matic as the highest midfielder and greatly disrupted Chelsea'sbuild up play. Moreover, we were unable to build up play on the left hand side of the pitch because Azpilicueta is right-footed and routinely positioned deep and in line with Hazard. This left Matic to become the shuttler and push up in attempt to link up play with Hazard and our attacking trident. While this ended up working for our goal it was generally ineffective, and the attacking trio remained quite disconnected and spread-out throughout most of the match.



Now, how to fix this? I believe Chelsea are at their best when Hazard is allowed to drift infield and link-up with Costa. This is best illustrated in our passing maps from the Burnley and West Ham matches below:

https://twitter.com/11tegen11/status/769565520697892864


https://twitter.com/11tegen11/status/765509367248584704


As you can see from these diagrams Hazard, Costa, Willian are all located more closely together and have several linkages reflecting their interplay. Moreover, in midfield you can see our RCM is further up the pitch (ahead of Matic and Kante), and is successfully linking play.



By moving Azpilicueta to the right and playing a more aggressive LB like Alonso, I believe we will be able to address our problems on both flanks. 



On the left, Matic is naturally positioned to sit deeper and cover for our LB. This intern allows our LB to push up the pitch and provide width, giving Hazard the option to use the LB for overlaps or drift infield to get closer to Costa.



Having Azpilicueta on the right would allow our RCM to move further up the pitch and better link play with our attacking band. This would lesson the RCM's defensive responsibilities as they would no longer be as responsible for covering for Ivanovic or dropping into the RB position when he pushes up the pitch (like Matic would be doing on the left). This would also allow Fabregas to see more playing time as there would now be fewer defensive responsibilities on the position, but would free up whoever ends up playing the position nonetheless.



What are your thoughts on what other changes/tweaks you think Chelsea should try?"
53ezs1,1,2016-09-18,Moving to a new city as a teacher Help??,Quicksilver9014,Teachers,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/comments/53ezs1/moving_to_a_new_city_as_a_teacher_help/,"Hi Reddit, 

I'm super worried about the next step of my life so I made a reddit account to get some help (this is my first post). I plan to move to Oregon next year but I don't have any connections. How would an individual go about booking a job in a city they've never been to, especially in the field of education where schools are only hiring at a certain time of year for the next year? 



Specifically- How should I go about researching which schools to apply to work at? I don't just want a job, I want the RIGHT job (see the bottom of this post).  I need a way of researching schools! I feel like most school websites are not effective indicators  as to what the school is actually like and I only have a few days max to explore/interview so I can't just go visit each and every school at my own pace. Further, I feel like most schools that have their acts together wouldn't feel the need to resort to online job adds, so I do not think that to be the most prudent course of action either. 



Further- Even if I find the ideal fit, how can I convince them to hire someone who is flying out for an interview and who has to transfer his credential (from California to Oregon) when they could just as easily choose someone who is already local? While it is effectively a sure-thing that a California teaching credential will translate to an Oregon one, the process can take between 3-5 months to go through. 



______________________________________________________________________________

About me:
 I am 25 and I am in my 2nd year of teaching. I possess  California Single Subject teaching credentials in both Social Science, as well as Science, with a specialization in Physics and a supplementary authorization in Spanish Language.  (Effectively I am legally credentialed to teach non-AP Spanish classes, History classes, general science classes, and Physics classes). I was doing an Intern Credential program this past year, wherein I was getting a teaching credential while working full-time as a World History teacher. I decided to quit the program (I didn't have enough in me to do night classes while trying to handle myself in my 1st year of teaching w/o any prep) in order to pursue adding the ability to teach Science, Physics, and Spanish to my teaching credential. I will be finishing up my program this year but I don't want to stay in Los Angeles where I currently reside and will be completing my student-teaching. I've always wanted to move to Oregon (beautiful weather, culture, and amazing quality of life there), and when I found out that a woman that I am in love with will might be moving there I figured that it was a sign that now was the time to make the move! I have enough savings to last me no problem, but I worry about being seriously considered for a job when I am not even currently residing in the state the job is in!

_______________________________________________________________________________


What I am looking for in a school:

-Not overly conservative politics present in the community in question (relevant to my curriculum as a History teacher as well as a Science teacher)

- The school where classrooms are funded sufficiently .I'm ok with falling apart buildings and no textbooks etc... I just need to make sure that the materials I need for physics will be compensated effectively by the school. I additionally would strongly prefer to be working at a school where I have the option to check out a laptop cart for my classroom

- A school where I wont have more than 30 students in each class,

- Where the educational philosophy of the school really emphasizes creating a love of learning (not opposed to any specific type of highschool. Does not matter if it is a private, charter, religious, Summerhill, Montessori, hippie, public or whatever kind of school). 

__________________________________________________________________________________

I feel that I am a desirable enough candidate, with my various teaching credentials and my not being a first year teacher, to be a tad picky (specifically since I am ok with mediocre pay at this time in my life) but I have never researched outside of schools in Los Angeles and truly have no idea what I am talking about. 

Am I being unrealistic? Is it even possible to get hired as a teacher in a new city without any contacts? Any advice comments or suggestions? I feel very alone in this decision and need consult. "

I'm planning on graduating in December with a Bachelor's Accounting degree from a small-ish college in the Texas A&amp;M system. Right now my GPA is something like 2.8 and with a little luck I can hopefully get it up to a 3.0 after this semester, as I'm retaking some courses I did poorly in.

During my college years I faced a lot of health challenges that made it difficult to be competitive in school - some semesters it was just a matter of scraping by and doing the best I could with the hand I was dealt.

My only work experience so far is outside of the accounting industry, and I haven't had the opportunity to work an internship before graduation.

I know I'm not in a great place right now, and naturally I don't expect work at a Big Four Firm or anything like that. 

My question is, can anyone give me some advice on what to expect in terms of employment opportunities? I'm concerned that my low GPA will make it difficult to find work or be taken seriously for interviews or internships. Do you have any advice on how I should frame myself in interviews, or explain my (relatively) poor academic performance? I really just don't know what to expect and I have a lot of anxiety about how I'll be able to begin my career.

If it matters, I live in the Dallas-Fort Worth area but I would relocate just about anywhere if it meant a steady job and a foot in the door of the industry.

Thanks in advance. "
53fh10,12,2016-09-18,Does anyone else feel they aren't meant for an office job?,The3Broomsticks,CasualConversation,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/53fh10/does_anyone_else_feel_they_arent_meant_for_an/,"The only reason I majored in computer science and IT it's because I knew I'd be able to get a job.  Being in my 3rd office-setting job, I'm realizing that I'm never going to be happy in one.  My favorite job of all been ones where I was either outside, got to walk around a lot, or both. 

My first job was at a drive-in movie theater. Most of the work was outside. I would spend the first hour or so showing cars where to park, and then I would walk around the fields to count how many cars we had or make sure people weren't doing things they shouldn't have been doing.  And to top it off, the hours were evening/night and the theater was in the middle of a heavily forested area, which are my favorite times of day and nature scenary.

My second job was working for my township's road department.  Most of the work with park maintenance (cutting grass, picking up litter, trimming hedges/trees), but I would also go out with the full-time guys into town to take care of other things. So no matter what I was doing I was always outside and being visually productive, it was also a big bonus for me.  I was taking care of the town I grew up in and loved. 

Finally, my job during college was working for the IT Department. I work in the IT building at the help desk, but I would also often have to walk to various buildings around campus to pick up computers, drop off printer paper, or take care of issues that were more easily fixed in person.  Our campus was pretty small and it was beautiful, so I loved walking around it.

Since then I've had an office internship and two full-time office jobs.  Obviously they pay better, but I'd much prefer being able to be outside walking around to inside sitting at a desk for 8 hours.  Honestly, if I could have my road department job back and make the same amount of money I do in IT, I'd do it in a heartbeat. 

Does anyone else feel this way?"

53fut3,2,2016-09-18,21 [M4F] - Starting Over,burnbabyburner69,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/53fut3/21_m4f_starting_over/,"On September 22nd, 2036, a deep space probe was launched from Cape Canaveral. Its creators had designed it to detect supernovas in far away galaxies, but they had no idea that it's destiny laid in another direction. In order to escape the solar system, it had to use the Sun as a gravity assist. Readings taken from the probe as it circled the Sun were almost ignored completely, as many thought that the probe's sensors wouldn't read any significant information. Luckily though, a team of interns had no better work to do at the time and combed over the data as a way to keep their skills honed. One of them found an abnormal measurement and reported it to her superiors, but she got no word back about it. She figured that it must have been nothing. She was wrong. As soon as her superior looked over her discovery, he knew something was amiss. He went straight to the top and a small, top-secret task force was commissioned to investigate the measurement. A couple decades passed by before they reached their conclusion. The chemical makeup of the Sun was not nearly as stable as had been accepted for so long. The Earth didn't have billions of years left before the Sun blew up, it had hundreds.

President Alvarez had just been sworn in weeks before he was informed of the matter. While still keeping the veil of a normal presidency around him, he spent the entirety of his 8 year term researching the options that Earth had left. It was settled within a year that Earth was doomed. The Sun had reached the point of no return centuries ago and moving the Earth out of the blast radius was [out of the question](http://imgur.com/a/SIfaO).

Obviously, there had to be some kind of evacuation, but technology was extremely limited. Even when the other governments of the world were contacted, their pooled efforts could only create one spaceship that had could carry the resources necessary for sustaining life far enough away from the Sun. It wasn't all doom and gloom though. The research on designing the base accelerated quickly, and the spaceship itself was designed in less than a decade. The same probe that discovered the Sun's fatal flaw was retasked to scout out planets, and a small list of acceptable candidates was assembled quickly. Models suggested that the primary planet candidate could have its atmosphere be made breathable in less than a century and that the soil could be made farmable, though that would take a significantly longer amount of time.

All that was easy. The hard part came when it was time to select the people to fill the ark, as most of the people who knew of it called it. Some thought they should all be engineers, people who could manage the base well and troubleshoot mechanical problems the easiest. Others wanted a more balanced team that could manage all sorts of things, like the plants or the crew's health. A few politicians even suggested that the crew should be made of philosophers and artists to preserve Earth culture.

The decision was largely made for them though as two new problems surfaced. First, the cryogenics systems didn't develop as nicely as the others. Tests on people over 50 were catastrophic, with volunteers not lasting more than a few days before the tests had to be stopped for safety reasons. Further tests and calculations estimated that no one over 40 could survive the journey. To add onto the problems, volunteers with even average amounts of stress were much more likely to suffer heart attacks in their sleep state. The second problem was the elephant in the room that everyone tried to ignore for as long as possible. To continue the human race, the crew had to breed. But the ship could only hold six people, five women and one man to ensure long term species procreation. There would have to be incest just to create a third generation. Knowing that it had to be done, research was done on the science of incestuous breeding and it was found that only .0001% of the population had the genes necessary to sustain a healthy family tree.

With these two factors in mind, the most qualified candidates were identified from a short list. Most people who were involved in the decision wanted the candidates to be trained and debriefed extensively before the launch. However, the cryogenic scientists made it clear that the stress of knowing the fate of humanity was to be carried on their shoulders was far too much. The only plan that ensured the safety of the candidates was to sedate them in their sleep and put them into the cryochambers without even the slightest bit of warning or preparation.

Thousands of years later, the lights in the spaceship turned on. It had landed on the virgin planet just as the scientists and engineers designed it to. The cryochambers started their three day reanimation process, and once the crew members exited, they barely had a chance to speak to each other before a video played in the center of the room.

""Hello, I'm Dr. Baker. Welcome to Project Phoenix.""

***

This is obviously a long term prompt that will focus on breeding, and if the RP goes on for a long time, incest. However, this most likely isn't going to be a sex-focused RP. The main focus will most likely be on the characters themselves as they go through the emotions of knowing they're the last humans alive and the struggles that they'll face just to survive and deal with each other. I'm looking for realistic character development, with each one taking a different view on their situation. Breeding is the only truly necessary kink for this RP, but others can be discussed. Here's my [kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/ZTXuOUH.png) if you want to check it out. I'm always open to doing this prompt, so no matter when you're reading this, feel free to shoot me an orange envelope!"

I've been stressing out a bit because that relationship essentially rides on whether or not I can find a job in New York. I feel pretty good about my resume (is it against the rules to post this?) and have spent the last week applying for different jobs in that area but have yet to receive anything back.

Without rambling too much further, my question is: Does it seem like I'd be able to work in a place such as New York City?  Is it difficult to find a job in Manhattan or nearby? I'm not really looking to work for a top 4 company and would be alright working at a mid-tier company (I have pretty high anxiety so less stressful the better). Additionally, my internships have been very research/data driven; writing Python scripts and packages for data analysis, visualization, etc. - I have very little software development experience (the senior project I'm in will help with this). Is this a skillset that is sought after and if so, where? I really don't know where to start looking.

Any help would be really, really appreciated. Thanks!"

I hadn't experienced it much in my young adult life. Always taking chances and exploring the world as much as I could, my friend Jax called me an opportunist. 

""You know, you're the bravest person I've ever met.""

""I just like to try new things, okay!"" I used to respond. Not anymore. I wasn't brave just stupid. They all thought it would change their lives. It did.*

___________________________(Part 1)_____________________________


***I awake, my palms suddenly cold, clammy***

The days have started to move more quickly now. Flickering, obsolete conversations that I can't recall a single word from. Food I remember eating but not tasting. I had to check the date three times before I really believed it. Four months. It had been almost seventeen weeks since that night. The night the five of us went into the black cave, near the lake and dead center in Rudy's Forest. Rudy was an original founder of our small town, died over two hundred years ago, and helped plant part of what is now his forest. My younger brother by a year, Cody and I had built a treehouse in the forest as kids.

***Stinging goosebumps crawl over my whole body***

We found a small clearing one night, with only two trees right in the middle of it about three feet apart. Perfect for a big tree house. It wasn't very sophisticated, and it creaked loudly when it was windy; but it had two rooms, a bed, hammock, all of our comics and books, and an amazing view of the forest canopy. We spent most of our teenage years there, until that night.

***Small specs of sweat slowly streak down my face***

Dave originally brought up the idea of a group camping trip, which was typical for him. He loved the outdoors more than we did, so much so that he volunteered as a Jr. Park Ranger in Rudy's Forest. I grew up with Dave and as kids he was always with us exploring the forest. 

I was up for a camping trip, needing an escape after the hell of a finals week we had all been through.

""I am so down. I haven't been to the lake in forever, and it would be really cool to visit the old clubhouse. How about it guys?"" I asked the rest of the group.

""I'm free. Would love to spend some time outdoors! You're gonna go right Cody?"" said Sky, giving Cody a longing look that everyone noticed except him. Sky professed her love for Cody over six months ago, but his life was so crowded with summer school and his law internship that he barely even realized she was serious.

***My pulse races with the sound of slowly approaching footsteps***
 

""Yeah yeah I'll be there guys. Probably have some work stuff to do though while we're out there though."" my brother said ignoring Sky, as he furiously texted what I assumed to be one of his many bosses.


""Jax how about you, you ready to finally see the place Dave and I have told stories about since you've known us?"" I asked, lightly shoving him in attempt to exhume his nose buried in one of the many Time Wheel novels. His love for reading fantasy was only surpassed by his love for writing it. I always told him the forest would give him great material for a story.

***My vision blurs as a shadow flickers on the edge of the firelight***

""Hmm? Sorry, what did you ask me? Why are you pushing me Luke? I'm just finding out about the One Power! I wish stuff like this was real so much!"" he exclaimed, oblivious to our proposal.

""The One Power? Huh?"" Dave said with mock interest.

""Nevermind that. Jax! Camping, Rudy's Forest, all of us, beer, bonfire, good times. Yay or nay?"" I said, trying to make it easy for him to pick out the basics as he continued reading.

""Sounds good, I'm up for whatever just let me know what you guys want to do."" he replied without looking up. I slapped my forehead, rolling my eyes at the rest of the group.

""Okay he's in. Cool looks like were all going. Lets say meet back here tomorrow morning and we'll take Dave's truck if that's cool with everyone?"" I asked looking around at everyone.

""Fine by me, just had her scrubbed up."" Dave agreed. We all went home to pack and get ready for what we hoped would be an amazing time.

***All around me lit up for a brief second as if lightning had struck outside. I saw the creature looming in the entrance to the cave. It was back from hunting, empty handed again. How long could it go without eating before I became its next meal. It made its way towards me, slowly dragging its deformed body across the damp cave floor. The fire seemed to be playing tricks on my eyes because the creatures shape kept changing. One second massive and lumpy with growths protruding out of it; the next skinny and hollow like a skeleton. The smell got worse as it crept nearer, until the air was thick with the bitterness. Soon darkness black as death engulfed me.***

53gota,0,2016-09-19,Keep making mistakes in new job and terrified,arghsoscared,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/53gota/keep_making_mistakes_in_new_job_and_terrified/,"Hiya, so after a 4 month job search, I managed to find a full time job in customer service, for a company that delivers food around the city. 

Before this position I was doing internships, and before that I was let go from an estate agent job after 5 months for making mistakes. I over-ordered stationery, and didn't call a customer by their name in an email.

Needless to say I'm terrified of being fired again, as the experience was so traumatic.

Well, you've guessed it - 2 weeks in and I keep making silly mistakes. I sometimes filled out spreadsheets incorrectly, and I did not stay on top of drivers' schedules, so when they fell behind, I didn't notify the customer in time. Some customers came back furious. On top of this, I get through the work slower than the rest of my team.

I also had to work alone the other day, and I felt like I was finally doing better. I was getting through the issues, logging them properly, and watching the drivers' schedules like a hawk. However, right near the end of the day, I received an email from a very irate customer from 2 days before that I had scheduled her delivery for the wrong day, and that as a result her dying friend would have to go without the goods. 

I had a panic attack and started hyperventilating and crying. Just as I had thought everything had gone well, this happened. I immediately let my manager know about my mistake, who handled it. I was so mortified, and told her as much. She responded that mistakes happen, and that from now on she'd monitor my emails until I get used to it.

I really don't want to be a liability to my team, and I'm so horrified that I caused that much damage two weeks in. I was so happy to get the job after so long, and thought that this time, everything would be different. 

I trained people during my internship after just two weeks, and I was the go to person for procedures and customer issues. I also was an extremely competent teacher abroad who trained others for years. I really don't know how I could be such a fuck up, and seen as a liability so quickly.

The one thing I think I did differently was going to my manager first as soon as I found that email. In my estate job I tended to shy away from the managers, as the workplace was a very hostile environment.

Now the manager wants to catch up when I'm next in. I'm so terrified of being fired that my whole weekend was spoiled. I've become so depressed and fearful that it's affected my sleep, and I feel like crying all the time. I think I have some sort of PTSD from the estate job that's finding its way into my new one. I really wanted to excel in this company. 

The one thing I can think of is that these events have been so traumatic that I'd never want to experience them again, so I've become much more vigilant. I am worried about the speed at which I'm currently working. 

Any advice? I'm so afraid right now."
53gowb,1,2016-09-19,"Just started studying Finance, a number of questions/looking for overall advice.",D3LOREAN,FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/53gowb/just_started_studying_finance_a_number_of/,"Started college right out of hs, fall 2014, finished my general associates by October 2015 ^(well... I finished taking all the required classes - I forgot to apply for graduation to receive the actual degree. So I didn't get it until this past May). 

Had no idea what I wanted to do with my life at this point. Took about 8 months off from October. working at a middle school and a grocery store. I still work at the middle school. 

Missed studying and going to school, decided to major in Finance - not knowing too much about the field, just knew you can make a lot of money. I've mapped it so that I know I'll graduate by the end of the summer 2017. Kind of feel like I'm falling behind the 'race', so I want to finish it as fast as I can. 

After reading a number of the top posts on this sub, it seems that I should have a few things defined before looking for internships/jobs. I know I want a solid steady income, to live in a big city, more or less a demanding/stressful job- something that no more than 60+- hrs/week. 

Also, as I'm taking finance/economics classes I feel like I'm grasping at straws trying to understand: 1. the whole system of finance/banking/economics , 2. what exactly Finance entails , 2a. what part I see myself working in/what interests me the most. (My idealized interest would be in trading like how its depicted in movies/TV, where you're at a stock exchange and yelling over one another,everything looks chaotic, etc... but as far as I know this isn't anymore - it's all electronic now). 

Another thing I've read is to be good at programming. Can you explain why programming would be important? And which programming language (is this the correct term?) is most popular/useful- I'm thinking of Java, Linux, etc? 
In terms of excel, I'm decent in it - know I can be better. I do plan on spending a lot of time learning more, come October. 

I think I should've applied to internships over 2 summers ago to build experience. If I apply now to some internships, it'll be in my last 5 classes of my degree (not giving me too much experience as others will have), depending on if I were to get accepted. Would I just continue to intern after I graduate to build experience? 

My school has a minor/program that prepares students to take the CFP exam (it's approved by the actual CFP Board), would this benefit me even if I know financial planning isn't necessarily something that interests me? 

Thanks in advance!"

We were friends for 12 years. No matter what you did or where you went, when you came back home we would hang out at our spot, and talk for hours. We had a good thing going.

Then my wife's vehicle was vandalized. Key marks everywhere, and the insurance money couldn't cover it all. You happen to mention that you could do body work, and you could fix it up nice for us. Great! That's awesome. 

My mistake was not making a contract before you started working on my wife's van. I should have known better. You ended up demanding an amount of money that was absolutely ridiculous because you were afraid we weren't going to pay you. What? Have we met? In what universe would I ever do such a thing?

But whatever, we made an agreement.

A few days later my wife happens to mention that you're upset with me. Now I'm pretty damn busy. I have three step kids, three jobs, and an internship at a high school. Sometimes keeping up with people can be hard. So I text you to see what's up, and this is what you say: ""color me confused. You haven't spoken to me or even really given me eye contact in nearly a week."" 

What? Aside from the fact that that's not even true, you have made zero attempt at doing that either. You couldn't be bothered to come in to say bye because you just had to go to laundry. The one time you asked if I was okay was ""hey, what's wrong with you?"" Yeah, that's really inviting to have a discussion.

But after I try to talk it out, you say that this is ridiculous, and that after this job we will not speak. Excuse me? Are you. Really going to end our 12 year friendship over text message? Nope.

The next day, I reach out. You say you need to think about things, and we can talk after the van is done. Fine.

Then I see the van. Holy shit, a monkey could have done a better job. We trusted you, because you said you could do body work. You clearly just wanted some easy money. After a few days I reach out again. I tell you that I'm done being angry over this, I express my feelings in a clear and calm manner, and tell you that if you want to meet up and talk about this, we can do that.

"" Hahahahahahahaha, okay, yeah, bye.""

And just like that, it's over.

And I've never been happier.

You were my first love. I've been in love with you for over a decade, knowing you didn't return the feelings. And I respected that. I didn't bring it up, didn't make anything weird, but it was always in the back of my mind. Sometimes I would cry just from the pain.

But now, it's like a bad spell has been lifted. I'm no longer broken up over what never would have been. Sure, our van looks like shit, and we might not make rent this month because of you. But that's okay, I always figure something out.

I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors."

My grandfather, who was like my father to me, passed away a week before I came to Santa Fe. I am in the GE@SF program currently for Computer Science, so I'm basically guaranteed to get in. The only problem is, I'm extremely depressed and homesick. 

It wouldn't be so bad if I had my grandfather to talk to like I always do, but now I don't. Now I'm afraid it's starting to take it's toll on my schoolwork. I procrastinate a lot because I don't feel like doing _anything_ but sitting in my room or talking to friends occasionally. I just can't do this when I'm 4 hours from home. I've been able to visit my family a couple of times in the past month, but each time I leave, I'm a mess. I know UF is usually praised as the best school, but is it worth it if I'm in this current state? I know I don't get over this kind of stuff easy, I've been through it before when I moved states and it took me a year to realize I needed to move back. A big factor that keeps pulling me back too is my little sister. She's a toddler, and our dad works all day every day of the week to support us, so I feel bad not being there to help her. Especially cause at this point she feels like my own daughter. 

So anyway, would it be fine to just go to USF instead? I know it's ABET accredited in Computer Science and UF is not. It might not be that big of a deal, but I was also not planning on going to UF for grad school. I want to go somewhere more prestigious and challenging to get my MS or doctorate. I know UF offers more resources and internships as well, but I can do alright without. Hell, my friend went to USF then got into MIT for grad school. 

I also think going to USF will be easier on my pockets since I can live with family. 

Also, can I transfer scholarships? I have a few helping with tuition. 

I'm pretty much set on transferring to USF after this semester, but if anyone could weigh in on this, it would mean a lot.

So, please know your efforts are not in vain. Anyway, wanted to share that I did contact my Congressman's office(s) this morning, and it went very well. Fortunately, I have 2 separate districts that came up within my zip code, so I was able to contact both. As thought, the interns answered the calls and I explained to them that the Dear Colleague letter would be circulated as early as tomorrow, and is extremely important to a national community that our Representatives sign this letter. The second intern was more conversational, and requested my contact information so they could pass it on and have them contact me regarding the action taken. Good luck to everyone. We're down to the wire here, and if the ban does go through, it will make it much easier to step away knowing we did not go down without a fight."

I was twice in the USA for holiday and i really liked it there. So I decided that I want to live there atleast for some time.
I'm currently study computer science (bachelor) in germany and will graduate in about 1 year.
As a working student (20hr/week) I already gathered about a year experience in software development and also I need to do an internship.
Basically I just have some question:

* I heard that the job market is good for computer science graduates. But how are the chances for foreigners?
* Is it possible, in term of visa, to do my internship in the usa and do companys even take foreigners as interns?
* Should I rather stay in germany and get some more experience and try to move after some years?
* I kinda like colder weather more then super hot summer. Are there any big tech cities like San Francisco in areas where it is a little bit colder? (spring and autumn are my favorite seasons due the whether :D) 
* For which visas would I be qualified for?

That were my first questions :D
I would be really happy if someone could give me some informations about them.
Thanks in advance.

Apologies to those who I left behind after my last prompt, I got extremely busy! If you're reading this, feel free to recontinue our past prompt or start anew with this one.

Typically I roleplay by posting a long prompt and hoping someone builds off of it, however I'm feeling particularly lazy today and need to go to work in about an hour. So instead of me writing a nice long, steamy prompt, I'd love it if YOU wrote one out. Below are ten mini-prompts. Each one has a little to offer, and I want you to build upon one of them. Essentially, send me a prompt based off of one of the mini prompts below! In your message, please include your kinks, your limits, and your name/age.

Please don't take too long on the prompt, but also please don't send a small amount either! I'll be content with 2-3 paragraphs, but will always read however much you'd like to put into it. All of these themes must include one kink: Expansion/transformation, but other kinks can be discussed!

1) As a newlywed couple, you and I decide to take our first honeymoon aboard a lavish and large cruise ship. This boat has all the amenities anyone can imagine; massive pools, relaxing spas, and even a tennis court. However, there's something awfully peculiar about this cruise ship...

2) Uh oh, a dirt biking accident gone wrong. You've broken your right arm, and you're now in the hospital being waited on by a beautiful staff of nurses and doctors. That's when you notice this hospital doesn't seem... normal.

3) You are the high chief of a small, pagan tribe within Scandinavia. You hate that bogwash of religion and mysticism until you meet an occultress who wields sorcery beyond the scope of imagination.

4) The Brew Pot, your favorite place to get your morning coffe. It's a bustling cafe mixed with cute barista's, a lovely smell, and the best tasting coffee you've ever had. Things do get weird, however, when they change the recipe to their dark roast blend...

5) You are a young casanova living at the height of your life in downtown Manhattan. Young, hung, and beautiful; you really have it all going for you. Your only weakness? Women who are extremely beautiful but batshit crazy. Your most recent girl is a firm believer in astrology and pagan rituals and brings you to a... strange part of Manhattan.

6) One of us is a lowly intern at one of the biggest corporations in America; Bi-dustrial incorporated. They make anything and everything, and pretty soon, one of us finds out some of their most secret and lucrative projects. 

7) Being a king or queen in the modern era isn't exactly what it used to be. From running entire empires and civilizations to being classy socialites and having bounds of twitter followers, it's hard to admit that time has indeed changed for our monarchs. Boundless wealth and nothing but time is enough to cause anybody to get a little crazy.

8) It's difficult, becoming a mother. Gaining unwanted weight, my breasts getting uncomfortably engorged with milk, sometimes I'd just prefer it if I never had to do it at all. The changes can be drastic, and can really make me feel a little depressed. It helps, however, to have a caring and loving spouse.

9) Genetically modifying fruit is a very controversial practice these days. We're putting these fruit in our bodies, that can be dangerous! It can be especially dangerous if a young, inexperienced scientist get's their hands on boundless information on how to accomplish some of the crazier changed fruits.

10) It's kind of like the plague, except no one dies? It's weird, doctors are afraid of the effects it will have on society, but it doesn't actually hurt anybody. If anything, it makes everyone feel pretty good. Even if society falls, at least the plague will make people happier. Maybe it's not all bad if society takes a tumble.

If you have any prefernce or ideas that you'd like to throw in, feel free! Please remember, I'll be going to work soon, so this roleplay wont be immediate.  [kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/iI8tV6V.png)"

What should I do?,caloriemonster,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/53iobd/chemical_engineering_graduate_of_2013_no_real/,"Here is my resume for some background: http://imgur.com/a/vpq2I

This might seem like a stream of consciousness post so I apologise:

I graduated from chemical engineering in 2013 with a good GPA and took a job in regulatory affairs which is what I had done a co-op in. It was not really relevant to my field but I took what I got. After this 14 month contract ended I went to Calgary since at the time the job market there was good but then crashed shortly after. I kept applying to jobs, maybe more than a 1000, got maybe 8 interviews, two of them going to the second stage. Both were in pulp and paper I guess because of my short internship in quality at a tissue plant, but I didnt end up getting the job. Also, looking at new/recent grad job postings, the vast majority require someone who has graduated in the past two years.
I had to work, so did security. I then decided, after being 3 years out of university to go for a course based masters thinking it could help me get internships or maybe full time work. I am completely lost in class as the stuff done in my bachelors is just being skimmed in a couple of classes and then we will be going to more advanced stuff. I ended up dropping those classes and have taken two that I feel I will be able to cope with, however, eventually I will need to take the core courses and get at least a 70% in, otherwise I will be expelled.
Now I am applying for internships so that at least I can get relevant work experience even if i couldnt finish this MEng, and even applying to full time work mentioning the end date of the MEng as ""Tentative"" and saying in the cover letter that I am willing to put it on an indefinite hold for employment.

I dont know what to do, all the time I spent on my bachelors and hard work to get good grades seem like its all been a waste. Any input would be great since I have basically hit rock bottom."

Can someone list a basic outline template that I can create mainly aimed towards the tech industry?

Would it just be Personal Info at top, Introductory, Skills, Experience, Education as the categories?"
53j5ps,1,2016-09-19,My [30F] boyfriends [30M] masturbration habits are getting a little out of hand.,wankwankqq,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/53j5ps/my_30f_boyfriends_30m_masturbration_habits_are/,"My boyfriend ""Craig"" and I have been together for a little over 4 years now, and we have been living together for just over a year now. Our relationship is great! We have a lot of things in common; that being said, we do our thing and have our own interests. Moving in together went really smooth, almost *too* smooth. Our habits seemed to be right on point, considering both of us are on the ""upper"" end of being clean and having our routines (compared to most people I would say).

---

That being said, over the last number of months (I would say as far back as January), I have noticed that Craig hasn't been that desecrate when it comes to masturbating at our place. For instance, one day I came home from doing errands, and he was just laying on the couch getting himself off. I wasn't expecting that, but whatever. My biggest issue though is when he masturbates in our bed! Specifically, he never really cleans up after himself when he is done. 

Normally whenever we have sex, or we are on a bit of a tear, I try to keep up on cleaning our sheets as much as possible. I am sure most of you couples living together know where I am coming from here. But, I can always tell when he has masturbated in our bed. For instance, I spent Friday doing laundry and cleaning our sheets, while he went over to friends place to drink and hang out. Here I am, a 30 year old women cleaning my bed sheets because my boyfriend decides to spray over our sheets like he is 16 or something.

Sunday night (last night, Sept 18th) I had a talk with Craig over this. I have been really, really quiet about this since I started noticing this back in January. I didn't want to rock the boat in our relationship over a very small issue. I told Craig that I would like him to be more aware of himself while he masturbates - specifically in our bed. Craig told me that he always was self conscious of himself while he masturbated and he didn't think that he was making a mess. But, I then had to allude to him how much I was cleaning the sheets of our bed, and/or buying/putting on new sheets very periodically.  

I felt like after our small talk that Craig will probably forget about this soon enough. How can I approach him in more of a ""direct"" manner, opposed to trying to not rock the boat, but intern, being less effective? Have any of you couples living together have had to deal with this before? How did you go about it?

  ---   
  **TL;DR: My boyfriends masturbation habits, that I started noticing around January, have been bothering me a lot. I am trying to figure out a way to speak with him directly, without rocking the boat and making this a bigger issue then it has to be.**"

But quick announcement, I **started rewrites and new chapters for PROJECT LAZARUS** today (and kind of yesterday). The story I want to tell is looking at around a short novella-length, maybe less, maybe more, we'll see how things go. If you have any comments or suggestions on that story, now's the time to send 'em my way before I'm fully underway.

Anyway, wanted to throw that to you all so you know I'm **still actively working on my writing and career there.** I haven't forgotten about you all, and I hope you haven't forgotten about me.

Updates with Lazarus should come in the next few weeks. I'm hoping to finish it within the year and releasing it as a full story in one fell swoop.

53jf49,4,2016-09-19,Octo - Kig-Yar Doctor (Format Fixed),DreamingKroot,HaloRP,https://www.reddit.com/r/HaloRP/comments/53jf49/octo_kigyar_doctor_format_fixed/,"Scales and Feathers.

  Albeit they are hardly the center-stars of the universe, it's hard not to feel this odd, twitchy Kig-Yar just didn't just hit the ugly tree on its way out of the nest, but careened through it and decided it'd make a good home.  With big yellow-amber eyes that gleam when viewed at certain angles, and scales that are a bit on the red side, with flecks of ochre running the underside of his eyes, mouth, and against the slits where his hearing organs lay.  He's given to a long, beak like snout, with many mangled teeth resting in his mouth, while the scale looks pinched, like he's too stressed out to relax his facial muscles.  Occasionally, a twitch makes one eye spasm.  He has indigo-black quill-feathers that run from between his eyes and up over the top of his scalp, and sweep backwards.  A few patches of quill-feathers are permanently missing - indicating he lost the growth there in the past.

  He has a bit of a bird like neck,wattled slightly and prominent to a nervous swallow that runs him a near constant dry throat.  His neck flusehes with the thin shoulders, while his build appears to sag slightly from his bones.  Lacking any particular strength, the weedy lizard-bird has loosely feathered forearms that run to three fingered hands, tapped as they are with sharp pointed claws.  His chest is slim, and belly has an odd paunchiness to it, showing the odd dishealth that he keeps.  The mottling darkens over his chest and along his lower belly, while a slender trail of feathers runs from mid abdomen and low, short quills that are fine in manipulation, but itchy as all-get-out when disturbed.

  Slender hips give him an almost delicate manner of walking, which might oddly offset the otherwise twitchy movements he normally leads with.  A short tail rests above his slim haunches, stubby and touched with small feathers that match the ones that run down from the back of his neck, though they do little to hide him.  His legs are bent in the unfamiliar digitigrade stance, marking him to walk like a bird with backward-bending knees.  He has three toes on each foot, claws worn down from being always on his feet.

  A headset rests upon his brow, covering a black band that looks strapped to him, and clowers both a microphone to rest along his jawline and a visor to cover his left eye, providing pertinent information as needed.  He has a black carapace covering his torso and hips, made of hyper-light armor that designate him as a drop-paramedic, as well as a ships doctor, or at least so the heraldry of the shoulders say.  He has a beaded necklace around his neck adorning him well, though it's hardly ostentatious.  He's otherwise not wearing much beyond his utility belt.

Quirks:

Medical Prodigy - He's skilled at medicine to a degree that almost makes up for his flaws!

Lucky - He's got something about him, perhaps chance, perhaps fate, that keeps him alive.  
  
Flaws: 

Ugly - He hit the ugly tree, and decided to build a nest out of it.

Coward - He suffers from combat paralysis, and refuses to fight back.

Gremlins - Tech goes wonky around him.  A lot.  Weirdly.

Stigma - People tend to feel unlucky around him.  This crimps his social abilities.

Bio:

  Born on an unassuming ship in high orbit around a little historically unimportant world known as Harvest, in the late edge of 2525, Octo is unlucky.  Or he's very lucky, but everyone else around him is made unlucky by his sucking the luck out of them.  Or maybe it's just the bad circumstances around his birth.  It was a difficult birth with half the eggs were stillborn, the ship undergoing a quote: ""Really bad slip-space event"", and the contact with what would end up being the hammer to smash the Covenant against the anvil of reality, bad things happened around poor Octo that simply aren't his fault (so he claims) but can be devastating (so others admit) if not handled carefully.

  But such are the ways of fate that, despite being unlucky, he was still a native-son on-board the Kig-Yar ship ""Fortunes of War"", and such was put to use working, when he was old enough.  From scrubbing walls to burning out bilges, to just sitting in a room to avoid actually touching anything with the gremlins that seemed to follow him about.  After the third contaminant failure, and while he was recovering from being covered in bilge-goop, the poor Octo was taken up by the doctor on duty to run errands as intern.

  Maybe because gremlins are prone to not messing with living bodies than they are mechanical, he had very little trouble when it came to doctoring.  And, after a particularly nasty encounter with a rival ship that remains off the record, he was instrumental in not screwing up the med-bay when half the doctoring staff was injured.  This lead to him getting promoted to medic - and his career was born.

  Having served ship to ship for over thirty years, and has survived - always by keeping his head down, never returning fire, and just staying under his desk when the shooting starts.  He might have a reputation as a coward, craven, and someone weak, but he's alive - and has a chance to make sure others live through encounters with the many horrors of war."

My lenovo ideapad has served me pretty well for three years, but last winter a crack appeared in the plastic body right by the charging report. I got it repaired for ~200 dollars, but now the crack is back, and I think it's time to retire this one. The crack in the plastic is getting bigger every time I open or close the laptop, so while I try to open/close it as little as possible, I can tell that its days are numbered (possibly only a week left). 

* **Total budget and country of purchase:** 
Less than $700, purchasing in the US (in person or online). 

* **Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications to your requirements for the money? Pick or include any that apply.** 
My sister got a Dell Inspiron 2-1 this year, and I used it over the summer since my laptop was starting to break. I really liked it! Two-in-one would be great, but not mandatory. I'm not too picky about battery; as long as it lasts about an hour and a half on dim, I'm okay.

* **How important is weight to you?**
Somewhat; I would be carrying it around to class and stuff in addition to textbooks and notebooks, so I would prefer not to be lugging around a monstrous laptop.

* **Which OS do you require? Windows, Linux, Mac.**
Windows

* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 
 14-15 inches. My sister's inspiron is the 13.3 one and that's one of the few things I didn't like about it.

* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run. If you have no requirements, put N/A.** 
N/A
None at all! Don't do any gaming ever haha.

* **If you're gaming (leave blank if you put N/A above...), do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** 
N/A

* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable business grade build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** 
Touch screen would be nice but not compulsory. I would also prefer for the keyboard to not be too noisy, but again it's not a deal-breaker. 

* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**
I've looked up the 15.6"" version of Dell Inspiron and it seems pretty good. I also have looked up the Dell XPS 13 which looks awesome but totally out of my budget. I don't do anything extraordinary on my computer (I literally just use it for schoolwork (and work for my internship), browsing the internet, and streaming netflix. Should I just stick to what I've used and liked (inspiron 2-in-1)? Or are there others that I should be looking at?

Side note about brand: I've generally had really good customer service experiences with Dell and not very good with Lenovo.

Side note for the budget: My mom is considering paying for a laptop as a birthday present and I think she's more likely to agree if it's within the 400-600 range, so that'd be great! Otherwise, I may be able to get her to pay for ~500 and I would pay the rest."
53jmf6,2,2016-09-19,My dad is a high-ranking employee at a big tech company - I'm interviewing for a software engineering internship there. Should I avoid bringing it up?,dootdoot13131,interviews,https://www.reddit.com/r/interviews/comments/53jmf6/my_dad_is_a_highranking_employee_at_a_big_tech/,"I'm a college undergrad and this week I have a final-round interview with one of the tech giants that's popular with CS students (Msft,Apple,etc) for a software engineering internship of the summer. 

I believe I'm well qualified and I think I should be able to do well at the interview. I have a lot of experience for my age, solid knowledge of programming, practiced &amp; prepared a lot, etc.

There's one thing I haven't been too sure about, though and I feel that it's a super naive question but I'm only a young college guy so what do I know haha. My dad is among the highest ranking employees at that company. His direct boss that he reports to on a day-to-day basis is one of the people who show up when you Google that company's executives, and he personally knows all the execs.

For me, this is one of the reasons that I really want this internship. And I feel like, in general, if an interviewer asks ""So why are you particularly interested in working here as opposed to somewhere else?"", this would definitely be a reasonably good answer: ""My dad works here so I've been able to see what the company culture is like, and I think it's a great company and it'd be awesome to be able to work for it."" (and that's really how I feel about it). But I also feel that answer naturally leads to the question ""Oh really, that's cool! What does he do here?"". At that point, I'm afraid saying his actual job/position could be almost arrogant, because in terms of job level it'd be like saying ""oh yeah my dad is your boss's boss's boss's boss."" I don't know if that's how it'd be actually interpreted, but to me it's certainly a possibility that I want to avoid since that's definitely not what I mean to convey. But if I just answer super vaguely like ""oh yeah he works in ___ department"" then it'll seem like I'm not actually that interested in the company, I'm only saying it.

Am I proud of my dad? Heck yeah. He started his career as a dishwasher and worked his way up over the years. But I certainly have no delusion that him being a big boss at the company has any influence on my own chances at an internship, and I don't want to come across that way.

Should I just avoid bringing up the subject entirely? Will the interviewer probably not care and I'm just being paranoid? Essentially one of the reasons that I really want to get this internship is because I know the company well, but bringing up the reason why I know the company well feels a little awkward for me because it almost feels like nepotism or something.

**tl;dr I'm struggling to think of a way to mention that my dad works at the company which is one major reason I'm really excited for the opportunity, but at the same time not coming across as saying being super arrogant like ""ha my dad is one of the top people at this company, you better give me this job""**"

I'm going to be on a call with the hiring manager soon. Quick background: I went to a target school, got decent grades, and did a few internships. I started the job search arguably late. I spent a month studying and tidying up my resume. I've been on the job hunt for a month now. The company: A mid-sized start-up in SF.

My thoughts: I was surprised at how well I jived with all the engineers during the onsite. I only had 1 technical interview. The other 4 were more behavioral/long term goals/ testing/ect. type interviews. I got a really good vibe from everyone in the company and am interested in the product they are working on. That being said, I'm in the process of potentially interviewing with bigger, more well known companies (still in the early stages of those interviews though). How do I time this?

I didn't really consider working at a start-up right out of college. I thought working at a more established company was more ideal. I don't know how true that is. Thoughts?

How important is the work you'll be working on (in terms of future employment)? This is a front end role, so I'll be working with JavaScript. Would that put me at a disadvantage for future, general software engineering roles? 

Finally: What should I ask the hiring manager? What is the target salary I should be looking for (in SF)? General things to keep in mind when deciding on a new job? 

Thoughts, comments, and advice is appreciated. Don't have too many people to talk to about these things.

53jyz5,2,2016-09-19,21 [M4F] - Starting Over,burnbabyburner69,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/53jyz5/21_m4f_starting_over/,"On September 22nd, 2036, a deep space probe was launched from Cape Canaveral. Its creators had designed it to detect supernovas in far away galaxies, but they had no idea that it's destiny laid in another direction. In order to escape the solar system, it had to use the Sun as a gravity assist. Readings taken from the probe as it circled the Sun were almost ignored completely, as many thought that the probe's sensors wouldn't read any significant information. Luckily though, a team of interns had no better work to do at the time and combed over the data as a way to keep their skills honed. One of them found an abnormal measurement and reported it to her superiors, but she got no word back about it. She figured that it must have been nothing. She was wrong. As soon as her superior looked over her discovery, he knew something was amiss. He went straight to the top and a small, top-secret task force was commissioned to investigate the measurement. A couple decades passed by before they reached their conclusion. The chemical makeup of the Sun was not nearly as stable as had been accepted for so long. The Earth didn't have billions of years left before the Sun blew up, it had hundreds.

President Alvarez had just been sworn in weeks before he was informed of the matter. While still keeping the veil of a normal presidency around him, he spent the entirety of his 8 year term researching the options that Earth had left. It was settled within a year that Earth was doomed. The Sun had reached the point of no return centuries ago and moving the Earth out of the blast radius was [out of the question](http://imgur.com/a/SIfaO).

Obviously, there had to be some kind of evacuation, but technology was extremely limited. Even when the other governments of the world were contacted, their pooled efforts could only create one spaceship that had could carry the resources necessary for sustaining life far enough away from the Sun. It wasn't all doom and gloom though. The research on designing the base accelerated quickly, and the spaceship itself was designed in less than a decade. The same probe that discovered the Sun's fatal flaw was retasked to scout out planets, and a small list of acceptable candidates was assembled quickly. Models suggested that the primary planet candidate could have its atmosphere be made breathable in less than a century and that the soil could be made farmable, though that would take a significantly longer amount of time.

All that was easy. The hard part came when it was time to select the people to fill the ark, as most of the people who knew of it called it. Some thought they should all be engineers, people who could manage the base well and troubleshoot mechanical problems the easiest. Others wanted a more balanced team that could manage all sorts of things, like the plants or the crew's health. A few politicians even suggested that the crew should be made of philosophers and artists to preserve Earth culture.

The decision was largely made for them though as two new problems surfaced. First, the cryogenics systems didn't develop as nicely as the others. Tests on people over 50 were catastrophic, with volunteers not lasting more than a few days before the tests had to be stopped for safety reasons. Further tests and calculations estimated that no one over 40 could survive the journey. To add onto the problems, volunteers with even average amounts of stress were much more likely to suffer heart attacks in their sleep state. The second problem was the elephant in the room that everyone tried to ignore for as long as possible. To continue the human race, the crew had to breed. But the ship could only hold six people, five women and one man to ensure long term species procreation. There would have to be incest just to create a third generation. Knowing that it had to be done, research was done on the science of incestuous breeding and it was found that only .0001% of the population had the genes necessary to sustain a healthy family tree.

With these two factors in mind, the most qualified candidates were identified from a short list. Most people who were involved in the decision wanted the candidates to be trained and debriefed extensively before the launch. However, the cryogenic scientists made it clear that the stress of knowing the fate of humanity was to be carried on their shoulders was far too much. The only plan that ensured the safety of the candidates was to sedate them in their sleep and put them into the cryochambers without even the slightest bit of warning or preparation.

Thousands of years later, the lights in the spaceship turned on. It had landed on the virgin planet just as the scientists and engineers designed it to. The cryochambers started their three day reanimation process, and once the crew members exited, they barely had a chance to speak to each other before a video played in the center of the room.

""Hello, I'm Dr. Baker. Welcome to Project Phoenix.""

***

This is obviously a long term prompt that will focus on breeding, and if the RP goes on for a long time, incest. However, this most likely isn't going to be a sex-focused RP. The main focus will most likely be on the characters themselves as they go through the emotions of knowing they're the last humans alive and the struggles that they'll face just to survive and deal with each other. I'm looking for realistic character development, with each one taking a different view on their situation. Breeding is the only truly necessary kink for this RP, but others can be discussed. Here's my [kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/ZTXuOUH.png) if you want to check it out.

Slayer made an album called South of Heaven. Washington incorporated a city called South of Kent.

But most of you know it as Auburn. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uzae_SqbmDE

Auburn can be reached by highway 18, which once boasted the title of most dangerous highway in the United States. That means those that lived made it to Auburn and developed a city. Like Mad Max.

And look no further than the burn pit at the Fireworks stand for the Thunderdome. Every year around The Fourth of July, people from all over the Puget Sound visit the Muckleshoot reservation to buy fireworks. I am told this is 70% of the Auburn economy. The other 30% comes from the trauma unit at the hospital. 

In most Washington cities, fireworks are illegal. Or, rather, the caliber of fireworks found at Muckleshoot are illegal. For 20 dollars, you can purchase the amount of gun powder used throughout the entire Civil War all wrapped up in a cardboard burrito and ready to blow your hand or hands off. 

From Whistling Petes to tennis balls full of gun powder, you are given a dirt lot to light off just about anything and just go nuts. Typically, ""just go nuts"" and tons of explosives are frowned upon in societies outside the Middle East. But in Auburn, it's encouraged. Fingers, limbs, and heads are blown off every year in order to elect a mayor last-man-standing style. 

But The Fourth of July is only once a year, so you'll need to go beyond Beyond Thunderdome for the equivalent outside of July: gambling. 

If you think losing your thumb and nose to a mortar rocket is painful, try losing your life savings to a slot machine based on a television show. Muckleshoot casino can offer you this. Price is Right, Wheel of Fortune, Star Wars - they all have slot machines aimed to make you think gambling is entertainment. And let me tell you something: if you win 300 dollars, then lose 400, then win 100, then lose 1000, then win 100 you are being entertained: through math.

Speaking of entertainment, Auburn is also home to Green River Community College: Home of the Whopper. You can get an AA, one menu item, and a soft drink for a student loan you'll have well into your AARP days. Keep telling yourself ""I'm transferring to the U next quarter"" as you take bong hits out of the potato gun you made last semester in Modern Art 101. Check out their Running Start program where you pay 500 dollars a quarter to intern at Taco Bell.

If you're like me, you like to kick back and watch a concert - what better venue than The White River Amphitheater. White River is becoming the go-to for top acts from music to comedy. You would think this would generate city sized crowds and you'd be right. You'd also think they'd have more than a one way dirt road in and out of the amphitheater - they don't. Let me tell you something: if you're going to see a concert at White River, you're essentially camping. Now you may choose to camp outside the theater in someone's yard or you can camp for seven hours in traffic on the road leading to Highway 18, either way you're camping.

But let's talk about lifestyles - what can Auburn offer you? Well, your cousin for starters. Do you want seconds? Auburn has a Waltons in Compton way of life that is rivaled by no other. Let's say you want to join a street gang, but you still love country music - Auburn has you covered. And boy do they: at any time in Auburn there's a 90% chance there is a gun drawn on you. This could be a gangbanger, survivalist, cop, hunter, teacher, doctor, priest, or an anti-gun protester driven to the final edge. 

In addition to wild west shootings, Auburn has an array of local fast food joints. These aren't just your everyday McDonalds or Burger Kings, these are independent burger joints that serve a great meal at a reasonable price. Just don't expect fancy city things like licenses or food handling permits.

Auburn is also the home of Washington National golf course, which is home to the UW men's and women's golf teams. So, you can see how that college thing comes full circle.

All in all, you couldn't find a better city to find yourself out of a job, divorced, and wiping with a flannel shirt in an Applebee's bathroom at 1 AM because they're out of toilet paper again.

53k8sa,1,2016-09-19,Some observations and conclusions. Let me know if I am correct or is it just wishful thinking.,koodlyak,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/53k8sa/some_observations_and_conclusions_let_me_know_if/,"I have been looking for a job for some time now and have observed certain trends. Just to be clear, I am a grad student looking for a job in the STEM fields (mostly CFD, Aerodynamics and stuff).

I get a rejection mail form some jobs within a day or so of applying, some jobs don't ever bother to change the status of my application and a couple of them have called me for an interview. From these I have drawn the following conclusions. Could you guys let me know if I am correct or not?

The jobs where I get an almost immediate rejection are those where my CV is rejected by a automatic filter (say scenario A). The jobs where I don't hear back for months are those where I might have passed the filter but have been rejected by a hiring manager and they don't update the status till either they find the person for the job or have identified potential candidates (scenario B). The ones where I had a phone interview also rejected me. One, outright on the phone because I did not have 1 year experience in an industry (intern exp does not count apparently) and another because I did not have the required coursuework/intern experience in one of the subfields of the job ( that is what I thought, or maybe I just didn't do well in the interview). 

So am I correct in my conclusions? I ask this because, I will try and find a pattern in jobs where I get rejected immediately and maybe try and tailor my resume better for those type of jobs. For scenario B, I guess there is not much I can do apart from maybe highlighting my skills and competencies better. Any advice is appreciated.

Roughly about 40 - 50 % of my applications are in scenario A, while the rest are in scenario B. I have had 3 interviews so far and I missed one interview because their mail went into my spam folder and by the time I realised, they had already selected someone. 

Thank you people."
53kc5h,3,2016-09-19,Need some happiness right now.,saaaaaadthrowaway,actuallesbians,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/53kc5h/need_some_happiness_right_now/,"Hi everyone,

I've never posted on here before but read all the time and you've all really helped me out with some stuff I've been dealing with before. I've also answered a few advice-type questions before so now I'm hoping you all might return the favor. But it's not necessarily advice I need right now...just some happy thoughts and encouragement that life won't be like this forever. Anything that might make me feel better because life is pretty much shit right now. A few big issues have come crashing down all at once and it feels like too much.

1)First of all, my ex broke up with me a few months ago. I saw it coming, and it needed to happen but even so I've been blindsided by a pain I didn't even know was possible. The worst part is the up and down part of recovery, which is apparently pretty common after a breakup....I've thought I was legitimately feeling better a few times since the breakup, but today I woke up, started sobbing immediately, and have been doing that off and on all day. It's almost 6:30pm. I feel just as bad as I did when I woke up this morning. I think about her and the fact that I'm alone now and it starts again. I don't know how to make that feeling go away.

2)All this is made even worse by the fact that I recently moved back to my hometown (for financial reasons) since an internship I was doing ended. I feel like most of my friends don't live here anymore so I don't even have a wonderful support system.

3)I'm putting tons of time and effort into looking for a job. I am getting more and more sick every day of the constant grind of searching for and putting all of this effort into applying for jobs I likely won't get (statistically speaking...though I'm putting everything I've got into applying and trying my hardest to stay positive.) I've got a bachelor's degree, a post-grad program in my field, some relevant work experience, and now a directly related internship under my belt. I only took the internship thinking it could help me get a full time position and all it did was reconfirm what I already knew--that I am totally qualified to be a full-time employee in this field, since I already had experience doing everything my ""superiors"" were doing. Yet I still haven't had any luck at landing a full-time job.

I'm just at my wit's end with everything. Part of me knows I could maybe speed up the process of healing from my breakup if I could date, even casually. But I plan to move for whatever job I get because there are really no prospects in my field here so I wouldn't want to start dating anyone now. 

I've been looking for love and a job both now for a couple of years, and I've got nothing to show for it. I feel like I'm doing everything I possibly can and still coming up short. I feel completely and utterly stuck. I can't move on in love, but I've got to get a job before I can get out of here and live my life in any respect, including dating or finding love.

This turned into quite the rant, so thank you for reading. I couldn't really explain why I'm feeling SO terrible without explaining my whole life situation and what exactly is holding me down. I've been thinking lately I'm getting better at rolling with the punches, but today really shook me. I've never been suicidal, but days like this (which are few and far between and I may have never had one this bad) make me understand a little bit why someone might be. It's a really miserable thing to feel like you're wasting your time and you should just give up, and that the road ahead is so long and grueling that you don't even want to try.

What I'd really love is some encouragement, maybe on the love side of things, or even the job side. Have you been here before? What did you do to get out of the mood? What motivated you to keep trying when things got tough? Give me all your wisdom please...I really need it.

Thank you all so much in advance

[This is the program.](http://www.sait.ca/programs-and-courses/full-time-studies/diplomas/information-technology-course-overview.php) I took the Computer Systems one. I've been working for a school district doing helpdesk/desktop support kind of stuff with a little bit of sysadmin stuff for a little over two years. The pay is average, the job is low stress, and I get a full pension. But I'm not happy here due to the location (small town Alberta). It's also so easy that I feel like I'm barely learning anything. It's really boring and I feel like I'm wasting my youth.

Just got back from a vacation to Europe and I decided I'm going to move there, particularly Scandinavia. I've learned that English-speaking IT jobs are pretty much non-existent in these countries. English-speaking programming jobs, however, seem to be in abundance. My programming knowledge is pretty basic. At sait I took a couple weeks each of: java, perl, html, css. I went into it with zero programming knowledge and didn't struggle at all, but I never got into object-oriented programming. 

Some questions:

There is a transfer option to a really nice University in Aarhus, Denmark, where I can transfer all my IT courses and have a degree in 1.5 years. There are two options that interest me: [Software Development](http://www.baaa.dk/programmes/it-and-technology/software-development/) and [Web Development](http://www.baaa.dk/programmes/web-media-and-communication/web-development/). I pretty much know for a fact that web development would suit me better, but is it worth taking that in university? From what I understand, web development falls under the software development umbrella anyway, so wouldn't I just want to take that regardless? Or would both degrees be a waste of money? One of my friends said that these both look like ""meme courses"", and he's been a software engineer for a few years now. 

What really catches my eye about these programs is that you get a guaranteed real-world internship. Unpaid, but I think it means you get a work visa in Denmark, something which is near-impossible for a non-EU citizen otherwise. This makes me want to take the program regardless of its content. Perhaps I'm overvaluing this. 

Say I got either of these degrees, are there any career paths where my IT skills could also be a huge asset? Such as server administration, network stuff, customer service skills, etc? 

I think I'm more interested in the web design aspect more than the technical aspect. I have a creative mind and a strong attention to detail. Those are probably my best skills. I'm imagining that the more artistic web jobs are much harder to come by and likely pay less. Is this assumption somewhat accurate?

I'm not too sure what sort of info I'm looking for. Would just like some opinions other than those I got from my friends. I have until March to apply for this school, so if I'm going for it I should probably start self teaching myself some stuff. 

Thoughts? Thanks in advance. "

I was also an intern for an entire year before that. Finally, I got notice that I will be schedules for a ""review,"" basically raise talks.

I know what I want, which is $10,000, but I am unsure on how to approach that request. I don't want to be too aggressive, which could possibly lead to an awkward aftermath, nor do I want to be passive.

Some background info- I am an Electrical Engineer, working in control systems in a business that is very specific(Even a experienced electrical engineer could not come in day 1 and do productive work without a lot of training). I started at $60,000 salary. The company is about 35 people, with about 10 engineers.

I've thought about the points I could bring up to back up my case. See below:

-I was an intern before I started full time. I was able to jump into designing and working on projects. Someone without that experience would have had to go a couple of months with training to be able to do that level of work I started day one.

-I graduated #1 in my electrical engineering graduating class(the 30ish that graduated with me.) I have a couple of friends I graduated with in the same major who started at 65, 70, 75k salaries. (Should I bring this up?)

-I've never taken a sick day off, even when feeling terrible, to avoid missing deadlines.

-I work with a handful of other engineers. Year to date, I have engineered more $'s(regarding projects) than any other engineer. Now this doesn't mean I'm the best(I'm not), but it is a feat. I have only been there for a year and a half, and I'm working on projects that are as difficult as a few people who have been there for 3-5 years.

-I know a very close approximation on how much each job pulls in profit-wise. Just a example, I engineered a couple of panels, these wren't too difficult, but it took me about 12 hours of work time. This project grossed about $110k in profit. Now, its not often those kind of profits are made so easy, but I easily make the company tons of profit every week. Should I bring these thoughts into the boss' office?

Should I even bring up the theoretical situation, if I left the workplace, to hire another worker and get them to the skillset I am now would take a huge amount of time and effort?

I am just so unsure of the approach i should take. Please help me out here! Sorry about the long post!"

Katheyn or what she preferred to be called Katy was the new intern at the company. A big industry in downtown Los Angeles that dealt with many movie, tv and rock stars. Basically, offering rich and famous people services to handle their careers while also giving fresh faced wannabes the opportunities.

Katy was one of them, a young girl that wasn't even 21 yet dreams of making it in music, becoming a world known star. She had tried numerous times and had many meetings with companies to try and get her talent across to no avail. Eventually the money she saved up from her part time job while she was in school dried up and she had to pick up a job in L.A she she thought why not a business in a similar field to her dreams.

Katy remembered when she walked into the office for the first time, people couldn't believe what she looked like and you think they would be accustomed to seeing gorgeous people all the time. She had worn a pair of red 6 inch stilettos and a tiny pencil skirt that would of been the shortest a woman could wear. Thigh high stockings that hugged tight to her legs that were held up by clasps attached to a garter belt. The tight blouse she wore strained her rather biggest assets, her double DD breasts that were pushed up in her black bra. They bounced around as she worked around the office, attracting the attention of many guys. The man Katy worked for was always delighted to see her, his eyes filling up with lust as he looked her body over before leading her into his office and shutting the door.

Katy regularly wore clothes that brung her attention, it was always another pair of 6 inch heels, short skirts and stockings accompanied by a tight low cut blouse. Guys around the office started to talk about Katy, about how they would love to ram her as she bent over their desk. Many guys often tried to get with her but she always refused.

Soon Katy developed a reputation for being a strong feminist supporter. She thought that all men were pigs for treating women as nothing more than a pair of tits and ass with a pretty face. That's how Katy felt in meetings, guys would get sidetracked around her and just stare at her boobs or ass. They wouldn't take her seriously and thought that she was just a slut. She thought that guys only chatted to her because they wanted to fuck her and weren't even calling her by name around the office, she overheard them calling her by her big tits.

Though what Katy did, didn't always match up with what she said. She would scold men for staring at her body when she wore revealing clothing everyday. She would also find every excuse to bend over to give everyone a good look at her, regularly dropping things on the ground. She would get angry at guys all the time for flirting with her as they obviously wanted to fuck her but she would flirt with guys all the time brushing her hand near their groin and giving them a sexy, sultry look as she walked away.

One day the CEO came to the office and went to a meeting room with about 30 other businessmen. They were all aged between 50-80 years old. After about an hour, Katy was called into the meeting room. Jason, a fellow coworker had a desk right in front of the room, he watched her strut in their, clad in her tight clothes. She closed the door behind her. It must of been 4 hours until the doors opened again, with the old guys walking out with satisfied looks on their faces. They talked about how great that was and how they must do it again soon. Out Katy stepped as they finally all left. Her hair was disheveled while she was fixing her rumpled blouse and rolling down her skirt while carrying her stilettos. As she walked she pulled out a curly hair from her mouth and wiped away a bit of stickiness from her lips. Going to her desk and continuing work like nothing happened.

----------

I want this role play to involve scenarios following the womens career such as trying to break into the industry (a lot of time spent as the secretary), dealing with the sudden fame, hook ups with celebrities, sex tapes, paparazzi, fans, relationships, becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol and turning into a nymphomaniac.

The prompt above doesn't have to be the start or involved in it... just an example of some writing.

Can be different and have a male celebrity and their journey. (Check out my 'Famous Life' posting in my post history for that)

I want to play the males the celeb will encounter. I want someone to play the main lead which will be the young female starlet. I would love for the young starlet to be Katy Perry or Kylie Jenner but I like a lot of other celebs as well such as Taylor Swift, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande, Megan Fox, Margot Robbie, Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Alba. Though.. the female celebrity can be an original character that is made up would love her to look like Madison Ivy or Lana Rhoades though also into Lindsey Pelas, Emily Sears and Claudia Alende.

I prefer to roleplay on Google Docs and use messengers to chat and set things up such as K , skype, yahoo msger and google chat/hangouts. Want this to be a long term rp

If you are interested and wish to talk about this further send me a message. Please make your message to me detailed and include any character/ scenario ideas, which celebrities you like and what platforms you use.

P.S Also have a recent posting in which I mention all the rp's and things I'm interested in for a long term rp, so check that out if you want, particularly interested in doing a Marvel Black Widow RP or a Post apocalyptic/dystopia world that is similar to Fallout.

Note: I change my objective per each position I apply for. It would help if I got some critique on how to make a better general objective statement (if I should included it at all.)

I recently graduated this past May and have been applying to jobs (mainly ""entry level"" IT positions) every week since and so far not a single company has contacted me.  It could be the high saturation of people with higher level education in my area and the fact that many huge IT companies and their headquarters are located where I live. 

I didn't do any internships and wasn't really involved in school organizations, so my working experience in IT is nothing and all I really have to show is my course projects.  I want to pursue a career in database or software engineering, but at this point I realize that with my lack of professional IT experience, I may have to start with help desk positions.

Anyway, I have shown my resume to multiple people in my related field and they have said that it looks fine.  I would appreciate additional criticism.

However, my boss told me I was still not allowed to work overtime because they couldn't afford me in their budget, but that if I needed to keep working (we are severely understaffed and my job expectations are through the roof, also because of other laws my boss breaks that makes me work even more), I would have to clock out and finish the job. Then my boss also tried to lie and say it was against the law for me to do overtime, even though it says I can on my new contract. This budget and lying things made me really angry, so I decided to file a complaint with HR. What is the most likely outcome of this?

There are some things I know for certain- I am ambitious, I am a romantic type, I care about my family, I like sports (both being active and watching them), so on and so forth. 

That being said, there are some large parts of my identity I am unsure of. I really like the idea of world travelling, but when I have done it twice I didn't even really have that much fun. I studied abroad in a summer program once in Hong Kong (about 1 month long), and pretty much was counting down the days until I could come home for a few reasons (home sickness, lack of comfort in new place, etc). I went to Asia this summer with my dad for a week, and also didn't even really like it (because he was annoying me and I also just kind of like home better to be honest). Now, due to FOMO (fear of missing out), I do want to study abroad for a full semester in Europe, but I'm not even sure if I would like it.

Secondly, I can't really decide which people I want in my life (or even the outlook in life I want). When I see some of my friends from way back, I literally have nothing in common with them because they have zero ambition, and have basically done absolutely nothing with their lives after high school ended. However, when I see people from university clubs and so on, I find that people can be pretty pretentious for their age and are taking life waaaaay too seriously. I can't decide whether to be the 'chill' guy who works at the gym during the summer, or going for banking internships where I will be pumping 80 hours a week out of myself.

Even my political beliefs are somewhat like this. I consider myself to be a very liberal person, and I get offended when many of my male friends have that 'good old boy' type of attitude that is somewhat sexist and racist. But when I have been in groups where everyone is very left wing I basically felt like a cowboy haha.

Most importantly, I have a devil's advocate type view of myself. I tend to view myself as opposite of my surroundings always. 

I am partially asking this question because I have some important decisions to make: the type of full time jobs I look for, whether to study abroad for a semester or do a demanding but rewarding university club, etc "

All these tools seem to do the same thing. Like it seems like they are all just environment setups for server. 

For example docker is a portable container, you can have a bash script that downloads all code and run your web server with some command, to deploy you basically have to push the image to the server and run the command, but ansible and chef seems to do the same thing too just configuring the server and running it.

I have learned a lot of basics in terms of networking, linux, microsoft server and others. Basically the course curriculum correlated with the following certs: CCENT, CCNA, LPIC 1/2, 70-412, A+. In terms of my resume, I don't have any certs yet, but I did have an internship this summer. They were called Interactive Intelligence, just got bought out by Genesys. Paid me $18/hr and paid for my apartment. I feel like that could be a solid on my resume since it was really my first tech job. Anyways, I would like to work out of state, but it's not necessary. So, where should I start??

This can be basic or in-depth answers, any knowledge anyone has will certainly help!!

Skip to the end if you don't care about the story/intro.

I went off to university in 2009 and fumbled around for several years as a CS major. I considered switching majors but decided that Comp Sci was the only thing that really interested me so I figured I would take time off and get a job while I figure it out. I felt like I was just wasting time/money and was stressing out for no reason. 

Truth be told, I was struggling in my courses but really didn't apply myself. I made it through gradeschool/highschool without ever really doing any work/study and didn't have the discipline to correct my habits in college. 

I managed to take quite a few classes like discrete math, DS/algs, basic programming (oop/java) but really started to fall apart in the higher-level theory classes. One class in particular led me to drop out, it was a programming languages / paradigms courses where we learned common lisp and explored functional concepts. I absolutely loved the class and topics but couldn't finish the first project because I wasn't far enough ahead in my math courses (we had to write a program to differentiate polynomials but I had barely passed pre-calc a semester before). At that point I was panicking and felt like a failure and couldn't imagine ever being able to program professionally without being stressed/anxious all the time.

Ultimately I dropped out and got an internship doing IT support which quickly turned into a fulltime job. It's a stagnant help desk position with pretty much no hopes of moving up internally.

In my free time I've been getting back into programming with the hopes of landing a simple mobile app dev job somewhere. I hate IT more than I ever could have imagined (most of it can probably be chalked up to the environment and work culture here but it's really turned me sour).
I figured I could create a few apps and publish to the playstore as a portfolio but as I dig deeper into the work I'm starting to second guess myself.

Basically, my issue is that I already know enough to be a competent programmer thanks to the courses I managed to pass and I want to be a true software engineer someday, not just the mobile app guy that throws a UI together and does some data binding to tie things up to a DB and call it a day.

**TL;DR** Do I have any hopes of landing an actual software engineering gig some day? Or can I expect to be relegated to web/app dev forever?

Going back to finish my degree is an option but I'm already 25 and would probably have to re-do most, if not all, of the courses. The Gen Eds would probably transfer but I'd essentially have to start from square one in CS courses."

53n3v9,1,2016-09-20,"I hate this job, and I don't know why I don't quit",musingsofmadman,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/53n3v9/i_hate_this_job_and_i_dont_know_why_i_dont_quit/,"I hate the job I'm in. This time last year, I knew I was going to be moving to a new city in late spring/ early summer of 2016. I looked at what my current job and skillsets were in, and realized that it was not going to be easy to get into that area in the place we were moving too; not to mention I knew I was going to have to move again at least one more time for my wife's career and my career field (at the time) was not much suited towards portability/ following your spouse.  So I thought long and hard and found a career path that made use of my current skills and training and took steps to make the transition easier.

The move is getting closer and I find out there is an opening in the my general career field in the new city were moving too. Seems like it could be a good fit. So I apply, interview, and then get offered the position. This seems great! I've got a job lined up for when we move, its in my current field.....then it goes down hill.

I realize that in the new hire paperwork that I had never discussed pay during my interview or offer period. (I'm relatively young , I work in government where pay is usually set due to policy and up until this point someone in the interview would say early in the interview process what they could pay me based on policies). I call up and try and discuss pay, its capped at what they stated. Its low. Very low. Its low for the position, its low for even the area we were moving too, its very low considering I have a masters and at least 2 years of experience in the field. 28k. But the benefits are decent, fairly good pto policy, and it will be good experience whether I decide to stay in government or move into another field. Thats what I tell myself.

I get to the new job and at first everything seems to be going well. The projects I'm told I'll be working on sound interesting. My co-workers are nice. The regular office hours are pretty awesome (7:30-3:30). All is going well.

Then the reality sets in. The projects they told me I would be working on, well there's a few caveats to that. The main project they discussed during the interview and in the first few days of the job, that's not really a main focus. In fact, were just going to reference that project and not really do anything with it or give you any guidance.  The other project that was mentioned, that the real focus. Also, no one really knows what to do with that project, is going to offer you any guidance or direction or expectation, you're going to have to be a rea ""self starter"". Also, there are some other functions to this job that we didn't mention.  On your third day here, were going to make you the accreditation manager of this program that's really important to us. We haven't had an accreditation manager in about a year, no one in the organization really knows anything about this program, and there is an annual report due in three months. Also- it will be at least two months before you'll get any real information on this when we ship you off to the training for this program. Oh, you have this other random responsiblity associated with this position because the person you replaced took on this position on their own for some reason. Have fun! Also you'll occasionally get emails from people asking about things and you'll find out that you are also in charge of a few other things randomly. Have fun!

The final nail in the coffin. Travel. We mentioned nothing about travel or irregular schedule in the interview, job description, orientation (or whatever passes as orientation) or anything in the first few weeks. Now I figured I might have to travel once in a blue moon for training, or an odd meeting, that sort of thing. I did not know that when certain parts of my job are ""activate"" I might have to travel for several days at last minutes notice. Our over night stay policies and per diem policies suck btw.

I deal with random job responsibilities, the potential for a lot of travel (at last minute notice), and little to no direction projects, for 28k a year, and I have a masters in this field. The final cherry on top, the janitor in my office building makes more than me. He's also an employee of the state, he's been here six months longer than me, and he makes 31k a year + comparable benefits , but his pto package isn't as good as mine but still decent. 

I really wonder why I took this job. Hindsight is 20/20 I couldn't of known about half the stuff that turned out to be shit in this job. I'm still not sure I would of turned down this job had I known all that was involved. Being able to move somewhere with a job lined up (especially after some higher than expected moving expenses and small emergencies that popped up). Now that those emergencies have been setteled, and finances are stabeled, and funds replenished, and reserves have been established , I wonder why I'm still at this job. Other than resume fodder/ job history (i'm young in my career and I took time out of full time work to do internships + my masters for the past 3 years), and the extra income, I don't know. We could live off of my spouses income easily, and I have money set aside (60k). It just makes me wonder. 

I hate this job. I want to quit. Sometimes the only thing that gets me through the day when I think about all the crap associated with my job (lack of direction, cruddy boss, random responsibilities, random last minute travel, extremely low pay) is the knowledge that I have a rip chord- if I really want to I can quit and be fine financially."
53n7p6,3,2016-09-20,Which job should I take?,kotisheu,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/53n7p6/which_job_should_i_take/,"Without too many details,  I am currently a college student studying computer science.  As if right now,  I have been working at an IT job for over a year,  and it's pays more than minimum wage to fix usually simple problems. The job is great for a college student,  and if I were to keep at it for the next few years, it would look pretty decent on a resume. 

However,  my dilemma is that though it is tech related, it's not really teaching me what I need to know in the future to be a programmer/ software developer. On that end,  I recently interviewed for a student software developer position,  which would teach me a lot of the things that I need to/ want to know.
While my ideal choice is working both jobs, my current boss doesn't want me to. 

So assuming I get the other job, I have two options: 

A. Stick with my current tech support position, a much easier job that would pay more for now and possibly show dedication and/or work ethic at a decently early age,  but not learn much in the way of programming

Or 

B.  Take the software development job that would teach me a lot for my (hopefully) future career, a much harder/stressful job that would pay less at first, but would give me a more programming oriented job/ skill set for my resume, as well as fill an internship requirement

*Both jobs have ~ the same pay cap,  it would just be a matter of if/when I hit it. 

Any advice? "

I'm a junior in college studying criminal justice. At least, I am for the moment. Since I was a kid, working in LE has been a dream for me. I got my associate's in CJ at my previous college, and while there I was selected for a campus safety officer internship program as well. To this day that's the best job I've ever had. We worked with some of the best officers I've ever met there, and it was a hell of a learning experience and a great time.

But I may not be able to go as far with this career field as I'd like. Due to some un-correctable vision issues, I'm pretty much ineligible for any ""field"" position. My plan had been to get into the probation/parole field until a few months ago, when I found out that said vision problems also meant I can't get a driver's license. 

I tossed around the idea of working in dispatch/evidence/analyst positions for a while, but realized it's just not quite the same thing. One thing that I learned from that security job was that I absolutely loved getting out there, meeting people, dealing with problems head-on, not sitting behind a desk. Also, in speaking with some folks involved with our state investigative departments, the vast majority of analyst or technician positions require some sort of ""field"" experience, which I can't get. 

I have a meeting with a career guidance counselor in two days to determine if I'm going to stay in the CJ program or try and transfer my credits to something else. I'd love nothing more than to stay in this field but it's pretty clear that things wouldn't work out well if I did.

I'm not looking for pity here, just felt that the post deserved a little explanation. You folks do a job that doesn't get enough respect these days. Even though I might not be able to do the same job I felt that a sincere thanks for what you do is needed.

53nf1u,10,2016-09-20,Slightly unrelated- does Uni prestige matter in the Big 4,Thranrond,AusFinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/AusFinance/comments/53nf1u/slightly_unrelated_does_uni_prestige_matter_in/,"Sorry if this is in the wrong sub! I didn't know where else to ask.

I'm in year 12 now and am deciding on which uni to go to. I'd eventually like to work in one of the Big 4 but I don't know which is my best pathway there.

I'm deciding between UniMelb, Monash, RMIT and Swinburne.

I've pretty much crossed UniMelb off my list though because of how bad I've heard the competition is there. My careers councilor (who definitely knows her stuff) told me only 250 internships are offered to the 1000+ commerce students. She also said a lot of comm students are graduating worried from there because they know they aren't going to get jobs as they don't have any work experience or overseas study.

Swinburne and RMIT are very appealing me to right now. They both offer guaranteed 12 month work placement (paid at Swinburne, not sure about RMIT). From what I've heard and the information I've read, work experience is invaluable to prospective students and I feel like it would be silly of me to let this go.

The counter side of this argument in my head is that I don't need a 12 month work placement to be in my course for me to do it. If I go to Monash (or Melbourne), I could still organise the work placement myself and do it on my own. I imagine this would not be easy (and very time consuming!) though.

My ideal situation is to obviously go to a Go8 university AND have work experience but I don't know how likely this will be.

What do you guys think? Do you possibly have any advice for me?"
53nghs,1,2016-09-20,Doing multiple searches on different sheets. How do I skip sections I already did?,gualdhar,vba,https://www.reddit.com/r/vba/comments/53nghs/doing_multiple_searches_on_different_sheets_how/,"I've got a workbook with sheets from three different years, and I'm trying to combine them into one sheet, but grouped by product number and sorted by year. This was previously done by an intern I worked with, but he was a science major and had little coding experience, let alone in VBA, so the code wasn't fantastic. Activated cells, actual copy/paste, etc. After cleaning it up as best I could I noticed a problem - he did a search of one year's sheet, found the same product numbers on other sheets and moved on. But the macro wouldn't look for products that didn't exist on the first sheet. We've got new products designed or obsoleted every year, so there are products that might exist in one year but not the others.

I'm trying to find an elegant solution to this. I need a way to show which product numbers are accounted for on the other sheets, so I can skip them in subsequent searches. I could do a .Find on the combined sheet for each product on the year sheets but it seems like overkill. Then I thought about italicizing the cells for matches I found on by-year sheets and skipping them on the next loops, but thought that wouldn't be very efficient.

I can't mess with the values on the original by-year sheets, but anything else should be fair game. Any direction would be appreciated.

I graduated with a BS in information technology a few months ago. I completed an internship as the last requirement for my degree. At my internship I was told that I would be hired on full time but the last day on my internship I was told that ""they aren't sure if they have the room/budget to keep me"". This put me in a bad situation because I had stopped looking for jobs because I thought I already had one. This was also a day before I left for annual training for 3 weeks for the Army National guard, where I would not be able to apply/interview for jobs. Upon returning from AT, I started applying for as many jobs as I could most via Indeed or similar sites. Since I was not working, I had a lot of downtime and was able to live off money in my savings. With this downtime i studied for my CCNA (I got my CCENT a year earlier while still in college). I started getting calls back regarding positions I had applied for, mostly for helpdesk positions. I also got a few call backs and scheduled interviews for positions that required a CCNA. I sat for my CCNA a few days before most of the interviews and I passed so this made my so much for valuable to them and I was going into the interviews with a lot more confidence because I was more qualified than what they previously thought. 

I had about 15 in person interviews in a span of 2 weeks. It was crazy but I knew I needed to do it. Since I had a lot of interviews, I then got more calls and requests for second interviews. 

Last week, I stared getting calls from company's I had interviewed with and starting getting job offers (a few offered me the position the same day I interviewed). 

I am now sitting in a position where I have about 7 or 8 job offers on the table where I get to pick and choose which ones I like/dislike. All of the positions are offering good money. Anywhere between 45K to 60K. Some are helpdesk positions and a few others are actually entry/associate level network positions. I am currently still deciding which job to take but it's nice having many different options and companies to choose from. 

I can't stress it enough, if you have downtime, STUDY!! Self learning can go along way and show a company that you are committed to your field. Also don't be afraid to apply for jobs you feel you are unqualified for. I have applied for numerous jobs I feel I am unqualified for and a few of those jobs have offered me positions. When you interview, sell yourself to them and tell them what you bring to the table without lying!

There is hope and you will find a job. Stick to it and continue to learn on your own. Hopefully this help if not motivates some of you looking for jobs. It's been a tough long run for me but it's finally over and i can finally pick a job that I actually want to do. GOOD LUCK!

tl:dr - if you are looking for a job and have downtime, study for certs and get them. Also don't be afraid to apply for jobs you feel you are unqualified for. "
53nss6,1,2016-09-20,Feeling discouraged. How hard is it to find a job after graduating?,serinxandar,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/53nss6/feeling_discouraged_how_hard_is_it_to_find_a_job/,"So this may seem like a very dumb question to many of you but I am feeling very discouraged lately at the jobs prospects after graduation. I am graduating spring of this next year. 

I got my first programming job for the school of education at my university. Many of my co-workers there were information systems majors this seemed odd that there weren't many other CS majors there. After working there and getting a handle on some basic web technologies I got an internship working at a startup where I have worked for 8 months doing work on their front and back end. They recently hired another intern that is an IS major. 

Now to the point of the post. This new intern has way more experience than me. Even though he is a junior he had an internship at a large company, has several impressive personal projects, and just seems like he is ahead of me in knowledge of technology. I felt similarly inadequate at my first job and now I feel even more so. 

I don't feel like I can compete with people like this for jobs because I have no time to work on any personal projects because I work over 20 hours a week and have 4 CS classes. My new coworker (and I feel like most IS majors) has 1 CS class and is otherwise is just taking business classes. This offers him way more time to go to events on campus, and work on personal projects. Basically what I am asking is, how much is experience weighed over technical knowledge ( algorithms, data structures, design patterns)?  Would it be better to try and find time to work on personal projects or use that time to study principles?"

I really think one of the biggest issues in this game is purely technical. 

I know so many people who wants to play this game but just can't or the FPS is just unacceptable. Many of those people have excellent computers. If you look at the technical support forums, every patch update theres always huge performance issues effecting many players. 

For us veterans, we will do whatever it takes to get this game running smoothy, but for new gamers, they probably won't spend much time trying to figure out how to optimize the game before switching to something like DOTA2. 

Lastly, the sheer number of bugs for a Blizzard quality game is unacceptable. I realize this is a FTP game, and that they probably have intern programmers working on many of the things. But the sheer number of issues is just disappointing and the time it takes to fix them is really concerning. It almost feels like WoW and Overwatch were made by a different company all together.

This is not meant as a rant, but to encourage discussion and get blizzard aware of the issues at hand. "

When I go into bios/uefi settings for my thinkpad and select to boot from usb, the screen goes blank and returns right back to the menu of the bios.

53oe24,3,2016-09-20,Conflicted with new internship teaching children how to code,cheeekyslug,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/53oe24/conflicted_with_new_internship_teaching_children/,"So I'm about a month into this new internship teaching 7-10 year olds how to code in Javascript in an afterschool program. This is with a 1-year old start up.

I am not getting paid for this, I do it because I thought it would be fun and it takes up my free time that I don't need. But I love the class I'm working with and I look forward to every time I come in.  The CEO dabbled with a paid internship, but he has never brought it up again. 

I work directly with the CEO in the afterschool program. He never gave me the company's shirt which makes the kids a bit intimidated to ask me questions. I never got to introduce myself, and just have me interacting with the kids. I don't like him very much, I feel like he's ingenuine to the kids and has big ego for starting a startup at 21.  

There's a lot of issues that make this very stressful and I am not quite sure how much I really enjoy the company itself:

1. I didn't realize this, but each kid in the program pays nearly $1000 for 15 weeks of coding. I thought the school was providing this service and all the funding had been done by the school. Remember, I don't get paid for this and there's 20 kids in the program. The school provides the computers so it was no expense on the company's part. The CEO is an unfinished business-management major too, so I'm just questioning if CS is really his passion. 

2. For one, the app that they're using times out, so if you're writing code, it will randomly restart. I remember this kid was so frustrated because he wrote 30 lines of code and it all disappeared. There is no Save button on this app, you can only save your work once. He keeps blaming the ""internet quality"" but I know it could be a potentially a bug in the app. 

3. Unprofessionalism by the CEO. We contact through text, he's always late, he makes me take the kids out to pass out snacks and for recess. Later down the road if I need a reference, I could already tell that he would definitely not be the most dependable person.

4. I always ask ""Is there anything you would like for me to work on next week?"" and he gives me the most blunt answer. I would enjoy try teaching the class on my own, since I have 4 years of science education experience and there's a lot of flaws in his lessons. None of the kids ever work on the coding assignments that he does and he expects kids to finish up 2 full pages of class notes in 10 mins. 

The company itself just seems disorganized. However, since I switched into CE recently, this is what I have to work with. I am currently applying for summer internships at the moment so I was hoping that this will give me something to talk about in interviews. 

How can I make this less miserable due to the CEO?  "

53ogtt,4,2016-09-20,Five years,where2go_fromhere,NarcissisticAbuse,https://www.reddit.com/r/NarcissisticAbuse/comments/53ogtt/five_years/,"Not sure where to begin, 
When I was 19, I started dating the person I thought I was going to spend the rest of my life with. I will call him J. He painted himself as this sad little puppy who lost his high school sweet heart after she cheated on him. The first two years we spent together were the happiest I had ever been. There were issues here or there, his ex would text him or school would be over whelming, but I thought we were happy.

2 years into the relationship, J's lies started to unravel when his ex confessed to me they had been having an affair for the past six months. He swore she was lying, trying to break us up. He said there was no proof, and he was right, there was none. So I decided to believe him, stupidly. At this time, he dropped out of school and could not keep a job. He must of gone through 5-6 jobs at this point. Six months later, he disappeared. Randomly, cut contact from me. I begged him to contact me, with no words. After some time passed, he showed up in my life again. He would come over tell me sweet things, we would have sex, and then he would leave. Eventually, we started a relationship again.

One day, months into starting again, while I was on a skype call for an internship meeting, my laptop crashed. I grabbed his laptop and restarted my skype call. While on this call, I found messages between him and several other girls. He had been cheating on me. Sexting women, slept with one.  I grabbed all my stuff and left. When he found out I left him, he started threatening to kill himself . He told me he knew he was mentally ill and needed help. So I stayed. I was scared of him killing himself. I really believed he would do it. I tried to leave several more times after this, all resulting in him threatening to kill himself. He would have violent outbursts at inanimate objects, but never at me. I watched throw a shoe at a laptop, throw a laptop out a window, slam his head into a wall, etc. He started believing in conspiracy theories and still could not keep a job.

In November of 2014, I found my father dead in the garage. He had a heart attack. I tried to save him but it was too late. He was my best friend.
At this time, I was diagnosed with panic disorder and PTSD and put on medication. I was pulling my hair out, I wasn't leaving my bed. Five months later, somehow, I manage still to graduate college. A week after I graduated, I found out again, that J was having an affair again. I kicked him out of my apartment and blocked him from every aspect of my life. I was a wreck, trying to put my life together after losing my father. I would have flash backs to finding him in the garage. I was at my wits end.

I dated someone else for about 6 months. We simply weren't compatible. J tried to contact me during this time. I did not let him. Eventually, J was taken to a mental institution. 

After I broke up my new relationship, I went off my medication. J contacted me again and told me all about his epiphanies and how he wanted to spend the rest of his life proving he changed. So I let him, I stilled loved him dearly. And for 6 months, we weren't the happiest but I thought we were stable. He kept a job the entire time and started talking about trade school. I would have days where I would just be so mad about everything he did in the past. I would find out lies he had told me. For example, I discovered all the beginning of our relationship was a lie. He cheated on his ex a multitude of times and then randomly left her one day, never even broke up with her. He started pursuing me, leaving his ex to believe he was cheating on her with me. He did drugs I never knew about. He did online stripping for a time. I would get so angry I would tell him I didn't want him in my life.

So now, here I am. Hes gone and he has starting dating an eighteen year old. He is 8 years older than her. I have started therapy and counseling. I'm a conglomerate mess because I don't know how to feel about it all. I ask myself if he will be much happier with her, if he really changed and I just couldn't get past all the history. He has tried to sext me a few times, so he has likely not changed. He has told me he is still in love with me but she makes him happy because they have no bad history. I'm just a mess and I'm trying to move forward and feel like I made the right decision. "

I'm a bit of a lurker on this sub, but decided to post because I need your advice ! 

I'm currently enrolled in a masters program in France (grande école). I have the opportunity to do a 6 month co op/internship next semester and I'd really like to do it in the US (I am a US citizen so I don't need a visa or anything) because I'd like to go back to the US when I finish my studies.

When I browsed this sub, it seems like talking to recruiters really helps when looking for an internship. Unfortunately I can't do any of that because I'm on the other side of the Atlantic. On top of that, I don't have a network in the US because I've been living in France for years now.

Also last time I was looking for an internship, I applied for a quite a few offers in the US that I had found on indeed.com. It didn't work (I ended up finding something in Europe though). I don't know if it was because my application was poor, or if the recruiter/algorithm didn't understand my CV (because the engineering system is different here) etc.
What is your experience with indeed ?

I am planning on starting my co op in January. Is it too late/early to start looking for opportunities ?

What do you think my strategy to find something should be ?


If it is relevant I'm looking for a 6 month co op in a tech company (small or big).

My kinks - Leather/PVC clothing, boots, rough sex, anal and assplay, big cock and cumshot, deepthroat, athletic girls

The RPs will involved most of, or all of, the above kinks. Limits - Hardsports, incest, anything under 18

Indecent Proposal - one of my favourites, all the details are here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3wyd43/34m4f_the_indecent_proposal/ - also I've combined this with the office roleplay in the past to some success so I would be interested in exploring this more, such as
* the intern gets a special offer
* staff member needs to make a deal to save their job

Office Muck Up - this worked out well, all details here - https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/3sfmkc/33m4f_office_mistake/

The Guitarist/Backing Dancer - In this one I'm backing you up, either your guitarist or one of your dancers. On this tour, there's a section of the show where you are basically singing on me, wrapped around me, dancing sexily in front of me. As the tour progressed we're getting hotter and hotter until the last night of the tour I whisper in your ear as you finish ""I want to fuck you tonight"" before carrying on with my job. This obviously lends itself to celeb play.

Escort Roleplay - I've had some great roleplays with this scenario - you are an escort and I'm your client. You can play anyone from a street hooker to a high class/exclusive/celebrity escort. I've also been exploring an 'Old West Brothel' RP - you'd play a girl working in a brothel above an Old West bar, your clients could be the sheriff, the mayor, an outlaw?

Stalker - I've been following you for a while, and watching you. That's the basic premise but we can work out the exact details. This could be quite a dark RP if we both wanted it to be that way. Do you know I'm watching? Are you enjoying it? Do I break in one night?

Damsel in distress - I have a log cabin in a remote mountain range. You get stuck on my doorstep after getting lost and racing to shelter from a snow storm. You have no choice but to spend the weekend with me, which isn't a bad prospect on first impressions as I'm a typical romantic novel woodsman - strong, sexy, fit etc.

A gym affair - I run a gym, you are a member. We're both married, but we are both crazy about each other. Ultimately this will end up with us in the gym after hours making use of all the equipment. Actually, I'd pretty much consider any roleplay that involves sex in the gym - sexy ladies in gymwear are a thing for me

Celeb Play - I absolutely love celeb roleplay and if my writing partner fully commits to the character, it can be amazing. Really open to anything with this one.

Unless you want to play yourself, or if we're doing celeb roleplay, I usually like the women in my RP to be picked from one of the following subs - AthleticGirls Hardbodies TrashyBoners FestivalSluts"

The reason I moved away from android app development is because I applied to a ton of companies and had a fair number of interviews, and the general consensus was that I didn't have enough experience or that my projects were not impressive enough or that I didn't have many published apps in the app store. To be completely honest, I never really liked android development, I was only doing it because I took a course on it in college and won the best-app award, but the more I did it, the more weary i grew and was simply not passionate about it and I am not willing to spend any more time on a sinking ship. I understand that to break into the Data Science field I need to start much lower and I'm okay with that.

Hi Reddit:

I met this girl at uni (computer engineering major ) while I was a sophomore and she was junior. I was madly in love with her for two years but nothing happened  between us,just close friends 

During that time I used to do her homeworks,projects ,study together (more like me teaching her stuff ),and did here graduation project as way of telling her that I'm madly in love with her.

Nevertheless i've never felt that I was even a close friend of hers,Never felt that I was important to her

On her birthday I bought her this expensive purse as a birthday gift and a cake ,but she never even got to eat the cake with me as she was busy with her ""other friends ""  so just gave it to her at the bus station 



Thinking of her was just too painful that I decided to never meet with her again once we finish working on her graduation project,I gave her lots of signals that was gonna happen,On the last day of school I gave her all of her stuff that I had borrowed,Then she started crying beginning me to keep that stuff with me.




Then she called me and asked me to attend her graduation dissertation I told her that I wont be able to,because I was doing my internship,Nevertheless I took a day off and went to surprise her(or at least that what I thought would happen ) she couldn't be less surprised,I got mad and left (using my internship as an excuse )

Then one month later she invited me to attend her graduation ceremony,So I went there for 3 hours hoping that I can take a pic with her,or say some sweet words to her once the ceremony is over

And once it was over ,she left so quickly that I couldn't even say Hi to her


Tow days ago she texted me with a funny meme and asked why we haven't talked in a long time !and then told me that she's moving to another city in two days,So naturally  I just asked her to meet up for the last time She said yes 

So i went shooing bought her this cute mug that i'm sure she would just love ,and a bracelet as a goodbye gift 

Today she stood me up ,And after I called her for more than 20 times 
she picked up and Said she's sorry but her friends surprised her and threw a party for her that she couldn't leave home (and her phone was with some of her friend ) and let's re-schedule for tomorrow (her last day in the city )) 

now i'm wondering what should I do ?Should I go ? or Should I just call it off (I'm really angry ) ?


Update:
Just to be fair to her ,just has almost never asked me for a favor.

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: My crush who became a closed friend that never appreciated anything I did for her,stood me up today and asked me to reschedule for tomorrow ,possibly it's the last time I'll be able to meet her as she moving    to another city /should I meet her?  "

I'm definitely studying, but I know I'm not as prepared as I should be for the interviews I have coming up.

I'd like to get a job that'll give me some exposure to Big Data, but I'm not taking Databases, Big Data, and Cloud Computing until next semester.  I'm worried I'll get stuck doing JavaScript or Ruby for my first job and then have an impossible time transitioning.

If I delay my graduation to December of next year, I could do another internship this summer and spend my free time doing interview prep and exposing myself to Big Data. It seems like a gamble but with potential for a huge payoff.

Thoughts?

53p97u,186,2016-09-20,You have a heart of gold,FollowtheBuzzards25,LetsNotMeet,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsNotMeet/comments/53p97u/you_have_a_heart_of_gold/,"A few years ago, I was walking down the boardwalk of Venice Beach; I was interviewing for an internship in the area and decided to grab some dinner and go shopping.

I did not have much growing up in life and to this day, am extremely sensitive to folks who are down on their luck and are mentally ill. I firmly believe that kindness can go a long way. As most Southern Californians know, there is a huge homeless population on the beach, complete with panhandlers as well as performers who hustle.  After dinner, I was heading back to the hotel I stayed at, and gave ten dollars to a man sitting in the shade with his head down;  In my opinion, he certainly appeared to be homeless.  A gray, shaggy beard, unkempt clothing, two large plastic bags beside him full of blankets, torn shoes, and sweaters, etc.  As soon as I dropped the money in his hat, he looked up at me, smiled a big cheeky toothless grin, and stated "" YOU HAVE A HEART OF GOLD.""  I smiled shyly, wished him the best, and walked on.

Twenty minutes later, I arrived at my hotel, reached my room, and   prepared for a shower.  My room was on the first floor, just the way I liked it - I also must mention that due to being younger and without financial help, I was obligated to choose a seedy hotel of sorts.  It was the kind with palm trees outlining the front, pink cemented walls, the more ""decorative"" type, if you will.  The way the room is situated, you walk in, the kitchenette is directly to your left, the bedroom is straight down the room, and the bathroom is past the bed and to the right.  Typical.  Routine.

I took the shower, put on my robe, and proceeded to go to bed, as my interview was the next day.  That night/morning, I woke up at exactly 2:45 AM to contents in the closet shifting (I had placed a few hangers with clothes prior to my shower.  At first I thought it was my imagination, but SOMETHING made me get up to check.  I can't pinpoint what it was, but I ALWAYS trusted my gut.  I got out of bed, walked over to the closet, opened it, and before my eyes is the SAME HOMELESS MAN I gave the money to!! At this point, I am obviously fucking TERRIFIED and screamed bloody murder!! The crazed look in his eye complete with that same toothless grin is an image that haunts me to this day.  

""I WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR HAVING A HEART OF GOLD.""

I hauled ass the fuck out of that hotel room in my robe, ran to the front desk, and told the clerk to call the cops.  All my valuables left behind, including my cell phone - believe me, I knew I had to get the hell out of there before God knows what would have happened.

The cops arrives on scene 5 minutes later and I was obviously in shock as to what just happened.  They proceeded to case my room and the surrounding area for the homeless guy, but minutes later they came back and stated there was no sign of him.  What they DID see, however, was a broken window with glass shattered both in and out of the room as well as a hammer right outside.  I heard NOTHING - i was in the shower, afterall.

My assumption is that he followed me back to my room after I gave him the money.  Venice Beach is crowded at all hours of the day and night, and I was regrettably not vigilant.  They never caught the guy, as he was most likely a roamer.

I suffer from terrible anxiety and panic attacks because of what happened, but feel much better now.   Please everyone, I strongly urge you to all to choose a SAFE and highly reputable hotel when staying the night somewhere, and check your closets, bathrooms, hallways.  Please look out your window and make sure there are no shady folks!"

53pais,6,2016-09-20,Angel's Fall,Channel_20_News_Net,Askasurvivor,https://www.reddit.com/r/Askasurvivor/comments/53pais/angels_fall/,"Breaking News gentle viewers!

It seems the good FR captain Duvalle has gotten a trifle too friendly with the angel woman he was appointed to escort. Our eye witness testimonies and long-range photos taken of Cpt. Duvalle's quarter's window show and confirm frequent instances of hugging, kissing, and other displays of affection public and private! One source even professes that the Captain at one point publicly bragged to the crew and the political appointee sent to oversee him that he was engaging in sexual intercourse with the angel.

Faithful followers of Rev. Alban, Archbishop of New York have expressed shock and disgust at Duvalle's actions, citing past reports of his inappropriate conduct toward women under his command as proof of his being a satanic incubbus sent to deflower the guardian angel of the Free Republic. More liberal sources have also put forward the theory that Duvalle is not a demonic seducer but has instead been trying to father a nephalim, an angel-human hybrid, in order to curry favor with the state and with God Almighty. These same proponents were sadly publicly flogged for heresy by angry crowds shortly after giving Channel 20 News their take on the issue. 

When asked if he at all felt as though his relationship with the angel represented conduct unbecoming of an officer, Cpt. Duvalle declined to comment and had our roving reporter forcibly ejected from his airship. No word yet on whether this has anything to do with the abhorrent slaughter of a kindly old Catholic schoolteacher and his students for just trying to follow their sincerely held religious beliefs, perpetrated last sunday by an FCC Smith graduate ""Creepy Chris"", or with the Monday night Massacre of New Rochester police officers by Chris and his accomplice, notorious blood monkey-in-chief Davey MacNeil. But our sources are calling it sure signs of a demonic plot to undermine the righteous cause of the Free Republic and its President. 

We'll have more details tonight as our roving reporter and armed intern team are given the go ahead to interview none other than Pres. William Bradford concerning how his administration plans to respond to Cpt. Duvalle's conduct and to the rash of killings perpetrated in FR borders. Tune in at 11!"

I want to know if any of you have solved this problem? And how you went about it. I want to be able to take he data and compile it into heat maps or another format that would make the information more digestible so we can see what is working and what isn't. 

Google hasn't really helped me much, but maybe I just don't have the right scope. Hence why I am coming to you. I am currently using inpage analytics to help with some of the digestion, but it is only working for one test and doesn't know the difference between our a/b tests.

I am a graduating college senior (who has a shaky understanding of taxes), and just received a job offer, which includes a signing bonus. The company told me that the signing bonus would be paid after my first 2 paychecks; my concern is about taxation of the signing bonus under these circumstances:

The only income I had this past year was over a summer internship (I made about 15k total over the internship), and if I receive part of the signing bonus now, I figure I may be taxed at a lower rate since I'm still a student... is this correct? If so, how would I calculate how I would be taxed on the signing bonus if I received some of it now vs receiving it in lump sum after I start?"

I will call him J. He painted himself as this sad little puppy who lost his high school sweet heart after she cheated on him. The first two years we spent together were the happiest I had ever been. There were issues here or there, his ex would text him or school would be over whelming, but I thought we were happy.
2 years into the relationship, J's lies started to unravel when his ex confessed to me they had been having an affair for the past six months. He swore she was lying, trying to break us up. He said there was no proof, and he was right, there was none. So I decided to believe him, stupidly. At this time, he dropped out of school and could not keep a job. He must of gone through 5-6 jobs at this point. Six months later, he disappeared. Randomly, cut contact from me. I begged him to contact me, with no words. After some time passed, he showed up in my life again. He would come over tell me sweet things, we would have sex, and then he would leave. Eventually, we started a relationship again.
One day, months into starting again, while I was on a skype call for an internship meeting, my laptop crashed. I grabbed his laptop and restarted my skype call. While on this call, I found messages between him and several other girls. He had been cheating on me. Sexting women, slept with one. I grabbed all my stuff and left. When he found out I left him, he started threatening to kill himself . He told me he knew he was mentally ill and needed help. So I stayed. I was scared of him killing himself. I really believed he would do it. I tried to leave several more times after this, all resulting in him threatening to kill himself. He would have violent outbursts at inanimate objects, but never at me. I watched throw a shoe at a laptop, throw a laptop out a window, slam his head into a wall, etc. He started believing in conspiracy theories and still could not keep a job.
In November of 2014, I found my father dead in the garage. He had a heart attack. I tried to save him but it was too late. He was my best friend. At this time, I was diagnosed with panic disorder and PTSD and put on medication. I was pulling my hair out, I wasn't leaving my bed. Five months later, somehow, I manage still to graduate college. A week after I graduated, I found out again, that J was having an affair again. I kicked him out of my apartment and blocked him from every aspect of my life. I was a wreck, trying to put my life together after losing my father. I would have flash backs to finding him in the garage. I was at my wits end.
I dated someone else for about 6 months. We simply weren't compatible. J tried to contact me during this time. I did not let him. Eventually, J was taken to a mental institution.
After I broke up my new relationship, I went off my medication. J contacted me again and told me all about his epiphanies and how he wanted to spend the rest of his life proving he changed. So I let him, I stilled loved him dearly. And for 6 months, we weren't the happiest but I thought we were stable. He kept a job the entire time and started talking about trade school. I would have days where I would just be so mad about everything he did in the past. I would find out lies he had told me. For example, I discovered all the beginning of our relationship was a lie. He cheated on his ex a multitude of times and then randomly left her one day, never even broke up with her. He started pursuing me, leaving his ex to believe he was cheating on her with me. He did drugs I never knew about. He did online stripping for a time. I would get so angry I would tell him I didn't want him in my life.
So now, here I am. Hes gone and he has starting dating an eighteen year old. He is 8 years older than her. I have started therapy and counseling. I'm a conglomerate mess because I don't know how to feel about it all. I ask myself if he will be much happier with her, if he really changed and I just couldn't get past all the history. He has tried to sext me a few times, so he has likely not changed. He has told me he is still in love with me but she makes him happy because they have no bad history. I'm just a mess and I'm trying to move forward and feel like I made the right decision."

I have a question for all of you, like many of you i learned to code on my own, i had programming classes but they honestly all sucked i was never able to learn anything until i started doing internships and building funny stuff like surprises for my GF in my website.

I already do a good amount of money and every month i can really see how much i learn and improve just by looking at my old commits but here is the problem: I've been ""studying"" for almost 7 years now a major in information technology and communications engineering at Mexico ITESM university which is ""one of the best"" but extremely expensive.

I hate it, i have to pay around 5000 usd per month just for the semester and i have failed classes like english, software development fundamentals, databases fundamentals, etc... i re-took most of them and passed but the problem is still there, i have to take classes like entrepreneurship 101, finance, accounting, ethics(which i actually like), an ITIL, project management fundamentals, etc... and i cant but feel frustrated because in two months i have to deliver a new feature on my job and pass an exam online about ""advanced ethics"", i still need to pass 11 courses and do social service which is about 300 hours, also i have to do again an internship because i haven't graduated and the other four i did the past years are no longer valid because i haven't graduated yet.

My mother calls me a ""disappointment"" because i haven't finished and she doesn't trust me on anything i want to do with my life, I'm already 23 years old and i pay my stuff at least for the past year. she doesn't want me to drop out because she says that without a degree I'm nothing and i wont have security in the future but the companies that i had applied in the past wont even ask me if i have a degree i just pass their exams and show them my silly weird projects and they want to have a chat with me.

What should i do? is it true that without a degree i'm a worthless piece of human garbage and i wont be able to carry out anything in the future? what can i tell to my mother about this? she wont listen to me and the problem with this AND THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT is that even though i want to drop out i cant because she works at the university i study and because i'm no longer living in that city she just pays the inscription and then charges that money to me...

i'm very frustrated because i cant just drop-out without starting a family fight...

the director of my major and my mother are insisting on me to quit my job and go back to study but it was hell i was not happy, i was not learning anything, i was not earning anything!!!!

pls help...

These might be the last words I ever write. I can already feel it, the savages tearing apart my simulacrum. Soon, they’ll have access to my wine cellar. It was once a joyous place of celebration, but now it’s my last stand. A couple of my friends stand by me, prepared to fight to the death. As the humans begin to enter my Wine Cellar, I remember the events that started this plight.

My realm has always been a place for monsters and animals to harmoniously coexist. Humans were welcome in the realm as long as they kept the peace. They had their own realm called a nexus, but some humans preferred to stay in my realm. The pirate brothers Dreadstump and Jon were two of my best friends, so it’s no surprise that they accepted my offer to permanently stay in my realm.

Then, there was the famine. Hundreds of my subjects started starving to death. It wasn’t long before we learned that the cause of this famine was that some of the humans were stealing massive amounts of  food to sell oversea to other lands. My most trusted advisor, Shaitan recommended that I close the realms immediately and banish all the humans for disturbing the peace and causing the deaths of thousands of monsters. I was foolish enough to ignore his advice. Instead, I set up a screening process to see which humans were smuggling suspicious crops.

Two of those humans, Alex and Rob were caught stealing our food in masses, using 24 enslaved drakes to carry them. They were promptly banished, and told never to return. Little did we know, they would come back. 

For the next few years, the peace was maintained. Then, my intern Craig reported an issue on the beach. He said something about starvation and murder, so I sent one of my two simulacrums there. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. The humans, Alex and Rob had lead a group of humans here. 6 of my guards lay dead while the humans pilfer the remains of their weaponry. Then, my simulacrum flashed and it was decapitated.

I sent Hermes, a swift moving god to contact the humans for an explanation. I wish I knew what happened to him, but he never returned. The only thing I received from him was a poster of me. “Realm of the Mad God - Live Action Game - Try to kill the Mad God and his minions!” I was furious. I issued an order to kill all hostile humans in the realm, and use them as food, since our regular crops were no longer available.

They came, wave after wave. Each time, the humans took more of my realm and murdered more of my gods. I tried calling for a ceasefire, but they were ruthless. They killed some of their own kind, the pirate brothers. They even went out of their way to aggravate the stronger gods to kill their allied humans - just for fun.

At last, my realm was stripped bare of all its inhabitants. The desolated areas that remained were plundered by humans, searching for my castle. I needed to end this. Using all my power, I created a magical current that transported all of the humans into my castle.

My stone guardians tried their best to talk to the humans, to convince them that they were wrong. Instead, they were met with a flurry of swords and projectiles from various different weapons. Janus tried to show them the different paths and their outcomes, but they chose destruction. After they entered my chamber and destroyed my simulacrum, they were prepared to enter my wine cellar.

My wine cellar was specially designed so that only the invited guests could come in, if they owned the wine cellar incantation. I never expected that the holders of the incantation would be killed and that their incantation would be stolen. 

The last of the humans were sharing laughter as they took down one of my Henchmen. They would even laugh when one of their fellow teammates died. Alex and Rob were behind them, with a smug look. That’s when I realized...

They didn’t understand. Besides for Alex and Rob, they never knew the truth. To them, it’s just a game. To me, it’s fighting for my life, fighting for the land where I used to rule, and fighting for my friends, who boldly tried to stop the invaders. They were just pawns of Alex and Rob, the true evil ones. It was far too late to convince them of this though.

When I was finally beaten back, I heard a voice yell “Stop!”. Alex and Rob were walking toward me slowly. I braced myself for the final kill, but instead, Alex whispered in my ear. “You have made me too much money, and I’m not letting you die now.”

#Epilogue - 6 years later

It’s been a long time since I’ve seen any light. I’m given the minimal amount of nutrients to survive, and forced to work. It’s painful, being forced to recreate simulations of my friends that have already died. I watch sadly as mirages of Jon and Dreadstump were slaughtered over and over. I wish I could die, but I’m cursed to do this for an eternity. Alex and Rob have been gone for a while, but they were replaced by many others - Dashahead, Zbornox, Tiffytiff, Nullbot, Buffsoulja, Arbiterz, KoalaP, and most recently Sileex. A tear drops from my eyes as I witness the illusion of Shaitan, dying once again - and know… this is forever."

I have had 3 internships at prestigious companies in generalist software engineering roles. Now that I'm about to finish university, I find myself in an interesting situation.

I currently have a job offer as an Application Security Engineer at a top company in the Bay Area as well as generalist new grad Software Engineer offers at a few other companies in the same location with similar compensation and prestige.

At face value, I think the decision is obvious: take the security role! But I have a few concerns that I want to address before I feel comfortable signing any offer:

1. My prior industry experience has been in generalist software engineering roles. My strengths lie in crypto (mostly through graduate level classes), pentesting (through war games), and malware analysis/reversing/exploit development (through personal projects). The AppSec role is mostly doing web app security, which is an area within security where I'm weakest but certainly not incompetent. I'm terrified that I'll show up to work and be way out of my depth, although I don't doubt my ability to learn quickly on the job. 

2. The company is big but the application security engineering team is quite small, &lt;5 people. Unfortunately I get the impression that this company does not place a big emphasis on security of their product as they are heavily focused on growth right now, and so security engineers are perceived as barriers which can slow down their development cycle.

3. What happens if I want to pivot out of the security engineering role and move towards more general backend SWE roles? At this point, my only experience with non-security SWE work will have been my 3 internships. I fear that after 2-3 years in a security role , my internships will become much less relevant to getting a SWE interview. Furthermore, I fear that as a security engineer in a specialized role I'll lose out on knowledge of industry best-practices that SWEs typically pick up in their positions.

4. There seems to be a lot of variation between security roles at tech companies. I've seen ""Information Security Analyst"" roles which seem to be ""checkbox compliance"" roles which require little technical legwork, and I've also seen ""IT Security"" type jobs. I am trying to avoid like the plague. I'm mostly interested in ""Application Security Engineer"" and ""Software Engineer in Security"" roles; but at this point, it's unclear to me that there is a difference between the two. Is there any difference?

Any help or advice is greatly appreciated."

Took a hit and played video-games for about a half hour. Knock on the door. It's the police, ohshit.jpg. Open the door, was super honest and straightforward with them. I have never been arrested and my record is squeaky clean. They respected that because after taking the remainder of my weed, they were generous enough to let me off with a ""don't let us see you doing this shit again"" type deal. They gave me a good scolding, but the police simply confiscated 2 grams from my dorm room, and left me to reflect. I was not told I was being charged with anything. The police merely told me that my name is in their system now and if they catch me with weed again they will be less forgiving.
Later, the RA's on duty came by to write up the incident, and I was just as honest with them as I was with the police. About a week went by, and I got an e-mail telling me to meet with a community director to discuss the whole ordeal. I had the meeting and all went well, and then he told me that since it was drug related that he had to forward my case onto student life, where I will discuss the events again and be issued my punishment.
I have the meeting with student life in a week's time, but I was hoping to learn from other Spartans' experiences in these types of situations.

My question: Considering I was not charged with anything through the police, what is a punishment I am likely to receive from Student Life? Perhaps a class? Writing a paper about the incident? Or something more severe, like losing financial aid? 

PS: I am a broad business student and have been on dean's list since my freshman year. I have never been written up for misbehavior during my entire stay here, until now of course. Additionally, I have had 2 internships and can prove on paper I'm not a useless stoner.

Last year, of the three interviews I did receive (out of ~40 applications), I did get offers from all three (decent, mid-sized) companies so I think I am interviewing fine. This year, so far, I've interviewed and received offers from two companies, but out of about 30 applications. What can I do to get noticed and get an interview by the target companies I'm after? "

I plan on getting a CompTIA security or networking certification during winter break. Since I don't have any job or experience to claim on my resume, what are other skills, apart from CompTIA, I can learn and put on it? What things can I put that will make a potential employer go ""hey, even though this kid doesn't have experience, he has these certifications and skills. Maybe I should hire him.""

Anyway, I'll give you a little background. I always struggled with some depression and issues of self-image. And when I got to college, it became much worse. It got so bad at one point that I started walking around downtown looking for the best building I could jump off of. I just barely kept up with my classes while struggling with a sadness that I could not determine the source of. If you talk to me on the street, you would have no idea that I was struggling with this. When I'm with people, I'm usually energetic and I make people laugh.

Anyway, I'm three years deep into college with a major that I am figuring out I am not smart enough for. As I see these professors writing abstract formulas on the board that I can not comprehend no matter how hard I try, and I see everyone around me surpass me in intellect, it's becoming too much. Every time they hand me the test, I completely blank out. It's a major for programming, and I like to code in my free time, but as we get into the more complex stuff I quickly realize I am a one-trick pony. I can only do the basic shit, nothing the employers want.

And it's all catching up to me. I am on academic probation. I have not told anyone about this. If I do bad this semester, I'm done. And unfortunately, my classes have gotten even more difficult and I am having even more trouble keeping up. I lose my full ride scholarship, lose all my college opportunities, I have to move back with my parents, and I lose something else...

I have an extremely good paid internship that I would get kicked out of. I would be kicked out and put right back at a shitty retail job I despise. I have bad anxiety everyday thinking about the future. I know I would be absolutely devastated if I lost all of that. My future would be gone. Everyone in my family would be disappointed in me. All my friends would surpass me.

But that's not the sole reason why I'm thinking about it. There's more.

I am just disappointed in everything. Life is not what it is shaping up to me. I had this great fantasy in my head and it's just all turned out to be shit. I lost my virginity recently, and it actually made me more depressed. I was completely disconnected from the entire act, feeling like shit, having that ""Is this it?"" feeling like I have with everything. I have no motivation to do anything, even play video games, because I know it's just going to disappoint me. It's hard to go on like this.

In a way, it feels like my life has led up to this. Things are in order in some fucked up way. I've been seeing a girl and she brings a small glimmer of joy to me, enough to keep me going a little bit. We both agreed that we shouldn't be a couple, but we still do ""couple"" things like go out to eat together and cuddle. She may be the only thing I'm not completely disappointed by. But I'm sure that's all going to be over soon.

After I (probably) fail out of school at the end of the semester, go through Christmas, and have one last hurrah at New Year's, that's when I want to do it. I'm really looking for any other way out than what I want to do. I know there would be people who would be hurt. I'm just saying I want to do it, I don't know if I would actually go through with it. But I'm scared to death that after it all comes crashing down, my future self is going to make the decision easily.

I need help."

I currently work as a Sr. Desktop Administrator.  Been doing it for 4 years at my current company and getting bored of it.  My manager has been pushing (or so he says) to get me promoted to Lead for over a year now.  Still waiting on that....

Overall, I have been doing Help Desk / Desktop Support for 16 years now.  Because of that, I've started to think about my future....don't want to be stuck doing this forever.  

I've always been interested in system/server administration, but in each company I've worked in, I've never had the opportunity to click with the admin group or get trained on how it works in the company environment.

I've known the Windows admin in our office for a while now and he's a cool dude.  I talked to him a few months ago about my thoughts of moving away from desktop into system admin work.  But at the time, I told him I'm not interested in leaving my current role.  So today, I asked to him if I could shadow him for 1-2 hours a day on what he does and his role in our company's environment.  He told me he was cool with that. 

But during our conversation, he mentions something that caught me by surprise.  He told me that his manager and him have been looking for someone to fill body count (I'm guessing work overload or not enough staff) and he could talk to his manager about bringing me on as a Jr. Admin.  I never expected him to say that.  I was only looking to shadow since I don't have any experience in the field.  He said that's no problem because they currently have an intern that's been working with them who was just offered a FT role.

The dilemma I have is my manager.  My team is currently training for the CCNA.  Each one of the team members gets 2 hours out of the day to train for it.  But for me, I'm starting to get bored of it (I don't think it's the CCNA, more the instructor in the videos we're watching).  I told him before in our 1-on-1s that I'm interested in system / server administration, but it's been a while since I've told him.  So for this, I didn't mentioned anything to him about shadowing one of the admins.  

I want to shadow the Windows admin during my training time.  My manager might get some vibe with me shadowing that I might be moving on from his team.  Without giving him that hint, how can I get away with shadowing the Windows admin?  What do I tell him?"

Wednesday: Study, fap, study, fap, study, fap.

Thursday: Take tests. Damnit, I shouldn't have fapped this much. Well I dug a hole this low, fap.

Friday: I feel like a piece of shit. How do I pick my self back up? 

It's literally just when I have serious things to do. I end up just desiring high level escapism for a moment that ends up being hours and it's really bad. Sometimes when I have a regular week I can go almost all week without a relapse. I still work on a regular week. Go to class, go to my internship, go to the library. I'm pretty normal. It's beginning to be more stress-induced procrasturbation than anything. Irrational too. If I just studied those hours, I'd probably ace the test.

One thing I have noticed is that I have become uninterested in almost all porn to the point I spend 3 hours finding one I even want to fap to, so the procrasturbation ends up way longer than desirable. My reptilian brain kicks in because my human brain is stressed and nearly lets it.

I don't expect to really get hired based on the fact that I went here, so I'm trying to focus on doing things in my free time as much as possible. I've started my own personal projects on various things. Basically dabbling with all sorts of things to see what I like and eventually making some small things I could post in a portfolio. I am also considering internships. 

My big question is; are personal projects looked at as being better or internships in terms of being hired? Currently I'm thinking of going into software engineering, but I don't really know much about what all there is in terms of job opportunities and what they're like for other fields. My school has thus far only taught us about software development in terms of a professional career and my school doesn't have CS classifications, it's more focused on broad skills.

My main concern with internships is that as it stands I will be having to graduate school a semester late, and if I take a summer internship I'll have to graduate a year late. I'm not sure how much an employer would weigh that in considering whether or not to hire me. I feel like if an employer saw that someone took five years to graduate without knowing the context they wouldn't consider them very highly compared to someone who did so in four years; however maybe I'm just being paranoid.

Any and all advice is greatly appreciated!

Edit: I'm also curious, when giving out my GPA for internships, are they looking for my overall GPA, or my specific CS GPA? If it's unclear what I'm talking about I'll try to clarify: When I view my current academic standing I have two different GPAs visible. One is my overall GPA that accounts for my CS courses as well as my general education courses plus any other classes I have taken in the past. While my CS GPA is specifically my GPA when accounting for the CS courses I have taken. I would very much prefer to give my CS GPA as it is substantially higher, however I don't want to give them the wrong information and end up being in a bad position when they say that I've unwittingly lied to them."

A big industry in downtown Los Angeles that dealt with many movie, tv and rock stars. Basically, offering rich and famous people services to handle their careers while also giving fresh faced wannabes the opportunities.

Katy was one of them, a young girl that wasn't even 21 yet dreams of making it in music, becoming a world known star. She had tried numerous times and had many meetings with companies to try and get her talent across to no avail. Eventually the money she saved up from her part time job while she was in school dried up and she had to pick up a job in L.A she she thought why not a business in a similar field to her dreams.

Katy remembered when she walked into the office for the first time, people couldn't believe what she looked like and you think they would be accustomed to seeing gorgeous people all the time. She had worn a pair of red 6 inch stilettos and a tiny pencil skirt that would of been the shortest a woman could wear. Thigh high stockings that hugged tight to her legs that were held up by clasps attached to a garter belt. The tight blouse she wore strained her rather biggest assets, her double DD breasts that were pushed up in her black bra. They bounced around as she worked around the office, attracting the attention of many guys. The man Katy worked for was always delighted to see her, his eyes filling up with lust as he looked her body over before leading her into his office and shutting the door.

Katy regularly wore clothes that brung her attention, it was always another pair of 6 inch heels, short skirts and stockings accompanied by a tight low cut blouse. Guys around the office started to talk about Katy, about how they would love to ram her as she bent over their desk. Many guys often tried to get with her but she always refused.

Soon Katy developed a reputation for being a strong feminist supporter. She thought that all men were pigs for treating women as nothing more than a pair of tits and ass with a pretty face. That's how Katy felt in meetings, guys would get sidetracked around her and just stare at her boobs or ass. They wouldn't take her seriously and thought that she was just a slut. She thought that guys only chatted to her because they wanted to fuck her and weren't even calling her by name around the office, she overheard them calling her by her big tits.

Though what Katy did, didn't always match up with what she said. She would scold men for staring at her body when she wore revealing clothing everyday. She would also find every excuse to bend over to give everyone a good look at her, regularly dropping things on the ground. She would get angry at guys all the time for flirting with her as they obviously wanted to fuck her but she would flirt with guys all the time brushing her hand near their groin and giving them a sexy, sultry look as she walked away.

One day the CEO came to the office and went to a meeting room with about 30 other businessmen. They were all aged between 50-80 years old. After about an hour, Katy was called into the meeting room. Jason, a fellow coworker had a desk right in front of the room, he watched her strut in their, clad in her tight clothes. She closed the door behind her. It must of been 4 hours until the doors opened again, with the old guys walking out with satisfied looks on their faces. They talked about how great that was and how they must do it again soon. Out Katy stepped as they finally all left. Her hair was disheveled while she was fixing her rumpled blouse and rolling down her skirt while carrying her stilettos. As she walked she pulled out a curly hair from her mouth and wiped away a bit of stickiness from her lips. Going to her desk and continuing work like nothing happened.


-----------------

I want this role play to involve scenarios following the womens career such as trying to break into the industry (a lot of time spent as the secretary), dealing with the sudden fame, hook ups with celebrities, sex tapes, paparazzi, fans, relationships, becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol and turning into a nymphomaniac.

The prompt above doesn't have to be the start or involved in it... just an example of some writing.

Can be different and have a male celebrity and their journey. (Check out my 'Famous Life' posting in my post history for that)

I want to play the males the celeb will encounter. I want someone to play the main lead which will be the young female starlet. I would love for the young starlet to be Katy Perry or Kylie Jenner but I like a lot of other celebs as well such as Taylor Swift, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande, Megan Fox, Margot Robbie, Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Alba. Though.. the female celebrity can be an original character that is made up would love her to look like Madison Ivy or Lana Rhoades though also into Lindsey Pelas, Emily Sears and Claudia Alende.

I prefer to roleplay on Google Docs and use messengers to chat and set things up such as K , skype, yahoo msger and google chat/hangouts. Want this to be a long term rp

If you are interested and wish to talk about this further send me a message. Please make your message to me detailed and include any character/ scenario ideas, which celebrities you like and what platforms you use.

P.S Also have a recent posting in which I mention all the rp's and things I'm interested in for a long term rp, so check that out if you want, particularly interested in doing a Marvel Black Widow RP or a Post apocalyptic/dystopia world that is similar to Fallout.

Apologies to those who I left behind after my last prompt, I got extremely busy! If you're reading this, feel free to recontinue our past prompt or start anew with this one.

Typically I roleplay by posting a long prompt and hoping someone builds off of it, however I'm feeling particularly lazy. So instead of me writing a nice long, steamy prompt, I'd love it if YOU wrote one out. Below are ten mini-prompts. Each one has a little to offer, and I want you to build upon one of them. Essentially, send me a prompt based off of one of the mini prompts below! In your message, please include your kinks, your limits, and your name/age.

Please don't take too long on the prompt, but also please don't send a small amount either! I'll be content with 2-3 paragraphs, but will always read however much you'd like to put into it. All of these themes must include one kink: Expansion/transformation, but other kinks can be discussed!

1) As a newlywed couple, you and I decide to take our first honeymoon aboard a lavish and large cruise ship. This boat has all the amenities anyone can imagine; massive pools, relaxing spas, and even a tennis court. However, there's something awfully peculiar about this cruise ship...

2) Uh oh, a dirt biking accident gone wrong. You've broken your right arm, and you're now in the hospital being waited on by a beautiful staff of nurses and doctors. That's when you notice this hospital doesn't seem... normal.

3) You are the high chief of a small, pagan tribe within Scandinavia. You hate that bogwash of religion and mysticism until you meet an occultress who wields sorcery beyond the scope of imagination.

4) The Brew Pot, your favorite place to get your morning coffe. It's a bustling cafe mixed with cute barista's, a lovely smell, and the best tasting coffee you've ever had. Things do get weird, however, when they change the recipe to their dark roast blend...

5) You are a young casanova living at the height of your life in downtown Manhattan. Young, hung, and beautiful; you really have it all going for you. Your only weakness? Women who are extremely beautiful but batshit crazy. Your most recent girl is a firm believer in astrology and pagan rituals and brings you to a... strange part of Manhattan.

6) One of us is a lowly intern at one of the biggest corporations in America; Bi-dustrial incorporated. They make anything and everything, and pretty soon, one of us finds out some of their most secret and lucrative projects. 

7) Being a king or queen in the modern era isn't exactly what it used to be. From running entire empires and civilizations to being classy socialites and having bounds of twitter followers, it's hard to admit that time has indeed changed for our monarchs. Boundless wealth and nothing but time is enough to cause anybody to get a little crazy.

8) It's difficult, becoming a mother. Gaining unwanted weight, my breasts getting uncomfortably engorged with milk, sometimes I'd just prefer it if I never had to do it at all. The changes can be drastic, and can really make me feel a little depressed. It helps, however, to have a caring and loving spouse.

9) Genetically modifying fruit is a very controversial practice these days. We're putting these fruit in our bodies, that can be dangerous! It can be especially dangerous if a young, inexperienced scientist get's their hands on boundless information on how to accomplish some of the crazier changed fruits.

10) It's kind of like the plague, except no one dies? It's weird, doctors are afraid of the effects it will have on society, but it doesn't actually hurt anybody. If anything, it makes everyone feel pretty good. Even if society falls, at least the plague will make people happier. Maybe it's not all bad if society takes a tumble.

If you have any prefernce or ideas that you'd like to throw in, feel free! Please remember, I'll be going to work soon, so this roleplay wont be immediate.  [kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/iI8tV6V.png)"

53sj1m,10,2016-09-21,Serious visa/residency trouble,RichardElric,italy,https://www.reddit.com/r/italy/comments/53sj1m/serious_visaresidency_trouble/,"Buongiorno redditori italiani! 
Parlo un po' d'italiano, ma la mia domanda è troppo importante per rischiare che qualcosa si perde nella   traduzione. Per questa ragione quella farò in inglese.
                     
So my girlfriend is currently in Italy for an internship and has run into some legal trouble concerning her visa/residency permit (or lack thereof). I've come here for advice, since we haven't got a clue how to turn this mess around. But first, some background:

My girlfriend is a non-EU citizen, but has lived most her life in Germany on a permanent residence title. She is currently studying for her Bachelor degree in a program with an integrated year abroad. This incorporates one semester of study at an Italian university  (which she 
already completed) and a four month internship.

Her legal status was already complicated when she studied in Italy, however in that case, her (Italian) university assisted her in getting a residency permit.

When the time came to go back to Italy for the internship, she enquired at the Italian consulate whether she would need a visa and/or work permit for this. Her German residence title generally only entitles her to a short-time stay for tourist purposes.

The consulate wasn't being very helpful. After several rounds of not getting any information at all or contradictory statements from them, they finally told her that she wouldn't need a work permit since the
internship was part of her study, and that she should apply for a permesso di soggiorno locally, as she had done when she was studying in Italy. (The internship is unpaid, if this is relevant.)

So she did just that. However, when she was at the local ufficio immigrazione for her permesso soggiorno, the workers there had a different opinion. They told her:

1) she should have applied for a work permit beforehand  

2) she was currently staying and working illegally in Italy

3) this wasn't any of their business 

All the while, they were getting very agitated as my girlfriend tried to explain her situation and what the
consulate had told her. They obviously didn't believe her and at one point threatened to call the police and have her taken away.

However, before they (almost literally) threw her out, they told her she could still try to get the internship recognised as part of her study via some unspecified documents which she should present to some unspecified government entity. It's quite possible that they told her where to present these documents and she simply didn't understand in this agitated situation, as her Italian isn't perfect. However, when she asked, they showed her the door and told her this wasn't in their responsibility.

So that's the full story. We'd be thankful for any kind of advice of what to do in this situation, but
mostly we'd like to know:

1) Is this really not within the ufficio immigrazione's responsibility? If not to them, to whom should my girlfriend try to plead her case?

2) What would be needed to prove that her internship is part of her study? She has an official  letter from her home university stating as much. Would this suffice? Is this even legally relevant? 

3) What could be the consequences, both immediate and long term, if it was ruled that she has definitely been staying illegally? 

If anyone has experienced a similar situation and gotten out of it, please tell us how to proceed. Also any kind of information/resources on the laws involved would be welcomed.

We've been thinking about getting a lawyer involved, though we can't really afford one. Would this be a good idea? I'd rather get the money needed somehow than risking dire consequences. (My girlfriend has recently applied for naturalisation in Germany and violating another country's residency laws could, in a worst case scenario, stop the process from going forward, or even result in her German residence title getting revoked). 

Thank you in advance. I hope someone has some advice to offer. It's greatly appreciated!"

I was thinking to go for an internship during the semester break. If I were to applying through my university, they would probably place me somewhere  near and local, and the local IT industry in the state which I live in is not quite developed. 

Thus, I was wondering if I need to go out and look for other companies(probably larger in scale) which are in other states for internship? Will these companies give a better learning experience or does it not matter?

I don't have any experience in it and I got discouraged from approaching a lot of other companies compared to other students that had programming skills, projects, internships and other prior experiences.

jobs. 

I plan on getting a CompTIA security or networking certification during winter break. Since I don't have any job or experience to claim on my resume, what are other skills, apart from CompTIA, I can learn and put on it? What things can I put that will make a potential employer go ""hey, even though this kid doesn't have experience, he has these certifications and skills. Maybe I should hire him.""

53t01m,4,2016-09-21,It's one of those weeks...,BootyhunterzX,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/53t01m/its_one_of_those_weeks/,"Have you ever had one of those weeks where everything in your life is just going wrong? I mean everything. From your relationships  to your business pursuits to your family to your work. This has been the longest and most lucid nightmare of my life.

I have no friends. I only have one friend and I can feel he's getting sick of me already, all I do is complain about how everything is crumbling around me. People I used to talk to have been giving me a cold shoulder. People I have not talked to in a while, maybe the alienation is my fault.

I cry at least once a day. Some days I might cry more than others.

My biggest issue right now is that I'm in a relationship where only one of us is in love. The other just wants out. I've done everything in my power to keep my SO happy, I guess I've just been delaying the break-up. She doesn't love me anymore, she says she does, but I guess she's just grateful for trying to be there for her for four years without expecting anything in return. I did my best in this relationship. I really did. She was my first of everything. I looked at so many relationships to find where they went wrong and I did the best I could to be perfect for her, so she could be happy.

We talked about it and I guess I managed to just delay the break-up saying that we should take some time apart. It was just me selfishly clinging to this, the relationship is brain dead, but I just put it on life support, hoping that this was going to change, that she would magically love me again one day. It's only been 11 days since I decided that maybe what we needed was some time apart. She doesn't really talk to me. All she says is ""Good morning"" and ""Good night"" every three days, like it's on a schedule. In the four years we were together, I was very certain I was going to marry this girl, then, from one day to the other, that dream was gone.

I was starting a business with a friend from my high school. He's an Engineer, but his dream had always been to work with cars for a living. To start his own performance shop. My dream has always been to have my own business to administer and make money off. I suggested that we start a Corporation. I convinced him and I put a chunk of my savings into this. Way more than he did, to show him that I was really trying to make this work. I got all the necessary paper work, I made long lines at multiple Government offices, I did everything that was boring shit. He didn't do anything. All he had to do was pop open hoods and get to work, and take some classes for his mechanic license, classes that I agreed to pay for. He was literally going to get paid to study. I sought out internships with prestigious Auto Shops that he would've been able to go to.

Then one day, he tells me over messaging telling me that he's afraid of the political environment over where we live and if some asshole that everyone hates wins the election (Not US), he's going to leave the country. 

At first I was just bargaining to keep him interested. Now, I don't care. I don't want to be in a business with someone that shits themselves the first time something goes wrong. He doesn't have the backbone for leadership, how could I run a business with this person? Regardless of the outcome of the election, I want to dissolve the company anyway and pursue something else. I can't be the only one with business gall. I can't be with someone that isn't in this 100%. A corporation is like a marriage, if one of them is always unsure, it's going to be long and messy when it comes to an end. I want to just nip it right now.

My grandmother has Multiple Myeloma. It's pretty bad and she might not last as long the doctors initially said she was going to last. The condition left her bones so brittle that they break under the stress of her own movements. She was in surgery a week ago for a humeral fracture, she finally left the hospital on sunday, on monday she was rushed to the ER again because he other arm is now broken as well, she has since been operated and and is recovering. It kills me that my dad has to go through this entire problem on his own. He has three brothers, one that helps and two that haven't done jack. He has basically done everything on his own and it kills me that he has to watch his mother die regardless of all his effort, all anyone can say about that is that ""It's life, it's the way things are"" but ultimately, it's unfair.

I'm suffering this in my own way. I was closer that some of the other cousins, but I wasn't the closest. The closest had left the country in pursuit of other things and rarely visited. I don't cry about it, but the stress on my father is killing me. He needs me there for him and I can't be there because I am angry and just miserable all the time.

My sister has made some terrible choices in her life, leading to my parents not trusting her at all. I've become the bridge for them to interact. I'm forced to tell my parents some made up story about what my sister really did some night instead of what she really did. Turns out my sister is a Lesbian, I have no problem with that if that's what makes her happy, but my parents don't see it the way I do. They would absolutely go nuts if they found out my sister was a lesbian, even if it is out of her control. They would certainly kick her out of the house and she's not equipped to take care of our pet turtle, let alone herself. She ruined her own life and I'm the one that's going to be left to take care of the family, my parents when they're older and her because she's not very good at doing things the right way, because she's made some shitty choices. She was going to be a doctor, now she tests needles at the QA department of some Big Pharma company, earning scraps. That I couldn't get a word through to her and had to see her catch fire, crash and burn.

My job has made me a bit miserable in my life, even if it is decent money for an undergrad. I thought working in the company for where my uncle was a Chief Officer was going to be a good thing. That I would get too see ""How the sausage gets made"". I haven't seen anything. The Accounting team is distrustful of me and the other teams downright dislike me. I'm sure the issue gravitates to ""His uncle is the president of one of the companies and Main Shareholder in the other, that's the only reason he's here."" Yeah, that I'm here because of connections and not out of merit. That I don't deserve to be there according to them, even if I'm just an Intern. Every month they send out a list of all the birthdays for the month and they have missed mine consistently for the two years I've worked there. It's been clear that they don't care about me and they don't want to either. I've been doing a good job. I've been given more and more hours because they need me, but they still treat me like crap. It took me two years to actually get a terminal that didn't freeze up when I had more than one application running at a time.

I want to just quit, but things where I live are so bad that I can't just turn down $10 an hour. My father can't keep paying for my stuff because I need him to put more money into his 401k so he can retire comfortably because the government where I live destroyed the pension fund for employees to pay for debts and my mom is now out of a retirement fund.

My life has become a boring routine that has depressed me. I can say exactly what is going to happen today because it's happened every other day. I get up at 5:30 in the morning. I brush my teeth. Get dressed, pack some extra clothes and I'm out the door at 5:55. I drive to college and get there at around 6:30. I go to the Cafeteria and I get the same ""Turkey, swiss and Egg sandwhich, mayo and butter, no salad, and a coffee please, thanks."" ""That will be $4.79"" the employees already know what I'm going to order before I order it. I already know the price. I could operate the register already. I wait around go on reddit because my class is actually at 10:00 in the morning, the reason I'm here so early is because at exactly 7:00am we run out of parkings spots at the lot and we have to walk a lot further. A LOT. 


After my class I leave the University and stop on one of the three food trucks on my way to work, this is the only place that is unpredictable to me because I still don't know what the specials are but that will change in a few days. I take my food and sit down, I eat it as quickly as possible because the time is usually 11:45 and I have to be at work at 12:00. I leave for work which is just 5 minutes away from the trucks.

Then at work, my direct supervisor tells me that I haven't done something she asked for through email when I was in class. This will become an even bigger problem because she will bring this up in front of the general supervisor, the person that reports directly to my uncle and she will get a few hits in too. I do all my work as quickly as possible. Sometimes I finish all of my things on the To-do list way before 5:00 pm so I lock myself in a stall and cry because they don't want me there and I don't want to be there with them, cry because my entire life is falling apart. If I was dying, and I had a chance to have them there comforting me before I died vs dying alone, I think I'd rather die alone.

I clock out at 5:00 pm and am diligently stuck in traffic at 5:20. I reach the gym at 6:00 to 6:30. When I get there, all the free weights are taken, all the machines have a queue and all I can do is cardio. I do Cardio for 40 minutes to an hour, I'll be on the elliptical machine most every day and then a bit on the stationary bike.

Once I'm done, my other grandmother that isn't dying makes a small meal on mondays and tuesdays so I stop by and eat. Then I'll go home. Once I'm home, I'll pour a tall glass of scotch I keep under my bed, I'll catch up with my homework and watch an episode of some show, then I shave, shower and go to bed.

The next day I do the same thing, except that I leave earlier from the university and the food trucks aren't open yet so I have a frozen burger from the cafeteria and then go to work. Today is food truck day, I'd enjoy it more if it weren't so expensive.

This is about the time that I wish a truck would just run a red light, T-bone me and just obliterate me. It would spare my SO the issue of breaking up with me because there would be nothing to break up with. It would make my co workers happy because they can hire someone based on merit. I wouldn't have to see my dad go through his issues. I wouldn't have to tell my friend I don't think he has the balls to run a business and I wouldn't have to dissolve the company myself, my mom and dad could so it and they could keep the money. My friend won't have to listen to me bitch about how everything sucks or how I feel things suck. My sister will become more responsible and maybe she will take charge of her life because her safety net is gone.

Maybe being dead is better for the people directly around me.

TL;DR It's one of those weeks where everything keeps going wrong. I was already miserable and didn't need any more misery to pile on."
53t1na,2,2016-09-21,Handling access,Lokart,userexperience,https://www.reddit.com/r/userexperience/comments/53t1na/handling_access/,"I'm developing an application to store and manage files, passwords, things like that. Currently I'm thinking about how to handle access to this data;

My initial thought was a ""security level"" system; every user has a security level (given by an administrator), which is actually just a number between 0 and X. When uploading files, storing passwords, etc. you can specify the required security level. For example: user X has a security level of 10 - hence he can look at all data which requirements are equal or lower than 10. Every data with a security level requirement above this won't show up.

My concerns here are: it could get tricky if you have a lot of different security levels. At some point the administrator is probably like ""well, what security level does this need to be viewable by managers but not for senior developers? 50? 100?"". Kind of a solution to this problem would be to store security levels by name. So you could manage security levels by value and by name; e.g. security level 1 is ""Intern"", security level 10 is ""Employee"", 20 is ""Accountant"", etc.. That would mean you're not assigning the security level itself to a file (or a password, or whatever) but a readable string. Sounds easier - but is still the same as above.

I don't to handle every users access individually. That would be way to much work when, for example, just want to provide a file which shouldn't be read by new employees but anyone else.

Any other ideas? Or are my concerns about the security level system just exaggerated and it's actually ""okay"" to do it that way?"

I graduated 6 months ago from a Bachelor in Business ( Major in IT Minor in Marketing) and I'm about to finish an IT internship in a big company ( 50 000 + employees, CPG, well known and reputed).

The likelyhood that I receive a return offer from the company at which I'm working right now is pretty high, but I also received an interesting offer at a much smaller company ( 300 employees, tech industry, huge growth right now)

The biggest dilemma I'm facing right now is that I'm wondering if jumping from a big to a smaller company is a step down for my future. I feel like I would perform a bit more in the role in the smaller company ( Partners Manager ) than in the one I would get in the bigger company ( IT Project Manager ). 

I have been getting feedback saying that I should stay within a bigger company to learn from their processes and methods, but I've also received feedback saying that I should jump to the smaller company to get more diversified responsibilities and an opportunity to learn and grow with the company.

CDC also has a fellowship program available called the Public Health Associate Program (PHAP https://www.cdc.gov/phap/ ).  


Here are some applied skills that we often see missing from the skillset of new MPH graduates.  If you can leverage your MPH program to support you in developing these skills, that’s great, if not, you may have to do some self-teaching on these but your candidacy will be stronger for it in the long run.

•	Develop a really solid understanding of the principles and methodologies behind disease surveillance- Many MPH programs offer a lecture or if you’re lucky, a whole course dedicated to disease surveillance but that’s often not enough. Roughly half the jobs in applied public health are surveillance positions (which will be evident when you look at the positions advertised on the PHEC website). Having a really good understanding and working knowledge of the principles and applications behind disease surveillance is worth seeking out.

•	Know how to code in SAS and/or R and/or EpiInfo (extra bonus if you know how to code in Python).  Focus on data management skills, specifically know what a relational database is and like how to deal is, not just statistical analyses.  Just about everyone with their MPH can do cross-tabulations, or even run regressions, but very few understand what a relational data table is, and how to deal with it to run the report you want- there are a lot of opportunities to learn these data management programs for free. Both R and EpiInfo are free programs- so there should be no financial barrier to getting experience with both of these platforms.

•	Know how to make maps (ArcGIS experience preferred)

•	Know how to use the entire MS Office Suite (that includes MS Publisher)

•	Get experience visualizing data dynamically.  A large piece of the work we do is communication, and in particular communication to non-scientific audiences. 
 
•	Become familiar with the principles of project management and resource mapping. 


As much as I dislike the idea of an unpaid internship- I feel that people should be paid for the work they do, unpaid internships are a great way to get experience and network also. The longer you are willing to be an intern for, the more exposure you’re going to get, and, generally, the more time you’ll have to develop a relationship with your mentor so that they trust you with bigger projects that will get you better quality experience and exposure.


I have probably missed a million things, so if anyone has anything to add, please do!

I'll be accepting a job in LA for early 2017 (Feb). I interned with them before, so I'm familiar with the area and the commute, but that was a temporary gig. This is at least semi-permanent. Here are the details:

* $50k pay, and I can expense travel on the job, if that matters.
* Located slightly east of DTLA. Think Little Tokyo/Arts District. More specifically, very close to 1st/Alameda.
 

My info:

* Single, 24 year old male.
* Moving from the midwest, Chicago area.
* I have a car, and I own it outright.
* I have no debt of any kind.
* I've lived in an apartment for some time, so if it's the best option, I have furniture, including a bed. Everything I'd need to set up short of appliances, essentially.
* I've looked at PODS for shipping my stuff. Cost estimate was roughly $2k after taxes/fees.
* Essentially, I have no outstanding monthly costs other than rent, utilities, and car insurance right now (which I've had quoted around $80/mo).

I've looked at trying to find a decent deal in Pasadena, since the office is really close to the Gold Line, or the commute would be super short from the South Pasadena area anyway. As for the city, I'd need a bit more help. My max rent is pegged at right around $1100. For my internship, I got lucky and subletted a great spot at USC, but that's not gonna work for permanent adult living.

I guess what I'm looking for here is an assessment of my situation, a couple more particular ideas for areas of the city, and costs I need to consider that are CA specific (rather than the generic costs of moving).

Thanks!

My career path looks like this:
1st internship: JavaScript and Python and Django 2nd internship: Full-stack .NET 2nd internship turned into 1st full-time job: Full-stack .NET Left full-time job for 3rd internship: C# and WFP and Python/C 4th internship: Full-stack .NET 2nd full-time job: Full-stack .NET
Most of my experience is full-stack .NET, specifically with vanilla JavaScript or ReactJS and some AngularJS. But I've done Java stuff on my own - recently played with Java to make a restful API for reading and writing tweets to my Twitter account. So I'm familiar with Maven, Jetty, and more.
And I've also done enough with Django to understand that the frameworks are conceptually similar....and where they're not, it's easy to pick up differences and syntax if you already know one stack.
The manager I chatted with in writing initially told me he thinks my background is a solid foundation. But then on the phone call, he told me he doesn't think I'm a good fit because of the lack of open-stack experience.
So...am I right to be worried with the stack I've been working with? This is the first time I've actually felt threatened by being pinholed into a single stack. He mentioned that all the real top companies use open-stack technology (and only some closed-stack tech) and that I'd do well to transition into that direction.
So I'm requesting some advice here. Did I make the wrong move in sticking with another full-stack .NET role after graduating and leaving my last internship? I had an opportunity to work at a company that has a typical Java stack going but I liked the current company more. In any case, I was under the impression that serious software companies don't care too much what stack you're experienced in as long as you're a strong engineer who learns quickly and efficiently. :/"
53u9yz,2,2016-09-21,Is a title change from developer to analyst something to be concerned about?,theguyjb,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/53u9yz/is_a_title_change_from_developer_to_analyst/,"I work for a large IT Consultancy firm that has many roles ranging  between technical and functional. I was hired from an intern to a permanent member several years ago, and at the time I specified it was important for me to be in a highly technical role. I was given the title of ""Applications Developer.""

The company has recently changed the definition of many of our roles, claiming they were trying to get a better idea of what our members are doing. My role was changed to ""Programmer Analyst.""

Most of our non-technical roles use the term analyst (e.g., Business Analyst). I am concerned the shift will make me sound less appealing both to external and internal contacts, possibly hindering me if I want to make a move. However, I am not very up -to-date with industry standard titles. Does this seem like a red flag to anyone?

If it helps, I work in a support and maintenance role, handling bug fixes, enhancements, and major software updates. Some days I'm implementing a suggested fix, and some days I'm creating them. I probably spend 40% of my time coding, 20% testing, 30% designing solutions, with 10% miscellaneous.

Also, how do I handle this on my resume? My responsibilities have not changed at all, just my title. Should I create a new section with the new title?

- Work with our Director of Hockey Analytics to compile all of that data, so we can do data stuff with it. Or, ""crunch the numbers,"" as we like to call it here in the biz.

So, if you're interested, [here's that application link.](http://bit.ly/analyticsinterns) It's a part-time role and you'll pretty much only be here on game nights.

53v6of,1,2016-09-21,I [25/m] Had A Crazy Ending After 2.5 Years with Girlfriend [23/f] Need Advice.,tscott1991,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/53v6of/i_25m_had_a_crazy_ending_after_25_years_with/,"I met this girl I dated for 2.5 years halfway through college. I had previously been six months earlier in a relationship that ended after 4.5 years. The ex had been very smart and challenged me, but in the end she was so strong willed and hard headed we didn't work out. My friends and family described her as not a nice person. Thus I went after this most recent girl, I'll call her ""Allison"". 

Allison, was more fun in nature. She seemed to go with the flow and like someone I could spend large amounts of time around. I had other girl options at the time but she seemed the least like my ex and a sure bet. I was her friend for a year or so previous and we had always stayed in touch, now that I was single and she had moved back to the campus after taking a year off, I decided to make a move. 

We hung out a ton around Christmas time and I asked her out. Everything went super well. I noticed though in some ways emotionally, she didn't seem to have the depth or feelings early on I saw develop with other girlfriends. She seemed to go straight for sex after we had started that phase, instead of cuddling or kissing. As a guy I was fine with it but found it odd. I attributed this to being her first boyfriend, and that her parents were on the brink of divorce and had an unhealthy relationship (didn't even sleep in the same room). She had hooked up with some dude once before my time she met at a club a few times, but that's all I knew in terms of her guy history. 

To give some background, I'm a very jokey, light hearten person who gives their all into everything they do. Sometimes it scares people but I think to do anything less than your best is a joke. I was a 3.3 student and very organized for a guy and clean. I enjoy sports, reading, video games, volunteering. I sometimes come off as hard to read or a jerk at first but once people know me well I become very close and a long term friend. 

She's a great person as well but struggled in school when we first met often and took things personally when I tried to help or point something out. She'd make a great mom and wife one day I thought. She's drop dead gorgeous and normally a nice person, good to take home to mom and dad type. She was very messy and disorganized though and tended to trip herself up a lot. Forgetting things and all that. I tried always to help her with that and be more functional. Often she didn't see the problem but would be late or forget to do stuff in school and I'd help save her. I guess I thought her growing up over time would fix those things so it didn't bug me much and she was a good time to hang out with and relax. She knew she lacked compared to me in those areas but I'm not perfect and she seemed to know that at first and that I wanted to help her. Over time she resented it and it bugged me she didn't seem to progress. She was very much save the world, vegetarian, liberal, dreamer. I was rational and believed hard work got me places along with others. I didn't mind her opposite mindset because I felt it balanced us as a couple and made us branch out more. 

We spent a ton of hours together the first six months like any normal couple, we grew in love and made one another better. The same could be said for the months following. We were on campus a lot together, volunteered in the same service groups and lived in the same apartment complex area. 

The first problem started about 8 months in, she ran into a guy in a class. This guy looked like your typical jerk who didn't care about anything and was a frat boy. I knew this because I'd attended one class with her before and seen the kid. She would tell me how he wouldn't pay attention, then text her asking for her help, and that he would play with her computer mouse or touch her screen when sitting next to her.  After several times of me telling her he was flirting, a fight broke out at her apartment between us. Not heated but me saying stop talking to him and that she needed to be trustworthy. He had kept texting her and the last text she showed, he asked to study together at his place. I said she had to have known and to stop flirting. She said sorry and cried and turned around to end the conversation by saying she would never do anything because she loved me. That was the first time we had broached that and I had considered saying it soon but wanted to be patient and not freak her out. She was 20 at this time. That was our first fight and over trust. It would become a common theme. 

After this time and for the next year things were still good overall. The guys hitting on her issue and her not shutting them down seemed to still happen though. It always ended with the guy via text or in person blatantly inviting her over or texting her something awkward then she allegedly got the hint and agreed with me to shut it down. Part of me wondered if she had done this because she didn't really like the idea of commitment and enjoyed the intention. I'd had girlfriends hit on by dudes before (but they shut it down properly and quick. 

Trust became a big issue. I always felt bad bringing it up but the worry grew over time seeing the pattern. I would always do little things for her like bring her coffee at work, or do her laundry if I could, take her to dinner, or those kind of things. Romantic things seemed to weird her out the first year so I was hesitant of those type things but tried. I'd bought her things like jewelry too but she had lost two of the three necklaces I had gotten her and so I got her a cute but less expensive one last for her to wear around. I just wanted her to know I was thinking of her, and that she mattered. Not that material part had mattered to me. She rarely did the same type stuff but I didn't need it I thought because making her happy made me happy. 

We spent tons of time together the next few months and did things like make meals together and celebrate holidays with families and really seemed passionate about one another. 

Around 1.75 years in I got a full time job at the place I attended school, while still finishing. I couldn't turn it down because it was paying for my school and getting me a salary, benefits and job exp. I became much busier and moved to night classes. During this time the girlfriend got a job at a restaurant waiting tables and we ended up having opposite schedules only seeing each other on weekends and select nights. This job in IT wasn't strenuous, I had did similar tasks as a student intern previous but it took a toll working 40 hours and class twice or three times a week at night. Sometimes at night we wouldn't talk as much cuz I'd be tired or she would or stress levels were just high. 

The girlfriend and I began to get in a rut and around 2 years in she said she wanted more adventure. I agreed but said I was doing my best with the time I had. When we saw each other on weekends it was often at 10pm at night and so she would come over and we'd often watch a movie or go out with friends for food and then come home, have sex and fall asleep. It happened often and I knew it was only a phase and part of growing up so I was ok with it. Things were still passionate and fun to me, just less spontaneous due to schedules. The occasional trust problem still cropped up with guys hitting on her at her new job, but mostly nothing developed. We only ever really fought once every few months about that issue and never really fought about anything else. She wasn't very vocal or willing to share her true thoughts, I am the complete opposite. I was patient though with her because she was still kind of new and meant well at this. 

Two years in she went on a service trip with friends in the northern part of the state. She was one of the student planners on the trip so we didn't talk much the week she was there. She seemed to create a bond with a girl while up there, we will call her ""Erica"". Upon returning from the trip she was supposed to meet me and take her car to a shop to get it looked at about an hour away. Instead of taking me, she took Erica. I found this odd but didn't think much of it. Two weeks later, she had come over late and was showering. I was laying in bed waiting for her to join me and suddenly her phone is blowing up. It's Erica and she had little emojis. I knew Erica  a little previously and knew she was a lesbian, as she had dated a mutual friend of mine. I decided with that in mind to see what was so important on her phone. It was then that I found that my girlfriend, Allison had been hanging and talking with Erica at a level I never suspected. Allison was texting her how she had plans to break up with me in the next week and that she had to ""get used to touching"" with her. 

When my girlfriend walked out of the shower, I left the phone on my bed with the screen lit up to the texts. Her face went white and she actually tried to deny it when asking her if she cared to explain. She didn't know I had read majority of the texts, and so I tested to see if she offered to share anything more. She did not and seemed pissed at me. I don't like having to look at someone elses phone and not text them, but my gut and the results there proved I was right. My trust was shattered and it made me wonder how faithful she had been in all those guy situations she claimed weren't her fault. 

She apologized to me but didn't seem to really quite understand the impact that she had more or less possibly cheated or planned to and the impact that had on me. We were ok dating the next couple months but I was edgy with work stress and she seemed to be mailing it in of late in terms of effort. Eventually she wanted to talk and break up. Siting that I wasn't as fun and carefree and that she didn't know who or what she wanted. We broke up at her apartment and it was a cordial and nice as that situation can be.

About a month later we attened the same social event and she looked good, apparently she had been drinking before hand knowing I would be there. I only went to accept a very prestigious award at the ceremony.  I heard rumor she was still into me some and that things with others didn't work out. I never knew what happened with the girl and she claimed nothing. I always questioned that because they no longer talked and the girl tweeted what a shitty person she was. I talked to a few other girls in between but wasn't into it and still thought of her, even despite what she had done.  I decided to ask her on a date after about a month and five days of being broken up. She came over and we talked and I told her she needed to be confident in herself and believe in herself for us to date, and to act trustworthy. I thought maybe she was just young and messed up and I loved her so I felt it was good for us to have a second chance. She agreed and we started dating and everything was fun and great. That lasted about four months. 

She then went up north again on a fun vacation trip with a new friend and her friends family who lived up there. She didn't call me for the first 5 of the 11 days she was there but when she had left things were good, she was asking about moving in on my lease coming up, talking long term with kids and wedding colors someday and seemed happy. Suddenly after a long work shift doing upgrades I get a text at 1am. It's her basically saying she's really happy up there and she had found herself and didn't know what she wanted in life. She said she wasn't sure she only wanted to be with one guy and was worried she was settling. She admitted it was out of the blue and claimed she was doing it for her after talking to her friend and that it had nothing to do with the friends brother who was her age up there. He had eyes for her before once when we hung out in a group and I met him, but I trusted her it was nothing. She said she wasn't sure if she wanted to break up and that she wasn't happy and didn't feel like herself with me. She asked to not text for a few days, but after 24 hours I asked her to call me and talk about it, I thought 2 and some years had bought me at least that respect. It was a heated of a conversation as we had had, she kept saying things she had never brought up before, and claimed things like ""I wouldn't be fun if I didn't have my job to focus on and that it defined me"" and that ""I didn't like her singing or adventures"". In all reality I love my career so that offended me, yes I had focused on that of late but it required that, and I loved her singing and adventures. I just didn't have the time and energy sometimes to go off on as many as I used to. She said that the tickets I had bought her to a concert recently, that she didn't have fun at it because the right guy would have danced more at it and pushed up into the crowd unlike me who was just content singing a little along and admiring. She got mad when I asked for sure that the brother wasn't involved and she struggled to say I love you when hanging up the phone. We texted a little after and I asked why she hadn't said she was unhappy more before? And she said she didn't feel like herself when with me, I never knew that so how could we have addressed it? It seemed like her solution was just to ditch it all and she said that she didn't feel like we were throwing away anything after 2.5 years. She also claimed that I didn't want her to study abroad, in reality I did I just told her I would miss her which I attributed to normal human reaction. That wasn't me telling her know, it was that I loved and would miss her but have fun and do her. I was upset, we texted very little that weekend and she didn't call or text once back. We basically broke up via phone an Facebook which made me mad. I wanted more class and maturity than that. 

Turns out after talking to a mutual friend, less than 3 weeks after breaking up, she drove 10.5 hours one weekend to spend four days with the brother of her best friend she had gone up north with. This guy was 21 and seemed like a bro/party type. The opposite of me, I was past that phase a few years back. Moving on that quick and claiming nothing was there before we broke up makes me think twice about the kind of person she was/is. Once finding this out I was enraged and deleted her from all phone, social media etc and don't care to talk to her again. 

 I worry I may have been too boring or not fun enough and that weighs on me, at the same time I think maybe that was her was of making herself feel better about running off with the other dude. 

My question going forward is, how do I trust again and not carry that fear to the next person, and should I give her the light of day if she ever enters my life again?"
53v79a,69,2016-09-21,Got the job!!!!!,rking93,ChemicalEngineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChemicalEngineering/comments/53v79a/got_the_job/,"After searching for about 9 months, I finally received call saying they would like to hire me. I graduated in May 2016 and been applying since middle of my senior year. I graduated with no internship and research experience. I had GPA of 3.04 but my last two year of ChE I had maintained GPA of about 3.5, something I used to forte in my interview saying I have maintained high GPA while taking some of the most core classes in ChE. I filled more than 400 applications and went to about 5-6 interviews. I would like to share what I changed in this process which help me land this job at Colgate-Palmolive. I see lot of post here that are struggling to find jobs. First of all do not loose hope! I have filled every application out there and always stayed positive on possibly landing job. Staying positive is the most effective thing. Another, if you are not landing jobs/interviews get your resume reviewed by you senior classmate who is working in industry or best option your professor( something I did). You will be surprised on how many connections professors have in industry. Aim at professor who is very nice guy and you know he would help any student, I went to my thermodynamics professor. He suggested me to put my projects on my resume instead of irrelevant work experience you might had. Try putting senior project, Heat-mass project or any project you did during your degree and show them how you used computer programs (Excel, Aspen plus, Visio, etc) to solve or make project easier. Brush-up on interview skills. There are tons of website,workshops or videos to improve your interview skills. Talk to your classmates who have had internships or other positions. Lastly, find a way to get contact of hiring manager. If you can somehow find a way to put your resume directly to hiring manager and skip HR dept, you are mostly likely to get called in for interview. Find any alumni from your college working in industry by either LinkedIn, networking or again professor's connections. I landed my job because he graduated from same college. They are very familiar to the program you went through and professors/classes and projects you did during your degree. They are more lenient towards  same school when making the final call(happened with me in this job). "

We have always been really shitty with money, him more so than me in terms of paying bills on time/acknowledging their existence but we always made rent. As you can imagine that has been a CONSTANT pressure on our lives but hasn’t really caused any noticeable relationship stress until I started trying to get our finances in order. 

A little background:  when we met both of us were working minimum wage jobs with the intent of saving up for school. I ended up going back to school through the grace of a windfall from my family, scholarships, some saving, and a bit of help from credit cards while he bounced around jobs and finally settled into where he is now making decent money 36K/yr. I spent a year doing an unpaid internship following school, where he supported us, and then ended up where I am now making 37K/yr. During the intervening time life happened and we racked up debts, most stupid but some unavoidable (medical) and as a result have been swimming in what feels like crushing debt. We make our minimum payments, contribute to the household equally, and attempt to save where possible but really hadn’t gotten beyond the “whining about being poor” stage until now.

I jumped onboard the budget parade to track our wasteful spending and ended up going through the last year’s worth of expenditures and breaking them down by category.  I found out how much we were spending on cigs (we both smoked) and I quit. Found out how much we spent on alcohol and I quit that too. Basically I got healthier because I was horrified by the amount of money being spent but didn’t want to force my husband into anything so I just assumed those expenses would be halved (WRONG).

Problems:  I’ve been getting a little prickly about our budget since then (he was never really 100% on board with this approach, he just wanted all debt to vanish and or didn’t want to alter his lifestyle) because now 62% of our monthly “fun money” ($230) is going to things I don’t participate in and I would rather save that money OR go do something that we can both participate in. The prickly-ness extends to me spending 15% of the “fun money” on things I want and then getting hassled because “Oh, it’s okay if YOU spend money on blahblahyourthing but I can’t spend money on blahblahmything”. He doesn’t seem to realize that drinking and smoking are NOT NECESSITIES/BASIC RIGHTS they are LUXURIES and fall under the FUN MONEY category despite being explicitly told that and shown that in a myriad of graphs (yeah I’m a data junkie). 

So now I’m pissed and a little butthurt because I have been putting in no small amount of time and effort developing a budget system (mint and ynab didn’t really do it for me so I set up my own spreadsheet system) so that we can get out of being 22.5k in debt, fix his credit, save for a house, save for a kid and maybe live in a world where we don’t feel crushed by debt and he is making me feel like a bad guy for not letting him spend money on the things he wants to! I have tried to make him feel involved in this process, shown him the data, broken in down multiple ways for him to get a full understanding of what is going on, and expressed to him how he hurt my feelings and the level of genuinely upset I am. Here is the kicker, he seems sorry but then a few days later is doing the same exact thing that hurt my feelings in the first place! 
What can I do to make him actually understand that I’m already sacrificing the majority of ‘my’ spending money so he can keep doing the shit he wants to do but more importantly TEACH HIM THE VALUE OF BUDGETING BECAUSE I REFUSE TO SPEND THE REST OF MY LIFE BEING STRESSED ABOUT SOMETHING I CAN FIX WITH RELATIVELY LITTLE SUFFERING.

So. Does anyone have a better approach for me or am I being way out of line about this whole thing?

TL;DR I [26F] started budgeting to pay down debts and my husband [27M] thinks I'm being unfair about how he spends 'his' money

PART I - Excitement 

I drove the same car from 16 years old to the day I got hired at my first ""real"" job out of college. It was a 2001 Subaru Outback. The thing was awesome. It carried all of my high school friends on countless adventures, made several expeditions through terrible weather conditions across the mountain passes of Western Washington, and stayed on the road with very few mechanical issues despite my sometimes less-than-pampering treatment. 

As reliable as it was, an older used Outback wasn't the coolest car to have as a 16, 18, or 22 year old. This was always in the back of my head. I wouldn't say I felt embarrassed driving it, but it just wasn't something I took pride in when I was driving down the road. So throughout college, I told myself that I would save as much as I could. When I graduated and found a career job, I would spend whatever I was able to save on a new, COOLER, car. 

I worked every summer, odds and ends of jobs; one year as a camp counselor, one year a marketing intern. I vicously saved all of my summer money that I could throughout the school year. I was fortunate to have parents that covered my basic amenities in college (cheap rented house shared with 4 people, a basic meal plan at the school, stuff like that), so I didn't have to worry about large monthly expenses. I even avoided ""necessity"" purchases like a mattress, instead opting to sleep on a $30 inflatable one. All in the name of saving for a cool car. 

I graduate college and find a good job at the end of 2012. By this time, I had saved up about $8,000 in my ""car fund"". About 4 months after moving to my current town for work, I come into contact with a higher-up at Microsoft selling his 2005 Audi A6 because he is buying a Tesla. It was top of the line, fully-loaded. 4.2 liter V8, 335hp - the thing was crazy. 
He was the only owner, bought it new in '05, had all the service records, and was only selling it to clear out the room in his garage. 92,000 miles. He found a dealer that was giving him $12,000 for it. I asked him if I was able to match that offer, would he instead sell to me. He agreed. 

I proceeded to ask my dad if I could borrow $4,000 from him to cover the difference I needed. Now having a salaried position, I knew I could make car payments relatively easy, I just knew trying to finance this 7 year-old car through a bank as a first-time borrower would be more difficult. He loaned me the money. 

I was stoked! I had the coolest (and fastest) car of all of my friends. Even though it was 7 years old, it looked new. It had been super well maintained, this guy had just finished performing ""tune-up"" maintenance to sell it, so it had new brakes, new tires, oil was changed, cabin filter, etc etc. 


Part II - Enlightenment 

Fast forward about 4 months. Still loving the car. I'm noticing it's kind of expensive to fill up, though, with gas prices being where they were at, and the fact that this thing isn't that fuel efficient (20 - 24 mpg). I'm spending almost $80 to fill the tank up sometimes, but whatever. At this point it's about time for this Audi's first oil change. Wow, $150 for an oil change. Oh, it takes 8 or 9 quarts of oil? And HAS to have the oil that's $10/quart? Yikes. The price I pay for a sweet car I guess!

Let's jump ahead another 4 or 5 months. I notice a very deflated tire coming back to my Audi in the parking lot of a restaurant. I baby my way to a local tire shop. Don't exactly remember why the tire couldn't be fixed, but I remember that I had to buy new tires. It's a quattro, so I can't just replace two of them, it needs all four replaced. Oh this Audi takes super wide, weird-sized tires? Ok, how much are those? $900? Holy &amp;%*#. Ok, well get it done I guess. 

Now the fun starts. Myself and my (now) fiancé are driving back from a weekend getaway. I notice the car doesn't seem to have the umph it should have going up hills or getting up to speed. Over the next day or two I also notice the car getting louder as I bring it up to speed. Ok now, it's clacking. Wow, now it barely goes 35mph. 

I convince my dad to come down with his car trailer to bring it to a local independent german auto shop we had used for my sister's VW. A few days later I get ""the call"". It's basically worst case. It's the timing chain, which is inside the engine block. To fix it, the engine will straight up need to be removed; about 40 - 60 hours worth of work. We're talking a V8, 335 horsepower engine has to be taken out of the car. The estimate? About $6,000. I chew my options over. The car is basically worthless like this so it's not like I can sell it. I choose to fix it. Not even through paying my dad off for the purchase of the car, I reluctantly ask him to help me out with the cost again. He loans me another $2,000. Thanks, First Bank of Dad.

3 months later, the car is finished. YAY. I get my car back. 

Not even 6 months after, something else happens. I'm attending an event in Portland and come back outside to my car, start it up, and notice the electronic parking brake is on. That's weird. I don't usually put my parking brake on when I am on flat ground. I push the button to disengage the brake, and... nothing. Instead, after a few seconds, a giant indicator light blinks brightly at me with a horrific high-pitched beeping noise to accompany it. Parking brake failure. 

I had it towed to an independent shop closer to Portland. This is a story in itself, but the short version is they spend 1 month pulling their dicks around and come up with no fix. I finally convinced them to give it up and had the car towed to Audi. (By the way, arranging a tow for a completely disabled car with a parking brake permanently engaged can be difficult). 

Audi was actually confused by the problem for a while too. They eventually replaced the whole parking brake module which worked. $1,500.

You might be wondering if I had ever thought about selling this godless money pit. Yes. Yes, I had. Let's remember at this point, the car depreciates every day. Quickly. Someone had slightly sideswiped me in a parking lot without leaving a note, so the driver's side panel had a dent in it. I was kind of screwed. Do I sell this for like $8,000 and then finance a brand new car (still while owing my dad a little money)? Or do I just eat this fix and pray that it lasts another 100,000 miles?

Preferring to only owe money at ONE institution - The First Bank of Dad - I decide to give this car one last chance. Now we get to March of this year. I'm driving to an Easter celebration with my fiance at 70mph on the freeway. Total loss of power. It's a cracked head. $5,000 estimated fix. The car's done. 

How the mighty have fallen. 

I owned this car for a total of about 3 years and I spent more on maintenance than I did on the car itself.


Part III - Reckoning 

To everyone who's thinking:

""do your research"", ""you should have known"", ""there's a reason used luxury cars cost what they do"", ""should have sold it"", ""don't buy a car to be cool"", ""it's Audi"", ""shouldn't have spent that much to fix it"", ""don't buy a car you can't afford to maintain""

or any other snarky remark with undertone of my ignorance.

Fuck you and fuck off. Not because I don't want to hear it. But because you're right.


Part IV - Redemption

Now, if you're particularly astute, you may have picked up on the fact that the Audi was in the shop for a combined time of several months. What did I drive during that time? Did I survive without a car? 

I drove my 2001 Subaru Outback now with 220,000 miles on it. 

I returned to the Subaru dealer a humbled man. In April of this year I bought a 2016 Subaru Crosstrek. The thing barely has 150 horsepower, and I LOVE that about it. You know what I also bought when I purchased my Crosstrek? A giant motherfucking warranty.

I paid about $2,000 for it and I smiled as a wrote the check. I probably would have paid twice that for it. Even if it's unlikely it'll pay off, it's worth that to me just in peace of mind. I'll probably buy the biggest warranty available on every car I buy for the rest of my life. Cause I know what the value of it is to me. 

And if you think this was an unwise purchase, let me just say this:

When you are legitimately scared to take your car in for an oil change because you know they'll find something else that'll cost you 4 figures, THEN I'll take your feedback seriously. 

Value is subjective. There's not a soul on this planet who's going to convince me I didn't get a good deal on that warranty. 

When these salesmen say the ""true cost of something is what you are willing to pay for it"", they're not BSing.

Anyways, our nametags had our job titles- executive director and software engineer. When people (both guys and girls) would come up to us, they'd go right to him and would be unsure if they could talk to me about the position. In addition to asking about the internship opening they'd generally ask him about the skills needed and what they'd do- stuff that I know better since they'd basically be my intern. 

I had one guy try to explain Java to me. I work in C#... I'm making sure his resume isn't getting far. 

Also the women at sign in automatically assumed I was an HR person and needed clarification when I said I was an engineer 

Why is being a woman and being a developer such a farfetched idea?!?! Grah!!! Other women aren't innocent here either, I've gotten shit from both sides. I feel like my boss respects me more than most people there and he's voting Trump ffs! "

I'm figuring out my list of grad schools to apply to (running very late), but right now it's a bit top heavy. So far I've got UIUC, U. Washington, Georgia Tech and University of Utah... I'd like to add a number of options to the list that are safer choices. (I'd also like to have some less stressful options, even if I could get in anywhere.. I want to enjoy grad school.)

I think I've got a pretty strong resume (See below), so I'm looking for more mid-tier schools. The big thing is, I'm interested in learning a lot more about functional programming, theory of programming languages, static analysis and compilers, and I'm not sure how to find schools where those are a thing.

I care more about quality of courses (and local quality of life, though that's pretty subjective) than about super-prestigious research... still figuring out exactly how well-suited I'll be to research. I figure I have at least one solid Master's thesis in me, but past that I might just like to take more advanced coursework and return to industry.

To give you you an idea of where I'm at, for judging what qualifies as a ""Safe"" choice:

 - Just above a 3.0 GPA, but 3.7 if you only look at the last three years (my second run at college), and above a 4.0 if you only look at my CS grades during that time.
 - GRE scores - 90th percentile in math, 99th in verbal/analytic
 - Good/difficult course selection for electives
 - Math double major
 - Two very solid letters of recommendation, several pretty-good options for a third
 - Won site and placed second regional in Tier 2 ACM programming contest
 - Succesful internship (for whatever that's worth), was in charge of a lot of non-trivial features (including the entire security system, from design up)
 - Attached to several research projects (Missed results, did write a spam filter for SoundCloud that the professor had been wanting for a while)
 - Wrote honors thesis (not exactly research, survey paper on static analysis for memory management)
 - Spent my last year of college also caring for both of my parents as they died of cancer, so there's that"

2012 13""  
2.5GHz i5  
4GB 1600MHz

Just time for a new one. This one still does okay, but it's not what it sued to be. Lots of pictures, lots of music, lots of stuff for what was my internship and now is my work. This new one will *not* be a work computer. I'll keep this current one and use it at work for as long as it will keep on going... or until my work gives me one that I can use to make their stuff.... which would be reasonable anyway ;)

Stuck between [these two](http://imgur.com/a/1GX1U): Pro retina with 2.7hz and 8gb and the macbook pro (non-retina) with 2.9GHz and 4gb 

Trouble is, I don't really know enough of the nitty gritty to have a feeling for what difference this will make. This new mac will house music, pictures, maybe a few videos and books, select apps, and that's it (that I can foresee). It will be my everyday, at-home laptop that I will stream on and use the internet on. The macbook air and the new macbook notebooks just look to fragile to me. I want it to be capable of breezing through imovie/photoshop stuff if I had to use it. 

I want something that isn't *too much* for my basic needs, but I also want something that is strong and sturdy enough (both mechanically/power-wise and physically) to last me for another bundle of years (and maybe even more than this current one). 

I don't feel like I need to retina display, so I am leaning towards the 13"" 2.9ghz with 4gb. But I can't grasp what difference would be made if I a.) went down in GHz or b.) went up in GB and got the retina.

I should be shocked but I saw this coming. Wendy has gone to my youngest sister (the GC) whenever she is upset. If u/Libida and I stand up to Wendy and DH you bet your ass Wendy is going to go crying to my sister before I get a chance to talk to her. GC has put herself in the middle on several occasions. Wendy cries to her about how mean we were for not letting her do whatever the fuck she wants. 

But we have had several talks with GC and have come to an agreement that she will remain neutral and we will avoid pulling her into it. We actually just had a conversation about two weeks ago where we talked about how GC is afraid she may have to live with Wendy when she gets her internship because it is unpaid. Also we mentioned several other shitty things Wendy has done that do not come to mind right now.

Fast forward to this past Saturday(&lt; a week NC with Wendy). It is my sister's birthday. Early in the morning I message her on facebook and say happy birthday to my little sis. She replies back with “ thank you big bro” or something. So I think all is well. u/Libida wakes up and tries to say happy birthday as well and can’t… She has been block. What a two faced cunt! I check her facebook wall and there is a soppy speak about how she is soo lucky to have such great parents who did a fantastic job at shaping her into the women she is today. We had an agreement. She did not even attempt to talk to us. u/Libida was devistated. She did not see this coming. I feared this would happen and I still had trouble processing it.

As mad as I was with my sister’s betrayal I was equally as mad with Wendy for her part in it. I really wanted to talk to my sister but as I mentioned this all went down around her birthday. As mad as I was I did not want to lose any hope of saving whatever fraction of our relationship I could get. I will probably never trust her again and she will never have my kids stay the night at her place but I do not want to lose her.

So I sent her a text. I pointed out that we needed to talk and we set a date to talk. I spent some time thinking but also kept myself busy. Thinking too much would shut me down. It was eating at me and I was not going to let the feelings win. Sunday came around and I had all weekend to think. I realized that Monday’s conversation is not going to go well. My sister has taken a side and is going to mad on my mom’s behalf or defensive about her own actions. I am pissed that she has broken our trust and taken sides. This conversation should wait. I sent her another text and she agreed. We have not set a time or date and I have no clue when she will come around. I really hope she does. I just finished losing my parents. As much as it was gratifying to go NC it hurt to realize my relationship with my parents would never get better. I do not want to loose my little sister too.

A big industry in downtown Los Angeles that dealt with many movie, tv and rock stars. Basically, offering rich and famous people services to handle their careers while also giving fresh faced wannabes the opportunities.

Katy was one of them, a young girl that wasn't even 21 yet dreams of making it in music, becoming a world known star. She had tried numerous times and had many meetings with companies to try and get her talent across to no avail. Eventually the money she saved up from her part time job while she was in school dried up and she had to pick up a job in L.A she she thought why not a business in a similar field to her dreams.

Katy remembered when she walked into the office for the first time, people couldn't believe what she looked like and you think they would be accustomed to seeing gorgeous people all the time. She had worn a pair of red 6 inch stilettos and a tiny pencil skirt that would of been the shortest a woman could wear. Thigh high stockings that hugged tight to her legs that were held up by clasps attached to a garter belt. The tight blouse she wore strained her rather biggest assets, her double DD breasts that were pushed up in her black bra. They bounced around as she worked around the office, attracting the attention of many guys. The man Katy worked for was always delighted to see her, his eyes filling up with lust as he looked her body over before leading her into his office and shutting the door.

Katy regularly wore clothes that brung her attention, it was always another pair of 6 inch heels, short skirts and stockings accompanied by a tight low cut blouse. Guys around the office started to talk about Katy, about how they would love to ram her as she bent over their desk. Many guys often tried to get with her but she always refused.

Soon Katy developed a reputation for being a strong feminist supporter. She thought that all men were pigs for treating women as nothing more than a pair of tits and ass with a pretty face. That's how Katy felt in meetings, guys would get sidetracked around her and just stare at her boobs or ass. They wouldn't take her seriously and thought that she was just a slut. She thought that guys only chatted to her because they wanted to fuck her and weren't even calling her by name around the office, she overheard them calling her by her big tits.

Though what Katy did, didn't always match up with what she said. She would scold men for staring at her body when she wore revealing clothing everyday. She would also find every excuse to bend over to give everyone a good look at her, regularly dropping things on the ground. She would get angry at guys all the time for flirting with her as they obviously wanted to fuck her but she would flirt with guys all the time brushing her hand near their groin and giving them a sexy, sultry look as she walked away.

One day the CEO came to the office and went to a meeting room with about 30 other businessmen. They were all aged between 50-80 years old. After about an hour, Katy was called into the meeting room. Jason, a fellow coworker had a desk right in front of the room, he watched her strut in their, clad in her tight clothes. She closed the door behind her. It must of been 4 hours until the doors opened again, with the old guys walking out with satisfied looks on their faces. They talked about how great that was and how they must do it again soon. Out Katy stepped as they finally all left. Her hair was disheveled while she was fixing her rumpled blouse and rolling down her skirt while carrying her stilettos. As she walked she pulled out a curly hair from her mouth and wiped away a bit of stickiness from her lips. Going to her desk and continuing work like nothing happened.

I want this role play to involve scenarios following the womens career such as trying to break into the industry (a lot of time spent as the secretary), dealing with the sudden fame, hook ups with celebrities, sex tapes, paparazzi, fans, relationships, becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol and turning into a nymphomaniac.

The prompt above doesn't have to be the start or involved in it... just an example of some writing.

Can be different and have a male celebrity and their journey. (Check out my 'Famous Life' posting in my post history for that)

I want to play the males the celeb will encounter. I want someone to play the main lead which will be the young female starlet. I would love for the young starlet to be Katy Perry or Kylie Jenner but I like a lot of other celebs as well such as Taylor Swift, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande, Megan Fox, Margot Robbie, Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Alba. Though.. the female celebrity can be an original character that is made up would love her to look like Madison Ivy or Lana Rhoades though also into Lindsey Pelas, Emily Sears and Claudia Alende.

I prefer to roleplay on Google Docs and use messengers to chat and set things up such as K , skype, yahoo msger and google chat/hangouts. Want this to be a long term rp

If you are interested and wish to talk about this further send me a message. Please make your message to me detailed and include any character/ scenario ideas, which celebrities you like and what platforms you use.

P.S Also have a recent posting in which I mention all the rp's and things I'm interested in for a long term rp, so check that out if you want, particularly interested in doing a Marvel Black Widow RP or a Post apocalyptic/dystopia world that is similar to Fallout.

Hey all. I graduated with a bachelor's in CS in August from Lamar University in Southeast Texas (Magna Cum Laude, 3.78 GPA) and my job search which is centered toward Houston, TX has turned up a few companies who are interested. I have gone to one interview and have another scheduled for tomorrow, but there has been a common theme with the jobs that have shown interest - low pay. 

The work experience portion of my résumé is quite weak perhaps compared to some others who were able to find an internship etc. during school. I am very much aiming at an entry level position having worked at a restaurant for 5 years to support myself through school (I am the manager and do IT support and manage their menu database however).

My question is essentially, is it ridiculous to expect a starting salary on par with the ""average"" entry level positions from sites such as GlassDoor and PayScale with no experience in the field? Is it common for fresh college graduates to accept jobs at ~40k while the supposed average for entry level CS jobs is around 50-60k? I do want to start gaining experience in software dev or web security ASAP but I want to make sure I don't sell myself short! 

Thanks in advance for any help/advice.

Also I am on mobile at the moment but I can post an anonymous résumé later if anyone would like to critique or advise me in that regard.

An internship abroad though seems like an in between, where I'd get to work for a company (I could be placed where I want, could probably do something healthcare related) and also have the experience. Not sure really... these are just thoughts and may never come to fruition, but I'm torn in what I'd do if I had the option. My OChem professor said if you did good in the class and he would take students to work in his research lab (he is really nice and working with carbon nanotubes, which I think is cool and plus it'd pay me, plus I got the third highest grade on our first exam so I'm getting there), and I think this would be the best looking for med school, but also the most cookie-cutter. Studying abroad and internshiping abroad seem cool and more like an experience, but studying abroad at least seems like not a big deal to med schools, and both of these would cost me money.

Not really sure what I'm asking, just looking for some thoughts.

If I get a job offer, which would likely happen in the next few weeks, I'd rather go Reserves and have the choice of picking a unit. I already talked to my PMS and HRA about this, and they mentioned that there is (or was in the past) a waiting list for cadets looking for Active Duty. Other than that they weren't too sure about switching with an incoming Reserves 2LT. 

Can anyone confirm the deadline when cadets currently assigned to Active Duty can switch component to the Reserves? "

We tried to visit every other weekend, but the first year was really tough for me since I didn't meet many other people to spend time with and she was always telling me about her new friends.  I got lonely and kind of jealous, which was an awful feeling and wasn't fair to her.  Eventually I became detached as a way to cope and we called and texted less between our visits.

After we graduated, we lived in the same city for several months. For the previous 4 years the longest time we had spent in the same place was 2 weeks during our winter breaks, so we were excited to spend time together.  For the most part we had a good time, but I found myself getting bored easily when we were just hanging out at one of our houses and I was more annoyed than concerned when she would get upset about things.

3 months later (about 3 months ago) I moved out of state for a job and she went to grad school. We're about 5.5 hours apart in good traffic.  The few weekends we've visited each other we've had a really good time, but between those times I've been feeling detached again.  I'm not really interested in her texts and I haven't been particularly looking forward to seeing her, even though I enjoy it when I do.

Are these just the side effects of long term / long distance relationships? What can I do to become more emotionally involved without going back to being lonely and jealous?  Our plan is to move in together for a while when she gets an internship.  I think it could help, but I don't want to become completely detached before then.

**tl;dr:  I feel emotionally detached from my long term long distance girlfriend and I'm afraid it will hurt our relationship in the future.**"

I've started doing Leetcode a few weeks ago to get to work on reviewing some data structure and algorithm skills for Java because most of my internship was in Python. 

So far, the easy questions aren't too bad for me. I manage to break down the problem pretty well and either come up with a brute force (that I figure out how to optimize afterwards ) or in some cases, a optimal solution. The only problems that ever comes up is minor syntax problems (missing a semicolon, forgetting a bracket etc) 

But then I'm trying to work on moving up to the medium difficulty problems and I struggle even to come up with a brute force implementation. I run into the issue where I start over complicating things to the point where I get myself confused about what I'm even doing. I guess I'm looking for any advice to help me improve my situation.

53xmpt,3,2016-09-22,Help me with some advice on getting a job/internship,tobythekat,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/53xmpt/help_me_with_some_advice_on_getting_a/,"Sorry for the super long post. It's my first, and I wanna give all the details.

I am a Junior at a University in Houston (transferred from a Community College), studying Computer Science. I also work 25 hours a week during the school year doing basic inventory for $11.33 an hour to get by, and split rent with my SO.

I really want to get an internship or some type of part time coding job, preferably in web development. I've been applying through my University career services page, and have heard back from two companies: 1 an unpaid internship, and the other a 3 month contract job at a small company that I interviewed at, and offered $5000 stipend to basically train me, with potential hire at the end of the 3 months. I didn't take that because it would have been too much of a risk for the low pay.
I've applied to a lot of jobs on indeed, all entry level and internships, and haven't been called for an interview.

I joined the CS club at my school, and have been talking to other students who have held jobs/internships. Some had no personal projects and interned at big companies like JP Morgan, and some had luck with smaller companies.

I have been working on web development in my free time, learning to code front end to back. So, html, css, javascript for the front, and python/flask, sqlite in the back. I have a website that features my projects, a contact form that goes directly to my email, nice bootstrap layout, form validations etc… I have two front end projects, a Weather App, and a Random Quote Machine that show I know how to use APIs, and small Python game I made in 24 hours for a competition between friends.

I showed one of my successful peers my website and he said “woah, this is a lot more than most of the people in the club have, you should put those on your resume rather that unrelated work experience”. So I did.

We had a CS career fair recently, and I talked with a few companies and they really seemed unimpressed. I tried talking about my projects, but they were all mostly interested in hiring Java and C# developers. One guy from a company I spoke to basically told me “its cool you've been working on web development projects, but you should focus on core languages like Java. I could make a website too, it wouldn't be the prettiest, but I could”. Is web development a lesser skill or something?

My older brother has been a developer for 8 years now, and I've been asking him for advice. He told me to keep working on projects like my website, build a couple more small web apps, and maybe pick up C# and .Net (he's a C# dev).

I would really accept any position that would pay me at least $15 just to get my foot in the door and get some experience. Anyone have any advice? Should I be shifting to different languages to fit in the job market better, or is it just Houston?

Much preciated."

53y2vp,4,2016-09-22,Having trouble composing that email? Here are some suggestions and templates for effectively writing to Congress.,mitraheals,kratom,https://www.reddit.com/r/kratom/comments/53y2vp/having_trouble_composing_that_email_here_are_some/,"I’m not a politician or a lawyer or anything like that, just been researching the most effective ways to write letters to congress lately (3 guesses as to why :). Here are some personal observations I have learned, that helped me compose my letter to my congresslady today. Hope they are of help…

Intro: Here you want to quickly grease the wheels and state clearly what it is you want. The greasing may take a little tweaking, depending on who your congressman/lady is. For example…

“Dear Honorable Representative [SpongeBob]: Thank you for the excellent public service you have provided our district throughout the years. I am writing to respectfully urge you to sign the Pocan (WI) / Salmon (AZ) Dear Colleague letter by close of business Friday, to delay DEA Scheduling on Kratom tea.”

“Dear Honorable Representative [CarlosDanger]: Thank you so much for getting the funding appropriations for our district’s highways last year! On my way into work, I noticed how fewer potholes there are in the roads, all thanks to you! I am writing to respectfully urge you to sign the Pocan (WI) / Salmon (AZ) Dear Colleague letter by close of business Friday, to delay DEA Scheduling on Kratom tea.”

“Dear Honorable Representative [GiaEarthGoddess]: Thank you for fighting the toxic and dangerous oil/gas/nuclear/flux capacitor industry for contributing to climate change. We need more Representatives like you if we are to save our beautiful planet. I am writing to respectfully urge you to sign the Pocan (WI) / Salmon (AZ) Dear Colleague letter by close of business Friday, to delay DEA Scheduling on Kratom tea.” 

…you get it. Say something positive about the guy/gal then say why you are writing them. Short and sweet, ideally customized to your Rep, although the first one is generic enough that it could be used on pretty much any of them – just try to tweak the wording a little to fit your style.

Middle: Here you tell them why you want them to sign. It can be scientific evidence, regulatory conflict, or a personal story. Or something even better that you came up with. Again, the best choice will depend on who your Rep is and what issues resonate best with them. Just keep it short and sweet. Remember an intern or at best a legislative assistant will be reading this, and they have hundreds a day to go through. Make every word count.

Scientific Evidence: (good all around for repubs and demos): “Dr. Edward Boyer, M.D. of the University of Massachusetts has studied Kratom tea extensively and found it to be useful in the treatment of chronic pain and the opioid crisis. Unlike opioids, Kratom tea doesn’t produce the deadly side-effects associated with opioids, such as repertory depression responsible for death in overdose. However, Kratom tea still helps people cope with their chronic pain long term. DEA Scheduling Kratom would be taking away a powerful weapon against the opioid crisis.”

Regulatory Inefficiency (best for repubs/conservatives): “The CRE has noted a regulatory conflict between DEA action and that of an ongoing NIH health grant to the University of Mississippi and the University of Massachusetts for study of the plant’s medicinal properties. By placing the plant in Schedule I, the DEA would effectively stop the NIH’s research on the plant, because there would be no legal avenue for the researchers to obtain it. This is yet another executive overreach/abuse of power by the Obama Administration &lt;-- only use last sentence when writing to Repubs!!!”

Personal Story (best for liberals/democrats): “I suffer with chronic [whatever] and was prescribed a host of pharmaceuticals, such as [the scarier the better]. It made me into a zombie/addict, unable/barely able to work/care for my children, have a good life/marriage, or participate in society in any meaningful way. However, after discovering Kratom tea, I got my life back entirely. I no longer take [scary opioid drug(s)] and haven’t for [X] years. I am now a productive full time student/mother/professional, all thanks to Kratom tea.”

End: Sum up what you said above by restating what you want the rep to do, again complete with a little grease.

“Representative [EightHundredDollarHaircut], I know you are very busy, but could you please call Rep. Pocan’s office regarding this matter? His office will answer any further questions you may have. Please sign the Pocan/Salmon dear collegue letter by close of business Friday. Thank you for your time/have a nice day. Your constituent, [firstname lastname]”

My $0.02. Hope it helps someone out there in redditland fight for the cause."

I'm currently in Paris for a small visit and I leave in a day and a half. Having been exposed to this wonderful city, I wanted to explore to possibility of relocating or temporarily working here. If I researched correctly, I basically need a company in Paris to sponsor me if I want to work here.

However, I just graduated in college a few months ago with a technical degree. So the jobs I'll be looking for would be in IT or programming. My problem is that I can only apply for an internship or entry level position. I can't seem to find much and I've tried applying to a few so far. Additionally, I only know basic French right now so that would also damper my chances.

Anyone know any ideas or would working here be in the realm of impossibility?

Thanks!

53zh79,0,2016-09-22,F4M Some fun scenes!,[deleted],dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/53zh79/f4m_some_fun_scenes/,"Hey there DPP, tonight I have a couple scenes for you all to choose from and/or work out with me!

We can discuss specific prompts in private and please, do not message me with a scene already started, that’s the easiest way to get blocked. The same goes for one line/word messages.

I'm fairly open with my kinks with my only hard ""no""s being scat, unrealistically huge cocks, 3rd person writing, and vomit.

Without further ado, here are some of my prompts:

**The Lawyer and the Con**: For this one, I was thinking I’d play a young and up and coming lawyer tasked with defending you. We can discuss the specifics in PMs but one thing is for certain, I’ll be taking my payment in the form of cock.

**Breaking the Law**: For this one, the roles are reversed, I was caught committing a crime and you’re the officer/journalist/detective who caught me. Where that leads? Well that’s up to you.

**Wrong neighborhood**: What happens when me, a young and sexy girl finds herself in the wrong neighborhood? Do you help me find my way or decide you want to take advantage?

**Sports Star and Reporter**: A classic scene were I’m a reporter and you’re the sports star, that can only lead one place, right?

**The intern and the boss**: Fairly self explanatory, I’d love to be the intern at her dream job who meets you, her boss and potentially so much more.

**Opposite Sides**: For this one, I want to play a FBI/CIA/DEA Agent who is tasked with infiltrating your organization, now what that organization does we can discuss in PMs but I basically want you to turn me from righteous agent of the law into your slut.

**I’m gonna fuck your sister**: For this one, you’ll play my little brother’s best friend, I’ll be his big sister who is now recently single and back in town. You guys always joked that you would fuck each other’s mom/sister only this time, you’re not joking.

**Giving back**: In this RP, I’ll play someone  famous be it an actress or singer or sports star. You’ll be the person tasked in helping me set up some sort of event to give back to the community, only you want me to give you something more than this event.

**Bullies always win**: In this one, you’ll be as the title suggests, you’re a bully who grew up terrorizing my son (or brother), only unlike the stories we tell our kids to make them feel better, you know better. You get what you want, when you want it, in this case, me.

For those of you so inclined, I do like playing celebs in any of these roles so we have visual aids, if you’d like me to be any, just ask!

As for celebs I’d play, here are a few, feel free to ask about ones not listed:

Celebs: **Mary Elizabeth Winstead**, **Maisie Williams**, Anna Kendrick, Selena Gomez, Hailee Steinfeld, Taylor Swift, Willa Holland, Daisy Ridley, **Melissa Benoist**, Emma Stone/Watson/Roberts, Hayley Williams, Alison Brie, Alexandra Daddario, Aubrey Plaza, Bella Thorne, **Alicia Vikander** Jennifer Lawrence, Keri Russel, Neve Campbell, Jennifer Connelly, Scarlet Johansson, Sophie Turner, Oliva Munn, Olivia Wilde, **Miranda Kerr**, Jessica Biel/Alba, Victoria Justice

YouTube/Social Media: **Meg Turney**, Lia Marie Johnson, **Alli Speed**, Barbara Dunkelman, Ashley Jenkins, **Bree Essrig**, Maude Garrett, Trisha Hershberger, Datev Gallagher, Lindsey Stirling, Christina Grimme, Dodger, iJustine, or Meghan Camarena.

Whew, that was a lot. Hope to get some dirty orangereds soon!

Just so we're clear, everyone I'm playing in this post is 18+, so the prompts would take place in the future."

Could use some help,TonyPepperoni25,networking,https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/53zk1p/this_voip_issues_has_been_plaguing_my_department/,"So I am an intern at a towns IT department and no one in our department can figure out why our VOIP phones can't keep a steady connection. We switched about 150 land line phones to our new VOIP phones (Cisco 3905 for teachers and 7841 for admins and secretaries) and we are having issues with very choppy quality on the calls. Any ideas as to what might be going wrong would be very appreciated! 

What we've ruled out so far:

- Our first thought was that our web filter wasn't setup for as many clients as were on it, but we upgraded our web filter to handle many more clients than is necessary and nothing changed.

- Personally (just an intern), I thought our switches weren't configured for full duplex. They all are.

- We run 10G fiber to our hub and then we were running 1G to each building but we upgraded the connection between buildings to 10G and nothing changed.

So current theories (I'll put a * next to my own personal [just an intern] theories)

- *Our 1G switches need to be 10G and all cable replaced with cat6 (this is an unrealistic move from a budget standpoint) 

- Most of the complaints we get are focused in certain regions (connected to certain switches) of our buildings, so that might be a lead. 

Thats really where we are at right now so any input would be very helpful! And any questions I can answer I will."

I'm a junior computer science student who just transferred into UMD and I'm I feel like I'm falling a little behind compared to my school mates. This week has been busy with all sorts of companies coming to recruit interns for their companies and I feel a bit left out. I have some experience in computer science outside of school and I'm currently in CMSC132. I love programming and have a great passion for computer related stuff. Even though CMSC132 is a bit of a tough course, I enjoy every bit of it and I'm looking forward to learn more programming skills outside of school. During high school I was modding games and doing basic scripting and during my freshman year in a community college I developed my own android game and published it on Google Play. Even though its not a sophisticated game, I feel proud of creating it. (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.faho.juggletballs) 

I know I have a lot more to learn and develop more skills to be in par with many computer scientists here. My game plan is to learn more about computer science and all the related stuff during my junior year and then start focusing on internships and such during my senior year. Is this proper? Will companies look down on me for beginning my internship during senior year, or even after graduating? 

I'm sorry for sounding so simpleminded but I'm just clueless and the transfer experience for me has been a bit daunting. Also, any tips on what companies look for on the resumes? Can I put basic skills that I have. Over the summer I learned basic HTML, CSS, and also SQL programming, not anything extensive though. Is it worth putting things like this?

53zllx,1,2016-09-22,F4A - The Dark Journey To Fame,Undisclosed_Desires7,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/53zllx/f4a_the_dark_journey_to_fame/,"Katheyn or what she preferred to be called Katy was the new intern at the company. A big industry in downtown Los Angeles that dealt with many movie, tv and rock stars. Basically, offering rich and famous people services to handle their careers while also giving fresh faced wannabes the opportunities.

Katy was one of them, a young girl that wasn't even 21 yet dreams of making it in music, becoming a world known star. She had tried numerous times and had many meetings with companies to try and get her talent across to no avail. Eventually the money she saved up from her part time job while she was in school dried up and she had to pick up a job in L.A she she thought why not a business in a similar field to her dreams.

Katy remembered when she walked into the office for the first time, people couldn't believe what she looked like and you think they would be accustomed to seeing gorgeous people all the time. She had worn a pair of red 6 inch stilettos and a tiny pencil skirt that would of been the shortest a woman could wear. Thigh high stockings that hugged tight to her legs that were held up by clasps attached to a garter belt. The tight blouse she wore strained her rather biggest assets, her double DD breasts that were pushed up in her black bra. They bounced around as she worked around the office, attracting the attention of many guys. The man Katy worked for was always delighted to see her, his eyes filling up with lust as he looked her body over before leading her into his office and shutting the door.

Katy regularly wore clothes that brung her attention, it was always another pair of 6 inch heels, short skirts and stockings accompanied by a tight low cut blouse. Guys around the office started to talk about Katy, about how they would love to ram her as she bent over their desk. Many guys often tried to get with her but she always refused.

Soon Katy developed a reputation for being a strong feminist supporter. She thought that all men were pigs for treating women as nothing more than a pair of tits and ass with a pretty face. That's how Katy felt in meetings, guys would get sidetracked around her and just stare at her boobs or ass. They wouldn't take her seriously and thought that she was just a slut. She thought that guys only chatted to her because they wanted to fuck her and weren't even calling her by name around the office, she overheard them calling her by her big tits.

Though what Katy did, didn't always match up with what she said. She would scold men for staring at her body when she wore revealing clothing everyday. She would also find every excuse to bend over to give everyone a good look at her, regularly dropping things on the ground. She would get angry at guys all the time for flirting with her as they obviously wanted to fuck her but she would flirt with guys all the time brushing her hand near their groin and giving them a sexy, sultry look as she walked away.

One day the CEO came to the office and went to a meeting room with about 30 other businessmen. They were all aged between 50-80 years old. After about an hour, Katy was called into the meeting room. Jason, a fellow coworker had a desk right in front of the room, he watched her strut in their, clad in her tight clothes. She closed the door behind her. It must of been 4 hours until the doors opened again, with the old guys walking out with satisfied looks on their faces. They talked about how great that was and how they must do it again soon. Out Katy stepped as they finally all left. Her hair was disheveled while she was fixing her rumpled blouse and rolling down her skirt while carrying her stilettos. As she walked she pulled out a curly hair from her mouth and wiped away a bit of stickiness from her lips. Going to her desk and continuing work like nothing happened.

-------------

I want this role play to involve scenarios following the womens career such as trying to break into the industry (a lot of time spent as the secretary), dealing with the sudden fame, hook ups with celebrities, sex tapes, paparazzi, fans, relationships, becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol and turning into a nymphomaniac.

The prompt above doesn't have to be the start or involved in it... just an example of some writing.

Can be different and have a male celebrity and their journey. (Check out my 'Famous Life' posting in my post history for that)

I want to play the males the celeb will encounter. I want someone to play the main lead which will be the young female starlet. I would love for the young starlet to be Katy Perry or Kylie Jenner but I like a lot of other celebs as well such as Taylor Swift, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande, Megan Fox, Margot Robbie, Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Alba. Though.. the female celebrity can be an original character that is made up would love her to look like Madison Ivy or Lana Rhoades though also into Lindsey Pelas, Emily Sears and Claudia Alende.

I prefer to roleplay on Google Docs and use messengers to chat and set things up such as K , skype, yahoo msger and google chat/hangouts. Want this to be a long term rp

If you are interested and wish to talk about this further send me a message. Please make your message to me detailed and include any character/ scenario ideas, which celebrities you like and what platforms you use.

P.S Also have a recent posting in which I mention all the rp's and things I'm interested in for a long term rp, so check that out if you want, particularly interested in doing a Marvel Black Widow RP or a Post apocalyptic/dystopia world that is similar to Fallout.

2) If I do email or call back, what should I write?

Any advice should help!

Edit:  Thank you everyone for their advice and comments, they were all very valuable and realistic input.

The company's Benefit
Healthcare - I am still reading through it, but they are average. 
Retirement 403(b) is 10% contribution 3 years vesting. 
Tuition reimbursement up to $1,600 per semester and 50% for the rest of the courses (Really great since I am currently taking classes as well)
Paid-Time Off - 4 weeks vacation + 9 days holiday each year= 5 weeks vacation it's not bad at all.

After reading everyone's comments I guess $42k with all the benefits are very good.  I am going to just ask for a 10% increase and see what happens. If they reject the counter offer, then I will take the job anyways because I get to work with Biostaticians, researchers, SAS, SQL, and I get to help people.  I am really excited because I am going to be learning so much this year with my new job, school, and internships.

Basically, i'm finishing my masters this november/december, and i'll be 27 (born in august 1989), but i'll only get the degree in 2017, since the examination board takes place each year, in june or in uly. (i'll probably get a certificate this year though)

I got my bachelor's degree when i was 24, took a year off, and then started my masters (in a well known business school in my country). It's also common to do it in 3 years because of the additional 6-7 months internship.

My work experience so far :
-7 months as a business analyst in Bangkok (my master's internship)
-2 years of basic jobs : assembling computers, being a salesman, being an assistant-accountant (idk what you call that)...
So, to sum it up, i have around 2 years and a half of job experience, and i'm graduating at 27, BUT getting the degree at 28.

I feel really bad about it, because i feel like it's not normal to be this late, i feel like people won't allow me to have a great career because i failed too many times, and i'm starting my career too late. I feel like i'm not even allowed to be an entrepreneur (my dream) because my profile is mediocre or something...

I had a severe depression when i was doing my internship in thailand (i'm from western europe though), because i saw many brilliant interns who finished their course around 23-24 years old. We had tons of interesting discussions, most of the time, because (and that's what hurts the most), i know i have the same intellectual facuties : i'm not and idiot, but i feel like people will always look at me in a weird way if they know that i got my degree at 28 (although i'm graduating at 27)

So there you go : every time i see someone brilliant (just had a conversation yesterday with someone who got his masters at 22, and his phd at 26-27), and although i know this man didn't think that i was stupid when we had this conversation...i kept thinking what if he knew how old i am?....

* **Total budget and country of purchase:** The Netherlands, but I can order from Amazon.co.uk too (if I don't have to pay any extra that way). Budget is 550/600 euros 613/670 USD. 

* **Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications to your requirements for the money? Pick or include any that apply.** I prefer a combination of both, I want a SSD (256GB) and a battery life of 5/6H if that's possible. 

* **How important is weight to you?** The laptop shouldn't be heavier than 6/7 lbs or 3 kg's. I prefer a metal case over plastic. 

* **Which OS do you require? Windows, Linux, Mac.** Windows, defo. 

* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** Yes, 15,6''. 

* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run. If you have no requirements, put N/A.** Microsoft Office, Internet, Youtube and such, Runescape (2007) and League of Legends (occasionally)

I know it's been a while since I've posted here, or on the slack, but I just wanted to let you guys know that I'm still doing kaizen, and improving in nearly all areas of my life (I still need to work on procrastinating less). I keep kaizen and its ideals in my mind almost constantly, and it helps to get motivated to do work, work out, eat clean, meditate, etc. I am keeping score of how well I am doing based on Path_of_change's formula and the trendilne on the graphs that I make using the number outputs is upward sloping, meaning that I am ""continuously improving"", which is great. 

To be honest, I was in a really dark place when I started kaizen. I was studying abroad in England, and with the crappy weather, huge school and lack of friends I was really really depressed. It got to the point that I was self-harming, too weak and tired to go to class or get out of my room, and was drinking to get drunk by myself everyday. My best friend told me about kaizen, and that's when I started meditating, going to the gym, eating clean and talking with him a lot about how to get rid of my depression. Although kaizen helped a lot, I was still drinking a lot and didn't realize that this was a problem until the summer. What happened was that I was still depressed at my summer internship, and continued to drink heavily after work. Although I was doing kaizen stuff, it was the drinking that was leading to my depression, so no amount of kaizen without me handling my drinking could make me feel better. Anyway, on July 26th, I had a breakdown at work and was sent to the psych ward for three days to get a handle on my life. I was fired from my internship and felt like I hit rock bottom. Since coming home early, I've managed to have a handle on my drinking, and have felt much much better. Without heavy drinking in my way, I could really deal with my depression, and through practicing kaizien, I've felt happy on a consistent basis for the first time in almost a year. It feels great to be doing the stuff that I know is right for me, turning my life around, and heading in the right direction with my mind, body and soul. I am a much more relaxed, chill and easy going person now that I have my life together, and my social life has improved as well. I f**king love kaizen so much, it's really changed my life. As long as I keep disciplined and stay with it, I feel confident that I'll be the man I truly want to be. "

During your upcoming lectures a lot of companies will advertise ""internships"". One of the big ones is college works painting. Long story short, they are a pyramid scheme. They make you pay for your equipment by using a line of credit and you also have to use your earnings to pay your workers. By the end of it all you will be making far below minimum wage. They also go out of their way to write reviews on websites such as glassdoor in order to make themselves look legit.

Any company that tries to find its workers by advertising in a lecture hall not legitimate. Real companies do not need to do this because in order to find good candidates, they go to job fairs, post adds on LinkedIn etc. in order to get driven candidates. **This does not apply to campus orgs** however as it makes sense for them to advertise this way. 

I have also never met anyone who was turned down from the job, everyone I know that interviewed both: 1. Got the job and 2. Told me the interview process was very weird and sketchy.

540y6h,32,2016-09-22,"Just got a job as a new grad (Engineer) with no networking, here is how it went.",GT540MGamer,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/540y6h/just_got_a_job_as_a_new_grad_engineer_with_no/,"**Background:** I graduated with a bachelors in Mechanical Engineering Technology in late July from a state school with a 3.2 GPA. Prior to my degree I was enlisted in the Marines for 4 years in a combat role (i.e. not something with a direct civilian equivalent, but I did have some technical experience with radio systems and obviously there's a big leadership aspect). I also have been a paid blog writer for 2 years (concurrent with school). So basically I had some good experience, but not in the engineering field.


**Job Hunt:** 40 applications, 30 of which had unique cover letters, using one of 3 main resumes that I slightly tweaked; Design Engineer, Manager, and Marketing. I applied to entry-level jobs for which I was pretty clearly qualified (Meaning I met 75-100% of qualifications listed in job posting) My only callback led to an interview, and my single interview got me an offer. 


**What Worked:** 

* My callback was from a staffing firm, not a big company with their own hiring people. I think that's what helped get my resume in front of a human being, which is the primary hurdle. Big companies have so many applications to sort through and do a lot of that sorting with software.

* The job I got was posted on Indeed which was where I found the majority of jobs to apply to.

* Dressed to impress for my interview. Full suit (bought the day prior) even though the typical dress code is a tucked in polo shirt. There was specific mention of my attire pleasing them, so even though it's a well-known rule it does still get people's attention in a good way.

* I had things on my resume besides my education. My GPA wasn't stellar but my interviewer said he really just liked to see someone that ""had done *something*"" He liked my involvement in a school organization (it was on my resume) so don't discount things like that if you were in some sort of active role.


**the interview:** Like they say, if you get the interview then they already think you're qualified, what they really want to know is if they'll enjoy working with you. I've waited tables over the past year which has helped tremendously with general interaction skills (Those of you still in school, the money can be pretty good too). I would say half of my interview (2 hours total) was really just chit-chatting. A good portion of my interview was discussing the duties of the position and the business of the company, with a pretty equal split between the interviewer just filling me in, and me asking specific questions. Overall I think what worked was my candor, and my genuine interest in the position. Salary was the very last thing we discussed and it was pretty straightforward, ""What would be a comfortable salary for you?"" There are a lot of people that are big into negotiation here but I had a figure walking in based on the job description and the national and state averages for that and I gave it to them. They offered me the job at that rate after they interviewed their final candidate. 


**Advice**

* One thing I would have changed is my transparency in dealing with both the staffing firm and the interviewer. I'm great at having fluid engaging conversations and getting along, but I'm also sometimes overly honest and informative. I tipped my hand in the interview that I had a specific position I was looking into at another company (out of state) with personal contacts in the company and which would pay substantially more. What I should have done was remain vague. ""I'm very interested in this position, and if offered I expect to be able to make a decision by X date"" would have been a better way to explain my situation. The other job didn't pan out just because too much was up in the air and wouldn't be resolved until this opportunity had come and gone. 


* Take what you can get. The salary offered is comfortable, but it's entry level for sure. This led to some really silly feelings of wanting to wait for a better gig to come along even though I'm scraping by as-is. Getting called back and having a good interview boosted my ego and made me forget the frustrations of job hunting. Try and remember that if you applied for it, it is a job you wanted! 

* Remember that sometimes a posted job is already filled. I had a few jobs that I applied to where I was a PERFECT fit. One in particular looked to make use of every professional skill I had through experience and not one thing I wasn't clearly qualified to handle. I pursued it as hard as I could, even contacting a recruiter through the company on Linkedin and having her forward an email to the hiring manager. Not even a callback or phone screen. This was really demoralizing so it's important to remember that it is really just a numbers game. That sucks for sure, but now that you know the rules you can better play the game. 

* Create a few resumes tailored to positions you're interested in and attach cover letters with blank fields that you can easily fill in to quickly customize it for a specific company. You can't pour your heart and soul into every application and still generate the numbers needed to get seen. I had actually sent the wrong resume in response to the job posting, but since the key information was the same throughout all of them, it didn't seem to matter.

* do an internship! I thought I didn't need one because of my work history, but the real value in an internship is the company contacts. Those are huge! 


It feels great to get hired and I'm excited about beginning my professional career. I turned to this board a lot during my job hunt for advice and inspiration so I'll happily answer any questions in order to help those who are still in those shoes. "
5419jx,5,2016-09-22,Just got fired from my job at a student media position. Quit my retail position to work for them. Currently unemployed and waiting for a response from my old retail job. How to stop ruining my career?,photodummy,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/5419jx/just_got_fired_from_my_job_at_a_student_media/,"I guess fired isn't necessairly the right phrasing.  It's more like unamicable un-pairing.  

Basically what happened is I wasn't pushing out work as fast or as frequently as they wanted me to.  I was hired based on some work I did prior to working there and the work I did (not to toot my own horn) was demonstrably better than the work their current team was putting out.  So they hired me on as an employee, and things seemed to be going fine until about last week.  I was called in and they let me know that I need to speed things up and make more of an effort to get content out faster and I needed to communicate more with the other members of my staff. I responded frequently in our group chats but apparently that wasn't enough and none of my peers made that apparent.  

So I show up for work on Weds of this week to try to get some projects done and I'm pulled into the office with one of my peers and the ""production manager(?)"" and I'm basically made to come up with a reason for them to keep me on at my position.  They decided they could find someone else to do the work I was doing because they believed that they would push that work out faster.  They said they didn't want me to grovel, but that's essentially what they wanted me to do.  

Apparently the staff was contacting the supervisor rather than contacting me personally.  Rather than try to work things out with me personally they just went around my back and complained to her instead, and rather than really give me an opportunity to explain myself or even start a dialogue with other members of the team.  I'm simply told that my options were to either accept an unpaid internship position or leave.  So I leave.  

Due to some prior poor financial decisions I racked up a little over 10,000 dollars in CC debt and over 27,000 dollars in student loan debt.  I made mistakes.  


Forgive my ranting, I'm as upset with myself as I am them.  I keep seeming to burn bridges and draw rifts in my professional relationships.  I've been incredibly lazy most of my life, and I'm just now starting to get out of it, I'm trying to make some significant changes in my life but it seems like I keep finding myself falling into similar ruts.  I was so excited to even get the job because it was something that wasn't retail which I had been working uninterrupted for over three years and it seems like I'm going to be falling back into that.  How do I stop this cycle of failure?  I really would like to be a successful human being but I keep finding myself back at square one.  "

I'm having a tough time right now, and would like to talk. I am going to begin mental health counseling next week, but something came up recently... and I don't really have anyone to talk to since it's pretty personal.

I won't go into a lot of details to spare you... and me... from a 99-page-long rant, but I'll try to explain the best that I can my situation. As a disclaimer, this is a pretty long post - so I apologize in advance.

So I just graduated from college last month, and my major was a tight-knit group of 22 people. 3 guys, 19 girls. During the beginning of this two-year program I got to be great friends with one of the other guys, lets call him x.

Here is the cliff notes of our relationship up until now:

We get to be almost best friends

He comes out as gay and says he really likes me*

After a few days of thinking, I tell him I don't feel the same way. I'm not gay... as far as I know.

We continue being friends

There is consistent tension between the two of us

We get in fights fairly often

Try to be good friends

We have lots of good times

But also lots of bad times

It is not healthy for my mental health

We apply together for a quarter-long internship at the same hospital

Both get accepted

I have spent 2 years with this guy and the bad times are now outweighing the good

...

He is really emotionally manipulative and it is hard for me to continue being his friend.


Okay. Skip to the end of the summer internship, and nearing our undergraduate graduation. We get in a fight, and I try to make it clear that I don't want to be friends with him any more. He is SO DEEPLY ATTACHED to me... and admits that he is... that he cannot come to terms with the two of us not being together forever. It seems to me like he is in love with me, and has never gotten over the fact that I am not into him the way that he is into me. It's overwhelming.

Anyways, I'm sure that I'm missing a lot of details, but I'm gonna skip ahead anyways.

So yesterday was his birthday. My mental health is not that great, and it's hard for me to stop being friends with him. Up until this point I know (or at least I think I know) it's what I want, since he has caused me so much (seemingly unnecessary) pain. He is incredibly emotional and drags me down with him when he is upset. I am done with it... but since we have been so close for the past 2 years, it is hard for me to sever that relationship. 

He invited me to his birthday, but at this point (a month after graduation) I cannot be around him. It's hard for me since he invited a bunch of friends  IN A GROUP TEXT to this place in town.

I decline the offer, and stay vague that I am not able to make it.

So here is where the shit begins.

He posts a very passive aggressive post on his facebook, not saying names but that he gives the world and is sad that he receives nothing back.

This is typical - he has done this many times and expects me to console him. I have many times, and I feel like I have conditioned him to keep doing that. That's not healthy for either of us - for him to be PUBLICLY upset every time that he wants attention from me. again... I am done with it.

So the night goes on, and I get a text from one of our friends saying she hopes that I will come to dinner. I apologize again, and say that there are family health issues that are going on in my life (which is true - my dad went through surgery a few days ago and is nervously waiting for the results... but that's a story for a different day).

The next day (today), I get a call from him... which I didn't answer because I do NOT want to talk with him. Frankly, I am fed up with his needy tendencies, and can't give in to him any more. He is just going to rant at me. But then, I get a text message IN THE ORIGINAL GROUP CONVERSATION WHERE X INVITED US TO HIS BIRTHDAY saying:

""(my name) are you seriously not gonna do anything for my birthday ... I'm really hurt right now...""

Him and I haven't talked in over a month. I sent him a one sentence reply to his initial invitation, but nothing after that.

It is embarrassing to me, and (hopefully in retrospect) to him too... and this behavior is typical for him too! He will do something that is fucking crazy, and then be in tears apologizing later. One time, despite me telling him repeatedly to stop contacting me and specifically NOT to come to my apartment, he left a series of ~5 voicemails, i had ~30 missed calls from him, and then HE KNOCKED AT MY DOOR. Needless to say, that was a scary day. In fact.. that was probably when I decided he and I couldn't be friends after graduation.

Anyways...

So now our group of friends (probably about 5 other in the group text) are totally aware that he is incredibly upset at me, which is NONE OF THEIR GODDAMN BUSINESS!

I haven't replied back, and it has been a few hours now. But I can't perpetuate, congratulate, or continue reinforcing this kind of behavior any more. It is fucking nuts, and through him publicly yelling at me in the group message with all our friends, it seems like he is (unknowingly/subconsciously) trying to sabotage my friendship with our mutual friends.

I don't know if I should ignore that, contact him, send a message back to the group... or what. I was thinking I could write something back, staying professional, and saying ""hey, im sure that was meant for just me, and I'm sorry you have to hear about our personal business"" or something like that or..... I don't know man.

TL;DR: Eh, sorry guys, don't really want to sum up my personal life in a one-sentence synopsis. "

* Try my luck at other companies. And possibly *renege* if I do get something I like at another company. Sounds really *risky*, but would you recommend it in my case?

* Work on iOS dev at the said company this summer, and actively look for full-time opportunities at other companies during my internship. This sounds like something I wouldn't want to do, more like a last resort. More importantly, if my classes + research + personal projects are machine-learning oriented, but my internships are not, will I be able to get a machine-learning related full time job?

* Any other ideas from the Redditers here?

Thank you! :)"

He is in grad school and I have a very fulfilling and successful career in the city we reside. My last serious relationship lasted 3 years and we were engaged. I was forced to end things due to infidelity and emotional abuse and it completely wrecked me. Since then, I have spent 2 years dating around. I finally met my boyfriend and things clicked. I am his first girlfriend – he spent many years studying, being anxious and reclusive and he tends to be on the quiet side (i.e. awkward on first dates). I am the exact opposite in every way – super talkative, outgoing and I have no problem being an initiator. Everything we do together has been some kind of a first for him. It worried me early on but now I’ve grown to enjoy being involved in many of his “firsts.”


For three months out of the six we have been together, he was in another city about an hour away for an internship. We saw each other on the weekends only. Because of this, and because of his inexperience, we have moved slowly. He has since moved back and we have spent most of our days together since then. I believe we are hitting the point in the relationship where it’s time to decide if we are going to become serious.


Since he moved back at the end of August, he has shared his feelings with me more than he ever has before. He has told me that I have helped him come out of his shell and that he feels like he’s really growing as a person as a result of dating me. When he told me these things, my heart was pounding. I was waiting for him to finally say those three little words but he got flustered and the conversation faded off. I wasn’t worried though – I thought it was all a good sign that we were moving forward and heading in a more serious direction with our relationship.


Earlier this week, he very casually mentioned to me he was looking into school/work in different states. He has never lived anywhere other than the city we live in and he thinks it will be good for him. I agree and support him. I've lived in many different states and countries since I was young and they were amazing, super formative experiences for me. I think he needs to have those experiences outside of his hometown and I would never stand in the way of better job/education opportunities. This move would be a year from now –  next September.


Unfortunately, these comments have forced me to rethink the way things are going in this relationship and where it's headed. I am torn on what this means for our relationship and for me. Is it better for me to cut and run now? I am really falling in love with him at this point… but I do not want to invest in a relationship that looks like it has a firm expiration date. Even if things were still going strong, I don’t think I could handle a long distance relationship without becoming an anxious, jealous mess.


I confided in him about this last night, and told him I was feeling a little torn up. Honestly, I know this is a decision that is ultimately up to me and me alone, but I was hoping he’d give me a little direction. Really, I was just looking for any kind of insight into what he would prefer to do. He was quiet for a while and eventually cuddled me and told me he enjoyed spending time with me. He said, “You’re a great girlfriend. You’ve been great first girlfriend.” That addendum gutted me. It made me feel like shit. Not only were his comments vague and ultimately unhelpful, they made me feel like some sort of placeholder or starter girl to give him experience before he moves away and finds a better life, better girlfriend, etc.  


I was tired and needed to think, so I quietly thanked him and I drifted off to sleep. I woke up a few times during the night to find him awake, sitting up in bed or anxiously pacing around the room. At one point, I asked him what was wrong and he told me he had a cramp. He got back into bed and planted some really sweet, passionate kisses on me and I fell back asleep. I haven't heard from him since I left for work this morning. I don't know what to think about any of that except for that it's strange and unlike him.


I guess I’m sitting here at a loss wondering how to feel about things. Should I let the chips fall where they may and worry about this closer to the time when he will be moving? (Maybe we’ll have come to be in love, maybe we’ll have already broken up?) Or should I just end this now and not gamble with my heart any longer?


Thoughts, reddit?

TL;DR — My boyfriend of 6 months will be leaving the state in a year. I am starting to fall in love with him. Do I prematurely cut and run and save myself the heartbreak? Or do I stay in this relationship and continue to invest on the off chance that the situation may change?"

541zba,5,2016-09-22,Thoughts on OData?,TimeBomb006,dotnet,https://www.reddit.com/r/dotnet/comments/541zba/thoughts_on_odata/,"I have been working with OData recently as an API consumer, and I am curious why I don't see it come up often in discussions here because I find it quite enjoyable.

My colleague wrote an API, essentially mirroring a CQRS style service.. specific endpoints for commands and domain centric queries (for single objects), and OData controllers for retrieving IEnumerable results (allowing the consumers, a mobile app written in Xamarin and an admin interface in .NET MVC, to craft their own app-specific queries). OData integrates well with Kendo UI components, so even our intern (who wrote the web app) was able to pick it up quickly.

Is there something I'm missing? It seems like a great
 solution yet I see very little discussion, and unsurprisingly, few public APIs which expose OData endpoints. I understand the argument to keep business logic in the service,  away from the consumer, but I feel like it's a happy trade-off, as it's not really core business logic but app-specific queries with little domain value. My coworker mentioned some pitfalls, like consumers being able to expand the result set and access domain entities that are intended to be private, but he disabled that functionality. 

What are your thoughts?"

There are not many black and Latino computer science graduates but there are more than enough of them. I know talented black coders that went to top schools (Ivies, etc) who can't get jobs are in debt but the average white or Asian guy can get a job. And these men are actually talented.

In my case I am a black female engineer at a PhD level who went to an Ivy and is now going to an even better institution.
If it weren't for CODE2040 I wouldn't even have an internship. 
We've all heard stories of white(-presenting) people who drop out of college and get a coding job (not that there is fundamentally anything wrong with that) but do people really think the tech world is fair? The only ""diversity"" really exists for white and Asian women. 

**I don't know why this is bothering people, this is the God-honest truth**

An example is Isis Anchalee....even if I wanted to, I couldn't be like Isis Anchalee and I've been an engineer before it was trendy and hipster to do so.

5421ih,11,2016-09-22,"First week as a junior, totally lost",confuseddev7,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/5421ih/first_week_as_a_junior_totally_lost/,"So it's my first week. My first assignment was working on a bug fix. I didn't really understand the code I was changing, and the senior pretty much held my hand through it. I wanted to try and understand it a little more, so I asked him if he could explain what the module we were working on did. He may as well have been speaking Chinese. 

I looked at pieces of the code on my own and tried Googling to get a better understanding of it, but for the life of me I'm just totally lost. Everyone says to ""ask a lot of questions"", but using the Chinese example again, if you showed up to school one day and your teacher and the other students only spoke Chinese, would asking questions help anything? That's where I feel I'm at. 

My family/friends keep trying to assure me that this is normal for starting a new job, but I can't help but feel like this is beyond normal levels of confusion. I didn't do an internship, I didn't have any major projects before this. I actually raised this concern with my manager in my orientation meeting and he sort of waved it off with a ""don't worry, we'll be starting you on something simple"" comment. But I just worry that he doesn't realize the level of incompetence he's dealing with here, and my definition of ""simple"" is much different than his. I never excelled in my algorithms or discrete courses, I was just kind of ""let off"" with a B or a B-. I did fine in programming classes, but I've never seen anything remotely close to this codebase.

How long do you expect to feel totally lost in my shoes? At what point should I start wondering if I'm maybe not cut out for this? Now?"

I'm really trying!! That said, I will try and keep this short and to the point. Thanks for reading and any advice!

I attend a very small public university [Less than 1,000 people] for the past two years. Last year, I had a four hour long class that basically met everyday of the week. On the first day we were put in groups and I met my good friend who I will call C. 

I am a somewhat introverted person who is extremely socially anxious and has difficulty connecting with people as a result. C is a very outgoing person who gets along well with everyone, and I originally thought he was talking to me a lot in part because we are stuck in the same group. However as the semester progressed he went out of his way to invite me to events and gatherings, text me things at 2:30 in the morning, etc. 
I thought he was just being friendly, but it wasn't until he made the comment to me in which he referred to both us as being straight that I thought there could be something more. I kindly corrected him and told him that I wasn't straight but bi, and was in a relationship at that time with a girl. I could tell he was a bit saddened by this, not really upset, but definitely taken aback. 

Fast forward through the year and we remain very good friends even after our long class together ends and we see each other rarely. Over the summer we talked briefly a couple of times about various school things, but nothing too long. Then, out of the blue, he texted me about how he was going to have surgery. I asked him what day it was, his response was in thirty minutes. I asked for clarification of the day, not how long the surgery was going to be. He replied with a picture of himself in a hospital bed with the caption ""In 30 minutes."" 
It was a bit weird that he decided to talk to me right before, but I brushed it off as him trying to spark up a conversation. I went out of my way to talk to him everyday after that, stay up late with him if he was going through a tough time, and lament about how crappy post-surgery recovery is. 

When school started back up we learned that we were neighbors and our rooms were right next to each other. We try and hang out all day once a week to catch up and talk about how life is, but both of us are very busy and the workload at our school is very intense. 
However he did talk about his past relationships to me one night, in part because a mutual friend had asked him out on a date. 
During that conversation he told me particularly about one girl back home who he has been interested in. However neither one of them wanted to pursue a relationship with one another due to not wanting to pursue a long distance relationship among other things.

It was during this conversation that some other things clicked for me. The girl he was interested in, K, is evidently very similar to me. As in, he has made multiple comparisons between me and her on different occasions, both in how we act, dress, interests, comments we've made, etc. over the year I have known C.
Suddenly comments he made to me in the past year made sense, his random texts at 2:30 in the morning, his disappointment at learning I was in a relationship with a girl last year. And this was all basically cemented by the multiple other people who asked me if we were dating because of how we interacted with one another. 

Other notable things: He really wants me to come visit him over the summer on the west coast so I can meet his friends and family, to the point he went out of his way to let me know about potential internships in the area that I could pursue.
He told me after the conversation where he mentioned his feelings for K that I am now one of his closest friends as he very rarely speaks about that or his past relationships with anyone.
I am his closest friend at our college as is he to me. 

That is more or less where I am now. I do like him a lot and think any relationship with him would be super healthy and fulfilling, but I am way too socially anxious to outright ask him if he has feelings for me. I don't want it to ruin our friendship or make things awkward, and in addition I don't want it to make it seem like I am betraying his trust... Especially after our conversation about his past relationships which he was very guarded about prior.

Also, us and three other friends are going on a week long vacation to the beach within the month, so I don't want to make that awkward or weird either by this whole thing. But at the same time I want to know and I am tired of pussyfooting around the topic....
It's to the point that I feel like I am reading way too much into his actions and maybe nothing is there, and that is also feeding into my anxieties. 
 
  **TL;DR:** I want to ask my friend about his feelings towards me but I don't want to betray his trust or make things weird if I happened to misread the situation. How do I ask him without potentially damaging our relationship or hurting him?

I have 63,000 in student Debt. I pursued a BSc in Mining Geology and watched the commodity market crash ( and where it has remained) in 2012  - the year I graduated. I then went on  to complete a MSc in Petroleum Geoscience only to watch the oil collapse 6 months before I graduated and now in the worst oil downturn in over 30 years.  The best part is? The only way to get a job as a geologist is to essentially get an internship in school - however, I watched them all fold as the markets crashed, and now I am told if you are underemployed for more than 2 years they will never hire you.

So here I am with a 3.6 gpa and I can't even get a fucking interview for a job because I am not a student anymore, I am now a graduate. 

The plan - Go get a BSc in Computer Science, Go get a BSc in Engineering. Rack up another 80,000k of student loans and then leave to India, Chile, Japan or some other country and never pay them back.

I'm a sophomore year college student who is going for an MIS major this year. I'm trying my best to be competitive and get into the major. I've don't a bit of research as to what the major entails and the experiences from MIS grad students have, I have a few questions. If this isn't the correct place, do direct me in the right path please.

 I guess one factor as to why I'm posting is I'm slightly concern about my college's ""55%"" acceptance rate. They say I need a 3.6 GPA (which I can get no problem, sitting at 3.4 atm) along with an essay and a resume but I'm fearful that I might not get the major since only half of the applicants get in and my backups are a heavy downgrade. I'll start with this as my first quesiton.

* Since I have a passion for Computers, I've been self teaching myself coding in my little spare time (HTML5/CSS/C#). If I don't get in, what's a similar major to MIS that I can take?

* What exactly are the requirements for an MIS job? If I can learn C# along with HTML 5/CSS, will it help me? I have messed around with coding from video game mods to bots for programs like Discord (Voice program) but I wouldn't say that I created anything significant, just more or less play around with stuff to get a feeling for it. So far it's interesting to me.

* What should I do to better my chances at getting the major and getting a job with the major after graduation? I am looking at internships and so far I have a family friend who works at a Water company that would be glad to have me.

* From what I gathered, MIS jobs prefer people with an understanding of coding and good social skills. Is this accurate? If so, I am in the process of learning coding and I have great social skills. I'm a part of 3 campus clubs and am a PR Member for an online organization with around 10k~ members.

Forgive me for the long post, I just want to make sure that Management Information Systems is not only the major I'm looking for, but the major I like and will succeed with, along with backup plans if I don't get into the School of Business.

542njw,2,2016-09-22,(23/m HL DB?) Am I heading for trouble?,deadrooms55,DeadBedrooms,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/542njw/23m_hl_db_am_i_heading_for_trouble/,"My girlfriend and I are both 23 and we've been together for 2 years and we currently live together (about 3 months).

The first portion of our relationship (before we moved in together) we were having sex semi-frequently, probably 2 or 3 times a week  when we found ourselves alone (both lived with parents). When we moved in together I thought that would increase with us being alone more often, and it did a little bit. Probably 3 or 4 times a week for the first month or so. 

After that first month, she got a new job (was previously working midnights, same schedule as I am on) that is a standard 8-5(7-6 really with commute) M-F office job. With me working midnights and her working mornings it really doesn't effect our time together too much, she goes to sleep around 1030 when I go in to work, leaves when I get home and I wake up around when she gets home from work. She is also going to school Tuesday Wednesday Thursday after work to finish her bachelors. 

Ever since she started her new job our sex frequency has dropped to probably about twice a week (usually once on her off days and once maybe during the week). Anytime I would attempt to initiate sex I would get the I'm tired response or something like that. It has caused a couple fights because she said my attitude changes after I get rejected, she says I sound sad, which maybe it does change. 

I brought up to her that it bothers me the frequency we have sex and has told me that she feels like I put too much emphasis on sex, feels like I always want sex and that turns her off. She said if I put less emphasis on sex and made it feel less forced (I guess me trying to kiss her and touch her while we are cuddling is forcing it?) we would probably have sex more often. That was two weeks ago, and I have no mentioned sex, I have not initiated kissing or touching her while we are cuddling and I have tracked how often we had sex in those 2 weeks and it is still twice a week.

She has also told me a reason for her not wanting sex recently is she doesn't want to spend 30 minutes having sex when she only has 4 or 5 hours of free time after work. That is really what has caused concern for me, because the job she got is an internship for what she is going to school for, her shift is going to be a standard 9-5 the rest of her life. That makes me nervous because I don't think I'm content in a relationship where I'm only having sex maybe on her days off.

Our relationship is good outside of this, shes really caring, I can tell she loves me and is just great overall. But I just cant help but think I'm fucked here. I don't feel like I should only be having sex twice a week at 23. I feel like it is only going to get worse. I have a high libido and usually end up jerking off after she goes to sleep, and that is kind of depressing.  

Am I heading for trouble? What should I do in this situation? Thank you anyone for help, I really appreciate it."

I'm working at my current full-time job until May 2017 when I graduate and can really only take positions after that. I need to stay at the job I'm currently working since it offers flexibility, pays my current bills, and I can take a full courseload. I can't afford to take an internship or full-time next spring semester because then I won't be able to take my 15 credit hours and finish my undergrad with 150 hours.

It seems likely that the firm in question (smaller regional firm) was going to invite me for an on-campus interview since I connected well with the recruiter at the career fair, have been emailing with their HR director for about a year, and have spoken to their partner as well, and it's too late to withdraw the application.

This would be one of the top firms I would like to work for at some point, but obviously this position won't work out. What's the best way to word this with the firm? I feel like I've probably ruined my future chances with them.

542uqs,1,2016-09-22,Advise for undergraduate student ?,sbgm,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/542uqs/advise_for_undergraduate_student/,"Hello everyone,
I am currently a senior in an AASCB school with a 3.3 GPA about to graduate this coming May and just had some questions to ask. After getting my undergrad, I want to get my graduate degree so that I can sit down for my CPA exam in a year. The thing is I anticipate working after I finish my undergrad (Currently married and have a child) therefore I am mostly thinking about taking my graduate degree online. Do you think it might be possible for me to work full time and also be able to manage getting my graduate degree ? My other question was since my undergrad is from an AACSB school, does it matter if I choose a graduate school that isn't ? Will it ruin any job prospects with big 4 etc or affect me at all ?

On another note, I recently had on campus interviews for some internships and among those interviews was one with a big four. I am not sure how my big 4 interview went ( had 5 interviews overall with different firms) but the thing is they said they will let me know of a decision in the next 1-4 weeks. The thing is that I already have office visits from other firms this week and I really want the big 4 but I am worried that if I hold off the other offers and end up not getting a big 4 I might end up loosing all of them and graduate with zero accounting experience. I don't want to accept an offer then rescind it for a big four offer, what do you guys suggest I do ?

Would it also be possible to get an internship with a local firm or something and then apply to big 4 again ? I also got an offer from RSM, is it comparable to the big four ?

Thank you all for the advise I would really appreciate it."

**Target schools**: H/S...if there's an ROI case to be made for anything other than H/S I'd like to hear it, because right now my third option is to try for product management positions at a place like Uber, Netflix, etc. and just skip the MBA.

I actually already submitted my application to Stanford this cycle, but wanted a profile review to get some ideas about things I can do for next year when I inevitably apply again. Maybe try for R2 Harvard if I don't hear back from Stanford for an interview.

I've already completed an internship at a big tech company and will be looking for full-time jobs next summer/fall. This semester, I have to choose between doing machine-learning research and a deep-learning grad course (I can't squeeze in both). Which one should I do?

* Research: It focuses on analyzing the video and audio content of videos to understand what's in them, employing a variety of machine-learning approaches from deep learning to supervised feature-based methods. I might get a publication from this, should I choose to do this for a year. The coding work will be in Python (Theano maybe).  **Stuff that goes on my resume: the research experience itself + potential publication.**

* Grad course: It's about deep neural nets with assignments where we develop stuff like ConvNets and RNNs from scratch. There's also one final team project where we take a state-of-the-art paper in the literature of deep learning (stuff like ResNets, WaveNets etc.) and implement it in code by ourselves, reproducing or bettering the results of the paper. It's pretty similar in content to [Stanford's CS 231N](https://cs231n.github.io), except it covers stuff beyond ConvNets and focuses on other applications like speech recognition.  **Stuff that goes on my resume: the grad course itself + iPython course assignments on GitHub + TensorFlow final project on GitHub.**

Which one of these two would be more useful to have on my resume for a full-time machine learning engineer job? Thanks!"

I finished my first year of law school, squeaking by with subpar grades. During my summer, I did an internship in my hometown of New York City. Toward the end, I had my first full blown manic episode. I had to be hospitalized and put on Depakote, Risperdone, and Cogenten. Then I returned to law school, confident I would be able to tackle anything. After a couple of weeks, I could barely handle the stress and I cracked, threatening to harm myself. I was taken to the hospital nearby and I was hospitalized for a week.

I feel like a failure. It's a prestigious law school top and I felt like shit because of my grades, feeling suicidal. It's still hard for me to overcome that sense of failure even know. I feel like my life is falling apart and that I can't trust my judgment on anything. What if I'm just delusional about any plan or goal I come up with?"

We spend massive amounts of time and money on our education. We dedicate ourselves to lives of working most Friday nights and weekends instead of going out and enjoying life. We cut hours of sleep off our schedules every week so we can finish all the work we need to finish. We push ourselves to the mental limit so when we succeed, we are stronger and we can keep pushing further. 

So, in the eyes of a company, why is all of that pointless if we don't have a 3-month internship on our resume? I understand having experience is good, but why is the internship a firm make or break aspect for so many companies? Internships aren't the only method of gaining experience.

I don't want any tips or advice on what I should have done, I just want to discuss the current situation of engineering education and industry."
54375k,5,2016-09-23,21M in need of advice,woodunderfrank,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/54375k/21m_in_need_of_advice/,"I'm a 21 year old guy who met a 30M foreign graduate student in my hometown (in the US) a little over a year ago, while while we were both interning there. We only saw each other a few times that summer to hang out, cuddle, watch movies together etc., and I originally had no intention of seeing or talking to him ever again once we both went back to school. For some reason, I felt a compatibility with him that I've never felt with anyone else despite only having a few encounters with him, but I went back to school assuming that I'd just forget about him after settling back into my routine. As you can imagine, that didn't happen, and the urge to see him again remained in the back of my mind as the school year passed. After a few months without us talking, I emailed him to see how he was doing. This started a long chain of emails and FB messages, in which I got to know him more and more, and that's when I realized I was possibly developing feelings for him. We agreed that if the opportunity arose, we'd try to see each other again.

Fast forward to the last few months of the school year. After securing a summer internship, I decided I'd spend a few weeks after my internship traveling through Europe. I contacted him, hoping we'd be able to meet up for a few hours if I happened to travel near his city. Well, he took it a step further, and offered to take a week off work to host me and show me around his city. We kept in touch regularly throughout the summer, until I finally went to visit him for a week in August. I had one of the best weeks of my life, and connected with him in a way that I've never connected with anyone. I got to meet his family, friends, visit his office, go sightseeing with him; it was amazing. We both shared things with each other that we hadn't shared with anyone before. I visited him with the intention of having fun with someone I shared a somewhat romantic friendship with (not sure if that makes sense?), but the more we talked and the more intimate moments we shared, the more I fell for him.

I was only there for a week, but leaving him at the end of my trip was absolutely devastating. I had about a week and a half of traveling left in beautiful cities, but I honestly had to force myself to get up everyday and go explore. It's been about a month since our last day together, and I'm back in the US for my final year of college, while he's finishing his PhD in his country. I can't stop thinking about him. We message every day and are planning on seeing each other again next summer, hopefully for a longer period of time, as I'll have 1 - 3 months to travel before starting my full time job. Neither of us have brought up starting a relationship with each other. He mentioned during one of our particularly long, deep conversations during my week there that he believes the Internet and apps make long distance relationships possible, but I'm still not sure whether he was trying to hint at something. We'll both have jobs with which we'll be able to afford traveling pretty much as often as we want bearing time constraints, and that would allow us to eventually relocate to a different city if need be. I'm not married to the idea of living in the US forever, and would move for someone I love.

I'm fine just talking to him regularly for now as I continue to get to know him, but I know that I can't just keep developing feelings for him indefinitely without letting him know eventually. Am I crazy to think that this could go anywhere? Dating around is not for me, and there's no one else I've met so far I'd want to pursue anything with.

I know that he has at least some affinity toward me; he wishes me good night every night, he checks up on me regularly, and asked to visit me or have me visit him next summer (which I've agreed to).

The thing is that I'm not comfortable with the idea of starting a relationship with someone who isn't committed to making it work in the long term. Obviously, most people don't go into relationships with the intention of breaking up. But from what I've seen, a lot of people, especially around my age, go into relationships just to have fun and to see what happens. That's not enough for me. I need it to be clear from the beginning that we'll both try our best to make it last and really work through the inevitable difficulties that would arise. I don't want to scare him away with that and end up losing the friendship as well. 

I know I'll probably  have to end up discussing it with him eventually before it's too late. I'm just not sure how long I should wait to bring it up without putting the friendship at risk. I still want him in my life one way or another.

**tl;dr**: I am falling for a guy I met in the US, but who lives in Europe. We get along really well and have great chemistry. I only want to start a relationship with him unless he can really commit to working hard at it, but I don't want to be too forward and scare him away. I want him in my life either way, and I am willing to wait for the right time. How long do I wait to bring this up, and how do it do it to still keep him as a friend should things not go as I want them too?

543bqs,6,2016-09-23,My NMom keeps forcing me to change my travel dates for my first big solo trip.,PolkaDottedBee,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/543bqs/my_nmom_keeps_forcing_me_to_change_my_travel/,"I'm [20F] going to Europe this winter. I took the chance and told my mom I wanted to go and she said okay only after I said that it wouldn't interfere with anything and I would be paying for this trip by myself.

But I work for her, so she's been using work and family to guilt me into shortening my trip numerous times.

The original plan was to leave middle of November and return middle of January (around 80 days) because I really wanted to experience Christmas markets around different cities and then NYE/Hogmanay in Scotland.

She's made me move it earlier so now I am leaving October 18th. After this initial change, I had to return by at least December 20th (around 60 days). Her reasoning was (in order of importance):

1. Because we own a nail salon, the busy time would be before Christmas and New Years so I have to come home earlier than planned to work. 

2. I would miss ""family time"" during the holidays. We are Asian. We don't even celebrate Christmas besides giving little gifts to my younger brothers (I haven't even received a gift from my mom for Christmas/birthday since I was under 10). Besides, we work every day of the holiday besides Christmas (and even then it's because no clients would show up, not because it's a holiday we really recognize). 

3. Traveling ""for so long"" is dangerous because she says I'm too stupid and naive to be able to handle myself. But of course right after that she'll say something like ""who do you think would help you if you get into an accident over there? Do you think I would hop onto a plane for you? Are you going to pay for that?"" Or (this is my favorite. I remember before Obamacare, we only ever had life insurance. Never medical insurance) ""okay fine, go travel for all I care. And when you die I can collect the insurance for it""

But NOW because she wants to go on a week long trip in the beginning of December (she decided this yesterday. don't even get me started on how this contradicts some of her arguing points) she is making me book tickets so that I return the beginning of December. This makes me miss the two major things I was most anticipating from this trip. When I approached her with flights for me returning December 3rd because it was the cheapest I could find, she got even more pissy and told me I need to be back by the end of November (she literally changed this in a matter of hours, this takes another week out of my travel time will add probably $200 more in plane tickets on top of much more I've had to add) because she wants me home before she wants to leave. She keeps repeating things like, ""you need to do this. You have to put some importance in me before you because I'm your mom/I've raised you. Where do you think you got your money? Do you think other kids are as lucky as you? I couldn't travel like this when I was your age, so you shouldn't either"" etc. Just because I work for her, she still thinks it's her money. But it's my time and my effort that is being used to pay for this trip. I can't even tell her that because it makes her go into more fits about how ""lucky"" I am to have a job that doesn't require burger flipping.

The only reason I agreed to coming back beginning of December was so that I would watch my younger brothers while she and her husband leave for the week. My mom was about to drag my 72yo grandma across the state for a babysitting gig (but decided it would be easier to drag me over the Atlantic) which is such a safety hazard. I didn't want something to happen so I bent over again.

I just don't know what to do. I've already used as much defiance and courage I could to even make her agree to letting me go on this trip. But if I continue to defy her she would probably combust. She keeps telling her friends and our relatives that I'm stupid for going on this trip alone, but that I'm old enough that she can't deny me permission to go. When we were having an argument about the travel dates, I said that I'm already paying extra to get the dates she wanted. But her response was that if I was doing what she wanted, I wouldn't be going at all.

Sigh.

I forgot to mention this: even though most of my time in Europe will besolo, a close friend is at internship in Germany that ends November 16th. We were going to travel together before her family arrives December 18th (one of the reasons why I had my original itinerary scheduled the way I did). I've been looking forward to seeing her after so long and going around Europe with her. After the first change in dates, it was okay. But now that my mom is telling me to come home so early, this cuts two weeks out of our plans. Now it's not only affecting me, but my friend as well because she would have to go solo until her family arrives. Because it's not her choice to go solo, I would feel guilty for putting her in that situation.

I'm starting to feel guilty for even wanting to go on this trip in the first place.

I just need some advice, honestly. And I needed to vent a little. I thought that going on this trip would help me build my confidence to eventually feel like I don't need to be under her control anymore, but she still has so much of it over me. There's a lot (a lot lot lot lot lot) more that goes into this situation, but I think I hit the big points to understand what's going on."

543f7r,7,2016-09-23,How can I strengthen a grad application if I'm at the end of a somewhat mediocre undergrad career?,keyshawwwn,gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/543f7r/how_can_i_strengthen_a_grad_application_if_im_at/,"So first here's some background on me and my current situation:
-I will be graduating 2 quarters from now with a 3.2 GPA in Mechanical Engineering
-About 3 years into completing my degree, I felt that ME just wasn't the right program for me, so I picked up my minor in Math and planned on going for my MS in Applied Mathematics (I've always been passionate about Math, but Engineering was the ""logical"" choice when applying for college, and I thought I might like it)
-I've taken several intermediate analysis math courses and a few upper division stats courses to prepare myself and meet pre-requisites for grad programs
-GPA in these courses is a 3.3 (A's in my first few courses, and 2 B-'s in my last courses)
-had an internship for ~6 months doing some programming

So, I didn't know this at the time of taking my classes, but apparently, the B- I got in my last 2 classes was a huge deal. Since I'm an engineering major, they put some serious emphasis on looking at the few higher Math courses I've taken, which of course makes perfect sense. I initially thought that my grades would be the equivalent of all B+'s for the same GPA, but I was mistaken.

Here's another issue: Our class terms are relatively short. I am also the type of student who shows up to class and quietly does well in the back without saying much. This has led to me having almost no relationship to any professors at my school. I'll chat with professors every now and then, but rarely make the effort I should have for them to know me. So letters of rec are an issue.

So with all that said, any advice on how I can improve my applications? Take additional courses? Exams? Pick up some skills? Am I SOL because of the choices I've already made? Thanks!"
543glc,21,2016-09-23,Why aren't SLPs referencing the current literature?,dallassslp,slp,https://www.reddit.com/r/slp/comments/543glc/why_arent_slps_referencing_the_current_literature/,"Probably going to offend some people here, but oh well. So I've been a practicing SLP for over a decade now. Not nearly as long as some of you here have, but not quite so meager a time either. I have worked in pretty much every setting and I find that the caliber of speech therapists I am encountering is far below my standards of ""acceptable"". Sure, I may just be a crotchety old bag with impossibly strict standards, but there may be some validity here too, I hope. Recently, I took on a gig as supervisor for a grad program in my area. I mentor graduate students, supervise beginning clinicians, help with internship placements, CFY interviews, the works. I also assist with staffing and hiring SLPs in the hospital I work at. We have had an open position for so long, it is ridiculous. And this is not to say that there aren't any applicants; we get a wholeeeee lotta applicants, sometimes within the hundreds for one position. Probably because of the large amount of grad programs pumping out students like candy, but that's another issue altogether. However, my colleagues and myself have not found any of them to be within our standards. Are they just teaching graduates poorly nowadays? A new program just opened up within our district that advertises a 1.5 year program including prerequisite CSD courses. How are these students even learning everything in this time frame? It seems absolutely insane to us. 

One of the questions I like to ask applicants during the prelim interview process is, what journal article did you most recently read, tell us about it, and tell us what you got from it. It is APPALLING how many SLPs come up blank. What's even more troubling is the fact that I find this to be a common occurrence. Over the years, I'll occasionally ask colleagues if they keep up with the literature and it always shocks me how they all casually laugh and say ""not since grad school!"", ""Oh, we're out of school now!"" I see a lot of newer therapists coming on here asking about the validity of their methods, how they feel ineffective, how SLP is a grey area and they feel as if they're not actually doing any good. But how many of them cite the research in their complaints?? How many of them keep up with current evidence? Because nearly everything I do can be backed by the current literature, and I make it a point to read at least 2 articles every week, ever since I graduated ages ago. This field as a whole already faces a lot of skepticism from other fields because 1, a lot of people (our own therapists included) seem to not know what it is that we truly do and 2, SLPs are giving out therapy without really understanding the underlying research behind it. 

Some of the therapists I used to work with have said that the new CFYs/externs appear so completely lost and have very, very mediocre knowledge about some core concepts in the field. Goals and objectives are written poorly, data collection is sloppy and disorganized... how can they go through grad school and come out on the other side without knowing how to master these things? In the program I now supervise at, every class is a seminar and participation is mandatory. We read a minimum of 2 articles per class, per week and you must come prepared to discuss as colleagues. On exams, it doesn't matter if you have the ""right answer""; if you cannot cite the research or rationalize your response, it is incorrect and you will get no points. Biased or not, I believe that my students come out on the other side much more capable than the vast majority of new SLPs I am seeing, who only seem to be able to somewhat recite things verbatim from memory, but do not truly understand it. Most of the sites in our district are now clamoring for our graduates, but I do not think this is because our students are exceptional; I think it's because other graduates are so disadvantaged when they leave. This has been a topic that's been bubbling up inside of me lately. We literally cannot find an adequately qualified candidate. I've done guest lectures at other graduate programs, and the students there seem like undergrad freshmen, not like someone who is a year away from treating real people. Some programs don't even have their kids read journal articles on a weekly basis. I just find this incredibly damaging to our field as a whole. Especially with these accelerated, prereq+grad-courses-in-2-years programs coming out, how can our students possibly master the concepts they need when they enter the working field? Am I being too harsh, or is anyone else troubled by the competence of these younger SLPs? 

The knowledge is out there. There is a wealth of research documenting the effectiveness of what we do, but so many clinicians seem unwilling to invest the time and effort it takes to look into this evidence. "
543iqc,0,2016-09-23,"End Workplace Violence, Harassment, And Discrimination: Help Me Help Others",cliffhanger486,Assistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/543iqc/end_workplace_violence_harassment_and/,"My story is a complicated one. In 2007, I was diagnosed with some health issues that prevented me from working full time in most environments. My first plan was to apply for disability until my health improved. I was denied. As a result, I suffered great financial hardship and was a great burden to my family and friends, who I owe a great deal of gratitude as well as money. Along with the debts to them, I accumulated a great deal of medical bills which I have still been unable to pay. Since 2004 I have worked part time with teenagers at a drug prevention agency. Helping young people always has been and always will be my passion in life. I have worked as an antique dealer since 2011 as a means to supplement my income, and it has turned into a small business endeavor. In 2012, my health had recovered to the point where I was able to go back to work full time. I was hired by a human services agency (which I must refrain from naming due to ongoing legal proceedings). This agency hired me as a youth counselor for it's homeless shelter, which houses homeless and runaway teenagers up until the age of 17. This agency ""provides services"" to young people, and as youth counselors, we were on the front lines. We did everything. Intakes, paperwork, cooking, cleaning, supervising, helping with homework, running activities. We were basically substitute parents for these young people. We dealt with some of the worst trauma backgrounds you could possibly imagine, and most of us put our all into helpings these young people find a path to a better life. I would like to paint a rosy picture of this place, but it would be a fantasy. The truth is, this agency has victimized me and my fellow former employees, and has failed to live up to it's mission of providing the proper care for these young people who need it most. My time spent there has hollowed me out as a person and has jaded me to the world of human services. One would like to believe that in such a place, justice, acceptance, caring, and fair treatment / appreciation of employees in such a difficult position would be a given. Unfortunately, things couldn't be any farther from the truth. My yearly salary, as a college graduate with 8 years of field experience was $18,500 (which amounts to $8.89 / hour). I justified this salary, due to the fact that I was told that our agency didn't receive a lot of funding and that they couldn't afford to pay anymore. At this rate. I was making about $355 per week, before taxes, which came out to around $300 per week. It is easy to see how no one could live on such an income without great sacrifice. I was forced to keep my part time job and continue selling antiques just to keep myself afloat. In my mind, helping these young people made it all worthwhile... And then reality set in. On my first day of work, I was sexually harassed by an employee who was upset that I got hired for the position that she wanted. She touched me inappropriately and was incredibly vulgar. I tried to brush it off as some sort of new employee ""hazing"",  but I soon realized that wasn't the case. I was routinely harassed by this employee and was afraid to report it because I had just been hired and didn't want to make waves. She would call me at late hours and leave disturbing messages. She would hug me and touch me despite my protests and constant denials. Finally, the situation came to a head just days after I had torn a ligament in my knee while playing sports. I was on crutches and in a brace, and this woman assaulted me. She threw me over a chair in our administrative office, and laughed. I'd had enough. I reported this incident, along with the laundry list of other incidents that I had been subjected to by this woman. She had even gone as far as to come to work (on her day off) and bring me Valentine's Day ""gifts"" and stalk and harass my girlfriend who worked there. My executive director said she was shocked and said ""she needs to go""... I was relieved... And then the other shoe dropped. Not only was this person kept on the staff, she was PROMOTED to full-time. I couldn't understand. 3 days later, while still in a brace, I was assaulted by a female intern after reprimanding her for innappropriare behavior with the youth. She tackled me to the ground, lifted my legs over my head and said ""I'm gonna change you like a baby, bitch"". She did this in front of a resident and in front of another intern, who thankfully came to my aid. When I reported the incident to my direct supervisor (rather than my executive director who hasn't helped me in my previous experiences), he said ""Well, you know some of these interns like you. Maybe she was just trying to see if you were into that kind of stuff"". My head almost exploded. I didn't know what to do. Here I was, the victim of 2 assaults and constant harassment, and it was totally acceptable under this agency's standards. I am quite certain that if I was a female and the perpetrators were male, the response would have been drastically different. After the harassment continued and I had no recourse, I decided to give my notice of resignation, which was too be effective in 2 weeks. Because of my commitment to helping those young people and wanting my co-workers to be in a good position, I stayed on for over 2 months until a proper replacement was found. At this point, I took on the responsibility of caring for my sick grandmother, and oddly enough it was a great relief to me. My family was very supportive of me and helped me financially during this time. After a year, my grandmother passed and I had to move forward with finding work. It was at this point that I made the biggest mistake of my life. I heard that a case manager position was open at my previous job, and I thought that it would be a good opportunity for me to get back into the workforce. I figured since I would be working at the administrative offices instead of the shelter, I would be insulated from the previous harassment and that the culture would be different. I couldn't have been any more wrong. I was hired and took on my new position with a great deal of excitement and enthusiasm. I soon realized that the culture of harassment and mistreatment was just as bad, if not worse, than it was at our shelter. I was routinely targeted for bullying and harassment by my co-workers, who were of the mindset that if anyone challenged the status quo, they should be driven away. This agency provided such a poor level of service to these young people that it was sad and pathetic. Nothing about their mission was real. It was all a numbers game of clients ""served"" and getting funding. I did my best to thrive in my role and do the best I could for my own individual clients, but seeing other clients not receive adequate services was too much for me to keep quiet about. Finally, my supervisor called me and threatened me, calling me a ""pussy"" and a ""little bitch"". He threatened me and told me I didn't know who I was ""messing with"". I was actually afraid for my own safety, because this man is a convicted felon. He was a former police officer who got caught stealing money from suspects and not reporting the incidents as arrests, while keeping the money from undocumented ""raids"". He was finally caught when he and his fellow involved officers robbed an undercover informant. He was sentenced to 4 years in prison. He was hired by our agency when he got out. I have no idea how such a person is allowed to work with young people, much less be the supervisor of every case manager. Needless to say, I took the threats of this man very seriously, and I called my supervisor and told her that I was concerned and that something needed to be done about him. She laughed at me and told me that he wasn't going to be terminated. I told her that I was going to pursue legal action if I wasn't properly protected and the situation was him was not addressed. Not only was the situation not addressed, but I was suspended by this man the next day, and fired two days later. After consulting an attorney, I was informed that I was likely illegally terminated because of whistleblower protections. I was also told that my salary, along with that of many of my co-workers, was not within the legal limits of ""exempt"" status. This simply means that our salaries were so low that our agency was legally required to pay us for overtime and training, which they never did. Overtime and training were required and never paid. To sum this up, I am pursuing legal action against my former employer, and I cannot afford to do so. I need your help to make this right as best I can. I am pursuing this case not for the money, but for the young people who need the proper care, and for the few co-workers of mine who deserve to be supported by the administration and to be paid a fair salary for the difficult work that they do. I don't want to take this agency down, I just want it to change. I want to help make it what it could and should be, a place where the young people most in need can get the proper services. A place where employees and appreciated and applauded. A place where ""acceptance"" doesn't mean that assaults, harassment, and bullying of those who try to hold other accountable to help these needy young people are the standard practice. A great deal of the money that is given to our agency is funneled away from the children and the counselors and into the pockets of the administrators who have fancy fundraisers and events. They sell this idea of a wonderful place that helps people to line their own pockets. They have abused, neglected, and mistreated children. Due to the the sensitive nature of this case, I cannot go into further detail. I need your help. Every dollar counts, and will go to my legal expenses and my debts to all those who have helped me along the way. Thank you.

543kx8,27,2016-09-23,Please help me with rebuilding my life,Susan7,GetStudying,https://www.reddit.com/r/GetStudying/comments/543kx8/please_help_me_with_rebuilding_my_life/,"Hello, I'm a 24 year old female. Please help me out.

My life seems to be a big mess. I'm diagnosed with clinical depression and I seem to be failing out of school, due to the depression. I don't take my meds  because I just don't believe that they make me feel better.

My parents are usually mad/not fine with my behaviour in general because when I was going through some serious bouts of depression, I spoke to them rudely and cursed at them. They usually take it to the extent of blaming me for some things I have not done and when anything goes wrong at home, I am the one who is usually blamed. We have no good relationship and we sometimes argue, most of the times we don't talk.

However, they pay my school fees at university and buy me medicine that I don't take. I usually hide the fact that I don't take my medicine from them.  They complain a lot about my hygiene, how I do my chores at home etc while sometimes I am just going through a depressive period and they just don't understand it's why I'm slacking on duties.

I feel that they usually pay my fees and buy my meds so that I heal quickly and finish school, so that I am out of their house, not because they want the best of me. They seem to want to get rid of me because they usually say that I am old enough to move out, especially once I finish my degree.

Due to this pressure, and sometimes being threatened to move out, I failed my exams in university, 3rd year. I am studying a 4 year actuarial science course. I am afraid of telling them because they will definitely be mad at me. I got depressed due to how mad they usually are at me and how bad our relationships are and was unable to study well for my exams. 

When I look at my options, without a degree, I will be unable to get a job, a real paying job. I don't know what to do about my life because my parents will definitely stop supporting me, probably throw me out and I will have no one to turn to. I am currently doing an internship, which is good, but to be confirmed for a permanent job, I need to have a degree, which I have failed. What do I do? It's why I don't tell them of my results.

As for friends or a boyfriend, I lost my friends when I got depressed because most of them didn't understand me sometimes when I snapped, or lost contact, once I started being depressed. They would think I had something against them yet I was struggling with my own issues. I only have 2 wonderful friends, but they can't support me or help me much in this situation because they are also young and live under their parent's support. How can I work towards becoming financially independent so as to support myself in this scenario?

Emotionally, I am usually stable though there are times when I get majorly depressed due to lacking an answer to solve my problems. To the point of being suicidal. Ever since I got depressed, people (family and friends) have left me out, ridiculed me, claimed I am pretending to be ill when I actually am and blamed me for what I haven't done. My life has gone on a downward spiral and I can't even see myself as positively as I used to. I end up spending a lot of time on my own and living alone, especially because my friends are usually busy working. I see that my death caused by myself would make no difference because I am not someone who matters in society. I can't focus in school and I am distracted because of this situation. My family just copes with me, not that they want me or enjoy being with me, they just live with me because they have to - because their is nowhere for me to go. They treat me as if I am a bum who doesn't want to move out and pay their own rent, food, electricity and act as if I am living off them to finish their money while I am genuinely struggling to do my best with my condition.

They only talk to me when needed not because they enjoy talking to me. How do I work out of this? When I apologize, or ask them to understand me, or ask to speak to them, they ignore me and tell me that apologies are not enough, I need to pass and move out and live on my own and be independent so that I am not a burden to them anymore. They don't care.

Definitely, staying on my own means that I don't get a chance to socialise and meet people so I am boyfriend-less. I broke up with my past boyfriend due to this depression... I was highly temperamental and snapped at him (i had my own issues) and he left me, just like that. I have been heart broken since and noone serious really tries to court me or get my attention, making my self esteem suffer. What do I do?"
543ofe,1,2016-09-23,archived stories,fullasian,PatheticStories,https://www.reddit.com/r/PatheticStories/comments/543ofe/archived_stories/,"""""This is a bit of a cathartic rant, so forgive me for incoherence, bad grammar, and lazy spelling.

Background on me. I am 27, pursuing a career change into the nutrition field. I'm finishing my second Bachelors in a few months and pursuing a dietetic internship. I have a non-asian boyfriend. I don't want to attend church with them. I play video games sometimes. lol

I never truly believed I had ""typical asian parents"". Not like, Tiger Mom style at least. I got some Bs growing up. I wasn't forced to play violin. I went to a small, private liberal arts college (not Harvard, boohoo!) I suck at math. Throughout, my parents were generally good parents.

I appreciate them. They clothed me, fed me, housed me, loves me (the best they could). I even have a pretty good relationship with my mom, with lots of heart to heart talks, and good laughs.

But I've been noticing more and more a kind of emotional abuse occurring. Sometimes, things are good. But then there will be a sudden explosion of discontent, disappointment, and anger directed toward me. Then an apology. Then another explosion. It's exhausting and feels abusive. They say awful things. My dad will scream at me, at the top of his lungs, telling me how he is ashamed that I am his daughter. That I am SO OLD (at 27). That my life thus far is worthless and without direction. That my exclusive boyfriend of two years only uses me for sex. (my mom echoes this sentiment). They demand that I break up with my bf to appease them. They don't like him purely on the fact that I spend so much time at his place and that he hasn't proposed. Premarital sex also makes me a ""whore"".

Obviously my mistake was to be living at home during this time. But as I pursued another degree it seemed like a good idea to save money, and I was also getting out of a bad breakup and needed some emotional support. That clearly backfired on me.

I am SO grateful that my parents took me back in after my messy breakup with my ex. I will always love them. But this constant yelling and namecalling and passive aggressive behavior is getting out of control.

Marriage is not on my radar. I love my non asian, non christian bf. We like having sex. We also do other things. I've developed so much as an individual because of him, and I have improved so much in my ability to communicate with people (that is, everyone except for my own parents).

God, I could go on and on and on, but this is getting out of control.

I will end with this. I'm preparing to move out asap, or hopefully move in with my boyfriend. I am really worried about finances but this is the only logical step for the future, as living at home like this is akin to living with emotional terrorists.

Reading through this sub actually made me really sad. There are so many miserable children, so many hurtful parents.
-----------------------

I'm a female first generation Chinese American - my parents were born and raised in China, I was raised partially in Singapore, and we moved to the US when I was 16. Through my adolescence I've felt a culture gap between my parents and me; I'm highly Western in thought but maintain core Asian values, while my parents still have a very traditional mindset. But because of my Chinese upbringing, I've continued to live with them since graduating college, choosing to sacrifice some freedoms out of filial piety for the physical comfort of home and free rent.

I hadn't dated anyone long term until last year. I'm notoriously picky and I've kept all dating activity a secret from my folks. Nearing 30, my own apparent lack of desperation only made them more so - they began to set me up with ""nice Chinese boys"" (most of them recent transplants from China) introduced by well-meaning family friends. Out of respect to the ""grownups"" I gave all of them a shot, to no success. Recently, my parents tried to set me up with another prospect, and I couldn't bear the weight of my secret any longer. I told them about the guy I'm seeing, who as far as they're concerned strikes out on all counts: white, under 6 feet, earns less than me (and I don't earn that much), and whose career trajectory is in flux. The world did not end as I'd feared: my dad was reasonable and even-tempered throughout, leading the conversation, accepting all this while trying to persuade me that I shouldn't put all my eggs in 1 basket. My mom was quiet, but I know her well enough to know she's unhappy about this. Not only does she have outdated beliefs on most things, she also has irrevocably bigoted misconceptions about white men. I knew this wasn't going to change after one big heart to heart with them. I agreed, again out of respect, and knowing realistically that some circumstances of my current SO are not ideal, to begin correspondence this new prospect, but strictly as friends. If after a period of organic interaction it turns out we have chemistry and I develop feelings for him, I'll cross that bridge when I get to it. That was our agreement.

Things were peaceful for 2 weeks. During this time I suspected my mom had just been ignoring what I told them. Then I had a fight with her that made it very clear that my current relationship and how serious I am about it is an unpleasant truth, and one more way I'm willfully defying their wishes. That I'm unable to see what's good for me, and do what they say because they just want the best for me, of course they know what that is, they're my parents. She is angry and frustrated with me, because she believes I'm making a huge, mindless mistake. I'm wasting my time, there's no future with this guy. That what I'd feared turned out to be true, that she wouldn't be happy for me in any remote way, breaks my heart. My dad on the other hand wants me to ""slow things down"" with my current SO, in order to be ""fair"" to the other guy. Even though I've stated in no unclear terms I'm approaching him as a platonic friend. Incredulous, I told him I couldn't see sense in it. My feelings for one person has no bearing on basic chemistry with another. My unwillingness to comply to what he thinks is a reasonable request visibly frustrates him, and that hurts too, because I'd believed at least my dad and I could see eye to eye.

All I want is the freedom to like who I like and continue to be with them. I don't want to have to answer to anyone else. I don't want any obligations toward my parents' well-meaning friends or the guys' parents. I've never felt so trapped in my parents' home and expectations until now. I can't stop thinking of how much I must be troubling and disappointing to them, and how much knowing that hurts me. I can't even really communicate all this to them, because while I'm fluent in Chinese, my thoughts and emotional transparency are so ""Western"" they're construed as melodrama or hypersensitivity in this culture, and is readily dismissed. I know moving out is the most obvious solution, but it's not immediately viable, and I don't want to believe that we can never meet halfway. Looking for some solidarity and advice.""""

54407h,160,2016-09-23,TIFU when I tried to get my car back.,BigDubo,tifu,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/54407h/tifu_when_i_tried_to_get_my_car_back/,"Happened a couple years ago in University.

My car needed an oil change, but at the time I was interning at a small, engineering firm and my hours wouldn't allow me time to take care of it. Fortunately, the factory my dad worked at was a quick walk from his house, and he just happened to be on afternoon shift that week. So he offered to switch cars, and take mine in for me. Then I could just pick it up at the end of the week.

End of the week arrives, and I decide to go pick up my car. Now, my shift ends at just after 4, and his starts at 3. The only times we'd be able to exchange keys would be either right as he enters work, leaves, or during his lunch break at 7. I didn't really have the patience to wait until 7, so I decided to leave work early and meet him before he goes in.

My work was expectantly strict with interns leaving early or showing up late, so my dumb ass decided to make up a harmless lie instead of just waiting until the weekend. Something about family emergency. I got to leave, but traffic was pretty bad and I ended up showing up just after 4 anyways.

My place was a pretty far commute from my dad's work, and I didn't have a key to his place yet, so I wasn't entirely keen on waiting or driving back home. I texted him, but I knew he wasn't allowed to text on the line.

While I was deciding what to do, a couple of workers walked up and asked if I was waiting for anyone. I told them about my dilemma and they offered to help by letting me into the factory so I could find my dad, saying my dad was a good friend of theirs. They used their swipe cards to get me in, and gestured towards where my dad should be, before leaving to get back to their own work.

I walked around a bit, and asked if anyone knew or had seen my dad. I noticed their reactions were almost subdued, calling me ""Sir"" and given me terse replies. It was then I figured it was because I had just come from my office in business casual wear, so  they assumed I was one of the engineers working there. I figured this was better then being treated like some random kid. So I started to play the part, acting like I was the shit (to anyone who's worked in a factory, they know the engineer's attitudes). I'd point at people and ask where this and that was, tell them they were doing a good job, etc.

I was getting so into it that I didn't notice a man in suit walking up to me. That's when I froze. I couldn't bullshit this guy. He immediately asked what I was doing in his factory, and questioned why I wasn't wearing safety glasses or work boots (office job). All the bravado left me and I just ended up explaining the predicament with my dad, and how some workers let me in. After ripping me apart for pretending to be an engineer, he told me to wait outside and that he'd send my dad after me. I quickly left with my tail between my legs.

After a bit my dad showed up at the parking lot looking pale. He told me the man I had talked to was his superintendent, and that he was fired for ""allowing a minor to trespass onto company property, and without the proper safety equipment"". At this point, we were both pretty rattled, and he sent me home, reassuring me that it wasn't my fault.

When I finally got home, I just felt like the biggest piece of shit ever. As I was lying in my bed a couple hours after, I got a call from the firm I worked for. If I didn't feel like a big enough idiot, I forgot that my company was hired by my dad's company to work out some bugs on the line. One of our employees saw me, and casually brought it up to my boss thinking it was harmless. My boss decided to call me that night to fire me for lying to skip work. Talk about a shitty day.

TL;DR I went to switch cars with my dad, and got us both fired from our jobs."

I'm flying to NYC in a couple days for an on site interview at Bloomberg and I have very little faith I'll pass. If I get a Hash Table question, it's over. I can work with strings and linked-lists (barely). Binary Search Trees skills are not there yet either.

I know what I need to do, study and study some more. CTCI, leetcode, etc. But my questions is this: Can I reasonably expect to be able to find an internship with very little knowledge of these Data Structures? I'm losing faith. 

Follow up: If I do not find an internship, would it be worth it to stay in college an extra semester so that I will have one more summer to intern? Will internship have such an effect on my employ-ability that it would warrant this?

5463fj,14,2016-09-23,"Got a massive bill from Vodafone for loads of data over 3 GB I really don't think I've used, taking steps now - any horror stories/smart consumer advice from ye?",NapoleonTroubadour,ireland,https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/5463fj/got_a_massive_bill_from_vodafone_for_loads_of/,"Well it wouldn't be r/Ireland without a good whinge, but before I talk to Joe  (cue manic fiddle) I wanted to ask if anyone had previous experience with this.

So I signed up to a Vodafone RED Simply Plan last November for 12 months, paying €30 a month for unlimited texts and calls within Ireland and €3 GB free (the rest is charged extortionately enough IMO but more of that later.) I was a final year student at the time, just wanted bill pay to make sure I was never stuck for contacting people or cut off mid-call again. It wasn't a great experience (didn't have a job so I didn't set up direct debit, so they regularly would let the bill pile up over more than a month then randomly block the account so I couldn't pay online) and I was quite fed up and looked to switch to 48 by the end, so had my phone unlocked, SIM ordered.

By this time (late May/early June), I was preparing to go on the graduate visa to New York (you may say 'well then surely you can afford to pay any bill', but I'd been planning it for a while and it was a lot cheaper than doing a Masters immediately, while allowing me to intern at a genuinely great start-up to give me a leg-up I wouldn't otherwise have gotten), so I decided 'right, the account will be put on hold anyways after I miss a payment, so I'll leave it be and try to pay off the balance of the 12-month contract at some point during the summer.' The last payment I'd made was on April 22 for the bills up to April 9.

Fast forward to August, I get a letter to my Irish address saying that I suddenly owe them €758.23, the account is terminated and the methods of possible payment. I was fairly staggered and I wasn't sure how to approach it, so I decided to wait and see (foolishly, thinking it would be a mistake and the figure would be amended - I couldn't log in to Vodafone's online portal since my account had been terminated.) They sent another letter a couple of days ago saying it would be transferred to a collection agency soon, and I really can't afford a shitty credit rating when I'm just starting out my career. 

I analysed the bills and there's charges for having used 2 or 3 GB on some days between April 9 and June 9 (I left Ireland on June 10), one of which amounts to €72 euro (it averages about €24.15 or so for every GB used over the 3 GB/month limit included in the €30 monthly payment.) 

To make things worse, they add up the excess data charges and international calls/messages charges (I had to make a few short calls to the US when looking for apartments) and THEN charge VAT to this, which is more than a little sickening. They also have 'Charge' with a date listed on the summary invoices for each month, with no explanation what it might be for. I called their Customer Service international number this morning, and they said that while I could pay the €758.23 in instalments, I had to arrange this ASAP or they'd just transfer it to a collection agency. Honestly, I'm worried as it's putting pressure on my parents, who have already been so supportive through my degree and this internship, and they're already stretched finances-wise so I really want to minimise the cost of this as best I can, and any help or advice from any of ye would be just a massive help altogether.

TL;DR: Am I being shafted by Vodafone, if so do I complain to the NCA/ComReg or just try negotiate it myself, or just take my medicine and pay a massive bill in chunks?

Any and all help/advice/sympathetic gifs would be so much appreciated, thanks guys.

UPDATE: Thanks for all your advice, really appreciate it everyone! I called up Vodafone again and the guy this time claimed that while they sent me a text advising that my 3GB had been used up each time, he couldn't say what it was used up on subsequently but suggested 'well background apps refreshing' so he was somewhat taken aback with how I was persisting with it. I remained calm the whole time, reminding him that I was happy to work with them and that he was being very helpful and I appreciated it greatly (got his name as well so that helps for future records.) They never sent any alert or text whatsoever to say that I had used €50, €100 or anything in extra data charges so there was no alert or warning whatsoever (I know that this is what's to be expected but it still stings.) Making headway so I'll send an email with a summary of everything thus far and make sure to ask for a 'bill shock' as /u/zenova360 recommended, thanks a million everyone I'll keep you all posted and if it comes to talking to Joe then I'll be sure to give all of ye a shout-out!"

I would like to get some form of continuin education to learn a new skill and switch careers.


I'm currently eying a few programs at my local community college. One of them is a certificate in Computer Information Systems. It says that it provides basic courses needed for careers as an entry level programmer or help desk person. They also say they provide internships.


I am wondering if this is a viable stepping stone to a better career or if it would be a waste of time and money? Is there a good job field for this area of study and is there good potential for higher earnings? What are some other steps I might take to maximize my success in this endeavor?

It's a crippling anxiety and it surfaces with any person who may have influence on my future. I hate it because it has already cost me some serious opportunities (jobs, internships, etc.).

For example, I have recently spent quite a lot of time looking for a Bachelor thesis supervisor. Every time I wanted email someone, my anxiety rose up and I would scrutinize every single word. And when I finally got a response from someone who had a spot for me, I was nervous all the way up to and during the first meeting. Afterwards I just collapsed and beat my self up over how bad an impression I left (they could tell I was nervous). He said he would send me an email with more details on the project and an estimated starting date, but I haven't heard back yet (3.5 weeks ago).

I talk just fine with any other stranger, though. It's just with people who have some form of 'authority'.

I don't really know where I am going with this post, other than that I really *really* want to get rid of it, if I want to have any chance for a successful career. Does anybody else experience anything like this? Do you have any advice?"
546te6,10,2016-09-23,"Me [27 M] with my fiancée [25 F] of 4 years, I missed all the warning signs of depression and unhappiness, and now she's running away to become happy with herself.",badbloodhound,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/546te6/me_27_m_with_my_fiancée_25_f_of_4_years_i_missed/,"My fiancée and I have been together for 4 years. We've had difficult parts of the relationship (who hasn't), but we've always come out stronger and she's the only person who's ever made me really want to work on myself. She helped me to identify a lot of my toxic behaviors (not in a nagging way, but in a really kind manner) and stuck around while I was working them out. Similarly, I've helped her to get through a lot of personal doubt issues she's had as well as demons from her childhood. We were always a team. That's why I proposed last year, and we were planning on a wedding next Spring.

About 1.5 years in to our relationship (2.5 years ago), I went through a really difficult time. My parents got divorced and for some reason it had a really profound effect on me. I thought that at 25 years old (at the time) I would have been more prepared to handle it, but I was not. I started believing that relationships were always temporary, and that long term relationships were a thing of the past. I tried on several occasions to break up with her — never for any particular reason, but because I ""felt like we had an expiration date"" (my shitty words). She consistently stayed strong and refused to leave my side without a real reason.

I continued my downward spiral, though. I started talking to other women about sex. I never did anything physical with any of them, and at the time, I thought that that was ""the line."" I did it because I had low self esteem and the sexual conversations boosted my ego. My fiancée (GF at the time) finally caught me one time and confronted me. I immediately owned up to what I had done, and told her that I didn't think there was any way our relationship could survive what I had done. I thought that was the final straw. Amazingly, though, she said she wanted to try to fix things. That was sort of a light bulb moment for me, and I realized we might actually have a chance. I learned about ""emotional cheating"" and realized that it can be just as bad as, if not worse than, physical cheating. I immediately cut off all contact with these other women — deleted them off Facebook, took their contact info out of my phone, etc. I started really focusing on our relationship and trying harder to make it work.

The progress was noticeable, as we were much happier than we had ever been. We started to get a lot stronger. We had ""unofficially"" moved in together a little earlier (my lease was up and she only had a few months left on hers, so I crashed at her place until we figured out what we were going to do next) so we decided to make it official and rent a house together. I got more involved with my church and met some couples who were clearly happily married after many decades, and so I started talking to them about how they made it work. That restored my faith in marriage. I proposed to my GF, and she said yes.

But then I started to notice little cracks. My fiancée had always been high achieving, but I noticed that she wasn't nearly as involved in things as she used to be. She wasn't performing as well in her job as she used to. We were both non-traditional college students, and while she used to have a 4.0, she was suddenly on academic probation. While cleaning the house one day I found a notebook for a success class that was mandated for all students on probation. She hadn't told me that she was in the class. I confronted her and she tearfully told me about how all of the things that she used to be good at were slipping away. I was supportive, and she told me that no one else had ever supported her before, not even her family. I told her that I was there for her and that she could talk to me about anything. I was extremely careful not to come across as judgmental, since that was what everyone else in her life had done. I have had a lot of big failures in my own life, so I reminded her that I had no room to judge.

Things seemed to get better from there. Two years went by. When the Army ordered me to deploy, I felt like we were at a place in our relationship where we could weather that storm and come out okay. We were both nervous about something bad happening to me, so I convinced her that we should get a courtroom marriage before I left just so that we each had some legal authority in case the other person got hurt or anything, and then we could have the big ceremony when I got home. We didn't tell our families because she was afraid her family would be upset if they found out that we got married without them, so we kept it a secret. We decided that, as far as anyone else was concerned, the ceremony next Spring would be ""the real deal.""

A couple months in to deployment things started getting weird with her. She was losing a lot of weight (and she was not overweight to begin with), calling in sick to work (something she would normally never do), and passed out while driving and ended up in the ER (they couldn't find any problems). Then one morning I got an unintelligible text message from her saying something about the hospital and a man's name. We have a mutual friend with that name who works in a hospital ER, so I called him and he told me that my fiancée had come in with an overdose. I immediately got emergency leave approved through my unit (which wouldn't have been approved if we hadn't been legally married) and was on a flight back home by the end of the day. She was admitted to a psych hospital where I visited her every day upon arriving home. She explained the whole situation and said that it was a medication mix-up rather than a suicide attempt, and I believed her. I still believe her. She had been seeing a therapist for a little while, who referred her to a psychiatrist, who had prescribed her a heavy cocktail of drugs to ""numb the pain"" that therapy was digging up from her childhood. After speaking with several other doctors, many have said that they intentionally don't prescribe those drugs together for the exact reason that they can very easily interact and result in an overdose if the person taking them isn't extremely careful. The psych hospital also believed her and discharged her a few days later. I had a few days left on my emergency leave, so we took an impromptu trip to the coast and it was amazing. It felt so healthy for both of us.

I went back overseas, but I had a 4-day pass coming up at the end of my deployment and we planned for to meet in a nice beach town in Europe. She seemed much healthier after that and we enjoyed planning our trip. As we got closer she said that she didn't want to fly across the world for 4 days just to fly right back, so she was looking at volunteer opportunities she could take up in the area in the weeks before we met. Seemed logical. She found something in Africa teaching English. While there she had poor reception so we didn't talk much, but I could tell that she was loving it. I was happy for her.

A couple days before we were supposed to meet up, she calls me and tells me that teaching in Africa has changed her life and that she doesn't know who she is anymore or what she wants. I asked her if she still wanted to marry me. She told me she didn't know. (Of course, there's an additional complication in that even though we haven't had the ceremony and aren't married yet in the eyes of our friends or family, we did get legally married so us splitting up would mean getting a legal divorce.) I got really upset and told her we'd have to finish the conversation later. I called her back the next day and we talked a little more. I started to understand that she had spent most of her life trying to keep unhealthy relationships going strong — with her parents, with her siblings, and with me before I had my epiphany ~2 years ago and started to really work on our relationship. I asked her if she still wanted to meet up in Europe for our planned trip, and she said of course.

When we met up things were a little weird at first. There wasn't the same connection as before; we didn't have the same closeness. I tried to give her space, and by the third day we ""clicked"" again and started to have a really good time. Things were more or less how they'd always been. After 4 short days I had to return, and she decided that she was going to return to Africa to spend a week sightseeing with the friends she'd made while volunteering. She did and then finally went back to the States. As soon as she got back, she kind of reverted back to before our trip, saying that she wasn't sure if she wanted to ever get married. She hadn't been living for herself and Africa helped her realize that. She wanted to travel and try to nail down just what exactly she needed to be happy with herself. I called her and we talked for 3 hours on the phone. I told her that I had done a 180 from the emotional place where I was 2 years ago, and that I was fully committed to her. She said she recognized that I had truly changed. But she said that she was disgusted by the type of person she was who would allow herself to be cheated on and not walk away, and went further to say that I shouldn't want to be with a person who allowed themselves to be treated like that. That was a punch in the gut because I realized that she was right, and because I'm still extremely ashamed of my actions back then. I told her that if she wanted to walk away I would respect her decision, but that I wasn't going to leave. I told her I was here for her and I supported her journey to find herself.

However, my commitment is really being tested. She called me a couple days later and said she found an internship in Europe that she really wanted to do. It is nine months long and starts right before I get home, which would mean there would be no gap between my deployment and her internship for us to see each other. It would be a total of almost two years with just two short visits mixed in, both of which have already come and gone. If we can have a couple months together before she leaves then I feel like we can work on a lot of these problems and strengthen our bond. But if she leaves before I get home, then I'm really terrified that we won't be able to recover from where we are now. I told her that we get free couples counseling through my insurance, but she said that she needs to work on herself before she can work on us.

Now here's my dilemma. I've weighed what I can see as the options. I can tell her I don't want her to go, but if I convince her to stay then she'll resent me and our relationship will be effectively finished. We might go on for a little while, but with that festering resentment, it'll be a ticking time bomb. I can walk away now, but I love her with all of my heart and I'm serious about the commitment I've made to never give up on us. **I want to tell her that we need to stick together, but I also recognize that I was terribly selfish in the beginning of our relationship when she was busting her ass to keep us together. I feel like at the very least I owe her the same when the roles are reversed. She loved me when I was very hard to love, and it made me a much better man than I was and helped me learn how to trust someone else deeply and fully. It's been a wonderful experience, and I thank God every day that she didn't walk out on me when she logically should have. So I feel like now it's my turn to fight for us when she is having doubt and questions like I was just a few years ago.** (I put that in bold because I feel like it really sums up my dilemma.)

So the only remaining option I see is to wait for her and hope she decides she wants to be with me when it's all said and done. A few years ago I would have called any guy who did that a sucker and advised them to move on. But the difference is that I've made a commitment to her and to our relationship — to never give up, no matter what. ""For better or for worse,"" as it were. Which, in my mind, means waiting as long as it takes. She told me that if I wanted to walk away, she ""would understand,"" but I told her that I would never walk away. I told her that I was okay with all the uncertainty of her traveling and finding her happiness, but that the only thing I needed to know for sure was that she still wanted to be with me when it was all said and done. She couldn't give me a straight answer aside from ""I still love you,"" ""I still care about you,"" and the like, so I told her to think about it and get back to me. That was two days ago, and I still haven't heard anything.

Am I doing the right thing by waiting for her? Has anyone been in a similar situation and pulled through?

  **tl;dr**: Fiancée and I had a rocky start to our relationship in which I didn't really value her and took her for granted. I had a light bulb moment ~two years ago and I've devoted myself to our relationship since then. Things seemed great from there. I had to deploy with the Army, and she started getting sick and acting funny shortly after I left. She overdosed and I flew home to be with her in the hospital. I had to return to finish out my deployment after she got better but we were doing pretty good. She took a trip to Africa to teach English, and ever since then she says that she realized she hasn't done any work on herself since before we met. Now she wants to postpone our wedding and travel abroad without me to find herself. She says she'll come back, but doesn't know when (she's thinking about an internship and then a master's degree, so possibly as much as 3 years). I'm serious about the commitment I made to her, but I don't know what to do. I was having a lot of doubt about the relationship a few years ago and it was 100% her hard work that got us through it while I was being selfish, so I feel like I owe it to her to fight when the roles are reversed."
546uzx,1,2016-09-23,My dad [47 M] has reneged on his promise to pay me [17M] for the work I've done at his office.,OfficePayProblems,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/546uzx/my_dad_47_m_has_reneged_on_his_promise_to_pay_me/,"At the end of the school last year, I expressed to my parents that I wanted to get a summer job and start building my resume.  My options were very limited since I was 17, especially in a healthcare space.  I'm very interested in healthcare, so I thought it'd be good to get a feel for it before I picked which colleges I applied to.  

My dad is a doctor, and offered me a position at his office.  He agreed to pay me what he normally pays office interns (15/hr).  I know this is a LOT of money, but he originally offered 20.  I lowered it because I felt that 20 an hour was way too much.  

I asked my dad if I needed to fill out any paperwork.  He said no, because I was underage so he'd just pay me under the table. 

Work actually started pretty well.  I learned very rapidly and totally immersed myself in what I was doing.  Eventually, my dad asked if I could use any spare time to work on his practice's website.  I'm pretty decent at web design, and the website needed a LOT of work, so I agreed.

One of the sections of the website is a ""before and after"" section.  My dad is a plastic surgeon.  He offers patients a discounted rate if they consent to having the images used.  However, any identifying factors (tattoos and jewelry - which my dad always forget to make his patients take off) had to be photoshopped out.  

At first, this was a fun game.  I love learning how to photoshop.

But eventually, my dad went crazy with it.  I was working upwards of 60 hours a week, at least 30 of them dedicated to the damn photoshop.  My dad's demands were insane; any free time I had at home, he literally yelled at me to add more pictures to the website. 

He then started asking me to start photoshopping post-op photos to ""hide the scars"" and ""make them look a little better.""  It was such a toxic work environment that I eventually asked if I could quit - I said that I didn't want to ruin our relationship over a job.  My dad said that if I quit, he would refuse to pay for my college and said I'd have to find a new place to live.  

So I continued to work.  Even now that school has started back up, he still expects my free time to be spent adding pictures to his website.

I kept track of all my hours worked, and my dad owes me a LOT of money.  At dinner the other day, I brought it up, saying something along the lines of ""Hey dad, I have that log of all my hours I worked if you want to go over it!  I'm opening a new bank account for the money, I don't expect it all at once or anything.""

without looking up, my dad responded ""Honestly, I'm paying for your college and you expect me to pay you?""

I'm furious.  I completely understand that I'm very lucky to have a dad that will pay for my college, but that wasn't part of the agreement.  None of my older siblings worked a day in their life before they went to college, and they all got to go on my dad's bill.  I'm pretty sure he still pays their rent, and they've been out of college for a while.  

I can't do anything to the website, especially since he's holding this threat against me, and he could very possibly kick me out of the house.  And I'm an idiot and didn't sign the contract. 

The kicker was that he still expects me to spend time working on his damn website.  Seriously, how many before and after photos could he possibly need?

They are c#, python, and javascript. 

I am currently doing an internship using c# and following the MVVM pattern and even though I like c#, boy have I struggled. Moving forward, I dont know what I can do since I just graduated from school and I want to land a good job. 

I honestly dont think I did enough to land a full time position and alot of it had to do with the steep learning curve of MVVM and c#. 

Moving forward, I realized that I am weak at SQL, Database systems, and that I need to learn data structures and algorithms. 

In essence, I dont know how to proceed. Logic would say that I should just continue learning c# but if there arent as many jobs as I would like, then I would definitely be open to learning another language. 

Any advice?"

My problem isnt with parents or family, most of family is actually pretty secular and borderline not muslims at all. I have members in my family who are clearly atheist or are just cultural muslim with really moderate practice of the religion. 

I come from Yugoslavia, born during the war, making me and my parents refugees. We fled to the Netherlands and stayed there. I have attended all of my school in this country and beside it went to religious class once in a week from an age of probably 6 or something. It was usual for me that i was the brightest kid in both schools and people thought i would probably make it far. 

I started learning the quran sripture from age of 11. My secondary education I did at the gymnasium in my town, which is an old one, the famous Dutch philosopher and humanist Erasmus studied there, ironically. I still remained muslim but i believed in the objectivity of science and actually thought the quran talks about evolution. Yet i believed man was gods creation, not evolved from a common ancestor. I generally enjoyed my education, i liked physics, math and technology related subjects. I also enjoyed history. Though i wasn't the best student, I eventually did graduate.

During my school years i wasnt really super religious, i would go to school parties, i would get drink and get drunk. My dad even noticed it once and told me the next day not to do it anymore. 

So it was all pretty cool when it came to parents. It was however my own consciousness that bothered me. I felt bad after a night out and would seek forgiveness from god on my bike driving my drunk ass home. How stupid. It was eventually when i was 18 i started to become more religious in the sense that i started to care about the religion and its rituals. I wanted to pray, read more quran, learn more about the religion etc. 

And thus started my journey. Most of my choices i made from then where choices with religion as my priority number one. What awful choices they were. I wanted to join the airforce as i always wanted to be a pilot. But the idea of killing (especially muslim) people put me off so i went for engineering. During university my religiosity increased but my academic performance was non existent. I avoided non muslims and didnt really make friends with them. I seeked out muslims to befriend, as it was easier and i had more in common with them, but it was also a religious thing to do.

Two years in to uni and i was failing, i eventually switched to some sort of community college doing civil engineering. This was much easier than uni and i seemed to make progress. It was towards the end of this year ( i was 21 then) that i sort of woke up from my slumber, it was then when my religion was eroding underneath me. I realized how stupid i was, how i missed great opportunities and I became depressed. 

It took a few months before the religiosity was really gone and i declared I was no muslim anymore. I fell in to depression and my academic performance took a dive again. Even though im in my final year of my study now, i never really recovered from this. All the coursework and assignements i did werent stellar. It was all scraping by, half assing. It was horrible. 

It was since beginning this year i started to have some really heavy anxiety and panic, as i was to start my internship at an engineering firm. I felt so inadequate and i was afraid i would get fired. It was then also when i decided to go see a psychologist and seek out help. I explained what i wrote here mostly. He had some provocative things to say, but i dont really know if it helped. I eventually concluded my internship and the guys there were generally positive about me. It felt good knowing they were positive and i didnt fuck up big time. I did learn something after all and the work was okay to do. 

I try to better my life now, i try to become fit and go to the gym, do jj and do running, while also attending college and working part time.

But despite all of it, i still feel in confident. I still feel as if im worthless, as if i will never make, as if the damage is already done. I still cant focus on my coursework properly, even though i sort of like it and find it interesting. 

I wish i could just stop worrying so much and that i could focus on my degree and the things i like. But i cant. I always worry much and anxiety keeps me distracted. I seem to always had a pessimistic view on life from a young age. Religion seemed to complement my view somehow because it focuses on that eternal life. I had moments of relief after prayer and it felt good. 

I dont know where to seek for that happiness and how to live life. Im just caught up in trying to keep my head above water in college. But my mood shifts daily and i lose hope so many times. It really sucks.

I usually dont like making these complain posts. We all are caught up in our own problems i am fully aware of that. I know there are plenty of people who are off worse with their situation at home, or people who barely have food or live in war torn countries. But that thought doesnt remove my problems. Thats a religious principle and it just suppresses your own feelings. 

I dont really know where i want to go with this. I appreciate if you have read it so far. Its just that these thoughts and feelings have been cramped up in me for a long time and i had to vent. I just wish to have some feeling of understanding, acceptance and of being good enough, which i cant seem to get out of my current environment."
5475qi,3,2016-09-23,Should I quit my current first time job?,bsktbll5187,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/5475qi/should_i_quit_my_current_first_time_job/,"Hi! So, I'll get right into this. I started a new job about a month and a half ago. I work as a technology risk consultant for a medium size accounting firm. When I was hired I was told I would do things such as penetration testing, IT risk assessments, and cyber security assessments. These are all things that really interest me. I was also told there would be plenty of training since this is all new to me. Well, when I started the first thing I noticed is that there was no specific training for what I would be doing. There was only general HR training. I thought this was weird but i chugged forward. Then, I noticed they were not putting me on any projects even after asking for work multiple times. Another werid thing. Then, our director of cyber security ""resigned"". This is the main person in charge of bringing in clients for risk assessments and such. Another werid thing. Then, this past week they laid off 6 of my co-workers. I have no clue how I was not laid off. Its important to note here that our office is fairly small and fairly new. The longest person here has only been here for a year and a half and that person was one of the ones laid off. Now, I'm finally being put on projects but they are nothing like what I was told I would be doing or what I'm interested in. I'm looking at financial statements and other accounting audit things. This is down right boring to me and worst, I have no clue what I'm doing since I have only taken one accounting class (IT major).

So with all of this, I'm looking for advice. Should I quit this job and try to find anothrr one? My fear is I won't be able to find a job soon or that it looks bad that I was only at this job for a month and a half. Should I take a contractor position. How hard is it to find a contractor employee as an entry level person? I noticed the previous company I worked for as a a help desk intern is hiring for a full time help desk employee. My fear there is that its a pretty large pay cut (60k currently to around 45k) and the stigma associated with being a help desk person. Any help is much appreciated. Thanks!"

I graduated May 2016 from a top 50 university. Never had an internship during university but I did work on a some personal projects and done some IT volunteering. My courses also had projects but don't think those are too relevant to employers. I had around a 3.0 GPA and my programming skills would also be around average (for reference I can solve easy and a few medium LeetCode problems. Also did pretty well on some technical interviews but didn't get an offer).

I'm applying for literally every junior / entry-level position around my area as I can't afford to move. I am getting a low amount of callback from my applications. In total, I only received 7 in-person interviews (also had 6 phone interviews that led to nothing). Zero callbacks from any new grad positions.

I have already had my resume critiqued over at /r/cscareerquestions (using my main reddit account) and mostly received positive feedback. Overall my resume seems decent. I have sent out ~100 applications. At this point I am not sure if programming is the right thing for me as I still haven't landed a job yet.

So far I applied for the following positions (most are listed as junior / entry level):

* Software developer
* System analyst
* Business analyst
* Web developer
* UI / UX designer
* Development support
* QA

My questions are:

* Should I give up looking for jobs in the software development industry?
* If I do give up, what jobs should I search for where I can apply my CS degree to?

Edit: Another question: If I cannot enter the IT / software industry, how would I even write a non-software dev resume? I don't have any customer service or any other experience besides my programming projects.

Thanks again!"

Her green eyes fell to the lower compartment of the desk, her fingers grazed the steel lock, ""*48210*"" her mind echoed, as the compartment popped open.

Inside sat numerous folders, she carefully pulled out one near the bottom. Inside were pictures of the old Prime Minister, the President, and their families. When both of them had died within just days of eachother, both seemingly of natural causes the country went into practical chaos. With no unified leadership, an election would be held. The nationalists no longer had a strong firm hand on both the Executive and Legislative branches.

After sifting through the file for a few more minutes, the woman slammed it shut. Grabbing a lighter from nearby, she made her way to the most ventilated room in the Capital, which just so happened to be the bathroom. Kotryna stood at the sink for a moment, thinking over what she'd done. Since the founding of Uralic Confederation and her new found title of President, she had to destroy all her involvement in both former leaders deaths.

A big industry in downtown Los Angeles that dealt with many movie, tv and rock stars. Basically, offering rich and famous people services to handle their careers while also giving fresh faced wannabes the opportunities.

Katy was one of them, a young girl that wasn't even 21 yet dreams of making it in music, becoming a world known star. She had tried numerous times and had many meetings with companies to try and get her talent across to no avail. Eventually the money she saved up from her part time job while she was in school dried up and she had to pick up a job in L.A she she thought why not a business in a similar field to her dreams.

Katy remembered when she walked into the office for the first time, people couldn't believe what she looked like and you think they would be accustomed to seeing gorgeous people all the time. She had worn a pair of red 6 inch stilettos and a tiny pencil skirt that would of been the shortest a woman could wear. Thigh high stockings that hugged tight to her legs that were held up by clasps attached to a garter belt. The tight blouse she wore strained her rather biggest assets, her double DD breasts that were pushed up in her black bra. They bounced around as she worked around the office, attracting the attention of many guys. The man Katy worked for was always delighted to see her, his eyes filling up with lust as he looked her body over before leading her into his office and shutting the door.

Katy regularly wore clothes that brung her attention, it was always another pair of 6 inch heels, short skirts and stockings accompanied by a tight low cut blouse. Guys around the office started to talk about Katy, about how they would love to ram her as she bent over their desk. Many guys often tried to get with her but she always refused.

Soon Katy developed a reputation for being a strong feminist supporter. She thought that all men were pigs for treating women as nothing more than a pair of tits and ass with a pretty face. That's how Katy felt in meetings, guys would get sidetracked around her and just stare at her boobs or ass. They wouldn't take her seriously and thought that she was just a slut. She thought that guys only chatted to her because they wanted to fuck her and weren't even calling her by name around the office, she overheard them calling her by her big tits.

Though what Katy did, didn't always match up with what she said. She would scold men for staring at her body when she wore revealing clothing everyday. She would also find every excuse to bend over to give everyone a good look at her, regularly dropping things on the ground. She would get angry at guys all the time for flirting with her as they obviously wanted to fuck her but she would flirt with guys all the time brushing her hand near their groin and giving them a sexy, sultry look as she walked away.

One day the CEO came to the office and went to a meeting room with about 30 other businessmen. They were all aged between 50-80 years old. After about an hour, Katy was called into the meeting room. Jason, a fellow coworker had a desk right in front of the room, he watched her strut in their, clad in her tight clothes. She closed the door behind her. It must of been 4 hours until the doors opened again, with the old guys walking out with satisfied looks on their faces. They talked about how great that was and how they must do it again soon. Out Katy stepped as they finally all left. Her hair was disheveled while she was fixing her rumpled blouse and rolling down her skirt while carrying her stilettos. As she walked she pulled out a curly hair from her mouth and wiped away a bit of stickiness from her lips. Going to her desk and continuing work like nothing happened.

------------------

I want this role play to involve scenarios following the womens career such as trying to break into the industry (a lot of time spent as the secretary), dealing with the sudden fame, hook ups with celebrities, sex tapes, paparazzi, fans, relationships, becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol and turning into a nymphomaniac.

The prompt above doesn't have to be the start or involved in it... just an example of some writing.

Can be different and have a male celebrity and their journey. (Check out my 'Famous Life' posting in my post history for that)

I want to play the males the celeb will encounter. I want someone to play the main lead which will be the young female starlet. I would love for the young starlet to be Katy Perry or Kylie Jenner but I like a lot of other celebs as well such as Taylor Swift, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande, Megan Fox, Margot Robbie, Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Alba. Though.. the female celebrity can be an original character that is made up would love her to look like Madison Ivy or Lana Rhoades though also into Lindsey Pelas, Emily Sears and Claudia Alende.

I prefer to roleplay on Google Docs and use messengers to chat and set things up such as K , skype, yahoo msger and google chat/hangouts. Want this to be a long term rp

If you are interested and wish to talk about this further send me a message. Please make your message to me detailed and include any character/ scenario ideas, which celebrities you like and what platforms you use.

P.S Also have a recent posting in which I mention all the rp's and things I'm interested in for a long term rp, so check that out if you want, particularly interested in doing a Marvel Black Widow RP or a Post apocalyptic/dystopia world that is similar to Fallout or a Bioshock rp.

I'm a sophomore in college and was hoping to get some advice from my fellow college students or alumni. I've begun looking for internships abroad for next summer but was having a bit of trouble deciding which program I would choose. 

So far, I've gotten into three programs that promise to guarantee me a Business Development Internship abroad. I've applied to Global Experiences, Asia Internship Program, and Absolute Internship. They're all around the same price range and seem to offer the same benefits more or less. What differentiates them would most likely be where I would be interning. For Global Experiences, I would be working in Barcelona and get a chance to practice my Spanish. For the Asia Internship Program, I would be going to Hong Kong, Bangkok, or Singapore. And finally, Absolute Internship would place me in Hong Kong,

I'm a little split on which program I should go into. On one hand, going to Barcelona would help my Spanish skills and help me to develop my fluency in the language. On the other hand, I feel like the fast-paced (and perhaps more reputable) companies in Asia might be more beneficial in developing the business section of my resume.

I was hoping to hear from people who have either worked with one of these programs or interned abroad at some point in college. Is there anything you liked in particular about working abroad? How were the programs you worked with? I'd really appreciate any and all advice. Thank you in advance!

I left because at the time because I didn't want to take the time and work it out. We had just gotten married, had a kid, change careers, and had to move in with her parents. That all happen in a year. Before that we had been together for 6 years. And I felt like I was being pushed into doing things I didn't want to do and that I wasn't being heard. So when a college intern started giving me attention I thought that was what I wanted and took it. My wife found out and was willing to work thing out with me if I left her. But I didn't. 
I swore up and down that this girl and I were so much more compatible than me and my wife. My wife begged and pleaded with me to work things out that we were just have a rough patch and that everything is very fixable. But I didn't. She filed for divorce. 
I was with the other girl for 6 months. She went back to school and I went down to see her a few time. Then she just upped and dumped me. And I was very shocked because she talked about how she wanted to be with me and that we'd have fun and adventures and do so many things. Turned out I learned from other people later that this isn't the first time she has done this. 
So I tried just being on my own and dated other girls but I realized that I wanted to be with my wife and daughter. And when I went back and told her I was ready to work on it she wasn't willing anymore. 
Now 20 years later I'm alone and have a very bad relationship with my daughter and I wish more than anything I'd stayed and works on things. 
I'm not saying we would of been together if we had tried but I know she and I would of had a better relationship and been able to Co parent better if not her else.
Now I'm not say that everybody should stick around and try therapy and work on the relationship but if you have a good friendship and are comfortable and most of your problems are just communication issues you should try.
I've learned that new relationship feeling goes away and that the grass isn't always greener on the other side. I look back on that now and realized I was being selfish. 

TLTR: Divorce for 20 years and wish I would've stayed and worked on things."

Right now I'm waiting for bar results and if I passed, I'll be sworn in early November.

So once I'm legit does that mean I can immediately just go into court and represent clients on small time misdemeanors?  I have a few friends who said they know tons of people who could regularly use a lawyer for their dumb decisions and would push them my way.  I can use this word of mouth for advertising and maybe craigslist.  

I figure I could charge flat rates for things that usually end in a plea bargain, such as $250 for weed possession or $500 for a theft case, and maybe have a different payment schedule for additional appearances or trial. I already know the ins and outs of the municipal court system and have represented about 250 clients during my internships on just about every charge.

Do I need malpractice coverage or to incorporate or anything or is my plan pretty doable without having to go through all the expensive steps of setting up an actual law practice.

It's only been a week or so and  I got another offer from my school and I would get paid for work study.

I spent the past few months mustering up the courage to go for a dream job. I'm under-qualified on paper because my GPA was pretty fucked up early on in college, and that snowballed into not getting internships, and resorting to shitty paying part time jobs during my summers. Still, I leveraged my connections and limited internship experience to get a leg through the door to start chatting with existing professionals in my field. I spent about two months working at this (networking, interview prepping), only to find out yesterday that the time had passed for me to get a position. I felt like everybody I spoke to, realistically told me I had a chance-- but two months later, I'm finding out that I don't. 

I had pretty much taken a hiatus from everything to try to get my life together for this job, and I didn't even have the chance for an interview... I guess that's just life sometimes-- and I have come to terms with accepting that. Doesn't make me feel any less shitty though. I guess one aspect that really bothers me is that I really feel underqualified sometimes. As if I'm not smart enough. I find that I have a hard time remembering, concentrating, comprehending, etc. And it leads me to some serious anxiety at times. When people mention test anxiety, I feel like I have it. Yet I got through college decently. I've done lots of reading about self-doubt and how to rid it from your life. And I've tried to read into why I can't focus (maybe because of excessive use of technology?). I've gotten into the habit of meditating for at least 20 minutes every morning. I've been getting exercise. However, something continues to feel so off... It carries into my social interactions. Where once I was very comfortable saying anything openly, or interacting with anybody, now I have anxiety and I overthink about every situation in my life. The anxiety silences me. How do I let go? The more I read about it, the more I think about ways in which to let go, instead of letting go... The more I think about what I'm saying, the more I panic...

We can discuss specific prompts in private and please, do not message me with a scene already started, that’s the easiest way to get blocked. The same goes for one line/word messages.

I'm fairly open with my kinks with my only hard ""no""s being scat, unrealistically huge cocks, 3rd person writing, and vomit.

Without further ado, here are some of my prompts:

**The Lawyer and the Con**: For this one, I was thinking I’d play a young and up and coming lawyer tasked with defending you. We can discuss the specifics in PMs but one thing is for certain, I’ll be taking my payment in the form of cock.

**Breaking the Law**: For this one, the roles are reversed, I was caught committing a crime and you’re the officer/journalist/detective who caught me. Where that leads? Well that’s up to you.

**Wrong neighborhood**: What happens when me, a young and sexy girl finds herself in the wrong neighborhood? Do you help me find my way or decide you want to take advantage?

**Sports Star and Reporter**: A classic scene were I’m a reporter and you’re the sports star, that can only lead one place, right?

**The intern and the boss**: Fairly self explanatory, I’d love to be the intern at her dream job who meets you, her boss and potentially so much more.

**Opposite Sides**: For this one, I want to play a FBI/CIA/DEA Agent who is tasked with infiltrating your organization, now what that organization does we can discuss in PMs but I basically want you to turn me from righteous agent of the law into your slut.

**I’m gonna fuck your sister**: For this one, you’ll play my little brother’s best friend, I’ll be his big sister who is now recently single and back in town. You guys always joked that you would fuck each other’s mom/sister only this time, you’re not joking.

**Giving back**: In this RP, I’ll play someone  famous be it an actress or singer or sports star. You’ll be the person tasked in helping me set up some sort of event to give back to the community, only you want me to give you something more than this event.

**Bullies always win**: In this one, you’ll be as the title suggests, you’re a bully who grew up terrorizing my son (or brother), only unlike the stories we tell our kids to make them feel better, you know better. You get what you want, when you want it, in this case, me.

For those of you so inclined, I do like playing celebs in any of these roles so we have visual aids, if you’d like me to be any, just ask!

I did my best for 1 am on a day i forgot my meds.. 

A little background, i got out of my first serious relationship in July.. We were together 10 months but friends for 2 years before that. We went through a lot of big life moments together over that time and now that shes gone i feel so empty and unwanted.. And to make matters worse, I'm the kind of person that wants a small tight group of friends, and my school friend group evaporated when i had to leave school for an internship.

Now my current situation is im back at school. No local friends that I actually consider close anymore, and trying to reconnect with old friends have fallen flat. I hate talking to people i don't know with a flaming passion, particularly random people with no mutual friends to me. Ergo, i don't make friends quickly. That's the bad. The good is i am trying my damnedest to make changes about myself that i like. I'm working on keeping up with my hair and developing a personal style. Trying to straighten my posture and tone my body a bit. Im pushing myself to talk to a girl if i think shes cute and to talk with confidence, and to trust my social instincts. No idea if its working or not overall, but I'm genuinely trying. 

The part where my meddlesome life comes in is that I've hit a wall in my progress. It feels like I've stalled out and i have no idea how to recover that momentum and go back to making progress. And it all stems from one thing: college is bullshit. In one semester, i am expected to... 

-go to 15 hours of classes a week

-spend a minimum of 15 hours on homework each week, which i usually surpass if not double. 

-pay the school $13k to be allowed to go to these classes

-participate in extracurriculars to learn new things and meet new people

-find internships and network with companies 

-develop myself, my ideals, and mature because im becoming and adult

-get money to pay for things i want to do

-put a roof over my head (which means more work or pay more to the school) 

-put food on the table (again, more work or pay more to the school) 

-be healthy

-go out to have memorable experiences and make stories to tell when you get old

-develop friendships

-build your personal life (relationships) 

-spend time with your family 

-manage the 500,000 other things that come with being an adult (bills, broken cars, medical crap) 

-sleep

And when you look at that list, and remember that sleep is only kind of optional and combined with eating leaves 105ish hours in a week.. You run out of time pretty fast. 35 hours in class work, 25 hours at work, 20 hours in getting in and out of bed+driving from place to place... Next thing i know im finding that i might have to make a decision that i cant handle making right now. 

Do I continue focusing on my career and throw my personal life in the garbage until i have more free time? Or do i keep trying to cram in time to find the one and have friends and be happy, even if it impacts how successful i could be? And i.... And cant make that call... Because the me of September is screwed. His life sucks. But if he makes the right choice, the me of October or November or of 2017 could be pretty damned happy. And i have no idea what the right choice is. 

I guess my reason for posting this is, what do you guys think? Do i have to make this choice? Or am I pulling a Janus and creating my own phantom doors to choose between? 

TL:dr-college sucks and it feels like i only have time for my career or my personal life. Do i have to choose, or is a middle ground possible somehow?"

549ir6,1,2016-09-24,US playwright Edward Albee: The character of his opposition to the status quo,ShaunaDorothy,AnythingGoesEve,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnythingGoesEve/comments/549ir6/us_playwright_edward_albee_the_character_of_his/," By David Walsh
22 September 2016

Edward Albee, one of the most prominent figures in the postwar American theater, died at his home in Montauk, New York on September 16. He was 88 years old.

Albee is best remembered for works he wrote a half century ago or more, including The Zoo Story (1959), The Death of Bessie Smith (1960), The Sandbox (1960), The American Dream (1961), Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1962) and A Delicate Balance (1966). Out of critical and popular favor for decades, Albee experienced a degree of renewed success with Three Tall Women (1991) and The Goat or Who is Sylvia? (2000). During his lengthy career, Albee won numerous awards, including three Pulitzer Prizes for Drama and two Tony Awards for Best Play.

Albee was an immensely gifted and articulate writer, with a genuine feeling for the rhythm of language and an obvious flair for the dramatic. His early works, including The Zoo Story, a one-act play, and, most especially, Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, a full-length work, made a strong impression on the public when they were first performed. In these works, and others of the time, Albee launched fierce attacks on middle-class complacency and hypocrisy, and the moral failure of American society.

The playwright described himself on many occasions as an enemy of the status quo. This was entirely to his credit. However, if Albee’s conception of this enmity remained quite limited, as we shall discuss, this was bound up with the social-cultural environment in which he matured in Cold War America and the milieu in which he circulated.

Albee’s family background is a singular one. He was born in Washington, DC in March, 1928 to a woman who could not support a child. The father had “deserted and abandoned both the mother and child,” according to the subsequent adoption papers. When he was 18 days old, the child was adopted by Reed A. Albee and Frances C. Albee, a wealthy, childless couple. Reed Albee’s money came from his father, the head of the Keith-Albee chain of vaudeville theaters. The Albees lived in luxury in Larchmont, New York on the Long Island Sound.

The writer later claimed that he always felt like an interloper in the household. “They bought me. They paid $133.30”—i.e., the cost of the adoption services. His “outsider” status in his own family and his discovery of his homosexuality at an early age no doubt helped distance Albee from the American mainstream. He had a difficult time in school, being expelled or dismissed from several high schools and colleges. He left home for good in his late teens. Toward the end of his life, Albee told an interviewer he had been “thrown out” of the family home because he refused to become the “corporate thug” his parents desired him to be.

During the 1950s, Albee lived in Greenwich Village in New York City and worked at numerous odd jobs. He also received money from a trust fund. He wrote poems, plays and novels that were not published.

Albee wrote The Zoo Story in three weeks in 1958. It was first performed in West Berlin in 1959 on a double bill with Samuel Beckett’s Krapp’s Last Tape.

The short play takes place in Central Park in New York. There are two characters. Peter, a middle-aged man, an executive with a small publishing house, who “wears tweeds, smokes a pipe, carries horn-rimmed glasses.” We eventually learn that he has a wife, two daughters, two cats and two parakeets, the perfect, contented American family. Peter is peacefully reading his newspaper on a park bench on a Sunday afternoon when Jerry enters into conversation with him. The latter is younger, poorer and suffering, according to Albee’s description, from “great weariness.”

The conversation begins innocently, if oddly, enough, with Jerry’s now-famous line: “I’ve been to the zoo. (PETER doesn’t notice) I said, I’ve been to the zoo. MISTER, I’VE BEEN TO THE ZOO!” Peter responds politely enough, but Jerry becomes more and more intrusive, asking personal questions and revealing the character of his own lonely existence. When Peter has had enough and tries to leave, Jerry becomes aggressive and pulls out a knife. He drops it and tells Peter, “There you go. Pick it up.” The other man does so and Jerry eventually impales himself on the blade. In his final, dying words, he thanks Peter.

Something about the coldness and isolation, and inequality, of modern urban life emerges. Jerry lives in a rooming house, with a “few clothes, a hot plate that I’m not supposed to have, a can opener.” His neighbors are the marginalized. His closest relationship, aside from those with prostitutes, is with his landlady’s dog, about whom he speaks in a lengthy monologue.

Years later, Albee would explain, “Jerry is a man who has not closed down, … who during the course of the play is trying to persuade Peter that closing down is dangerous and that life for all its problems, all of its miseries, is worth participating in, absolutely fully.”

Albee was attacked for his play in establishment circles. On the floor of the US Senate, Prescott Bush (father and grandfather of two US presidents) denounced The Zoo Story as “filthy.”

The influence of Beckett, Eugene Ionesco and the “theater of the absurd” is evident in The Zoo Story, which is to say, Albee was under the influence of some of the same social and intellectual tendencies as those writers. British playwright Harold Pinter, born in 1930, was an almost exact contemporary. Pinter’s first play, The Room, was written and performed in 1957.

The intellectuals of the time, or the more sensitive ones, were appalled by contemporary society, by the giant corporations and institutions that had emerged in the aftermath of World War II, by the Cold War, by the threat of nuclear destruction, by the officially sponsored conformism and pursuit of material wealth.

On the other hand, for the most part they saw no way out of the situation. Stalinism and its crimes, widely identified with communism and socialism, seemed to many to have closed off the possibility of revolutionary change. The various counterrevolutionary “labor” bureaucracies suppressed the working class politically. Existentialism and other forms of irrationalism suggested that the human condition was absurd, but that one had to endure and find some meaning in what was perhaps a meaningless existence. Abstract expressionism in painting and the “Beat” movement emerged from these general ideological conditions.

In The Death of Bessie Smith Albee paid oblique tribute to the civil rights movement and the suffering of African Americans. The short play takes place in Memphis, Tennessee in 1937, in a hospital. An overworked white nurse, a white intern and a black orderly feature prominently. The premise of the play is that Bessie Smith, the great blues singer (who never appears in the play), dies following a car crash because she is refused admittance to a whites-only hospital. This was generally believed at the time. In fact, Smith was taken directly to a hospital in Clarksdale, Mississippi where she died seven hours after the accident. But Albee’s play concerns itself with race and class relations in America, and retains much of its power. The character of the Nurse stands out in particular.

Albee reserved much of his venom for the American upper-middle-class, nuclear family. In The American Dream, an absurdist satire, the central characters are Mommy, Daddy and Grandma. The couple, we discover, had once adopted a son. Unhappy with it, they mutilated the child and ultimately killed it. As Grandma, a sympathetic character, explains, “Well, for the last straw, it finally up and died; and you can imagine how that made them feel, their having paid for it and all. … They wanted satisfaction; they wanted their money back.”

A Young Man shows up, whom Grandma names “The American Dream,” who turns out to be the original boy’s twin. The old woman moves out and the psychologically damaged Young Man moves in. He will take the place of the original adopted child. The dialogue consists largely of a series of clichés and banalities. In typical Albee fashion, a well-to-do family conceals all the brutal realities.

Albee later asserted that the play “is an examination of the American Scene, an attack on the substitution of artificial for real values in our society, a condemnation of complacency, cruelty, emasculation, and vacuity; it is a stand against the fiction that everything in this slipping land of ours is peachy-keen. Is the play offensive? I certainly hope so.”

The work for which Albee is best known, Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (made into a film with Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, released in 1966), opened in October 1962, only a few days before the eruption of the Cuban Missile Crisis, the confrontation between the US and the USSR over the deployment of Soviet missiles in Cuba. The often intangible and even unnamable psychological menace and paranoia generated by the threat of nuclear annihilation are woven into Albee’s early plays, as they are in many writers’ and filmmakers’ work of the time.

In its framework and episodes, Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (borrowed from a bit of “intellectual’s” graffiti found on a wall) is more naturalistic than Albee’s previous efforts. George is a middle-aged associate professor of history at a small New England College; his wife, Martha, six years his senior, is the daughter of the college president. They return home late at night after a party, where they have already had a good deal to drink. Two guests arrive, a younger couple: Nick, a biology professor, and his wife, Honey.

For the rest of the night, George and Martha engage in furious, non-stop and occasionally amusing abuse of one another in front of the younger pair. Martha relentlessly taunts George and humiliates him. She dismisses her husband as “a FLOP! A great … big … fat FLOP!” In response, George breaks a bottle and holds the remains, like a weapon. Martha remarks, “I hope that was an empty bottle, George. You don’t want to waste good liquor … not on your salary.” It goes on like this.

At one point he pretends to shoot her. “GEORGE: Did you really think I was going to kill you, Martha? MARTHA (Dripping with contempt): You? … Kill me? … That’s a laugh. GEORGE: Well, now, I might … some day.”

The hosts play various vicious games, some on each other, some on their guests. When one of his games turns cruel, George explains calmly, “I hate hypocrisy.” George and Martha also claim to have a son, who is coming home that day. In the end, it turns out that they have no child and the fantasy that they do is one of the great lies sustaining their lives and marriage.

The play, above all, suggests America’s decline into something miserable, sick and full of self-deception. Again, the fear and selfishness under the surface of middle class existence come out, along with that social layer’s hypocrisy and servility. Success and stature, the jockeying for position, on this wretched, unimportant little campus absorb much of the time and thought of all four characters. Whatever was promising about America and the American Dream (and George and Martha, of course, are the names of the first president of the US and his wife) has somehow come down to this: stupid, petty and sterile infighting, an endless drunken, malicious quarrel in the middle of the night. All this expenditure of energy … for what?

The characters are not so much hateful, as pitiful. Toward the end of the play, Martha laments, “I do not wish to be happy, and yes I do wish to be happy. George and Martha, sad, sad, sad.”

In A Delicate Balance, a well-to-do couple, Agnes and Tobias live with Agnes’s alcoholic sister, Claire. Their daughter Julia is expected to arrive home soon, fleeing her fourth unsuccessful marriage. Friends of Agnes and Tobias’s, Harry and Edna, arrive and ask if they can stay. A terrible, intangible fear has overtaken them.

What to do with Harry and Edna, whether to ask them to leave or accept them and accept responsibility for them in their plight, becomes a central question in the play. The strongest element of A Delicate Balance, once again, is the contrast between the well-established rules of conduct of these polite, educated people and the painful, contradictory realities of life.

Albee wrote many other plays, including adaptations of works by Carson McCullers (The Ballad of the Sad Café) and Vladimir Nabokov (Lolita), but these early works contain the most compelling expression of his artistic ideas and social concerns.

Albee insisted until the end of his life that he was an enemy of existing conditions. In his introduction to Box and Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung (1968), Albee argued that one of the chief obligations of the playwright was to “try to alter his society,” since, as he explained, “very few serious plays are written to glorify the status quo.” In an interview in 2009, he told a journalist, along the same lines, that “A play should be an act of aggression against the status quo.”

Nor did Albee have much use for fashionable and marketable “identity politics.” Defending his decision to write about a host of characters, he told an interviewer, fellow playwright Craig Lucas, in 1992, “After all, there are a number of things we have not been, you and I. We’ve not been women, we’ve not been 80 years old, we’ve not been black. A lot of things we haven’t been. But its our responsibility to be able to be them, isn’t it?”

Albee attracted criticism for rejecting the term “gay writer.” In a May 2011 speech, he commented, “A writer who happens to be gay or lesbian must be able to transcend self. I am not a gay writer. I am a writer who happens to be gay. … Any definition which limits us is deplorable.” After his comments were attacked, he told National Public Radio, “Maybe I’m being a little troublesome about this, but so many writers who are gay are expected to behave like gay writers and I find that is such a limitation and such a prejudicial thing that I fight against it whenever I can.”

Albee’s criticism of the “status quo” could be quite fierce. He was quoted in 1980 as saying, “I think television is the destruction of the United States. I mean, that and the Republican Party … And the Democratic Party, for that matter, come to think of it.”

In Everything in the Garden (1967), Albee’s American adaptation of a black comedy by British playwright Giles Cooper, a group of respectable suburban housewives turn to prostitution en masse (although unbeknownst to one another) to supplement their husbands’ incomes. When one of the wives is caught out, she turns on her husband and decries the corrupt, even criminal manner in which each of the men earns a living. She sums it up: “You all stink, you’re all killers and whores.”

Albee’s sincerity was unquestionable. However, when the playwright spoke of opposition to the status quo, he meant primarily the moral, sexual and psychological status quo. To many intellectuals and artists in the US, and this view was encouraged by the various academic left tendencies (the Frankfurt School and so forth), capitalism had resolved its economic contradictions. What remained were the problems of alienation, aloneness, conformism and sexual repression.

Continuing to engage exclusively with these issues and ignoring the explosive questions that emerged in the 1970s and beyond, including the growing impoverishment of masses of Americans and the overall economic-cultural decline of the US, meant that Albee’s work failed to treat much of what was new and challenging, and urgently in need of artistic description, in American life.

Many of Albee’s later plays, and even some of the early ones, are not strong or convincing. Plays like Tiny Alice (1964), Malcolm (1966), Seascape (1975), Counting the Ways (1976), The Man Who Had Three Arms (1982) and others are not particularly engaging. The self-conscious “absurdism” often wears thin. There is a great deal of repetition, between and even within plays. The ideas are often murky and secondary, or commonplace.

Albee was at war with hostile critics for many years, and the critics were often obtuse, but the lack of success of many of his plays with the general public was not principally due to the reviewers’ shortcomings. He wrote numerous tedious and almost pointless plays. He seemed to have run out of important things to say at a relatively young age.

Albee returned time and time again to his early family relations. The ineffectual, “castrated” father, the domineering mother, the victimized son … There are only so many times one can cover the same ground. Did Albee have a childhood that was so excruciating, or that was of such world-historical significance that it needed to be treated over and over again, from different angles, during the course of 40 years?

No, that is not the case. It is rather that there are social and political conditions in which the artist’s individual psychological problems and traumas take on “world-historical” importance to him or her. There are periods when one’s family life dominates, when what one’s mother and father did or didn’t do years ago continues to be a central obsession in later life. This was the type of historical period in which Albee matured, when the class struggle apparently receded into the background.

Albee was no Henrik Ibsen, the Norwegian playwright, but some of the comments that Russian Marxist Georgi Plekhanov made on the subject of Ibsen in a 1908 essay (“Ibsen, Petty Bourgeois Revolutionist”) seem appropriate. Plekhanov noted that at the time when “Ibsen’s opinions and ideals were being formulated, a working class, in the present sense of the term, had not yet developed … and was, therefore, nowhere evident in public life.” This encouraged in Ibsen, “individual protests against the hypocrisy and vulgarity which surrounds him.” His was “the revolt of the modern spirit.”

Plekhanov goes on, “Now if a man teaches revolt simply because it is revolt, not knowing himself to what end it should lead, then his teaching will take on a rather nebulous character. If he is an artist, and thinks in terms of images and forms, then the vagueness of his thinking will necessarily result in vague artistic images. An abstract and schematic element will creep into his creative work. … The ‘revolution of the spirit of man’ leaves everything unchanged. The pregnant mountain has again given birth to a tiny mouse.”

Unhappily, for much of his later career, as a result of the nebulousness of his ideas and the formlessness of his opposition to the status quo, Albee gave birth to nothing but “tiny mice.”

Robert Brustein, the distinguished critic, producer and academic, once referred to Albee “as one who sympathized profoundly with the oppressed of the world.” One has no reason to doubt this, but it is not distinctly and sharply present in his work or public utterances. It is worth noting that in Mel Gussow’s biography, Edward Albee: A Singular Journey (1999), there is a single reference to the Vietnam War in the index. According to an August 1968 New York Times article, Albee did lend his name as a sponsor of the anti-war “Summer of Support,” aimed at US servicemen, along with Pete Seeger, Dustin Hoffman, Phil Ochs and others.

Overall, however, as one commentator notes, Albee’s plays in the 1970s spoke to “personal” rather than “social” disillusionment.

One has to look to the general features of Albee’s time, the postwar economic expansion and the Cold War, for the conditions that shaped his thinking. He traveled to the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, and certainly distinguished himself from the extreme right confrontationists, but his comments on the USSR do not rise above the level of garden variety anticommunist liberalism. His facile use of selections from Mao’s “Little Red Book” in Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung, either wooden truisms or Stalinist falsifications, gives some sense of his attitude toward what he took to be “Marxism” and “revolutionary theory.”

The “abstract and schematic element” in Albee’s work also manifests itself in the ahistorical character of his plays, and the often nameless characters: Mommy and Daddy, Young Man and Grandma, He and She, A B and C. He once told an interviewer, “Most of my plays are not tied to time, particularly.” He didn’t care for having the phrase “timeless” applied to his work, he explained, “but I don’t think they [the plays] are beholden to specific dates.”

Unfortunately, there is nothing that becomes dated more rapidly than the “dateless.” Abstract psychological characterizations and speculations and, frankly, the obsession with oneself do not generally lead to the most rewarding, enriching art. “We all wish to devour ourselves, enter ourselves, be the subject and object all at once,” asserts a character in Albee’s Listening (1976). But the artist seriously attuned to the world and life has more compelling things to do.

Albee’s great strength lay in his ability to represent his upper-middle-class figures, to reveal their inner lives. He helped demystify and discredit the affluent layers who thought themselves fully in control. Moreover, his rejection of corruption and cowardice, his insistence on unpleasant truths about American society in the late 1950s and early 1960s unquestionably contributed to the mood of radicalism and opposition that emerged later in the decade.

To paraphrase Plekhanov, drab, postwar American reality showed Albee what had to be opposed, but it could not by itself show him which road to pursue.

I'm wondering if someone could tell me my chances of getting accepted into the following schools: William and Mary, University of Virginia, and George Mason University. I would be very appreciative if someone could tell me their thoughts.

Academics:
- Full IB Diploma Program Student
- 4.25 GPA
- Top 7.5% of the class
- Mostly IB classes, though I took ""three"" AP classes (I dropped one due to a change of interest)
- IB Chem. (HL), IB Math Studies (SL), IB History (HL), IB Language and Literature (HL), IB Spanish (SL), IB Anthropology (SL), AP Comp. Govt, AP European History, AP Computer Science (the one I dropped), Theory of Knowledge

Tests:
-1240 on the ""New"" SAT - I am currently preparing for the next one
- 26 on the ACT
- 710 on the World History SAT, though I'm not sure if the score is good enough to justify me sending it

Extracurriculars:
- Archeological internship program at George Washington's boyhood home: 11th, 12th
- I design and build computers: 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th
- I do international-style power-lifting and bodybuilding: 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th 
- HTML programming / Website design: 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th
- FBLA: 12th (I probably won't put this on applications due to the short amount of time that I have participated in it)
- My parents' work schedules don't allow me to stay after school for any extracurriculars (the internship required a LOT of maneuvering)

Extras:
- Resident of Virginia
- I am applying for Early Decision / Action for all of them
- Counselor is able to write a very positive recommendation
- Interest in History and Government

Unknown:
- Admittedly, I received a minor (that is how the counselor will say it) 5-day (Junior Year) suspension for disrespecting a teacher after I received a bad grade in 11th grade; thankfully, the principal has generously agreed to write a letter stating that it shouldn't be a deciding factor in admissions

William and Mary is my first choice, and I have thought about doing a fall interview (it's not too late). Again, some feedback and tips would be most appreciated - this process has been nerve-wrecking.

EDIT: I have signed up for the on-campus interview. Wish me luck."

Good idea?,Sneakymist,PersonalFinanceCanada,https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/54a3qq/21_yo_thinking_of_use_wealthsimple_to_hold_extra/,"I've been looking around this subreddit and other places to try to enter the market, and stumbled upon WealthSimple. It seems like it would really fit me because it uses a robo-advisor to select portfolios on my behalf, and it's essentially free up to $15000 ($10k from Reddit + $5k from referral). 

I'm currently entering my third year of university, and through my internships I have up to $12000 that I can put into Wealthsimple. If I will be graduating in two years, and intend to withdraw that money then to pay off my school debt, would it be a good idea to use Wealthsimple in the first place? Even if I choose a conservative portfolio? 

The main reason I want to do this is because of the low interest rate offered by my bank currently (Tangerine). 

Thank you for any help. "

I'm about to graduate from a Boston area school and I'm currently interviewing for full time sales roles (SDR/BDR). I have been a top performer in my summer sales internship with a large software company in the area, so I know what the environment is like and it really excites me. 


That being said, where do you think I should go to create the best sales foundation for myself?


I'm considering large firms with established programs and also high growth mid stage startups. 


I'm concerned large companies may stagnate my growth potential as I'll be surrounded by many low performers and have less opportunity for promotion. However, the idea of a formal sales training program sounds important as a new grad. What are your thoughts here?


As for high growth mid stage companies (~100M/yr in sales, 250-750 employees), I think it's a great opportunity to ""hit the ground running"" and have a lot more autonomy. Although I'm concerned they might be overhyping any training they claim to provide and have a ""burn and churn"" mentality (I do not see ""burn and churn"" at the current place I'm at). I realize this is highly variable on the company. 


To top this all off, I'd like to get out of Boston and move West, specifically Bay Area or Silicon Valley. 


I'm open to your suggestions, thank you very much in advance



TL;DR: large co or high growth startup for college grad trying to maximize long term growth potential in sales? Preferably in CA. "
54al4h,1,2016-09-24,"New to the CS field, need opinions on my career plans!",blueberrykirby,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/54al4h/new_to_the_cs_field_need_opinions_on_my_career/,"I'm currently a junior in college majoring in linguistics with a psych minor. Over the summer I had an internship in linguistics where I basically realized my original plan of going to graduate school and becoming a professor was maybe too far fetched and not the best idea unless I was really good at research and ready to do research my whole life (which isn't the case). I had always been good at math and was looking for a related area that I could focus on, and while I had never had any experience with computer science, I thought I'd look into it. 

I ended up being really interested in it and I've added a computer science minor now, and even though my classes are difficult I'm really loving it so far. I definitely missed all the math and problem solving, and I actually somewhat enjoy doing homework for the first time. 

Obviously, though, my major is still linguistics. But I think I have a better selection going for a more CS based job vs a linguistics based job after college. I'm not planning on going to graduate school right now, but that could change if I think I need to to get hired. I was planning on taking a little time after I graduate to improve my programming skills since a CS minor doesn't really give me enough credentials to apply for programming jobs, and I assume I'll need a lot more practice than my minor will provide me with.

So I guess my question is, what kind of job would want someone like me? Can my linguistics background help me at all in any CS positions? I've kept a 4.0 GPA so far in college which I feel is helpful, but will employers even care about that since my major was linguistics and not computer science?"

I've never been one for whom on-the-spot mathematical thinking comes naturally, and I'm definitely better at data structures problems in which I can visualize the problem easier.

54b4ir,4,2016-09-24,A Light of Hope...,SIRmisterD,mag,https://www.reddit.com/r/mag/comments/54b4ir/a_light_of_hope/,"Good afternoon everyone.

I'd like to start out with talking about my background in MAG. I first found out about MAG a couple months before release from a GameStop ad in 2009. After researching the game I was so stoked for it that I begged my parents to allow me to go to the midnight release, and sure enough, it was my first ever midnight release. It's important to note that at this time, I was a month out from turning 10, and I am now 16. The next day after release was probably one of the best days for me, playing MAG all day and just enjoying a very unique game at the time. During its lifetime this was my favorite and only game I tended to play. When the time came for Sony to finally put the game to rest, it was extremely heart-breaking. However, that day wasn't only negative as it also demonstrated how well the entire community could rally together and enjoy the game one last time.

With that being said, for the past few months I have had an insane urge to play this game again even though it's not possible. Over the summer I was fortunate enough to learn and use a program known as Unity3D for a summer internship job.

Now you may be wondering a couple of things: what is the point of telling me this, or how is Unity3D relevant to MAG? Well over this past week I realized, why not try to replicate MAG using Unity3D? I am here today to broadcast this idea to what is left of the MAG community, and hopefully have it turn into a great game in the end.

The game will begin as a PC game, and I hope to bring it to consoles one day. Once I am able to get the game to a playable state (even if the visuals aren't there yet) I will probably open the game to a select few individuals who will be able to test the game just for core mechanics. The select group will be made up of only 20 people (including myself) due to server restrictions. The first game mode that will be implemented will be the good ol' 64 (or 20 during testing) player Sabotage. This brings me into my next point - servers. Unfortunately, because I am not a AAA company I cannot afford to host the game servers myself especially for a game of this magnitude. The reason for such a small testing group is because the server hosting service I will be using has a maximum of 20 people playing simultaneously for the service to remain free. At this point in time, you can expect this game to be a paid and/or subscription game. I am unsure of the exact cost(s) right now, but once the time gets closer I will run some numbers based on the interest of the game and go from there. The ONLY reason for why I will be charging for the game is because of the server costs.

Now that you know what the vision is, I'd like to share how you can be involved even if you don't have a tech background.

* If you would like to voice your opinion on features, changes, wishes, pretty much anything, then please go to [this Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/zc7BNTnE) and make your post(s) under **""Ideas and Any Opinions.""** Please only post under this section as the rest of the sections will be managed by me (just to keep things organized).
* If you are someone who has a tech background, specifically experience with using Unity3D, and you would like to help out then please message me (we will discuss further information directly).
* If you are someone who does artwork, 3D modeling, or any graphics of any kind, and you would like to help out then please contact me (we will discuss further information directly). You don't necessarily need to know Unity3D either.
* If you are someone who has experience with any music/sound design and you would like to help out then please contact me. The game will need background music, and various sound effects. You also don't necessarily need to know Unity3D.
* If you would like to just be involved in discussion and be kept up to date on progress, then feel free to join the Slack Channel. Create a Slack account, sign into a new team, enter the domain: ""mag-remake.slack.com"", and the password is ""magremakeslack"".
* If you have any further questions about any area, then feel free to contact me.

There it is, a long shot of a goal, but one that will be incredibly rewarding in the end if it reaches that point. I also would like to mention that this will definitely not be fully polished and ready to go in a couple of months. As of right now I am the only one working on this with so many aspects of the game to cover. On top of that I do have other responsibilities such as school, life, and everything that comes with those.

If you've made it this far, thank you so much for reading. If you have any questions at all, leave a comment below, message me, or join the slack channel!

As always... Just remember to ""improvise, adapt, overcome"" because ""you fight with the best now."" #Valor

**TL;DR:** I am planning on making a remake of MAG using Unity3D. Here is a shortlist of everything you should know if you're interested:

* The remake will start out on PC.
* At some point there will be 19 selected individuals who will be able to test the game just for core mechanics.
* The first game mode that will be implemented will be Sabotage.
* You can expect the game to be paid and/or a subscription based to cover the server costs.

If you'd like to help out, then there are a few options:

* Be kept up to date and discuss the progression of the game using Slack. **Team's Domain:** ""mag-remake.slack.com"" and the **Password:** ""magremakeslack""
* Voice your opinion for features, changes, wishes, thoughts, etc. using the [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/zc7BNTnE) I created. Please only post under the section **""Ideas and Any Opinions""** as the rest of the sections will be managed by me (just to keep things organized).
* If you create any sort of artwork, 3D models, or graphics and you would like to help with the project then please contact me.

54bd8f,6,2016-09-24,Demon Rehabilitation - Part 21,AlinaKG,AlinaKG,https://www.reddit.com/r/AlinaKG/comments/54bd8f/demon_rehabilitation_part_21/,"The light hurt my eyes. I woke up disorientated, expecting to be in my bedroom. The pillow below my head was hard and smelled of disinfectant and florals. I attempted to retrace my steps but a hot pain spread through my head as I tried to think.
 
Figures stood nearby, talking in muffed voices. My eyes had been too blurry to make out their faces.
 
What time is it? I thought, scared that I had overslept for work. My manager had just about enough of me already. I had never worked as a waitress before and messed up far too much to have had the three years of experience that I told him I had. Being late, on top of that, was just asking to be fire.
 
My tongue felt dry. “Hello,” I said.  A dull ache flickered in my jaw as I opened my mouth to speak. Memories followed the pain. Peter crying, Kel in the living room, torture, pain, and then Bael.
 
The figures stopped talking and turned to me. One of them, a woman, stepped closer. Bulky with hair chopped down to a boyish cut. I did not recognize her. A new doctor, I thought and shut my eyes tightly, as if to erase the thought. I’m not there anymore. I’m not there anymore.  
 
“Just you rest, dear,” she said. “We’ll take care of everything.”
 
“Where am I?” I asked. As far as I could see, light shone from the walls and the floor of the room, and other than my bed, there had been no other furniture.
 
“Don’t worry too much about that right now,” the woman said. “When you wake up tomorrow, everything will be back to normal.”
 
The woman seemed important. The other blurred figure still remained in the distance, listening to her speak.
 
I felt nauseas with worry. Did I have another episode? Kel beat me senseless, but surely not enough to make me see light instead of floors. I felt strange too. Almost weightless but not quite. As if I was up at a great distance with nothing below me, but I was not falling, rather floating. 
 
“Where’s the light coming from?” I asked. My heartbeat quickened at her confused expression.
 
Perhaps, a normal person, who had not spent countless years at a mental institution, might think that trauma they’d been through accounted for all the strange happenings around them, but I had not been normal, apparently. As hard as I tried to fight the idea of madness away, it followed me and wrapped me in a tight cocoon when I had least expected it.
 
Demons, Lily? Demons? And you thought you were fine. I closed my eyes, half expecting them to open in my old room in the asylum. Blink the crazy away. This had been the second time in a day—or however it long I lay her unconscious—that I wondered about my sanity.
 
“Can you tell me where I am, doctor?” The air was humid and the walls, despite having no apparently begging or end, felt as if they crept toward me. I called her doctor because that had been the sanest explanation for her presence. I had been on the verge of tears and for the first time felt as if my mind was truly lost. Could I have invented people and places? I had a job, for crying out loud!
 
Her expression relaxed at little. “Calm down, child. Bael called us. We’re going to help you get better, alright? My name is I am Doctor Deborah. You’ve received a serious head injury.”
 
“Who is Bael?” I asked her, scared that he had been another doctor or a nurse that I had dragged into my madness.
 
“Do you not remember?” she asked. The figure behind her stepped closer but still too far for me to make out his face.
 
“I do, but I just need you to clarify it for me, if that’s alright.”
 
“He’s your friend.”
 
I shook my head. “No.”
 
“He’s not your friend?”
 
“That’s not what I meant. I want to know if I’m crazy,” I said. My eyelids stung with coming tears. “Can you help me, please? I don’t know what’s real anymore.”
 
The doctor opened her mouth but the figure behind her came into the range of my vision. It was Bael, pale faced and wearing a wrinkled suit. “You’re not crazy, Lily.”
 
I turned my head to the doctor, keeping my eyes on Bael. “I’d like him to leave, please.”
 
The woman came closer, and put her head on my forehead. “Why don’t you sleep awhile?” she asked.
 
I felt drowsier suddenly and though I attempted to stay conscious, my eyelids grew heavier and it got harder and harder to lift them up.
*****
I heard spray behind me and a strong scent of vanilla filled the room. Deborah’s office seemed strange now that we were not in hell. The magic faded somewhat. Cars raced in the streets, horns tooted and an occasional merchant’s scream rang through the thick walls.
 
“She was close, Bael,” Deborah said, tapping her long fingernails against the glass sheet on the table.
 
I held my fists tight and looked into the corner of her office, fantasizing about putting a very permanent end to Kel. “I know,” I said.
 
“You should have called—”
 
“I know.”
 
 “Well, why didn’t you then?” Deborah barked.
 
“Because every intern you’ve sent me has been a complete moron.”
 
Deborah snapped her head back. “We have the finest men and women in our training programs.”
 
“I caught the last one taking a shower while Peter lay helpless on some stacked pillows and then found a frozen spoon in my tub of ice-cream.”
 
“Did he die?”
 
“He could have slipped.”
 
“And then you’d be free.” Deborah smiled, studying my expression.
 
“I’ve thought about that more than once. You don’t have to trick me into coming clean. I’ve never tried to hide what I am from you.”
 
“Who is this girl?” she asked, trailing away from the way the conversation was heading.
 
 “Just a neighbor.”
 
“Mae was just a neighbor.”
 
“Ah, yes, Mae.” I crossed my legs. “Thanks for sending her to check up on me. Things almost went over smoothly. You know how I hate it when that happens.”
 
“I won’t apologize for feeling concerned.”
 
“Well, someone better start apologizing for something.”
 
“Why did that girl not want to see you? Did she see something, do you think?”
 
“Because she’s not stupid,” I said simply. “Probably realized that I brought all the trouble to her.”
 
“Are we sure it’s Kel?”
 
“Most likely. Lucifer doesn’t like to repeat himself. He’d have thought of something else. Kel, on the other hand, lives to please and be like daddy. I’m almost certain it’s him.”
 
When I found her, I thought he killed her. Her face was swollen, lips torn, leg facing in a way it shouldn’t, but she took a breath, and another. Then she screamed.
 
I wanted to go over to Lily right that second. Bring her flowers, and those senseless stuffed bears the humans always seem to clutter hospital rooms with. I wanted to apologize, and then apologize again. Grovel without end and give her everything she wanted. It was all very unlike me but I had not felt like myself for a long time, and that was mostly a good thing.
 
“I need you to have a plan,” Deborah said. She opened the bottom of drawer of her desk and took out the bottle the two of us had worked on the last time I found myself in her office.
 
“I have a plan.”
 
“No, you don’t, but you need one. You’ve been surviving daily.”
 
“And what’s wrong with that?”
 
“You need a plan, Bael. I don’t care if you have to flee into the desert and we have to drop food down a tunnel. You need something solid.”
 
“Like a tunnel.”
 
“Don’t be smart. You need a plan. That boy’s seen more in the last six months than I did my entire human life. You won’t save him if you let this persist. Have a plan. Don’t let anything or anyone make you stray from it.”
 
“I’m not in love, Deborah.”
 
“No one us are in love, and then suddenly, we just are. And I don’t even care about that. Love who you love. Take Mae or Lily or whichever damsel you want to save next and bring her with you into that tunnel. But get a fucking tunnel, Bael.”
 
“I’ll secure the house,” I said. “Read to the boy a bit. He’ll be fine. He sleeps and eats ice-cream, I haven’t ruined him yet.”
 
“Well,” Deborah crossed her arms under her large breasts, “if you’re staying, I want you to still go to the meetings.”
 
The woman had some nerve. “This evening I left them alone for less than a half hour. What do you think happens when they find out I’m out every Tuesday for an hour?”
 
The atmosphere took a strange shift. As if rain clouds suddenly came over Deborah’s office, but when I looked out the window, the sky was clear and the sun shone through the window.
 
“Oh,” Deborah stood suddenly, “look at the time! Back to work, did you want to join me?”
 
“Perhaps another time.” I stood and straightened my suit. “Can I go see her while you’re down there?”
 
“We don’t have her anymore, dear,” Deborah said. “She’s back home.”
 
I narrowed my eyes, confused as to why she hid that from me. Did Deborah intend to give Lily a chance to flee while she kept me busy with pointless conversation? Build a tunnel, take who you want, but not Lily; was the thought process apparently. Truth be told, she might as well have given me two wedding rings and booked a church for the Sunday, because something in me stirred now that the prospect of Lily’s departure was a possibly.
 
“Don’t think too much into this,” she said and walked around her table. “I wanted to see how you were.” She put her hand on my shoulder and nudged her head toward the door. “You’ve got a minute or you’re coming whether you like it or not.”
 
“You know, Deborah, I’m still unsure whether you like me or fear me.”
 
She laughed then, her hand shaking on my shoulder. “I certainly don’t fear you, Bael.”
 
“Why did you give her a chance to run then?”
 
Deborah stopped. “Because I want to see that she stays and I want her to do that before you have a chance to convince her. I’ve read up on her. Good girl.” Deborah shook her head, looking down at something on the floor. “There are boundaries we should not cross, Bael. You go to her right now, trying to explain in your intense way and you’ll scare the life right out of her. You’ll make her feel trapped and she’s been trapped before—she won’t react the way you hope.”
 
“So what do I do then?”
 
“Write her a note.”
 
I raised an eyebrow, ready to take another step.
 
“Oh wait, you big doofus.” Deborah caught me by the sleeve of my shirt as I attempted to leave. “Tell her that you’re sorry and that if she wants to know the truth of what happened, she is welcome anytime, but you will not force it on her.”   
 
“That sounds like a lot of a trouble for something I am not really interested in, Deborah,” I said flatly after listening to how ridiculous she intended me to act. I had not sent a note in over a thousand years. God forbid, I pick up a pen for a woman again. The last time it had been for Mae and she got me killed. If my head’s to roll for anything, it will be Peter.
 
Disregarding Deborah’s terrible advice, I made my way to Lily’s house, trying to figure out a way to not make her feel trapped. Being a demon, I found the whole situation quite challenging, and bought a very large, white bear for her instead.

54bfmx,4,2016-09-24,"22/M, Go back to college full-time or continue to work and take classes? (X-post /r/Advice)",throwawaymikeyt,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/54bfmx/22m_go_back_to_college_fulltime_or_continue_to/,"Not sure if this sub is right for this question, but I figured it's worth a shot.

Using a throwaway as the necessary information is pretty personal. Also, sorry for the wall of text, but this is a huge crossroads that I'm at. 

Backstory about myself: I'm originally from Illinois, but currently live in Florida where I have for the last ~18 months. I previously attended a University in Central Illinois from 2013 to 2015. Not UIUC. Since I've been living in Florida, I took time off classes to work full-time at a theme park. I've been reenrolled in a community college in Orlando since January of 2016. I work full-time and take classes part-time. I'll be graduating with an Associate's Degree in May, where I'll then be transferring to a 4-year school. I'm also lucky enough to say that my current position at work has me set up for a pretty decent career, if I want it. 

This is where I need some help.

I'm considering leaving my job and going back to school Full-Time to finish my Bachelor's Degree ASAP. I'd most likely attend a large public university in Florida, since I'll be able to qualify for in-state tuition. In high-school, I had a 2.7 GPA. At my university in Illinois, I left with a 2.3 GPA. Since I've been in Florida, I'm looking at a 3.5 GPA, and I've been invited to be a member of Phi Theta Kappa. (Not a huge deal really, but it's something I'm proud of)

With my grades being the best they've ever been, and me feeling like I finally have my head on straight, I don't want to waste this opportunity.

At the same time, I also have a pretty decent job that pays well, and if all goes well, I'll be promoted to management within the year. I don't want to waste that either. My current plan is to take classes part-time/online instead of going back to school full-time. 

I've talked to some of my friends about this, and they're about as split as I am. 

Really, there's two schools of thought. 

1) My best friend, who is my age, says that I should go back to school Full-time. She knows that I'll be successful in the world, and doesn't want me to squander my opportunities by playing it safe and staying with my current company. She herself has had regrets about not taking certain internships, and instead choosing to stay with a company she already knew. Going to a better school (not an online college) is going to be a better investment for my future, especially if I ever decide to leave my current company. Plus the universities I'm looking at attending are infinitely better than my school in Illinois. I'm not trying to go to Harvard, but being able to have a large alumni base all over the country is important.

2) My one friend from work, who is about twice as old as I am, says that finding a company who wants to make you management without a Bachelor's Degree is really tough to find, so the fact that my current job already sees the potential in me is huge. Plus I get really good benefits. Insurance. 401k. Educational Reimbursement. Having a long history at a well-established company, plus making them foot the bill for my education, isn't something I should think lightly of. 

Obviously, this is gonna come down to my decision and my decision alone, but I'm really just trying to weigh all the options out and think long and hard about this. Whatever choice I make is going to have a profound impact on my life, and I'm going to need to be ready for it. 

TL;DR: 1) Either I stay with my current job, continue to take classes part-time, finish my Bachelor's degree in a few years, and hope my career pans out

or 2) I quit my current job at the end of next summer, move across the state, go back to college Full-Time at 23, and hope THAT pans out."

I'd just like to post this as a thank you to Jagex, to you scapers, to anyone I've interacted with in my 12 years playing this game. Here's my story:

At first, I played the game just like everyone else. Then, when I was 15 I discovered private servers. Soon, I began looking into how to make my own server; my first introduction to programming. This snowballed quickly into running my own server, where I achieved 100 concurrent players at my peak. Like most servers, people eventually lost interest, so I turned to botting.   

Over 4 years with 4 major botting sites I made a name for myself with decent scripts; but more importantly I found that computer science was my calling in life. 

To finish my journey, I transitioned from botting to major goldfarming when OSRS came out. At this point in time, its time for me to change. For one, Jagex bot detection is the best its ever been; even with a private client I wrote I can only reliably remain unbanned for 4 days - kudos mod weath. Finally, I need to move on. Thanks to the work I put in on this game, I went through college debt free (with a little extra :)), I had 2 amazing internships and now I'm going to start my dream job. I need to grow up.

Some of you may be mad that I ""ruin"" this game with what I have done, yet if we are honest with ourselves, this game is shit. Before you reply with a load of hate, think if you were in my position; what would you do? 

Anyways, I just felt I had to post this before I leave for good, to thank you. Maybe you played my server, or maybe you bought some of my scripts, or maybe you even bought some of my gold. Just know I appreciate you all and the life I live is thanks to you."

5. Ottawa – OSEG – Source is numerous hints dropped by OSEG staff. 2nd hand reports from people who have chatted with me. Also not worried about the Fury’s future after that same chat. Also mentioned in same article as Calgary &amp; Winnipeg.

6. Edmonton – Faths – I don’t know details but it’s been heavily implied by some people in the know... No link 

7. GTA – Mitchell Goldhar – Ok, no real sources, but someone who *does* have some connections kept throwing his name around and acting koi when questioned about it. [Rollins has also dropped that there is a billionaire interested in a GTA team]( https://twitter.com/24thminute/status/778722557725777922). I actually tweeted Rollins to ask if it was Goldhar, as he has been fairly candid answering questions, but all he did was like the tweet. Maybe reading too much, but I’m suspicious.

8. Quebec City – ??? – Someone is apparently interested in putting a team there. No one is dropping names though.

11. London – MLSE – Some have speculated that maybe this is MLSE forming a relationship with a L1O team that is drawing well and in a decently sized metropolitan area as a team to move up to CPL.

13. Victoria - ??? – [Listed on Verde’s tweet. He is a Carlton journalism student who had an internship at OSEG and decided to tweet this after the internship was over.

***
&gt; On January 11, 2016, MONICA HANLEY was interviewed by (FBI) Special Agents ##### and #####.
&gt; 
&gt; HANLEY provided the following information:
&gt; 
&gt; In 2003, following her college graduation, HANLEY interned for then Senator HILLARY CLINTON. HANLEY's internship position was converted to a permanent position in 2004. HANLEY continued working for New York Senator KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND, who was appointed after CLINTON was nominated as Secretary of State.
&gt; 
&gt; In April of 2009, HANLEY received a call from HUMA ABEDIN asking if HANLEY would be interested in working for CLINTON as a ""Confidential Assistant"" at the Department of State (DoS). HANLEY accepted the position at DoS, and continued work for GILLIBRAND until two day before her start at DoS.
&gt; 
&gt; HANLEY accompanied CLINTON on foreign travel on a few occasions during her first year at DoS. HANLEY's first overseas  travel with CLINTON  was to the Philippines. CLINTON specifically invited HANLEY  to join her on that trip because CLINTON knew HANLEY was of Filipino descent and would appreciate the opportunity to travel there.
&gt; 
&gt; When ABEDIN became pregnant in 2011, HANLEY became a primary traveler and accompanied CLINTON on most of her foreign trips.
&gt; 
***
**Email Accounts and Server**


&gt; During her time in the Senate, CLINTON used ####blackberry.net. HANLEY was aware of this email account, but did not use this account to communicate with CLINTON.
&gt; 
&gt; HANLEY was aware CLINTON was using a personal email address on a personal server for DoS business while CLINTON WAS Secretary of State. JUSTIN COOPER created, installed and maintained the server in Chappaqua  before the server was transitioned over to the Platte River Networks (PRN). HANLEY could not recall when the transition to PRN occurred. COOPER was HANLEY'S point of contract for assistance in regards to syncing CLINTON's mobile devices to the server. Anytime CLINTON got a new device, HANLEY would contact COOPER who would troubleshoot her through the process of setting up the new device with the server. COOPER was also HANLEY's point of contact.


&gt; HANLEY used two email accounts while at DoS: …
&gt; 
&gt; HANLEY was issued and carried /used a DoS Blackberry. It was difficult to access DoS email while on travel, as the DoS system required users to sign in using a token/key to sign in remotely. It was particularly difficult to sign into the DoS system in the Secretary's plane because the wifi was not always compatible, so HANLEY would often use her Gmail account while in the air. The same was true for foreign travel. Many DoS employees used personal email accounts because they were more easily accessible. ABEDIN emailed HANLEY   equally from her state.gov and personal accounts.
&gt; 

***


&gt; HANLEY recalled helping CLINTON change her Blackberry device at least three or four times while she was at DoS. HANLEY recalled having to replace CLINTON's Blackberry on one occasion after CLINTON spilled coffee on the device. Another time HANLEY recalled having to replace CLINTON's Blackberry beause it started to fail over time. HANLEY recalled proactively trying to purchase replacement Blackberrys for CLINTON at one point, but CLINTON only liked the older models. HANLEY believed she may have even purchased one of the older Blackberry models for CLINTON on Ebay.

&gt; **Laptop Computer**

&gt; After they learned longtime friend of CLINTON, SIDNEY BLUMENTHAL, was the target of an email hack in Spring of 2013, PRN spoke with COOPER, ABEDIN, and HANLEY, and advised CLINTON change her email address. COOPER subsequently provided HANLEY an extra Apple Macbook from President Clinton's Harlem, NY, Office. HANLEY then transferred all of CLINTON's old emails from the PRN server to the Macbook Air.
&gt; 
&gt; HANLEY maintained possession of the Macbook following the transfer of the emails. The Macbook was stored in HANLEY's apartment. HANLEY moved at least once after she transferred the emails to the Macbook, and brought the Macbook with her to her new apartment.
&gt; 
&gt; When HANLEY was first contacted by FBI agents in November 2015 in regards to scheduling an interview, she reached out to ####### to ask about the whereabouts of the Macbook. ####### told HANLEY she did not recall receiving the Macbook from PRN.
***
**Handling of Classified Material**

&gt; CLINTON did not have a classified DoS account, and received all classified information in paper form. CLINTON's Executive Assistant, JOE McMANUS, was responsible for determining what classified information was to be passed up to CLINTON.
&gt; When CLINTON was on travel, her traveling Executive Assistant or SULLIVAN would determine what classified information needed CLINTON's attention.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The DoS Mobile Communications Team (MCT) traveled with CLINTON on both international and domestic trips. The MCT generally set up an unclassified computer in either ABEDIN or HANLEY's room for the purpose of printing unclassified information for CLINTON. 
&gt; 
&gt; When CLINTON was traveling, ABEDIN would generally carry a secure cell phone. HANLEY carried the secure phone on occasion, and described the phone as looking like an old Nokia non-flip phone with a big antenna and large buttons. The secure cell was carried in a box.
&gt; 
&gt; HANLEY received a lesson from somebody on the DoS technical team in regards to using the secure cell phone, but when HANLEY tried to use the secure cell phone in 2012 on a trip to Haiti, it did not work.

****


&gt; **General Security Matters**

&gt; HANLEY also received verbal security counseling for Diplomatic Security (DS) following a Russia trip on which she accompanied CLINTON. Hanley was handed a diplomatic pouch containing CLINTON's briefing book on the plane arriving in Russia. HANLEY brought the pouch and its contents into the Russian suite she shared with CLINTON. DS found a classified document from the briefing book in the suite during a sweep following CLINTON and HANLEY's departure, and HANLEY was later informed by the DS the briefing book and document should never have been in the suite.

I'm use to being the only woman in alot of things since when I go to gaming events or anime events I'm sometimes the only woman there or playing.

I have my associates in computer science and dropped out of a software engineering program for personal reasons, but still learned a lot.

I've been writing code for almost 20 years but have only considered myself a software developer for about 3 years now.

I came to this job from an internship where I learned a ton of 

Java:

* Maven
* JaxRS, JSF, Spring Boot

Python:

* Pandas, NumPy
* NetworkX
* Django, Flask

Web Dev:

* LESS/SASS/CoffeeScript
* Node, Bower, Grunt, Gulp, Dokku
* Angular 1.0 (dead, yeah, but the ability TO learn and understand is important)
* D3
* JQuery

All-Around Dev:

* Jenkins, Ant
* Unit, Integration, Acceptance Testing
* OOP Design Patterns
* Functional programming
* Agile Scrum
* SCM

I came to my current job with no PHP knowledge and the environment was very start-up-ish. As soon as I saw the Wordpressy shit my co-worker had set up I immediately began applying pressure to overhaul their system and bring everything up to par. Since then my co-worker has become my predecessor and has left, and 95% of the code has been rewritten.

Our core software was a bunch of untestable global function garbage half-shoved into a Wordpress template and since then I have overhauled it to comply with PSR-4 with composer, PDO, introduced unit testing including build, deploy, and test automation, and created our own generic internal PHP library modeled after Pandas and R DataTables. I have many other projects utilizing Laravel 5 including many custom middlewares and service providers.

Additionally, I am trained in multiple 3rd party record-keeping databases, am in charge of maintaining basically all of our IT operations, self-manage and oversee 2 huge revenue projects, participate in executive meetings with clients, actively produce KPI reports, perform AR audits and work closely with the state to close any issues or requirements which arise, manage our database (hundreds of tables across about 60 schemas with hundreds of millions of rows of data). About 800gb of raw client financial data which grows every day. And I'm about to become lead on a service-oriented architecture project which will help our clients become compliant with new state-mandated regulations involving our industry AND we are about to seal a relationship with the state which will give us access to privileged data (which will, of course, become my 6th consecutive ""number 1 top priority"").

Lately I have not been able to get any work done because there is just too fucking much to do and we don't offer the comp that will attract those who are able to do it. It's like I'm doing a BFS from a node with an ever-increasing amount of branches. One minute I'm delivering a projection to a CEO, the next minute I'm resetting the router and teaching someone how to do a LEFT JOIN, meanwhile my task list just grows and grows. It's too much.

The problem is my degree. I have my associates and it affects my self-esteem and self-worth. I feel trapped in my current position and I'm really unhappy with where I feel I'm headed. There's this paranoid part of me that always simultaneously feels like I'm either about to be fired because I can never get anything done anymore or that I'm being taken advantage of because my actual market value is much higher than my perceived market value.

Is my perspective the problem? Are a lot of jobs like this? I've heard of having to wear multiple hats, but I'm at the point where I don't even feel like I have a hat because I'm always simultaneously doing so much for so many different people and it's gotten to the point where I am no longer able to even be productive.

What I do know is that I'm not making enough money to make ends meet anymore. How much do you people think I'm actually worth with the skillset I have?

Thanks for reading all of this."

I'm currently a CS major into my junior year.
I've taken a lot of interest into cyber security, and I would like to find an internship that is focused on cyber security to see if it is a career I would like to pursue.

But in order to do this, I feel like I have to do a side project, because my course work for my computer science major doesn't really have much courses affiliated with cyber security.

So my question is two things: 
1) Do you think cyber security is a good career to pursue? Why or why not? Keep in mind i know cyber security is booming but i heard it can be extremely stressful since one human error can cause a huge problem.

2) Do you have ideas for side projects that would impress employers? I have an idea, but I am not sure if it would be enough."

I know this sounds like a silly question - but I'm really nervous. 

We were together 1.5 years before we moved in together... and we're a month in

The thing is, it's mainly me who starts the arguments. I'm a little more particular about how I live (cleanliness, aesthetic if you will, keeping rooms bright, the fridge organized a certain way, tv volume), and lately even when things are going well otherwise, I find myself extremely grumpy. 

It could be the stress of me having an internship, 2 part-time jobs, and going to uni full-time (I have 0 days off), but I find myself being unreasonable at times and sometimes borderline mean. He has quit drinking, something he did a lot of (nothing serious, though), and it has made him a happier, productive, more creative, attentive, and sweet boyfriend: making my lunch, leaving sweet notes, offering massages. Yet I find myself being rude to him when I never was before.

This could be a much deeper issue; I think I'm a little upset with my grumpiness due to stress and personal issues and so the nicer he is the more I get angry at myself for being so rude... but I need some advice. 

I wouldn't like if he treated me the way I treated him.. and wouldn't want him resenting me like I resent him for stupid little things (like unplugging a lamp while I'm not home to charge his phone).

I just want to know that this is normal, and if we communicate like we do without my bitterness (I am setting up a therapy appointment next week), and learn to let the small things go, that this will get better.

We both met in college 4 years ago. Same friend group during those times. She developed a crush for me, but I was an idiot and ignored it. I never had any feelings towards a girl anytime through college. 


&amp;nbsp;



We remain friendly during these years, fast forward to about 8 months ago. We start to talk very regularly. She has since graduated. I am finishing my last semester and graduating. We both live at home. We continued to ramp up communication and hung out occasionally. Since this point it has been about 5-6 months of consistent everyday texts and snapchats. Just shooting the shit, linking videos, deeps talks to 2am. An unreal amount of snapchats. I began to consider her one of my best friends and she agreed. She has also told me the crush she developed when we met was something lasted a VERY long time.


&amp;nbsp;


&amp;nbsp;




 I was busy this past summer working an internship, and living at home. This was my first time for years away from all my college friend and have been very lonely. About half-way through summer we hooked up (no sex), met her parents. At this point I began to developed feelings for her. The everyday communication continued. 


&amp;nbsp;


&amp;nbsp;


&amp;nbsp;


Im not a person to develop sudden crushes and I really felt this was a fantastic match:


-friends all agreed we were very compatible.   


-She was going to start a job soon


-I was graduating and had a great high paying job lined up


-She has had feelings for me in the past.


-Both single and both had very little to no dating past. 


-We knew so much about each other, identical senses of humor, can talk about nothing for hours.


-I have been losing weight, entering best shape of my life. (not overweight).


-Both come from similar and great families. 




&amp;nbsp;


&amp;nbsp;





So back to the story. This is when shit gets hairy. About 8 weeks ago I ask her on a date, she says shes not interested right now, and has said she feels very off/on romantically for me. I say this is fine, and continue everyday texting/snapchatting.




&amp;nbsp;


&amp;nbsp;


&amp;nbsp;






 I fucked up here, I got the idea in my mind that she would still date me if I tried again in some time. My crush continued to develop. I couldnt get the classic ""why doesnt she want to go on a date"" thoughts out of my head. She starts her new job, which is a huge time sink for her. 3 weeks ago I asked her if she wants to go to local event with some of our old friends, she says she doesnt want to drive that long (its same as her commute distance). Because of the crush I get frustrated and say ""if you dont want to come you can just say so, dont have to make excuses"". She gets angry at this, rightfully so. 






&amp;nbsp;


&amp;nbsp;




ENTER SHIT PERIOD: She stops snapchatting and texting me completely. She will respond if I say anything, but shell stop after a few responses and its just not the same fun conversation. 


-I dont talk to her for a few days. 


-After being very distraught and coming to the realization I need to stop this shit. I asked her for another date, expressed I dont care about labels, just want to have fun together. She says ""its not me, she doesnt want any relationship right now, no time with work"". I tell her that theres a chance I might need to cut contact for a bit to move past my feelings. She says she didnt realize I had such strong feelings. She was supportive and said she understood. 


-Next 5 days suck ass, her ignoring continues as expected.  During this time I spend a massive amount of time self reflecting and trying to get over these feelings. I read online responses/movies/read some books (models was very helpful). 


-I tell her I am feeling much better and aware of my feelings and the situation. I tell her I dont need to cut contact to shake the feelings. She says she understands and says its good to hear. 


-5 days pass. No texts or snapchats. My self reflection continues. I realize I was being selfish with my desires and ignored some clear warning signs. I realize I was settling for what was available and latched to it from my newfound loneliness. I feel much better, the constant thoughts are gone. 


-I talk to her again, explain the situation in detail. I say I just want our communication to go back to what it used to be. I EMPHASIZE she doesnt have to be careful with what she says in fear of sending the wrong message. She understands and says it may be hard for her to flip the switch back on of the old communication. During this she also tells me ""dont settle for me, youll meet someone better""


-No texts or snapchats continue. If I text her I get a few generic responses and then responses will stop.




&amp;nbsp;


&amp;nbsp;



so....
I truly believe I have changed/opened my mind towards the crush. I obviously would still date her, but I understand if she doesnt want to I am okay with that. I am excited to meet someone in the future and am focusing on self improvement right now.




The problem is, I feel like she doesnt give a shit about me anymore, we were very close friends with daily communication for months before any of this started. Before the last 3 weeks, we texted ALL the time, and probably snapchated each other 10-30 times a day just shooting the shit. Now I am stressing about fucking up one of my closest friendships. It almost drives me as crazy as when I couldn't figure out why she wouldn't date me. It fucking drives me nuts that she hasn't snapped me back for 3+ weeks. It fucking drives me nuts that the primary person I talk to and knows everything about me continues blatantly ignoring me. It honestly hurts.





&amp;nbsp;


&amp;nbsp;




So if you have made it this far, thanks, and I want to get some outside perspective on this. I legitimately just want to have the old friendship back. Do you think the ignoring will continue? Should I just cut contact for a week or two so she believes me? Or do you think she wants nothing to do with me and I truly fucked this up?
Open to any perspective or advice. 


  ---   
  **tl;dr**: longtime friend, she used to have a crush. post college we talk everyday for months. I develop crush. She denies. I come to terms with this, desire old friendship. She wont communicate first and continues to partially ignore me.  "

Hello, guys. So, I've been a huge Gundam fan since Gundam Wing aired here in Brazil around 1995-1997, something like this. The anime was the best thing I've watched since the original Dragon Ball. Everything about that anime was so amazing, even the whole politics thing (which, now that I'm older, I started to give this part more attention). But it took me a while to get in touch with Gundam games. They were scarce at the time (at least here in my country), most were not at all accessible, and whatnot. Throughout the time I played a few Gundam games, and believe me, they were all worth it (and they're still dear in my heart). 

Here's what I remember playing:

* Gundam: Battle Assault - My reaction was some in these lines: ""oh my god, where all these nice Gundam come from?"". Turns out I didn't knew that there were MULTIPLE series, and this anime started in the late 70s.

* Gundam: Battle Assault 2 - Ball is amazing, shut up.

* Mobile Suit Gundam: Federation vs. Zeon - I believe that, at this time, I did knew about older series, and, boy, RX-78 is simply the best design, in my opinion. Also, space battles, underwater battles, Big Zam stills horrible (and horribly hard).

But then, it was getting harder and harder to find games. One of the reasons was that I moved to the Xbox 360 instead of going to the logical PS1&gt;PS2&gt;PS3 path. Turns out that I could never find those incredibly rare ""Dynasty Warriors Gundam"" games for the Xbox, and Mugen did its thing as far as it could.

When I finally got a PS3 (very late in its cycle, like late 2013), I discovered that there were MANY Gundam games ""available"". I almost bought a cheap copy of Gundam Crossfire, but I discovered that this game was bad moments before. Besides Musou games (that I only started to like a couple years ago), there was this CADILLAC of games called *Mobile Suit Gundam: Extreme Vs*, but it was only available in Japan. Importing from PlayAsia is rough, we have to pay so much taxes here in Brazil that most imports are not even worth it (talking about $100 games, at the end of the math).

Time flew by, an even better version of Extreme Vs got released for the PS3, and I was here, drooling over videos, watching my favorite Youtube channel (Two Best Friends Play) play a multiplayer match against other cool guys from other channels (Cranky Construct and Boku no Eruption, IIRC)...

EDIT: The game is a fast paced Z-targeting Mecha based arena fighting game. It is pretty much Fed vs Zeon but more ""arcady"", it contains gundams from various series and lots to unlock and discover. I'm an eternal fan of these arena brawlers like Power Stone, Anarchy Reigns and many others. It combines elements from different genres that I love very, very much.

I had some money and discovered a nice Model Kit seller in other state. He had Model Kits available and I started buying and building some. Here's a photo of my [MG Qubeley](http://imgur.com/a05cgSV), not my favorite building process, but the coolest looking one (and the only model that's not broken because I had to move to another house pretty much every year since 2013).

A few months ago, the Extreme Vs series got a Vita version released at the PSN store, in the US region! This way I don't need to get through Japanese menus, and the game is reasonably cheap.

___

Why can't I get it myself?

Well... I was waiting for a deal, really. Even though I'd pay the full 40 for it (and I believe it is worth WAY more than its price), [its price never went down, not a single time](https://psprices.com/region-us/game/261023/mobile-suit-gundam-extreme-vs-force-bundle).

I checked the physical version and it's available for something around $18, but I can't get this deal here in Brazil. And I also couldn't find this game available in cartridge around here.

If you guys search for my other requests, you guys will notice some common things like ""me wanting to buy a motorcycle"" or ""me wanting to get married"", and some things never change. The difference now is that I **wish** I could properly pay for my studies, I'm almost broke and I'm still trying to get a better job to finally get married. It's not easy, even though I'm acquiring a second degree. My internship doesn't pay me well enough to keep my videogames ~~addiction~~ hobby going on. Other thing is that I made a promise to her, we are both going to save money. Our first goal is a board game called ""Abyss"", as our mutual Christmas gift (because we want something to play with our friends when they're visiting us at our house)... the second goal is said house! If we can save money to buy *anything*, we can save to buy a house (an apartment, actually). To do this I'm going to continue looking for better jobs, while also avoiding eating snacks at college, and we're both going to avoid going out too much. Dates like ""seeing the sunset at the lake"" are OK. Things like expensive dinners at Outback are out of question.

It is worth mentioning that I have a PSTV (a Vita TV, actually), and I'm using this while my girlfriend plays with my Vita. She loves playing games with me, and having a game to play at the same time (don't know if we can do some ad-hoc multiplayer since we're using the same account) will be amazing! We love to watch movies/series or playing games while on skype, and this request can also help we both to have fun together while saving our money for our future.

I did well in high school but took a year break after high school to take a software development internship that eventually turned into a job, then started school.

I didn't do very well my freshman year and feel like I've half-assed many of my classes, because I know I have the safety net of this job. If I were to drop out right now I would be making $70k a year.

Everybody I ask gives different advice. Aside from the degree, it's also hard to get this social life outside of college. A big reason why I'm here right now.

How were your college experiences for those that went? And for those that didn't, are you satisfied?"

54dgbi,1,2016-09-24,Filling in for a friend.,azdv,DirtyFlashFiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/DirtyFlashFiction/comments/54dgbi/filling_in_for_a_friend/,"Billie was an intern for a popular local magazine and because they had to share the space. A good friend of the magazine editor ran the business next door. The business was depending on the day a soft core magazine or a porn study. 

Billie was helping one of the models when she noticed the two bosses talking. Billie boss waved her over when she was done helping the model. The studio next door had an actress that wasn't feeling well and needed someone to fill in. The director assured Billie she would be compensated and at any time during filming if she wanted to back out she could.  Billie took a breath and agreed. 

“Excellent! Come on over, we have everything already set up.”

Billie followed him into the studio and looked around at the small crew assembled to film this video. She noticed the bedroom sets bed had a variety of underwear spread out on it.

The director explained the video to a blush covered Billie. A female producer met her in the changing room to see how her nerves were. Billie was nervous but willing to help. The producer smiled and assured her she'd do great.

“Ok sweetie now I know your nervous already but would you mind stripping down to your underwear so I can see if you need a change. “

Billie took a deep breath before stripping down to her matching dark blue underwear. 

“Those are so cute! It's perfect!” 

Billie smiled blushing more. Her and the producer continued to talk as she prepped Billie for the scene. She left and told Billie to relax for a couple minutes to let her nerves calm and to come out when she was ready. She assured Billie she'd do great one more time before leaving. Billie sat on the couch. She sighed and stood up and went over to a full length mirror on the other side of the room. 

She gave herself a quick pep talk before leaving the room. Her face was still red with blush and it only got worse when the director complimented her body. She thanked him and he politely ushered her to the set.

The first few frames were just small teases, showing off the underwear and her body, maybe a little caressing thrown in.

After an encouraging smile and nod off set, Billie unhooked and removed her bra and slide her underwear off. She turned to the bed and picked up a pair of underwear, a lacy black and white combo and went over to the mirror, holding it against her to try it on. This continued with two more pairs before she layed on the bed. The director called for a quick to cut to check on Billie.

“How are you feeling?”

“Fine, surprisingly.”

Billie replied with a small laugh. 

“Ok, your still comfortable and all, still ready for the next scene?”

“I think so.” 

Billie smiled and so did the director. He hi fives her before returning to his chair and calling for filming to resume. 

Billie laid on the bed and held a red bra against her. She sighed as she began to rub the inside of her thigh. The camera zoomed in as she rubbed herself slowly and teasingly through the black panties. A door opened and in walked her costar. Her characters boyfriend. He entered the bedroom chuckling a little. Billie smiled.

“I did a little shopping while you were at work. How does this combo look?”

He layed on the bed. 

“Any of these would look amazing on you.”

They kissed as he tried to gently pull the bra away but she held on and shook her playfully. He smirked and laid on the bed. She grabbed a pair and held them out of his sight before hopping over him and going to the closet. She changed underwear as he waited and observed the other pairs on the bed. 

She came out in a skimpy pink set. The bra barely covering her perky tits, the panties covering slightly more. 

“How do I look?”

She asked (her blush gone)as she went over to the bed and kneeled on it. He sat up. 

“You look so sexy baby.”

“How sexy?”

“So sexy I'm willing to go over my break time.”

She giggled and rested her forehead on his before they began to kiss. His hand quickly cupped her breast, squeezing it softly while she unbuttoned his shirt. The scene cuts to him removing her bra and licking and sucking on her hard nipples. She clears the other sets off the bed as he pushes his shirt off. She lays on the bed with her legs open. He leans in and kisses her thigh softly and slowly. He starts to rub and kiss her pussy through the underwear. She moans softly.

He slowly slid her panties off, the camera zooming in. He leaned back down and kissed her pussy, sucking on the lips softly. 

“Mmm honey…”

She moaned softly. He began to lick her pussy slowly as he rubbed her clit. Her moaned got louder and louder with each stroke. He held her lips open and slid his tongue in and out of her pussy. A soft fuck followed as she arched in pleasure. He continue to lick for a little while longer, her moans getting louder and longer. He kneeled on the bed, pulling his pants and boxers off, his hard cock springing out. Billie sat up and stroked it a little and started to suck it. 

She sucked faster and longer and deeper before laying down again. He rolled her on her side and laid next to her. He out his arm around her waist and he slid his cock in her tight, wet pussy. The two made out as he slowly began to fuck her. 

The scene cuts to him kissing her neck, as she leans her head back in pleasure as he still fucks her slowly.

He fucked her faster and faster, her moans getting louder. He switched positions kneeling on the bed, her still on her side. He began to fuck her faster and harder.

“Fuckkkk.” She moaned as he continued to go faster and harder.

After a few more thrusts she came hard. He slowed down. Billie decided to improvise (she was told she could if she wanted to.). 

“Baby…”

“Yeah?”

“Lay me on on my back and fuck me like the “old days”. “

They shared a smirk as he rolled her onto her back an began to fuck, as hard and as fast as he could. 

“Oh fuck, pound me baby, fuck me like a cheap whore.” She moaned. 

He kept going her moaning was as loud as she could ( The director quietly thanked his producer and business partner for suggesting a sound proof studio.). She came again, harder and louder  than before, squirming a little in pleasure. He pulled and repositioned himself. He stormed himself a little more. Billie watched with a smirk and an open mouth. He came on her face, some landing in her mouth and hair. 

The director called for a wrap. Billie smiled as her costar layed in the bed next to her and whispered, panting. 

“That was excellent. “

Billies blush returned as she thanked him quietly and nudged his side with her elbow, complimenting him.

I have completed internships at Amazon and Microsoft (but I don't have a return offer for Microsoft because it wasn't a good fit and my Amazon offer expired). I plan to go into the tech industry (Seattle or Bay area) but I'm worried that I won't get a job.
The problem that I'm facing right now is split between interest and job opportunities. I want to write a thesis and at the same time, I want to be able to land a job for when I graduate in June 2017.

My problem for finding jobs right now is that I'm not familiar enough with my preferred language (C++ / Java) and I feel like this is really affecting my chances of getting hired. On top of this, my final year consists of graduate math courses so I don't have much time to practice, as these courses are not easy for me.

Would anyone still write the thesis in my position? Or should I just focus on job hunting? I only have one chance for my thesis and also one chance to start off my career with a good job (I don't want to be jobless for a year as I fear it may make it harder for me to apply to these big tech companies).

Note: I'm currently in the process of some interviews already.

**TL;DR**: I'm currently not up to pace with coding skills and I don't have much time. Should I still continue with an Honors Thesis (which is actually not required for the Honors program) or should I focus on job hunting?

My resume pretty much looks like this:

* Amazon, Microsoft
* High Major GPA + Honors Math and CS
* Research experience with professors (who can vouch for me)
* Not so impressive projects (at least this shows that I code on the side?)

What I probably am:

* Marginal coding skills (because I'm rather slow due to unfamiliarity at the moment)
* Good problem solving ability (not great, but I think it's passable)

Thanks for those who took the time to read and answer. I would really appreciate any advice."

It was hard, but I was more naive then. I figured I would graduate and search for jobs his area, move there.

A few years in I started my internship search. After so much looking and so much rejection, I became depressed. I was never going to find a job in my field. My plan slowly changed. I'd graduate, move to be with him, work minimum wage retail.. we would make do.

Senior year, my life is starting to look up. I got an internship with a great company. There could be a possibility in it being a full time opportunity one day. And I'm more confident, trying to make connections with other companies for when I do graduate. But suddenly my life is falling apart as I try to figure out how we will be together. What if there are job opportunities here that i should pursue? I feel I owe it to myself to pursue these opportunities..  It will be harder finding something in a new city with no connections. The dream has always been for me to move and be with him, but it seems more impossible than ever now. I don't know where this relationship is going now.

Dunno if any advice could help, maybe just others relating. I needed to tell someone. I need my therapist. I need to talk to him about everything."
54dwr1,1,2016-09-25,What should I do?,StrictlyPlutonium,actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/54dwr1/what_should_i_do/,"Hey guys, ill give some background info first. I graduated this past May with a B.S. in Applied Mathematics with a concentration in Economics from UC Merced on a full-ride. Graduated a year early at the age of 20. GPA was not the greatest, overall GPA was 3.2, math GPA was 2.8, while my Econ GPA was 4.0.

Decided on becoming an actuary during the past couple months, so I missed out on the internship opportunities early on, and am studying for exam p right now. No job but looking for some technical type jobs right now and would be willing to do a normal retail type job if it'll benefit me. Should I just focus on studying for the exams and pass a couple as soon as possible or should I go out and get any job while also studying even if it'll take longer to pass them?

Also a major reason why I am not working/not in a rush to work is cause I am supposed to get surgery but the hospital has yet to set a date (Sometime this year though) and im supposed to be out for 2-4 weeks (Don't know if a job would give me that much time off, so I decided to not work until after I get it and in the mean time study). Will this gap in my resume look bad even if its for a medical reason?

What would you guys suggest I do about my situation?"
54dxcs,10,2016-09-25,When do I turn in my resignation letter/quit during my (retail) shift?,notsomagical,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/54dxcs/when_do_i_turn_in_my_resignation_letterquit/,"Hello all,

I have previously asked for advice on leaving my job at the Disney Store [here, on this subreddit,](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4vfs4r/i_hate_my_retail_job_so_much_its_making_me/) as well as [in the AskRetail subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskRetail/comments/4vg0m4/i_hate_my_job_so_much_its_making_me_miserable_how/) (both are the same post basically, just different replies and such). Quick TL;DR for those who didn't read it, I worked for Disney before and loved it, but I hate working at TDS and wasn't sure the best way to quit without causing issues if I ever wanted to work for the Disney Company (in any field) again.

Well the time has finally come for me to quit, but I'm a little confused, as I've never had to quit a job before. I was hoping to tell the Store Manager and give her the letter, but I'm not working with her at all the next week, and I don't want to wait and work there an extra week just to give it to her. I'm not really sure how the hierarchy works at the Disney Store. I know we have the Store Manager, and then we have two other full time leads and one part time lead. But they all have pretty much the same responsibilities during the day and whenever we work with them, so I don't know if they would be considered Assistant Managers or not.

Anyway, so my next shift I'm working with (what I think) is like the ""2nd in command"" at the store, she's actually the main reason I'm quitting, (not saying that in my reason of course lol), and I'm not sure how to approach her about quitting.

First, is it okay to give her the letter and tell her I'm quitting instead of the Store Manager? I would prefer to give it to the SM but since I haven't worked with her (besides when she's in the office on conference calls all day or for like 30 mins) in weeks, I don't feel like I have any other choice.

Second, how and when do I tell her/give her the letter? I'm closing (which sucks because she gives me a hard time when I close with her) and only working like 4 hours, so should I tell her at the beginning, at the end, or sometime in the middle? It's only going to be the two of us working for my entire shift (unless they change things) so I can't pull her to the back and ask to talk in private. Should I just say something like ""Hey _____, can I talk to you before we leave tonight?"" or should I just have the letter and bring it up at the same time?

Also how do I even tell her I'm quitting? After I tell her I need to talk or something. Just a little general advice on how I should tell her that I'm quitting, should I tell her my reason (internship in my field) or just tell her I'm leaving and that's that?

It would be so much easier if I wasn't closing, as I could just do it at the end of my shift and not worry about how she's going to react, but I've been putting this off for months and it's time to pull the trigger.

TL;DR: I want to quit during my next shift, when I'm closing with one of the leaders (who is not the Store Manager). How should I bring up that I'm quitting (like how do I tell her I need to talk to her and how do I tell her I'm quitting) and when should I tell her/give her my resignation letter?

Thank you so much!

EDIT: To clarify, when I say give my letter of resignation I mean two weeks notice, I wrote this when I was exhausted so I wasn't clear enough."

Need help.",HopelessThrowaway789,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/54e09q/me_20m_with_my_exgf_21f_of_175years_she_cheated/,"Hey r/relationships

So as the title says, my GF cheated on me, and then broke up with me, and is now playing games with my already painful emotions.
To give you the story, we both work at a company abroad with numerous other people from our home country, all our age. Last week was her birthday, and after we had a rocky patch this month was the most amazing week. Holding hands all the time, sneaking kisses everywhere, romantic dinner, falling asleep cuddling. Fast forward to Friday, the day of her birthday ""party"" we had arranged at our place, with a lot of alcohol, food, and all of the other interns invited. We left our house pretty wasted, but o didn't drink an awful lot so I was halfway sober anyway. GF drank far too much Tequila, so did a few of the others. So we go to the club, we are all dancing in a group - I notice my GF pull one of the other interns (Dick) to the side and talk in his ear - I then noticed that he caressed her cheek and started kissing her, which she reciprocated. Her friend noticed this and took her outside, I asked the guy what happened, he said nothing. She came back in after a while, went to the bar, and stood next to him. I saw her just in time to see his had on her back and her grabbing his cheek and pulling him in to make out again.
Not going to lie, I was mortified. I went over, pulled him away and went ""what the fuck are you doing?"" And he just gave me this 'dumb' blank expression and said ""well I don't know mate"". We went outside and I asked him why, and he said, I fucking quote, ""Well we kissed, as you can see - she clearly prefers me, and it's fair play, so it looks like I've won"" and then smirks. Fucking smirks.

Her friend rushes up and pulls us apart, Dick goes inside and Friend brings GF up. She sees me and starts crying, and I can barely look at her. She tells her Friend that she wont leave unless I agree to a 3-person talk, so Friend brings Dick back up. Dick reiterated his ""I've won"" speech, adding ""well I'm not innocent, but I'm definitely not sorry, I don't think I've done anything wrong here"". GF then says she likes Dick and Dick likes her, and she is sorry they kissed but she doesn't love me anymore....she then got upset, and went to hug me. 

Nah, kidding, she got upset and hugged HIM.

Yep. I broke down there and then, at which point Friend took me aside. She went to speak to GF, then came back alone and said ""we should go home, she's staying here"". She stays, gos back to Dicks house, then comes home at 6pm the following day. She told Friend they didn't do anything, she was just terrified of coming home and confronting what she did. Never mind that I was physically sick with worry the entire day. She comes home, sits down, says she's so sorry she kissed him, she didn't intend to until he kissed her, which flipped a switch. She says she needs to go and think, but we are broken up. Says she will be back soon. Apparently she hasn't loved me for a month and her crush on Dick became full on liking.
And that, Reddit, was the last I saw her. She then said to her Friend she would be back by 12am, then 1am, and I woke up this morning to an otherwise empty house.

I don't feel like carrying on - my friends are amazing, but I alternate between encouraged, devastated, physically ill, hatred, and finding the busy road outside quite attractive. They both work with me - one of our mentors already knows, as he asked me how the night went and I fucking collapsed and started balling, so he teased it out of me.
Reddit, what the hell do I do? She's ripping me apart piece by piece with all the lies and ignoring me and using Dick as comfort. I'm a broken man.

  ---   
  **tl;dr**: GF cheated, broke up with me, said she had stopped loving me whilst all the while saying she does and acting as normal for her fancy birthday meal, now lies about when she's coming home to talk more, takes comfort in the other guy. I'm a physical and emotional trainwreck."
54e4eo,1,2016-09-25,"[WP] You and your team of scientists have invented a handheld device that allows people to time travel. On another note, it's Bring Your Child to Work Day, and you can't seem to find out where your kid ran off to.",hideouts,hideouts,https://www.reddit.com/r/hideouts/comments/54e4eo/wp_you_and_your_team_of_scientists_have_invented/,"The lab was filled with the chatter of over-caffeinated interns and the grumbles of under-caffeinated senior devs. Beakers clinked in earsplitting unison as janitors dropped tubfuls of them onto tabletops. Here and there, sparks fizzled and popped; on occasion, they snapped, causing surprised researchers to walk backwards into their chairs. They clanged on the metal floor, momentarily deafening unfortunate bystanders and passersby.

It was quiet. Too quiet.

Sophie looked up from her research manual. Harry wasn't tugging at her coat. He wasn't tying her shoelaces together. He wasn't jumping up and down next to her, asking if he could use the welding torch or drink the time potion or play BirdVille on her phone. She patted both her pockets and felt nothing. The realization punctured her in the gut, sending cold, prickling dread seeping through her entire body.

Sophie slid her goggles to rest on her forehead. Foregoing eye protection in the lab was against regulations, but so was losing your kid at work. She strode around the room's perimeter, her eyes leaping back and forth between crannies and shadows in search of Harry. Her ears perked up, awaiting a crash or a smash or any other discordant noise. But no sign of Harry presented itself: the lab continued to run in its perpetual state of peaceful business, and anxiety continued to brew within Sophie's stomach. 

After three fruitless circles, she took to asking her coworkers, starting with the cleaning staff and the interns lest her superiors reprimand her or her peers judge her. ""Have you seen Harry?"" she asked. Each person shrugged or shook their head until she got to Gerald. 

""Yeah, I saw him."" The old janitor smacked his gum and pointed to the doorway. ""Went out there. Had a phone or something in his hand."" Gerald shook his head and grinned. ""Bet he's found a nook to hide out in. Kids always trying to squeeze into the tightest spaces. I reckon they just wanna get back in the womb...""

Sophie forced a smile and patted his shoulder before bustling towards the doorway, her ponytail swinging excitedly. Momentum carried her down the hallway, past the offices and the other lab, all the way to the supply closet. Sophie unlocked it and fished in the dark, inside the crate two over from the right wall, for a TimePhone. Upon retrieving one, she input the time for one hour in the past. She wasn't going to alter the past. All she would do was observe. Keep track of Harry this time. Redeem herself as a mother. Every good parent deserved at least one do-over, she thought.

One hour earlier, Sophie cracked the broom closet door open and peered down the hallway, waiting for Harry to emerge. Within ten minutes, she saw him exit the lab and toddle down the hall, his eyes glued to her red TimePhone. He glanced up every few seconds to check the doors lining each side of the hallway before finally coming across an unlocked supply closet. Harry slid inside and clicked the door shut.

With her newfound knowledge, Sophie reversed to the present and burst out of her own closet. With any luck, Harry hadn't figured out how to configure the TimePhone yet. Her heart thumped with anticipation as she rushed down the hall, her mind split between formulating a lecture and an emergency time rescue plan. Her hand closed around the knob of the supply closet, and she wrenched it open.

Harry shoved the TimePhone between his knees and attempted his best expression of innocence. He looked anything but, though, perched on a mop cart with a guilty smile wrapping around his face. Sophie allowed herself an internal sigh of relief, but at the same time hardened her face, attempting to compensate for her lapse in authority. ""You're in big trouble, young man."" She yanked the phone from between his legs. ""Time travel is dangerous. Under no circumstances are you allowed to touch this phone."" Sophie waggled it to emphasize her point, daring Harry to challenge her.

Protest marked Harry's face for a fleeting moment, but he seemed to think better of it. He shut his mouth and hung his head, though Sophie doubted he was truly contrite. She motioned him towards the elevator, swiping her thumb across the bottom of her phone as they walked. She expected to see the Time Travel app, but to her surprise, the display was instead the title screen of BirdVille. Sophie frowned: something seemed off about it. As the elevator descended, she stared at the birds flying perpetually in the background.

Normally, an ad would have popped up after a few seconds.

Out of the corner of her eye, she saw Harry peeking at the phone, turning away when he noticed her glance. Sophie navigated to her phone's purchase history and checked the most recent figure. It was in the triple digits.

She jabbed the icon of the Time Travel app."

Yay, Saturday.",Naysnay,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/54e5xf/mother_calls_i_cry_yay_saturday/,"**TL;DR** Parents called and proceeded to engage in incoherent ramblings about how terrible I am. It reduced me to a puddle of tears. Thinking about going LC and unsure of where to begin. 

Today my parents called me. It was a disaster. I've been grey-rocking them for a while (though it's difficult!) because I don't consider them to be safe people to open up to. Well, they've wisened up to the technique and today was the confrontation. 

&gt;Father calls at 12:07. I'm in the bathroom so I call back at 12:20. 

We exchange pleasantries. ""How are you?"" ""Oh, I'm fine, nothing major going on. We're having a debate party on Monday and hanging out with friends today so blah blah."" 

&gt;Background: I'm currently unemployed, looking for a job. My husband and I moved right after we got married to a new state where neither of us have any connections. He started school immediately and I've been taking care of home stuff. We've been here for 1 month. 

Mother: ""We need to have a conversation."" *""conversation"" is her word for ""criticize"" when it comes to me*

Naysnay: ""Uh, ok. About what.""

Mother: ""You're not doing enough to find a job. You don't ask for help and you're not doing what we tell you to do. You need to contact more people and do x, y, and z. Do you even want to get into medical school? What are you doing about that? WE NEVER HEAR ABOUT ANYTHING YOU ARE DOING UNLESS WE ASK (lol, whut). Do you even want to go to medical school. You know, it's way harder than you think it is. All you do is sit around all day. Even transitioning from my PhD to my masters took a solid 6 months of work.""
 
&gt;Yeah, Mom was close to her PhD and instead chose to submit for a masters degree. Some days that's my fault (born while she was working on it -- I was planned so I have no idea why that's on me), some days it's her ingenuity and forethought. I guess today was an ""ingenuity"" day.

Naysnay: ""Ok. I am talking to different people though like {their friends kid/ my friend who is in med school} and {another friend who is going through the process}.""

Mother: ""Your friends don't know everything. *THESE ARE THE SAME FRIENDS THEY ARE DEMANDING I TALK TO*. You worked with that doctor for a long time and it doesn't seem like anything came of it.""

&gt; I worked with a Psychiatrist for a couple of years as an intern. I got to help with patient exams and hear people's stories. I learned a lot about psychiatry and patients. I also got published and presented at a major conference. I got the internship myself and did all of the work myself. I dedicated many weekends to working on my study because 1) it was awesome and 2) it was an escape from them. She looooves to belittle all of the work I did with the doctor to me but she also posted my publication on facebook because, well, narc. 
 
Mother: ""You never take our calls you're always busy."" *Now, do you think that might have something to do with you calling at noon on a Saturday? I might be busy, you know.* 

&gt;I checked my call logs. I have alternated between them calling me or me calling them every 3-5 days this month. But I never call/talk to them. Uh..

Mother: ""You never share anything with us. I don't know WHY you never share anything with us or tell us what you're doing.""

Naysnay: ""I don't like to share things if they're not happening yet."" 

Mother: ""YOU NEED TO BE TELLING US EVERYTHING. We are your parents. I thought we had a close relationship *If we had a close relationship, why have you been yelling at me for this same exact thing since I was 11?!* and other people might not tell their parents everything but I thought we were closer than that. You should WANT to share things with us. I don't know why you don't. We're just your PARENTS who love and support you with EVERYTHING. *anyone else laughing at this point?* WHY don't you want to tell us everything. Why can't you tell us ""oh I'm applying for a job here, here's what I've done...etc.""? *What? I don't even tell my husband everywhere I'm applying for jobs because...why bother until I have an interview* You are.../voice breaks/

She got emotional and stormed off, giving the phone to my dad. My dad says two or three inconsequential sentences to me and I shove the phone to my husband. They chat about lunch or something and the call ends. I start crying (really hysterical sobbing almost) because I'm a mess and she really upset me.  

I went to take a shower and get ready for the day. They called me back. My husband texted them that I was in the shower. They asked if I was okay. He texted no, which was the absolute truth. They insisted I call them back after lunch/ ""when I have time"" (guilt trip). I ignored them and we went out to lunch. I called them around 3 because I didn't have a good reason for NOT calling them/ I'm not ready to tell them that they're bad for me and I don't want to hear from them yet. It's true, I'm just not ready to say it. I spoke to my mother for ~5 minutes. She asked if I was ok. I said, ""I am now."". Then we talked about the weather/other random things. 

Oh! I told her that we're having a debate party on Monday, which I'm really excited for because it's our first party as a married couple which is a big deal to me. She said, ""Oh, we're not in to the election this year."" She and dad have watched every debate and all of the commentary so far. We know because we often watched it with them!! UGH, Narcs! To be fair, I think they're not interested in this election because they've been shamed out of voting for Donald ""The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese"" Trump. 

I had literally the most useless conversation and then that was it. So now I don't know what to do. I'm thinking about going LC with them but I also want to write them something so they know what they did. But I think it would just fuel their victim complex. Frustrating. "

54fza3,2,2016-09-25,21 [M4F] - Starting Over [Science],burnbabyburner69,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/54fza3/21_m4f_starting_over_science/,"On September 22nd, 2036, a deep space probe was launched from Cape Canaveral. Its creators had designed it to detect supernovas in far away galaxies, but they had no idea that it's destiny laid in another direction. In order to escape the solar system, it had to use the Sun as a gravity assist. Readings taken from the probe as it circled the Sun were almost ignored completely, as many thought that the probe's sensors wouldn't read any significant information. Luckily though, a team of interns had no better work to do at the time and combed over the data as a way to keep their skills honed. One of them found an abnormal measurement and reported it to her superiors, but she got no word back about it. She figured that it must have been nothing. She was wrong. As soon as her superior looked over her discovery, he knew something was amiss. He went straight to the top and a small, top-secret task force was commissioned to investigate the measurement. A couple decades passed by before they reached their conclusion. The chemical makeup of the Sun was not nearly as stable as had been accepted for so long. The Earth didn't have billions of years left before the Sun blew up, it had hundreds.

President Alvarez had just been sworn in weeks before he was informed of the matter. While still keeping the veil of a normal presidency around him, he spent the entirety of his 8 year term researching the options that Earth had left. It was settled within a year that Earth was doomed. The Sun had reached the point of no return centuries ago and moving the Earth out of the blast radius was [out of the question]().

Obviously, there had to be some kind of evacuation, but technology was extremely limited. Even when the other governments of the world were contacted, their pooled efforts could only create one spaceship that had could carry the resources necessary for sustaining life far enough away from the Sun. It wasn't all doom and gloom though. The research on designing the base accelerated quickly, and the spaceship itself was designed in less than a decade. The same probe that discovered the Sun's fatal flaw was retasked to scout out planets, and a small list of acceptable candidates was assembled quickly. Models suggested that the primary planet candidate could have its atmosphere be made breathable in less than a century and that the soil could be made farmable, though that would take a significantly longer amount of time.

All that was easy. The hard part came when it was time to select the people to fill the ark, as most of the people who knew of it called it. Some thought they should all be engineers, people who could manage the base well and troubleshoot mechanical problems the easiest. Others wanted a more balanced team that could manage all sorts of things, like the plants or the crew's health. A few politicians even suggested that the crew should be made of philosophers and artists to preserve Earth culture.

The decision was largely made for them though as two new problems surfaced. First, the cryogenics systems didn't develop as nicely as the others. Tests on people over 50 were catastrophic, with volunteers not lasting more than a few days before the tests had to be stopped for safety reasons. Further tests and calculations estimated that no one over 40 could survive the journey. To add onto the problems, volunteers with even average amounts of stress were much more likely to suffer heart attacks in their sleep state.

The second problem was the elephant in the room that everyone tried to ignore for as long as possible. To continue the human race, the crew had to breed. But the ship could only hold six people; five women and one man to ensure long term species procreation. There would have to be incest just to create a third generation. Knowing that it had to be done, research was done on the science of incestuous breeding and it was found that only .0001% of the population had the genes necessary to sustain a healthy family tree.

With these two factors in mind, the most qualified candidates were identified from a short list. Most people who were involved in the decision wanted the candidates to be trained and debriefed extensively before the launch. However, the cryogenic scientists made it clear that the stress of knowing the fate of humanity was to be carried on their shoulders was far too much. The only plan that ensured the safety of the candidates was to sedate them in their sleep and put them into the cryochambers without even the slightest bit of warning or preparation.

Thousands of years later, the lights in the spaceship turned on. It had landed on the virgin planet just as the scientists and engineers designed it to. The cryochambers started their three day reanimation process, and once the crew members exited, they barely had a chance to speak to each other before a video played in the center of the room.

""Hello, I'm Dr. Baker. Welcome to Project Phoenix.""

***

This is obviously a long term prompt that will focus on breeding, and if the RP goes on for a long time, incest. However, this most likely isn't going to be a sex-focused RP. The main focus will most likely be on the characters themselves as they go through the emotions of knowing they're the last humans alive and the struggles that they'll face just to survive and deal with each other. I'm looking for realistic character development, with each one taking a different view on their situation. Breeding is the only truly necessary kink for this RP, but others can be discussed. Here's my [kinklist](https://i.imgur.com/ZTXuOUH.png) if you want to check it out. I'm always open to doing this prompt, so no matter when you're reading this, feel free to shoot me an orange envelope!"

I don't know why this reboot is very different to the first one I did. I am not thinking about watching porn at all and I don't have sudden urges (probably because I am not in my room so much and because I am not studying but doing and internship).

During this week I have gone out with more girls than for the past 8 months! I got lucky with one in day 4 but I didn't have a condom so (c'est la vie). Anyways, I can handle conversations with girls in a smoother manner now that porn is not in my life (I don't know why? If someone can tell me please let me know). Instead of just focusing on trying to go to bed directly with the girl (which is something the porn unfortunately taught me.) I have more complex conversations that I believe satisfy the girl's and my intellectual side much more.

I am taking a scientific approach towards my rebooting and there is always alcohol when I go out to meet girls. So I will discontinue that so I measure if my ""ED"" symptoms have decreased. If anyone has any recommendations on how to proceed or want to share your experiences please comment.

54g1dx,18,2016-09-25,The Burning Ship Connection,blaze_holejammer,Smaude,https://www.reddit.com/r/Smaude/comments/54g1dx/the_burning_ship_connection/,"Well, I don't really know how to call this ""connection"" I just discovered, but the best name I could come up with is the **Burning Ship Connection** - or maybe **Smaude Turnwood** would be a better idea, I don't know. But anyway, I just thought I would share this because I think is so fun to think about these series of coincidences, and I know there are some cross-fans between Sourcefed and Rooster Teeth.


I'll start by saying that if you don't follow both companies, you should at least vaguely know some of these people: Burnie Burns, co-founder of Rooster Teeth; Ashley Jenkins, the main person behind the news channel *The Know*; Gavin Free, member of RT, Achievement Hunter and part of the *Slow Mo Guys*; Ryan Haywood, member of Achievement Hunter and, obviously, Meg Turney, and Sam and Maude. If not, you can look them up online.

I'll also say that previous to *ALL* of this, I was never a ""shipper"", or liked shipping people - especially real people, but as any of us Smaude shippers are currently aware, when the chemistry between two people on camera is so unbelievably good, that sort of develops naturally.


So, I'm a long Rooster Teeth fan, and my first ship ever with real people was between two RT personalities: *Turnwood* - Meg Turney and Ryan Haywood. Now, at the time, I didn't watch Sourcefed content yet, so I didn't really know Meg Turney from those days, and for those of us who are RT fans, we know how much Meg and Ryan were shipped - or at least, there was the jokes, which were really fun, btw.

That's when the whole idea of shipping opened up for me, really. That's when I *really* understood it - especially because they were obviously never gonna be together (Ryan is married, and Meg is with Gavin Free). Regardless of their relationship, Meg and Ryan were so good together, I couldn't get enough of it. They show together (*Free Play*) was soo fun, and as Meg eventually left Rooster Teeth, that kinda died off; but when there's so much chemistry like that, it never really dies, and Meg and Ryan still get in touch with each other and stream together constantly.


So, cut back to now, now watching Sourcefed content, and here I am again, shipping two real people: this time, Sam and Maude. One day, I thinking about all of this, and both of these ships, and I started to notice some similarities, so I decided to piece all together for fun:


* Meg started her career with a hosting gig in DeviantArt. Maude started her career with a hosting gig in Nickelodeon.


* Ryan started on the early days of Achievement Hunter as a programmer/channel manager, and eventually became a on-camera personality. Sam started on the early days of Sourcefed as an intern, and eventually became a on-camera personality.


* Ryan and Meg have a age difference of 7 years (36-29). Maude and Sam have a age difference of 7 years (30-23).


* Sam is a female audience favorite, and is known for flubbing words constantly. Ryan is a female audience favorite, and is known for flubbing words constantly.


* Maude and Sam became known for their chemistry as hosts, and often got their ships mentioned in their show (Sourcefednerd/Bloopers). Meg and Ryan became known for their chemistry as host, and often got their ships mentioned in their show (Free Play).


* Not long after the height in their ship's popularity, Meg leaves Rooster Teeth. Not long after the height in their ship's popularity, Maude leaves SourcefedNerd.


* Sam has a background in Musical Teather. Ryan has a background in Theater.


* Both Maude and Meg have mentioned having Star Wars BlackMilk dresses.


For those who know the RT website, there is premium content there (for the called ""FIRST members""). Very recently, Burnie uploaded a vlog of when he went to the Emmys this year, and on his time there (Los Angeles) he also went on the premiere of the Grace Helbig/Hannah Hart's movie, which Maude was also at (if you seen her twitter), and was actually invited by Burnie himself. In this vlog he also talks about how he met Maude, and we also learn that:


* Maude knew Ashley (Burnie's current fiancée) before and was introduced to Burnie through her. (From what I gathered) Meg also knew Ashley before she met Burnie.

* In 2012, when Burnie first went on a date with Ashley, she was actually with Maude, and Burnie brought in Gavin to ""wingman him and just talk to"" Maude. Gavin was said to be ""intimidaded by Maude"", and bolted.

* Circa 2013, Gavin starts dating Meg Turney.


So that's why I decided to call the ""Burning Ship Connection"", mainly because of Burnie Burns, him being this ""central link"" to all of this (although Gavin and Ashley also kinda are). But anyway, I just though it would share this with you guys."
54g7ov,2,2016-09-25,I [21F] don't really feel like my boyfriend [24M] is supportive of me...like at all [2 years],Throwaway888918,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/54g7ov/i_21f_dont_really_feel_like_my_boyfriend_24m_is/,"Hey everyone, so this has been on my mind a lot recently and I figured I'd get some opinions. Throwaway because reasons. 

I've been dating my boyfriend for around two years now. We're sort of long distance as he is gone working during regular week and only comes home during the weekend (travels to another state). He's moving up there next month, but he's not sure how long he will be there because he wants to move to another state after that. He will move again as soon as his company opens a position in his dream state.

Overall out relationship is pretty alright. We have a lot of the same hobbies, interests, sleep schedule, sense of humor, etc. We do not live together. Distance has definitely put a strain on it though. We do the best we can with the time we have together. So onto the actual post.

I really feel like he puts me down about things I do and enjoy. Like a lot. He's got depression and is very cynical so I'm not sure if that's the problem but I'll give you some examples. He rides motorcycles, and I've always been interested so I got my own to ride with him. I love it so far. I've been riding for like a year so I'm a still learning and have dropped it once. He can't seem to let this go and constantly tells me I ""suck"" at riding. When we ride together he constantly looks back at me to make sure I haven't ""crashed"" and when we stop at gas stations he will sometimes say things like ""I can't believe you made it through that on ramp. I was worried you ate it back there when you didn't catch up."" Keep in mind he rides a 600cc and I have a little 250 so of course he is going way faster than me. 

We play dungeons and dragons together often, which I really enjoy. I used to run (DM) but haven't played in a long time, like two years or so. We recently started playing with his friend so I made a character and had a lot of questions about the class and how the game worked. While we were talking he looked at me and said, ""I have no idea how the fuck you ran this game if you don't know how it works."" I almost started crying when he said this because it really hurt my feelings but I manned up and played anyway.

He also hates my career field. I am in graduate school for social work and have worked my ass off for this field. I finished undergrad with a great GPA and was accepted into my schools one year masters program for my MSW, which only lets in like 25 people a year. I'll be graduating in May with my Masters which I am proud of myself for.

However, he takes pot shots at my field all the time. He tells me I'll get paid like garbage, and that none of the work I do with my clients matters at the end of the day. I currently work in a maximum security psychiatric hospital deal with adults with criminal charges and serious mental illness. I get it's not ideal for some people but I LOVE working with this population and leave work feeling very fulfilled. However he tells me that I'm ""putting myself in danger for no reason"" and asked, ""Do you really feel like coloring with these guys twice a week will make them any less crazy? Wake up."" One time he yelled at me about going out on the ward with my patients to color with them (I do it twice a week). We have some dangerous people on the ward but there are security and staff around and nothing happened. However my boyfriend was pissed I ""put myself at risk like that"" and hung up the phone on me.

I recently have been looking at applying for a social work internship with the military when I graduate. It's a six year commitment but they have loan repayment and they fund me getting my social work license (10k at least if I have to pay for it). I've always wanted to join and mentioned to him I was thinking about applying and he freaked out again and told me that I'd ""hate the military"" and that I ""wouldn't make it through OCS anyway, knowing you"" (I'd be going to BOLC which is different) so there's no point in applying (I do need to work on my cardio but I am in shape at 5'7 and 135 pounds). My dad, cousin, and his wife, who are former Navy and Marines, are very excited for me, and are encouraging me to apply. I'd get paid more than in the private sector and be able to leave my hometown, so I'm definitely looking into it especially since it doesn't look like we'd be living together any time soon due to his desire to get to his home state.

Maybe I'm wrong but I feel like a boyfriend should be more encouraging and supportive. I just feel put down a lot and don't really find myself wanting to do much with him anymore because I get worried he will shit on me. Especially after this military thing (which would be great for my career) I'm kind of getting tired of it. I don't feel like I'm allows to be my own person anymore, you know? He didn't used to be like this, but he's gotten way more cynical and short with me since he started his new position about a year ago. I feel like I can't even talk to him without him getting angry or shitting on me. I haven't even told him about my days at work in weeks because he just gets mad about me working there.

I'm considering breaking up with him when he moves in a month or so, but how he used to be holds me back a little bit because there are times when he's fun to be around and helps me out (buying me tires for my bike, etc). Reddit, do you guys think this is salvageable it should I just end it when he moves?

Tl;dr: boyfriend shits on me about hobbies and constantly tells me I suck at them. He also doesn't like my career choice and tells me that my job (social work) doesn't matter. I was considering applying to Army AMEDD for social work but he essentially told me not to bother because I wouldn't make it through training anyway, even though the rest of my family is very encouraging. He's constantly negative about all my choices. ShouId I break up when he moves or is this worth salvaging? He didn't used to be like this. Thanks in advance. Edit: sorry for typos on mobile"

I'm your host, BreakFromReality, and I'll be accompanying you in your journey to find a fun, erotic roleplay.

Please check your ID with the security guard -- all potential RP partners and their characters MUST be at least 18.

So now that you're here, how do you get started?

First, you'll sit down at our [single-deck blackjack table](https://www.random.org/playing-cards/), where you'll be deciding the kinks of the RP. You'll be dealt eight starting hands of blackjack, with each total matching up with a specific kink. (For example, a 20 is for cheating.)

Here's the full list of kinks:

* 4 -- Dealer's Choice
* 5 -- Light Bondage
* 6 -- Group Sex (MFMF, MFMFMF)
* 7 -- MFM Threesome
* 8 -- FFM Threesome
* 9 -- Interracial/Raceplay
* 10 -- Anal (Woman Receiving)
* 11 -- Filmed
* 12 -- Clothed Sex
* 13 -- Dirty Talk/Name-Calling
* 14 -- Rough Sex (Hair-Pulling, Spanking, Light Choking, etc.)
* 15 -- Public Sex
* 16 -- Creampie/Risk of Impregnation
* 17 -- Facial
* 18 -- Risk of Getting Caught (i.e. ""hold the moan"")
* 19 -- Uniform/Costume
* 20 -- Cheating
* 21 -- Player's Choice

Once eight unique hands are drawn, you will choose two kinks that you would like to include in the RP. You will also eliminate two other kinks that you would not like to include. The dealer will then choose two kinks of the remaining four.

The Dealer's Choice and Player's Choice can not be excluded.

*(To play: draw 2 cards from 1 shuffled deck. Make sure all cards except jokers are included. Repeat this eight times until complete.)*

Once the kinks are decided, you'll decide if you want to stay on the main casino floor or head over to The Den. *(While I will absolutely play with everyone, those choosing to go to The Den will get VIP status.)*

If you choose the main floor, you will head to our [roulette wheel](https://www.random.org/sequences/), where you'll help decide the character you'll be playing. The women listed on the wheel will be character models only (with one exception).

The list is as follows:

* 0 -- Player's Choice of Anyone on the List
* 1 -- You, because you're always #1 at DPP Casino!
* 2 -- Bella Thorne
* 3 -- Dove Cameron
* 4 -- Laurel Coppock
* 5 -- Alison Brie
* 6 -- Kendall Jenner
* 7 -- Candice Patton
* 8 -- Margot Robbie
* 9 -- Vanessa Hudgens
* 10 -- Scarlett Johansson
* 11 -- Taylor Swift
* 12 -- Miley Cyrus
* 13 -- Ariana Grande
* 14 -- Emma Stone
* 15 -- Milana Vayntrub
* 16 -- Nina Dobrev
* 17 -- Rihanna
* 18 -- Sarah Hyland
* 19 -- Lily Aldridge
* 20 -- Mila Kunis
* 21 -- Stella Maxwell
* 22 -- Dianna Agron
* 23 -- Chloe Grace Moretz
* 24 -- Katherine McNamara
* 25 -- Victoria Justice
* 26 -- Carrie Underwood
* 27 -- Jennifer Lawrence
* 28 -- Selena Gomez
* 29 -- Emilia Clarke
* 30 -- Emily Ratajkowski
* 31 -- Meghan Markle
* 32 -- Jourdan Dunn
* 33 -- Katy Perry
* 34 -- Aubrey Plaza
* 35 -- Nicole Beharie
* 36 -- Ariel Winter

You will spin the wheel six times (12 for two-female scenes and 18 for three-female scenes). You will then pick three characters (six for two-female scenes and nine for three-female scenes). The dealer will then choose the character he would like you to play (the Player's Choice may get excluded).

*(To play: Set the smallest value at 0 and the largest value at 36, and keep it in one column. Take the first 6/12/18 numbers in the list.)*

Finally, it's time to ""role"" the dice at the [craps table](https://www.random.org/dice/) and see just what you'll be playing. The roles are below:

* 2 -- Dealer's Choice
* 3 -- Coach's Daughter
* 4 -- Friend's Wife/Girlfriend
* 5 -- Student
* 6 -- Sister's/Daughter's Friend
* 7 -- Incest (Daughter, Sister, Cousin)
* 8 -- Friend's Sister/Daughter
* 9 -- Work Scenario (Secretary, Intern, Co-Worker, etc.)
* 10 -- Wife's/Girlfriend's Friend
* 11 -- Bully's/Bullying Victim's Sister
* 12 -- Player's Choice

*(If Celebrity is chosen, you will be playing the actual celebrity from the wheel instead of a lookalike. For 12, I am giving the option of playing either the bullying victim's sister or an interesting revenge plot with the bully's sister.)*

You will roll the dice four times. Of the four unique roles, you will then discard one. The dealer will discard one of the remaining three, and you will then choose one (or both, if possible) of the remaining two.

*(To play: simply roll two virtual dice. Repeat until four different roles are picked.)*

After that is done, we will have the RP with the characters, roles and kinks!

Now if you choose The Den?

Here's the list of characters for the roulette wheel:

* 0 -- Player's Choice of Anyone on the List
* 1 -- You, as a woman age 40+ (if you're not one already)
* 2 -- Rena Sofer
* 3 -- Nigella Lawson
* 4 -- Christie Brinkley
* 5 -- Eva Longoria
* 6 -- Rashida Jones
* 7 -- Jane Seymour
* 8 -- Elizabeth Hurley

* 32 -- Ellen Barkin
* 33 -- Sharon Stone
* 34 -- Paula Patton
* 35 -- Mary Steenburgen
* 36 -- Courteney Cox

And here are the roles:

* 2 -- Dealer's Choice
* 3 -- Coach's Wife
* 4 -- Friend's Wife
* 5 -- Teacher/Principal
* 6 -- Mom's Friend
* 7 -- Incest (Mom, Aunt, Grandmother)
* 8 -- Friend's Mom
* 9 -- Work Scenario (Boss, Co-Worker, etc.)
* 10 -- Wife's Friend

The size, and resources were very appealing to me. I just toured Missouri S&amp;T yesterday, and also enjoyed it, but the campus was lacking when compared to Mizzou (I.E. not as lively). It was still good overall though. 

I was just wondering what other students thought about both the schools. To guide me in my decision, I have several questions for Mizzou Engineering Students:  

1. Is there anyone here who got accepted into Mizzou and Missouri S&amp;T and chose Mizzou? If so, why?

2. How hard are the classes? As in, are they academically challenging? (because my dad is ""convinced"" that Mizzou is a ""Party"" School)

3. Are the recruitment opportunities good? As in, how are the Career Fairs?

4. If you are a junior or senior have you been able to get internships?

5. How are the engineering clubs (whether it be for a specific major, or in general), and how have you enjoyed them?

6. Personally, how have you enjoyed your experience so far?

When are the new MacBook being showed? Is it gonna be this year or is it probably next year. If it's next year I'll think I'll just skip the wait and buy one right now.

But having no network and opportunities to do any internships (I lived alone all through university and had to work full time customer service to support myself) has left me struggling to get started.

I got offered a position in an industry leading company a few months ago but on their sales team (it’s a foot in the door, so I’m happy with it) but I’m very bad at it. I’m not a sales person, I’m realising that now. I can’t deal with people and I can’t push a sale.

My numbers are consistently low (although I’m 50% to my target after 3 months and we were told not to expect to hit until 6/7 months so I consider myself to be on track).  I get crazy customers who waste hours of my time with no result which also goes against my conversion statistics. I would estimate that 60% of my customers ghost me. I have good weeks and bad weeks (which everyone does, and I am new so I expect my numbers to be low for now).

I don’t want to be in sales forever (I don’t want to be in sales at all- I don’t have the patience for customer service) but I thought it would be a gateway to other departments in our company. I get the feeling I’m going to be fired though.

Long story short; I recently discovered I have a mental condition which makes me… spacy. I’ve been making mistakes and not been able to effectively prioritise my work load because of it (this was prior to diagnosis/treatment). Every time an error has happened however I have taken ownership, apologised, and asked how to avoid doing it again so that I can improve my performance and be better within our company.

It’s not my performance that worries me, because I believe that people can see that I really am trying. It’s an office clique and their knock-on effect.

We have a “work” mentor- which is a more senior member of the sales team. Now our mentor has taken a disliking towards me because I’m too independent. The others who started with me worship her and rely on her for everything whereas I am a very independent person who thinks for myself. I don’t bother her constantly for advice and help which she doesn’t like and when I do make mistakes (or misunderstand something) she enjoys watching me get in trouble for it because I didn’t ask her first.

The mentor, I (and a few others) have noticed, is also trying to skew my sales on purpose. She has given away my customers for petty reasons, ran to managers with mistakes rather than helping me, tries to publicly humiliate and speak down to me on internal communications, and generally acts quite malicious under the disguise of “helping”. 

But what makes it all worse is that she is best friends with our general manager. Our general manager is also the one I have all of my appraisals with- so I know that her opinion of me has already been damaged because of what our mentor tells her when they’re together. I feel like our mentor has a negative opinion of me because I don’t view her as a supervisor (she isn’t- she’s the same job as me, just been there a year longer) and do not rely on her as much as she would like to stroke her ego- and as a result of this our general manager is on the lookout for mistakes for me because the mentor has told her I’m a huge fuck up.

And I know that this is happening because our office manager asked the people who sit near how they think my performance is because she was concerned- only for my deskmates to all confirm that they think I’m adapting fast, doing a great job, and they’re all impressed with how well I am doing for someone with no experience and that I can’t be compared to someone with 5+ years in the industry.  I feel like I’m being pushed out of a job before I actually have chance to settle- I understand that newbies make mistakes but I feel that they’re being very petty and looking for mistakes now.

I don’t know how to proceed- every time my mentor is in I feel anxious and full of dread. I want to stay and work my way into a different department but I don’t think I’ll ever get the chance if she manages to push me out and keep ruining my reputation. I’m also not the only person this is happening to but she is also in a position where she cannot say/do anything because of their relationship.

TL;DR Mentor hates me and she’s BFFs with our Manager which is screwing over my chances to improve and move one because now I’m on their watch list."

Il fronte popolare del Pt ha spianato la strada alla reazione di destra

Impeachment in Brasile: gli operai non hanno un lato

Rompere con il Pt! Per un partito operaio rivoluzionario!

Lo scorso mese il parlamento brasiliano ha approvato l’inizio della procedura di impeachment nei confronti del presidente Dilma Rousseff, sulla scia di uno scandalo per la corruzione che ha scosso il Paese. Dal 2002 il Brasile è stato governato dal Partido dos Trabalhadores (Pt – Partito dei lavoratori) a capo di una serie di coalizioni di collaborazione di classe, guidate prima dal suo fondatore, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva e poi dalla Rousseff. Rousseff ora è accusata di imbrogli contabili volti a nascondere i buchi di bilancio dello Stato. Alla testa degli attacchi contro Rousseff ci sono gli ex alleati di coalizione del Pt, molti dei quali sono a loro volta indagati o sotto accusa per corruzione. Tra di loro c’è il vicepresidente Michel Temer, del partito borghese Pmdb, destinato a sostituire Rousseff qualora venisse sospesa o deposta.

Il blocco che governa il Brasile è un esempio di “fronte popolare”: una coalizione di collaborazione tra le classi in cui uno o più partiti operai si uniscono a forze borghesi per governare per conto dei capitalisti. Noi ci opponiamo per principio a queste coalizioni borghesi. I partiti operai riformisti come il Pt esprimono una contraddizione di classe tra la loro base proletaria e il programma filocapitalista dei loro dirigenti. Ma quando entrano a far parte di un’alleanza di fronte popolare, questa contraddizione di classe viene soppressa a vantaggio della borghesia, a garanzia del fatto che mentre sono al potere, questi partiti non oltrepasseranno i limiti di ciò che è accettabile per la classe dominante. L’esperienza del governo del Pt non fa che confermarlo.

Per più di cinque anni il governo Rousseff ha inflitto una serie di attacchi ai lavoratori, imponendo misure di austerità e tagli alla spesa sociale e attaccando gli operai in sciopero e i contadini che protestavano contro la confisca delle loro terre. Questi attacchi sono venuti sulla scia di quasi un decennio di dure restrizioni imposte dall’Fmi sotto la supervisione dell’ex dirigente sindacale Lula, che da presidente si è rivelato un valido servitore sia per gli imperialisti che per la borghesia brasiliana. Il Pt di Lula ha usato la sua autorità sul movimento operaio per attuare politiche neoliberiste che non erano riuscite nemmeno ai suoi predecessori di destra. Allo stesso tempo, la prima fase del governo del Pt ha coinciso con un boom a scala mondiale dei prezzi delle materie prime, di cui il Brasile è uno dei principali esportatori. Di conseguenza il Pt ha potuto distribuire qualche briciola, come i pagamenti in contanti ai poveri (Bolsa Família) e l’aumento dei salari minimi.

Ma il boom è finito da un pezzo. Negli ultimi due anni il Brasile ha conosciuto la più grave crisi economica da decenni. Oltre che nella campagna per l’impeachment, sia gli alleati che i nemici di Rousseff sono impelagati anche nell’inchiesta Lava Jato (Autolavaggio) sui traffici di tangenti e il riciclaggio di denaro sporco che vedevano coinvolta la compagnia petrolifera di Stato, Petrobras.

La maggioranza della popolazione considera i politici del paese come un covo di ladri. Data la situazione di instabilità politica e il crescere della povertà, il Pt è molto discreditato agli occhi della sua base operaia. Il malcontento si è espresso nelle proteste del 2013, scatenate inizialmente dall’aumento delle tariffe dei mezzi di trasporto ma che si sono poi estese ad includere le folli spese del governo per gli stadi dei mondiali, lo stato deplorevole dell’assistenza sanitaria e dell’educazione e la violenza della polizia. I partiti dell’opposizione di destra hanno approfittato dell’insoddisfazione popolare per condurre una vasta campagna contro il Pt.

Con le elezioni in vista per l’anno successivo, Rousseff ha cercato di ottenere l’appoggio della base del Pt promettendo di migliorare le condizioni di vita dei lavoratori e dei poveri. Ma dopo la sua risicata rielezione nel 2014, si è subito rimangiata le promesse fatte, imponendo l’austerità mentre il Paese continuava a sprofondare nella recessione. Di conseguenza, i lavoratori e gli oppressi si sono demoralizzati e smobilitati, incoraggiando ulteriormente la destra, compresi gli alleati di governo del Pt. Le attuali manifestazioni contro il governo, cui partecipano milioni di persone, sono capeggiate da fazioni politiche reazionarie spalleggiate dall’oligarchia mediatica e da gruppi di affaristi filo-americani.

Rousseff e i fedelissimi del Pt condannano l’impeachment definendolo un “atto violento” contro la “democrazia” e presentandolo falsamente come un colpo di Stato. Questi argomenti sono molto efficaci nel creare allarmismo e paura in una società in cui sono ancora vividi i ricordi delle sofferenze inflitte dal sanguinario regime militare creato dal golpe del 1964. Temendo l’ascesa al potere della destra, molti operai hanno partecipato alle manifestazioni contro la cacciata di Rousseff. Queste proteste, con tanto di bandiere rosse e contingenti della sinistra e dei sindacati (soprattutto quelli appartenenti alla Central Única dos Trabalhadores) vengono usate dal Pt per ricondurre la rabbia degli operai nell’alveo del sostegno al fronte popolare. Intanto però i dirigenti del Pt hanno cercato di scongiurare l’impeachment offrendo incarichi ministeriali a vari partitini borghesi in cambio del loro “No” al congresso.

In questo momento il Brasile non si trova di fronte a un colpo di Stato militare per rovesciare il governo, ma a delle sordide manovre del parlamento per rimuovere il presidente. Opporsi all’impeachment di Rousseff equivarrebbe ad un voto di fiducia, cioè ad un sostegno poitico, al fronte popolare capeggiato dal Pt. D’altra parte, appoggiare l’impeachment significherebbe sostenere le forze politiche di destra che tramano contro Rousseff. Come marxisti, fautori dell’indipendenza politica del proletariato, noi diciamo che la classe operaia non ha un lato in questo conflitto.

Quello che la borghesia riuscirà ad ottenere con i suoi attacchi agli operai, sarà deciso dal livello di resistenza e di lotta della classe operaia. Il proletariato brasiliano è la sola forza che abbia il potere sociale di guidare la lotta per tutti gli oppressi, dai poveri delle favelas nelle metropoli, alle donne, ai contadini senza terra. Questa prospettiva richiede la costruzione di un partito operaio rivoluzionario, che lotti per strappare la base proletaria del Pt e dei sindacati alle loro attuali direzioni, nel corso della lotta per la rivoluzione socialista e per il potere operaio.

Il Gruppo internazionalista: coda di sinistra del fronte popolare

Tra le versioni più combattive di collaborazionismo di classe in Brasile c’è quella propugnata dalla Liga Quarta-Internacionalista do Brasil (Lqb), affiliata al Gruppo internazionalista (Gi) degli Usa. Come tutto il resto della sinistra brasiliana, anche loro hanno la linea di “No all’impeachment”, che costituisce un voto di sostegno politico al fronte popolare di Rousseff (www.internationalist.org, aprile 2016). Pur non usando queste testuali parole, anche il Gi e la Lqb non fanno che ripetere la propria versione del ritornello di tutta la sinistra sul “golpe giudiziario”, agitando lo spettro dell’arrivo al potere di uno “stato forte bonapartista dominato dalla polizia e dai tribunali”, cioè di una dittatura militare poliziesca, se Rousseff venisse sollevata dal suo incarico. Per mascherare la loro difesa di un governo borghese, il Gi e la Lqb abbondano con gli appelli alle occupazioni di fabbrica e allo sciopero generale e sostengono persino di opporsi politicamente al governo.

Ma nella pratica, la loro posizione non è che una forma leggermente mascherata del più classico opportunismo, che consiste nel fare appello alla “lotta contro la destra”. Nel momento stesso in cui strepitano cinicamente sulla minaccia del “bonapartismo”, il Gi e la Lqb ammettono che un golpe in Brasile in realtà è improbabile “perché con l’impeachment la destra otterrebbe il suo obiettivo principale”. Per quanto condannino ritualmente il fronte popolare o chiedano di non votarlo, i centristi del Gi e della Lqb non fanno che offrire delle giustificazioni all’apparenza marxiste per la linea adottata da gran parte della sinistra riformista: salviamo il governo Rousseff.

Il Gi e la Lqb ammettono che il Pt ha portato molti attacchi alla classe operaia, “alcuni dei quali nemmeno la dittatura militare aveva osato tentare”. Ma sostengono lo stesso che un governo dei partiti parlamentari alla destra del Pt costituirebbe un pericolo qualitativamente maggiore rispetto al fronte popolare. Il Gi e la Lqb, per quanto glielo consentono le loro modeste forze, contribuiscono a tenere in piedi l’alleanza di collaborazione di classe che ha spianato la strada alla reazione di destra.

Il Gi e la Lqb pontificano che “se vince la destra bonapartista, essa avrà dietro di sé tutta la forza dell’apparato giudiziario e poliziesco”. Come se il governo di fronte popolare del Pt non abbia usato ripetutamente “l’apparato giudiziario e poliziesco” contro gli operai e i poveri! Andassero a raccontarlo alle masse miserabili in prevalenza nere delle favelas che ogni giorno subiscono il terrore della polizia. All’inizio dell’anno il governo Rousseff ha approvato una draconiana legge anti-terrorismo che rafforza i poteri repressivi dello Stato contro le proteste sociali.

Lo Stato borghese, il cui nucleo è costituito dall’esercito, la polizia, il sistema carcerario e i tribunali, esiste per difendere gli interessi della classe dominante borghese contro i lavoratori e gli oppressi. Da parte sua, nel 1996 la Lqb non si è fatta scrupoli ad invitare lo Stato capitalista a intervenire all’interno dei sindacati, intentando una serie di cause legali (si legga: “I documenti del tribunale provano che hanno fatto causa al sindacato. La montatura brasiliana del Gi: mani sporche, cinismo e menzogne”, in Workers Vanguard n. 671, 11 luglio 1997).

L’intera storia del leninismo e del trotskismo è consistita in una lotta contro la collaborazione di classe e per l’indipendenza politica della classe operaia. Fu grazie a questo che il Partito bolscevico poté guidare gli operai al potere in Russia nell’ottobre del 1917. Dopo la Rivoluzione di Febbraio, che rovesciò la monarchia zarista, i partiti dei menscevichi e dei socialrivoluzionari parteciparono ad un governo di coalizione con delle forze borghesi. I bolscevichi di V.I. Lenin condannarono queste azioni come un tradimento del proletariato e rifiutarono di fornire qualsiasi appoggio al governo capeggiato da Alexander Kerensky.

Per dare una parvenza di ortodossia alla loro posizione sull’impeachment, il Gi e la Lqb, in un breve articolo disponibile per ora solo in portoghese, invocano uno degli aspetti della Rivoluzione russa: il tentativo di colpo di Stato militare dell’agosto del 1917 del generale Kornilov per rovesciare il governo borghese di Kerensky, spazzar via i soviet e schiacciare la rivoluzione. I bolscevichi reagirono facendo appello ad un fronte unico di tutte le organizzazioni operaie per sconfiggere l’offensiva controrivoluzionaria, combattendo con le armi a fianco delle truppe di Kerensky, ma senza cessare di opporsi al governo.

L’articolo del Gi/Lqb sul colpo di Stato di Kornilov riconosce la posizione dei bolscevichi, ma solo per far sparire, con un giochetto di prestigio, la distinzione tra difesa militare e appoggio politico, per giustificare la loro capitolazione al governo di fronte popolare in Brasile! Il loro articolo elenca le molte differenze tra la situazione attuale in Brasile e quella della Russia nell’agosto del 1917: la Russia era in guerra, attraversava una situazione rivoluzionaria, esistevano i soviet ed un partito rivoluzionario di massa. Ma omettono disonestamente una differenza importante: gli operai russi si trovavano a fronteggiare un vero colpo di Stato militare, mentre gli operai brasiliani confrontano molta aria fritta su di un colpo di Stato che serve solo a far appoggiare un governo borghese.

Un anno dopo l’adozione da parte dell’Internazionale comunista stalinizzata della politica dei fronti popolari (o “Fronti del popolo”) al suo settimo congresso del 1935, il leader bolscevico Leon Trotsky sottolineò che:

“Dal febbraio all’ottobre, i menscevichi e i socialrivoluzionari, che offrono un parallelo molto buono con i ‘comunisti’ e coi socialdemocratici, erano in un’alleanza strettissima e in una coalizione permanente con il partito borghese dei cadetti, con i quali formarono tutta una serie di governi di coalizione. Sotto il segno di questo fronte popolare si trovava tutta la massa del popolo, compresi i consigli di operai, contadini e soldati. Senza dubbio i bolscevichi presero parte ai consigli. Ma non fecero la minima concessione al fronte popolare. La loro rivendicazione era quella di rompere questo fronte popolare, di distruggere l’alleanza coi cadetti e di creare un vero governo operaio e contadino” (Leon Trotsky, “La sezione olandese e l’Internazionale”, 15-16 luglio 1936).

Per i marxisti la distinzione tra difesa militare e appoggio politico riveste un’importanza vitale. Durante la Guerra civile spagnola (1936-39) il fronte popolare collaborò al soffocamento di una rivoluzione operaia, spianando la strada alla vittoria delle forze del generale Francisco Franco. All’epoca i trotskisti davano appoggio militare alla parte repubblicana contro Franco e i fascisti spagnoli. Nel 1937, Max Shachtman, un militante di spicco del Socialist Workers Party americano, sostenne che si dovevano appoggiare i crediti di guerra del governo di fronte popolare capeggiato dal primo ministro socialista Juan Negrín. Shachtman chiese: “Come possiamo negare un milione di pesetas all’acquisto di fucili per il fronte?”

In una lettera del 1937, Trotsky insistette che l’unica posizione corretta era quella di “votare contro” il bilancio militare. La sua spiegazione era che:

“un voto alla finanziaria in parlamento non costituisce un aiuto ‘concreto’ ma un atto di solidarietà politica (...). Tutte le azioni del governo Negrín sono all’insegna delle necessità della guerra. Se accettiamo di prenderci la responsabilità politica del modo in cui il governo gestisce le necessità della guerra, voteremmo politicamente a favore di qualsiasi proposta governativa (...). In simili condizioni, come potremmo prepararci al rovesciamento del governo Negrín?” (Lettera a James P. Cannon”, 21 settembre 1937).

Opponendosi all’impeachment, il Gi seppellisce la linea di classe, sostituendovi il criterio della contrapposizione tra “progressisti e reazionari”, criterio che è stato sempre usato per sostenere che, opponendosi ai governi borghesi di sinistra, i marxisti aiutano la destra. Quest’accusa fu lanciata in un classico caso di opposizione al fronte popolare. Nel 1964, l’allora dirigente trotskista Edmund Samarakkody e un suo compagno votarono a favore di un emendamento presentato da un politico di destra, che portò alla caduta di un governo di fronte popolare a Ceylon (l’attuale Sri Lanka). Quest’azione coraggiosa e coerente con in principi, fu oggetto di discussione alla Prima conferenza internazionale della Tendenza spartachista, nel 1979. Samarakkody aveva finito col pentirsi (a torto) il suo voto del 1964. I nostri compagni invece difesero la sua decisione del 1964: una possibilità migliore per Samarakkody sarebbe stata quella di attaccare le procedure parlamentari e uscire dal parlamento. Opponendosi al pentimento di Samarakkody, l’attuale capo del Gi Jan Norden, che all’epoca era un militante di spicco della nostra tendenza, disse giustamente:

“Un’altra obiezione comune alla nostra politica di opposizione proletaria al fronte popolare è l’accusa di aiutare la destra. Ma fino a quando non siamo in grado di rovesciare il governo esistente, qualunque tipo di opposizione ad un governo di fronte popolare in carica sarà esposta all’attacco di aiutare la destra”. (“Nessun ‘sostegno critico’ alla politica di fronte popolare”, in Spartaco n.3, febbraio 1981).

Ma ne è passata di acqua sotto i ponti. Da vent’anni Norden è uscito dalla nostra organizzazione con una manciata di seguaci e da allora si è spostato costantemente a destra, pur continuando a coprirsi le terga con una retorica pseudo-combattiva.

La classe operaia non ha alcun interesse in comune con gli sfruttatori e con gli oppressori capitalisti. La Lci è stata l’unica forza a lottare con coerenza per portare questa concezione al proletariato nel recente periodo che ha visto dei governi borghesi di sinistra in America Latina (frontepopulisti come in Brasile o populisti come in Venezuela ed altrove). Più di tredici anni di governo del Pt forniscono un esempio chiarissimo della lezione che Marx trasse dalla Comune di Parigi del 1871: il proletariato non può usare a proprio vantaggio la macchina dello Stato capitalista, ma deve spezzarla con una rivoluzione socialista e sostituirla con uno Stato operaio.

Per liberare il potenziale rivoluzionario del proletariato brasiliano è necessaria la costruzione di un partito internazionalista rivoluzionario, che si basi sulla prospettiva della rivoluzione socialista nelle Americhe e nel resto del mondo, specialmente nel cuore stesso dell’imperialismo, gli Stati Uniti. Solo la rivoluzione socialista mondiale, gettando le basi per una pianificazione socialista a scala internazionale, può consentire uno sviluppo economico qualitativo ai paesi che ora si trovano sotto il tallone degli imperialisti. La Lci si batte per riforgiare la Quarta intern azionale di Trotsky, lo strumento indispensabile per portare la coscienza comunista al proletariato e condurlo al potere alla testa di tutti gli oppressi.

I interned at a company this past summer doing a lot of work in machine learning.

I guess that internship must sound impressive, considering I'm getting interviews at places like Fitbit, Jane Street, Two-sigma, etc. 

However, I am not the genius-type these companies are looking for -- I have to work really hard to be good at things. Right now I'm not very good at programming quickly (although my fundamental CS theory is pretty good), and am not actually passing most of the interviews/code challenges I'm getting. I have so much schoolwork and other commitments on campus and I really don't have the time to sit down and study CTCI. 

I'm also getting really tired and bored of the whole application/interview process, and would rather just spend my time doing schoolwork, research, etc. and learning while I'm here. 

Will I face significant career disadvantages if I just forgo the whole internship process for now, and focus more on it next year?

I guess what I'm asking is, would a sophomore Big-N intern have significantly more career opportunities than a junior Big-N intern *after* graduation, when it comes time to get a job?

I don't know how I manage to do what I do manage to do. I can barely take care of myself because everything I need to do is just too much but I don't feel worthy of making sure I have the necessary extra time to do it. I'm in school (just barely) full time and I work (just barely) full time and I don't really have days off unless I blow off my internship so I guess it's reasonable to fall behind a little. But I can't manage anything. I'm lucky if I have my teeth brushed and deodorant on before I walk out the door and manage to be (mostly) on time to work. Say nothing about any sort of skincare routine, makeup, or doing anything with my mess of a hair other than a bun that hopefully catches all the fly-aways. I can't even manage to feed my fucking cats in the morning. If I didn't live with my parents again, I don't know what my poor girls would do. And I have foster kittens I desperately want to keep but my parents just keep reminding me that I can barely take care of the two I already have. And they're right and I feel horrible. But I'm always so tired. I'm physically sore and exhausted and even thinking of doing much more than surviving is so intimidating. Clean the cat litter? Sweep the floor? Do laundry? Maybe if I've had three days off and I've built up enough energy reserves to do anything. But I can't do that every single time I need to do something. How do I think I'm gonna get the promotion I'm going for? And if my some miracle I get it and can finally afford to get my own place, how am I going to maintain it? I have these dreams of a smooth, organized place but I can't bring myself to do anything for it. Even when I'm feeling mildly less like utter shit, and can entertain such thoughts, I know it won't last and I'll never be able to fulfill those dreams. I'm even less self sufficient than I was as a teen and I'm almost twenty fucking five. I just don't understand. I take my antidepressant. But my psychiatrist won't switch it until I get a sleep study done even though I didn't have sleep problems until the god damn Effexor, which isn't even helping. At best I feel flat; at worst, it does nothing and I feel like shit. I see a therapist weekly which has kind of helped with the aftermath of my ex and working through some anxiety that was holding me up with a few things but talk therapy doesn't help that black hole in my chest, the anchor in my stomach, the veil over my eyes, and the wet blanket wrapped around me. I go to the gym twice a week. I wouldn't but I know me so I signed up with a trainer. The accountability makes me go and I've seen some improvement physically. I have some muscles and my cardiovascular endurance has increased. Except when my body decides it's incapable of doing anything and one lap around the gym has me on my ass and I feel too weak at work that I barely manage the 25lb bag of cat food or kneel down and get back up without it also putting me on my ass. Why am I so weak? The one thing where the amount of effort I'm putting in actually feels like the amount of effort I'm putting in. Fuck. And even right this minute, as I'm typing, I'm in the shower. Some people with depression don't shower for days on end. I get in the shower. And promptly sit my ass down and take what satisfaction I can get from the warm water. Maybe I'll get some body wash and half-ass wash the important/ smelly parts. Maybe I'll get my hair wet in the hopes of resetting my curls so tomorrow's bun will be less shitty, even though I know that makes my scalp itchy. Occasionally I even actually shampoo and condition it, if I feel like standing for a few minutes. The other day I got enough gumption to really thoroughly shave. Today? I dunno. Depends how I feel when I finish this. Of course I'll tell my therapist on Wednesday how low I'm feeling tonight. But I don't think she even really understands. I'm so good at faking it and not letting people really see. And that in itself is so exhausting. Therapy is the first thing I do those days and I'm usually in such a rush to put on clothes and get out the door that I can't even acknowledge how I feel until much later so, and this I've explained, I have a hard time explaining to her how shitty I feel. A friend saw it briefly when I zoned out at trivia night. Another friend understands because she's been in a similar place. My parents don't. They know I'm not ok, which is why I think they take care of so much for me. But my mom thinks I just need to take vitamin D and then I can lower the dose of my antidepressant and get off of it. I'm lucky to be able to take what I'm prescribed, let alone the list (vitamins D, B12, C, E; iron; magnesium; flax; idefk what else) I ""should"" take. I think I'm done. I think I shamed myself into washing my hair. But I probably won't dye it until my roots are at my ears because that would require effort and simply existing requires effort and that's a bit of a prerequisite to pretty much everything.

Sorry there's no formatting. But that would require me to have had organized thoughts and we all know how that goes.

One more for good measure.

FUCK."

&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;The lizard carefully crept over the granite spikes. While the spikes made for an excellent protection from larger predators, that didn’t mean they were completely safe for the lizard. The spikes were indiscriminate about who they sliced into ribbons, intruders or those that had spent their lives in their jagged masses. As the lizard carefully placed its toes around the edges of the peak it was crossing, a shadow crossed its peripherals. The lizard quickly dragged itself over the edge, just as talons closed over the space it had just occupied. 


&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; The lizard blinked in a slow lazy satisfaction, knowing that the hawk that had attacked it would pay dearly for its efforts. The spike pit was easy enough to enter from the air, but getting back out was the tricky part. Even now the hawk was having difficulty spreading its wings for flight. The lizard turned to continue on its way, when the granite sliced one of its feet, the ensuing bleeding dropped the lizard to the ground.


&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; The lizard closed its eyes. Any minute now it would start bouncing of the unforgiving spikes, and by the time it hit the ground it would be a minced bag of flesh. 


&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Suddenly, the lizard felt the air change, but there was no pain. The lizard reopened its eyes to see that it was now falling down a hole. The hole did not seem to have a bottom and the walls were getting closer. The lizard reached out its bleeding foot to see if it could find some purchase on the wall. It was relieved when it could feel its claws making slight indents into the wall, slowing its descent. The lizard immediately moved all of its feet to the walls to decrease its velocity. Luckily this worked. Unluckily, the lizard was still falling fast enough that it couldn’t stop itself from hitting the bottom.


&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; The blow stunned the lizard for a bit. And when it came to, it licked its eyes in wonder. Everything around it show a beautiful sparkling pink. It was in a large chamber in the earth, the only sources of light came from holes in the ceiling, like the one it had just fallen down. But the walls and the floor of the chamber took these few beams of light and refracted them all over, so the whole room shone this beautiful solid salmon glow. 


&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; As the lizard looked on at this wondrous sight, a feeling of unease crawled down its spine. The same instinct that had saved it from the hawk was telling it something was wrong. But what? And then the lizard noticed. The shadows were wrong. The lizard noticed that glow was not as solid as it first believed. There were this impressions against the wall that were lighter than the rest. As if the light was trying to penetrate its depth, but there was something in there that was absorbing the light. And once the lizard noticed it in one area, it couldn’t stop the seeing it wherever it turned. The lizard quickly scurried up a wall and into one of the holes in the ceilings and began to climb far, far away from the beautiful chamber. 


&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; And once again the chamber was completely still.

**Chapter 1**


&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Sai fidgeted in her chair. That was what really drove home the seriousness of their situation. Not the harsh white light. Not the noise of the air filter leaking through the “soundproof” walls. Not the slight tang of ozone that any new air filter from the last decade had gotten rid of. It was the fact that their chair made them want to fidget. How broken can a chair be that it stops perfectly curving to your body they wondered. That’s the entire point of a chair!


&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Sai couldn’t help but wallow in self-pity. They weren’t supposed to be here. This was a job interview for the truly desperate. Not for the first time, they cursed their father’s name. 


&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “Ahem.”


&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Sai jerked, bringing their attention back to the interviewer. The interviewer was tall and willowy, obviously a spacer and still getting used to the natural gravity of larger planetoids. 
It still made scientists scratch their heads. Nobody had ever found anything empirically different about the gravity on space stations and the gravity on planetoids or planets. Darkness, all of the planetoids and planets had some supplemental gravity to equal Terra’s. But somehow human bodies always seemed to know the difference. Spacers just seemed more spread out than those who grew up on ground, inner or outer rim. Of course nobody had any health issues living anywhere, gene therapy made sure of that.


&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “Ahem.”


&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Darkness, Sai had drifted off again. They refocused their attention on the willowy interviewer. “Sorry, what was that?”


&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; The harsh light reflected of the clear plastic lenses set in a wireframe sitting in front of the interviewer’s face. The lenses were the most striking thing about the interviewer. Sai could not determine their function. They wondered if the lenses hurt. Sai couldn’t imagine holding something on their face using their nose. By this point, the interviewer had steepled their hands together and was looking at Sai. 


&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “You’re over qualified for this position. You’ve got two Ph.Ds. in astrophysics and engineering from MIT. And yet you are applying to be an intern at a shipwright start-up. A start-up with almost no capital. Thanks to some fancy tax maneuvering this internship will be paying less than minimum wage, much less. But you already knew that. We didn’t hide the fact when we sent out the job notice. So the question is, why are you here?”


&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Sai opened their mouth to answer, but by way the interviewer ignored them, it was a rhetorical question.


&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “There were no flags in your job application, but obviously there is something about you that has forced you into this position. And that makes me even more leery. Whatever it is that has made you this desperate doesn’t raise any flags for the United Nations, and we don’t have the spare money to run a deeper background check on you. Do you know what that makes you?”


&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Sai sat fidgeting in silence this time, thinking it was another rhetorical question. After a long pause they answered, “What?”


&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “That makes you a desperate mystery.” 


&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; The interviewer suddenly pushed themselves forward and slammed their hands on their desk and leaned forward, those strange lenses flashing. Sia flinched back at the sudden movement, the solid air comprising their chair couldn’t quite keep up with their movement. Suddenly there was nothing supporting their back and their back hit the floor with their legs weirdly floating as the chair tried to figure out what happened to the body it was previously holding. The interviewer’s shadow loomed over Sai’s sprawled body. 


&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “We’re trying to change the world here. We’ve got a staff of five, no capital, and a crazy idea. We don’t have time for a desperate mystery. Get out of my office.”


&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Sai tapped the pressure plate on the floor turning off the chair, allowing their legs to touch the ground. They sighed as they collected themselves off the floor and made for the door. Another job down the waste dispenser. At least this time she actually had an interview. Everyone else did have the resources to run a more in depth background check, and Sia didn’t even hear back from them. But their exit was barred by a person.


&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; This person had most definitely been born and raised in the inner rim. There was just something about natural or close to natural gravity that made for that delightfully defined musculature nothing else could seem to replicate. 


&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Their origin just became more obvious as they moved towards Sai. Inner rim folk moved like the gravity wasn’t the same out in the outer rim. They went from being still to an explosive movement to being still again. They almost seemed like a stop-motion hologram. 


&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; They smiled as they approached Sai. “Oh don’t listen to that stick in the terra Minerva, I love desperate mysteries.” They stuck their hand out for Sai to shake. “Welcome to the team, I’m the CEO of Modern Combustion. Please call me Mister Vladimir.”
Sai dumbly stuck out their hand to shake Mister’s hand. “What an odd name,” they thought.

I went out on a total limb and told her she was pretty and I wanted to hang sometime and handed her my number. I never thought it would have worked, or that we would have been together as my longest relationship thus far, or that I would have fallen that in love with her or that it all would have ended so abruptly. We were away (she lived in NY, I live in NJ) for our third summer, but we had made it through two before so I was used to it, and I thought she was. We were both doing internships, and because of that and how weird my hours were we didn't get to talk alot every day, but I made sure to text her or call her whenever I had free time, and any time I had a day off I would drive up to visit her (she doesn't have her license). I pushed and pushed to the end of the summer when I would be able to see her again, and out of nowhere she dumped me on my last day of work. I drove up to her house to try and fix it but it was no use. She said she had had some doubts and had found other people attractive sometimes, but it always went away when she was with me. I tried to tell her it was normal and that it's not like I never found other people attractive, but she said she wanted to be alone, and she thinks that she will find someone she never has a ""doubt"" about ever. Two weeks passed and I tried my hardest to give her space to work stuff out, but then we had to go back to University. Walking into my senior year alone after expecting to have had her like the past two years and also thinking we were gonna move in together after school (all her initial ideas) is so hard for me. I tried to get her back a few times but she says she's happy now and wants to see other people. She started going on dates with a grad student a week after school started and she claims she doesn't want a relationship so I don't exactly know what their deal is. I think she's just pushing herself over me with him. Regardless, it's been about a month and a half now, and I have made some progress but still wake up feeling like shit every day. I feel betrayed, abandoned, and alone. I have recently started trying to talk to new people since I basically have no other choice, but it sucks because deep down I still think I want her. I still believe that she meant all the things she said and that she might change. I also know I can't let myself believe that. I just hate that she was able to find someone new so easily. I tried a few times and got shot down, and while that doesn't bother me too much it torments me that I can't get my mind off her but she hasn't thought about me in days. Not to mention I've seen her with him a few times on campus and it always makes me want to puke. I want a new relationship, I want to stop caring about her, but I also don't want to end up hurting someone else just because I am hurting right now. I do feel ready to try again, because at this point I know she's never coming back, but I do still miss her and feel like there is no one else for me. Thank you to anyone who read all of this, it mainly felt good just to get it off my chest. Tomorrow is a new day and a new opportunity to heal and meet someone new."

I felt as if everything just clicked with her and I could not have been happier. We felt as if everything was going so well, decided to move in with one another and another mutual friend. We saw a few times over the summer, but for the most part it was long distance. Come time to move in, she away at Drill with the National Guard. A week later, I'm moved in and just waiting for her. That weekend, we attended a friend's party, hit the clubs and had a great time for 5 hours. After we go to leave she tells me we need to talk and then breaks up with me. Citing that I was doing things that made her feel crazy, that she felt more comfortable being single.

It was the worst pain in my life. I cannot even begin to describe it, but I'm sure you know how I felt. Against my better judgement, I drove home (I had sobered up from what I was drinking). The next few weeks, I had to force myself to eat, to drink, to move, to basically function as a human being. I lost 10 pounds, 1/16 of my body weight. So much of what I did over the time together was with her, including school clubs I love.

Basically, everything I did had her mark on it. From going to fencing club, eating at restaurants, driving and walking around town, the music I listened to. I couldn't even go home to get away, because the apartment I'm in was picked to allow her dog to stay with us. Sleep held no refuge for me. Every night I would dream of her: we would get back together, we never broke up, it was just a bad dream, she came crying back to me saying it was a mistake, I went crawling to her and she took me back.

She then contacted me three times. I didn't start them but I answered. First it started as asking if I would get rid of the art she made for me. Then it was the whole, I'm still going to be friends with you, which I rejected. I wasn't about to try to be just friends with the girl I gave my heart and soul only to be destroyed. She accused me of being cold for not wanting to continue the relationship. The way she worded it made it sound as if I could have gotten back together with her, but I couldn't let myself do that. That was my last real contact with her.

Fast forward to now. I can honestly say I'm over the break up. Not over her, just the break up. I still have troubles eating more than once a day. I still dread going to sleep because I fear what I might dream of. Hell, I'm writing this now to avoid going to sleep. When I go to the club where we met, Fencing Club, I'm plagued by the ghosts of her in the gym. I still find myself trying to think of the words to say to have stopped her from breaking up with me. I just cannot truly get her out of my mind.

Those are just my problems stemming from her. At my school, I'm in leadership positions in our Fencing Club and Humans V. Zombie Club (Game of Nerf Tag, real fun if you're interested). With Fencing, I am our club's treasurer. I have the wonderful pleasure of trying to deal with the University and they have given me no information, no matter where I ask. I have to figure out how to pay rent for our space, with no help from the University. I have to figure out how to deposit money into the club's account, with no help from the University. I have to figure out how to make $1000 cover $5000- $6000 of expenses for the year, with no help from the University. 

Now for the HvZ club. I'm the Chief Moderator and head the referees of our games. Sadly for me, my ex is still somewhat active in this organization, despite living an hour and half away. I have seen her multiple times during this past month because she came to town to take part in the meetings. Now, one of our moderators accused me of violating rules, which I did not, regarding a vote for a position my ex was running for. I removed myself from the voting during the election to make sure I kept personal life and club life separate. Now I hear rumors that the accusing moderator was causing the trouble just to gain favor from my ex, meaning I gained more trouble and stress in my life because of my ex.

Then on to my classes. I'm in high level classes as I am finishing my studies for a Data Science major, a new major at my University. They are all stressful and require my full attention, but I just don't have the energy to do so. Furthermore, my potential job field is competitive, so I am pressed to find potential internships now, adding just one more thing on my plate.

Then the family. My parents push the internship thing, they don't know what I am going through and don't know the extra stress they are adding. They are doing it because they are looking at my future, and I love them for that, but my current few for the future is rather limited at the time being. My Grandmother is also plagued by cancer and it cannot be defeated. While she is pursuing treatment, it is only a matter of time before she passes and the fear of waking up to a phone call saying that she has moved on is terrible.

All of these events have destroyed my morale, my will to carry on, my ability to wake up, get out of bed, and keep moving. I have my moments of clarity and strength, but they aren't common. The worst part, the part that scares me to the very core, is that I have thought about killing myself multiple time. I drove home and thought about running into the back of a semi at 90 mph. I looked at the shotgun I keep in my room and thought that it looked really friendly. I was able to keep these thoughts from becoming considered as actual options, but the fact that I still had them scares me. Pretty much, I am a broken and hollow man. It's all I can do to keep carrying on. When my friends and family ask how I'm doing, I lie and say I'm alright, but instead I am broken and lost.

I am reminded of the song ""M.I.N.E"" by Five Finger Death Punch and the lyrics: ""It could have been much worse
But it should have been better."" I had all my pieces put into place to ""make life my bitch"" as I so eloquently phrased it to some friends. Yet now, nothing seems right, nothing seems to be going my way and I hate it but I don't know how to change anything. It's tiring. It's painful. It makes me hate my life, yet I know I can't give up. 

I guess that's all I have. I figured I could vent to strangers and you can go about your day and forget about that guy from reddit, but if I went to my friends with this, it'd be a greater burden for them and I can't do that to them. Thanks for reading this super long post.

54ip3g,9,2016-09-25,The Phone [MF] [PHONE SEX] [COWORKER],LiviaFlair,eroticliterature,https://www.reddit.com/r/eroticliterature/comments/54ip3g/the_phone_mf_phone_sex_coworker/,"The other day, I sat in my room crying to myself and wondering what did I do to deserve this. All of this time I had spent supporting him and giving everything I had to our relationship. I sleep alone a lot of nights because he told me that he had to work late. I spent holidays alone because he told me that he had to go out of town for business. Some nights I would cook dinner knowing that his face would be absent from the other end of the table. Sitting on my bed, I became frozen as I stared into the open space in which we used to share. He left me for her, Amy the intern who helped him with all his projects. The look in his eyes as words formed from his lips telling me that he no longer loved me, shocked my heart. As he walked out the door, he turned to me and said, ""Maybe if you lose some weight you can get another man to fuck you."" The door closed and I stood there in silence with petals of tears running down my cheek. How could he just abandon the love that we built over all these years for an intern? Suddenly I went into a deep depression that seem like years but was only for a few weeks.
Sitting at the ice cream parlor, I devoured two big bowls of vanilla fudge. As I put each spoonful into my mouth I cried. The waitress kept asking me am I okay but I would just nod and mumble yes. ""Excuse me may I sit here?"" a deep rough voice said as I held my spoon in mid air. I didn't respond because, I didn't know how to respond. Staring at my bowl I refused to look up and instead shoved the spoonful of ice cream into my mouth. ""So what flavor of ice cream is that?"" he asked as I began to move my head slightly to look up. ""Its vanilla fudge"", I said softly as I began to notice his face.  It was Glen from my job. Glen is a man that all of the ladies follow at work, they love his charm and good looks. His hair is jet black with lots of curls and he has gem colored green eyes. He is handsome but he has never spoken to me before at work and I felt confused about him sitting across from me. ""You haven't been to work in a few days, is everything okay?"", he asks as he dips his spoon into my ice cream bowl. ""I am okay, just been busy"", as reply to him in a soft tone looking at him intensely. How does he know I haven't been to work, this man doesn't know me nor has he ever even acknowledged my existence. ""Btw you have very good choice in ice cream"", as he took another spoonful from my bowl. In my mind I am thinking what does he want from a broken woman and I wished he would go away. Then all of sudden he stood up, ""I'll leave you with your ice cream for now but call me later"" as he placed a card on the table then walked away. I gazed at the card for a moment thinking why would I want to call him. What is he wanting? before I could ask myself anymore questions I quickly grabbed the card and put in my purse.
Later that night, I kept thinking about the card in my purse. If I called him what would we talk about? Him and I have nothing in common at all. So before I scared myself out the whole idea, I took out the card and called him. ""Hello April, how are you this evening"" he said as short breathes pushed into the phone. In disbelief of what is happening, I acknowledged my presence with a soft hello. Silence for a few seconds and he says,""What are you wearing tonight?"" as I could hear breathes escape from his lips while on the phone. Startled at first I began to describe what I was wearing. ""Well I am wearing a black crop top and skirt."" He paused in the midst of his breathing and asked could I remove my top. I wanted to say no and hang up the phone however I slowly began to pull my top over my head. ""You should always be comfortable when talking to me,"" he said as I sat in my chair like a kid waiting for the next instruction. ""Are your nipples hard right now?"" he asked as I began to look down at my curvy breasts. I acknowledged they were hard with a soft, ""Yes."" Then he told me to rub my nipples in circles and tell him how it feels. Feeling a little reluctant, I began to do what he wants, ""My nipples feel soft as I glide my finger over each one,"" I said as my fingers went randomly over my nipples as I sat in my chair firmly. ""My dick is so hard baby, let me rub it all on your nipples,"" as he began to breathe harder into the phone. My pussy began to throb as his voice echoed through my whole body. ""Spread your legs, open that pussy wide, and rub that clit baby,"" he said as I started to hear him stroking his dick up and down. I told him my fingers were rubbing my clit and that he could slide in at any time. He then said to me, ""Let me slide in that fat pussy baby, "" as he began to moan louder in to the phone. My voice started to tremble as I felt that connection of both of us cumming at the same time. ""Cum for me baby,"" he said as I started to moan while rubbing my clit faster and then exploding. He came quickly after me and told me that he had to go. Feeling confused I took it as he used me for his pleasure. I then crawled into my bed and just stared up looking at the ceiling thinking about what I did with Glen over the phone.
The next day I couldn't help but to keep thinking about the phone call with Glen. Then suddenly a stack of papers slammed on my desk at work. ""Glen said to bring this paperwork to him on the third floor,"" the clerk said as I began to pick up the papers. I shuffled off to the third floor and as soon as I stepped off the elevator there was Glen in an empty room naked. He looked at me and smiled then motioned for me to come closer. Standing before him, I looked into his eyes and he said,"" This is my company and you are mine now, close the door.""

54iqml,1,2016-09-25,I feel like I have nothing.,ScrapDraft,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/54iqml/i_feel_like_i_have_nothing/,"I'm 24.  

I have no job despite being out of college for two years now.  I know I went into an unconventional field (audio), but I didn't think there would be absolutely no one willing to hire me.  I mean, I have somewhat of an internship going, but my boss is wanting me around less and less.  I've been with him for over a year and I have conflicted feelings for him.  On the one hand, he never HAD to take me on as an intern.  He also never had to pay me.  On the other hand, he has been cutting my hours drastically recently but still demands that I have my days reserved in case he needs me to come in.  So I usually end up sitting home alone, not working and not making money.  But unable to do anything else in case he needs me to work that day.  And despite this, he still only pays me for the time that I work.  $10/hr.  Which was what was agreed upon when I started the internship, but he said he would pay me more as my skillset grew and I started working on bigger projects.  And despite my skillset growing and working on bigger projects, I'm stills tuck at my starting rate.  I'm lucky to make $400/mo.  But this internship is the only thing keeping me somewhat employed in the industry.

Since my audio career doesn't look hopeful, I've been trying to explore different career routes.  Unfortunately, I can't afford to go back to school.  So I had to narrow my search to things I could learn/study for free.  Long story short, for the past few weeks I've been studying to be a certified drone pilot.  A lot of websites say those jobs will be growing and growing in the coming years.  I actually got excited for once.  When I told my parents that I was using my free time to study for drone certification, they gave me a lecture about how they didn't want me with TWO useless degrees.  And boom.  Right back into feeling shitty about a career.

That being said; I still live with my parents.  I know a lot of people my age still do.  But a lot of them don't as well.  Some of my ""friends"" are married.  Some just bought houses.  And here I am, typing this in my parents' basement.  As another user in this subreddit said in a different thread, I actually get upset when I see other people succeeding.  I get mad when I see people that I outperformed in school looking for apartments or houses.  And then that makes me feel guilty.  Even if I can't be happy for myself, I wish I could be happy for others.  But for some reason, I just can't.

I have a girlfriend of 4 years, but I think she's only with me because I'm her first and only boyfriend and she doesn't know any better.  I'm worried that eventually she'll realize how much of a bummer I am and drop me.  Especially with her new career.  She gets out a lot and meets a lot of great people.  Eventually she'll be moving out of her parents' place.  I wish I could be happy about it, but it just makes me worried.  I know, its selfish.  But I worry that her life is going to continue to move forward while mine remains stagnant.  And that just doesn't work out in the long run.

I don't have any friends.  I mean, occasionally I'll get invited to parties and gatherings with people from my high school.  But that's only because they're all friends with my girlfriend.  I was actually out at a birthday party last night.  Despite being an introvert, I tried to be open and outgoing.  But for the majority of the party I sat alone just kind of observing.  No one seemed interested in talking to me.  My girlfriend says that they're my friends too.  But I know that if we were to break up, I wouldn't see any of those people again.  Much less be invited to any social gatherings.  I mean, I've never been the person to have a lot of friends; even in school.  But now that I'm out of school and I have no way of being around people my age anymore, it's more of a problem.  I haven't gotten a single text message from someone wanting to hang out in years.  I haven't been invited to a social gathering that wasn't through my girlfriend in years.  Hell, for the last 4 years, I haven't even received a ""happy birthday"" from anyone other than my family or girlfriend.  So I sit in my parents' basement all day, alone, playing video games and job searching.

I have little to no hope.  I've heard every bullshit excuse in the book.  ""Things get better.""  ""Don't worry, everything will be ok.""  ""You'll make it eventually.""  ""You aren't alone.""  
I don't know how these lines are supposed to help anyone.  People act like there's some sort of unwritten rule to the universe that guarantees that everyone will find a job.  Everyone will make it.  Everyone will live a happy life.  Well sorry, but there isn't.  There is absolutely NO guarantee that I'll find a job.  There's NO guarantee that I'll be happy.  And it's just super frustrating to hear those lines come from people who have their lives together.

And the worst part is that I have no one to tell this to.  My parents would probably just get mad; making me feel even worse about myself.  My girlfriend doesn't want to hear that shit.  I know it's unattractive.  That's just a fact.  Insecurity is completely unattractive.  And like I said, I don't have friends.  And the last thing I would do is want to talk to some 1-800-poorme hotline.  I know they probably help a lot of people, but I feel like it would just make me feel even worse about myself.

So I resort to posting it on the internet to a bunch of strangers, for reasons unknown, on a thread that I probably won't even check up on."
54iqvg,13,2016-09-25,When is it time to worry about not getting a Summer 2017 internship?,notverygoodprgrmr,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/54iqvg/when_is_it_time_to_worry_about_not_getting_a/,"As the username states, I'm a mediocre programmer. I can do some stuff like counting leaves on a binary tree and fiddling around with linked lists. I am in the beginning of my junior year majoring in Math and Computer Science. Due to being a dunce and screwing around, I got my GPA to a 2.6, which I am working on increasing to a 3.+ while taking steadily harder courses. 

The languages I am in decent in are C++ and Java, I know some HTML and have done limited shell scripting and messed around with UNIX commands and pipelines. I have no real projects except am working on a game for my Java class. I am working on getting more experience on front end web development and Linux OS.

I have gotten an interview with a finance company, had to do a HireVue behavioral interview which I am sure turned out bad and have gotten a LinkedIn HackerRank problem which I solved 9/11 test cases. I also have one with Pure Storage which I am going to do this week.

Basically, when is it ""oh fuck I'm screwed time"" for an internship. And has anyone not had an internship at a state school when applying for grad entry level gigs and gotten one?

tl;dr: When should I start worrying, and then what should I do? Thanks y'all."

The business was not going to last much longer. In the end, we were in our twenties, chasing musicians around San Francisco who didn’t have enough money to buy lunch, let alone video and lighting production. After some tough discussions, my partner bought my share of the equipment and moved back to New York.

Upon hearing the news, another friend offered me an internship opportunity, so long as I could sit at a desk and wear button-down shirts. I was skeptical on all accounts. At the time, I didn’t know the conversation would launch me headlong into the world of Salesforce.com. So began a wonderful journey: riding the wave of one of the hottest business platforms of this decade, working at three enterprise level companies in completely different industries, and relentlessly obsessing over the inner-workings of each business model.

Four years later, I spend most of my time working with internal customers at Angie’s List. I wear many hats in an effort to bring new functionality to life. I am a business analyst, teasing out the pain points and inefficiencies within the company; a solution designer – the whiteboard is my canvas; a mentor to an ever-growing team of Salesforce administrators, project managers, and developers; a consultant to my Director, as I have lived and breathed the enterprise level best practices. Most of all, I am a team player, a chameleon. I do what the job requires in that moment and strive to bring out the best in the people around me.

I am happy with my achievements thus far, while knowing there is more to accomplish. My favorite part of my life is analysis, strategy, and innovation; not just at work but everywhere. I am a natural problem solver, relishing the high pressure of a looming deadline, and overcoming the doubt that my team will reach a viable solution to a seemingly impossible problem. I want to do that on a much broader scale, beyond the lens of a single tool.

Salesforce has been amazing, but I know every wave must crest. I want to get in front of that, hone the skills that mean the most to me, and know how to apply them anywhere. I believe an MBA will help me achieve that goal. More so, I want to learn how to harness the raw vision, the energy of new ideas; and get them out of my basement, my garage, and my head – into the marketplace and the world. I believe the program at Kelley, specifically with a focus in Entrepreneurship, will help me realize that dream.

As a philosophy major, small business owner, and enterprise level IT specialist, I have a unique perspective that I love to share. I have honed my critical thinking skills, learned my share of business lessons the hard way, and played the corporate game with continually growing degrees of success. Most of all, I am enthusiastic about achieving greatness, with great people who want to shape the future and change the world.

54ixqk,6,2016-09-26,"10 months job hunting, finally landed dream job. Here is my journey and lessons for you friends.",zacharoo12,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/54ixqk/10_months_job_hunting_finally_landed_dream_job/,"I am here to share my story in hopes that it might rub off or inspire those that are struggling to find work. 
I worked for 5 years as an outdoor instructor in NZ before eventually wanting to make something different of my life and I chose to study at the University of Auckland. I chose to study the two fields I was interested in which was philosophy and economics. To do so meant that I would have to do it through the arts faculty and only come out with an arts degree; no commerce degree for me. I did consider my studies as an investment however. I put the time into doing the readings, preparing for exams and took summer school each year in order to shave time off of my degree. I ended up completing it in 2.5 years instead of 3 but sacrificed a number of summers in order to do so. My GPA was only B+ average. Sometimes I got an A, other times I got a C+. I wasn’t a top student of any sort but I was a committed one. 

Come November 2015, I had completed my last set of exams, was feeling good about the results I would get soon and put my eyes forward to finding a job. What job did I end up wanted after my degree? Something in economics, business, accounting etc. What really tripped me up in the arts faculty was that they do not prepare you for a business template of job hunting at all, and I suppose rightly so for they are an arts faculty, not a business faculty. This meant that I was not told at the beginning that it was invaluable to be doing summer internships, work placements, volunteer work and preparing for a graduate programme at a large firm after I had finished. Instead I left in November and expected that I would probably have some sort of “office” job by December sometime and I could work my way into something I enjoyed from there. Naïve I know! But I actually had not been given any guidance or clues as to what I was to become. Maybe the business faculty of the university was supposed to do this at some point. I was interested in getting anything “economicsy” or “businessy” for the mean time. 
My first reality check involved my CV. My sister who works at a large firm saw it once in passing and immediately scalded me for bad spelling, grammar, sentence structure, syntax, font type, spacing, professional wording, you name it. I am extremely grateful for the work she and some other professionals put into making it look nice and presentable and my first piece of advice would be that; get your CV looking professional and do not underrate the value of a second opinion. A well paid for professional CV is actually worth the money hands down. These companies actually have electronic filters for CV’s. They will trawl the list of thousands of CV’s sent and delete 99% of them using keyword culling. The same goes with cover letters to a more important extent. 
So how long was it going to take me to get a job? 10 months. 10 long months of continuous searching NZ job sites, phoning people for opportunities, writing and tailoring CV’s and cover letters for each one in order for it to at least not be deleted without even being read. Here’s another opinion but I would not discard this method all together; job listing websites such as Seek NZ are almost exclusively after people with experience, or they immediately cull the ones without experience. For what it was worth to me, I never, not once, got an interview from sending my CV and Cover Letter to a company through Seek. Seek seems to work much better for people with experience and certainly not for someone trying to break into a field they don’t have a degree in. So don’t throw it just yet if this doesn’t apply to you. 
Here is where I can teach you the most on how to break into an industry. We have all heard it before, “it’s not what you know but who you know”. In my time phoning around people for jobs I had in mind my conversation would normally go something like this. “Hi X, my name is Y how are you doing today? (reply), hey look I am calling because I am a graduate from UoA in Economics and I am interested in working in (field) and I have heard you might be a valuable person to talk to and seek some advice. I am wondering if I would be able to get you a coffee and pick your brain about the profession sometime”. So this either got 1 of 2 replies. 1 being, “why should I waste my time with you, you don’t even have a commerce degree, no one is going to hire you, you made the wrong choice and need to go back to university and make better decisions” Basically they laugh you off the phone. (Click). The second reply was “I sure would love to get a coffee with you, I really appreciate the effort you have taken to get in contact with me, not many people do this, you stand out as someone with passion for field x, when do you have in mind?”. The people are few and far between but totally work the effort. Every time I sat down with one, they would buy me the coffee, I would have a large list of questions about the industry having done my homework on the field and we could talk sometimes for up to 2 hours about the field, history of it, where it is leading, job opportunities, sage advice from the person at the top. (these guys were often directors or even CEO’s, they actually are jumping in their boots to impart their knowledge, success lessons onto you). Now here’s what is interesting! I didn’t actually get a job from these guys however I can very very close. I would attribute it to just bad luck in the long run that this never worked and would actually advice this as the best way to get a job. These guys will shoot for the moon to get you a job if they like you. Sometimes the industry/company just doesn’t have a job going at the time or the decision just doesn’t stop with that specific person and you don’t get picked. The thing is that in knowing these guys, they will send your CV around to the golden destinations, put in their word for you, vouch for your passion and I even had 2 of them improve my CV once again to make it even more impressive. Once again! Call around and meet people face to face, this is the most valuable and opportune way to get a job in my opinion. 
I applied for 2 recruitment agencies. After talking with both and after a few weeks. 1 called me up asking if I wanted to be a milk man delivery driver, the other sent me to an interview that ended up being my foot in the door for office experience. These guys get you the small experiences that tally up on your CV. I ended up getting a second temporary placement through this agency to work at the might PwC big 4 firm. This was my massive break! 6 weeks working in the nicest offices you could work in. Free coffee quality machines, latest equipment, technology, software and the people are actually really nice! PwC would be one of the places I would love to work and hey I kinda did! For 6 weeks. The greatest part about this was that I now could stamp the brand of PwC on my CV. The funny thing is that no one actually cared how long I had worked there. My CV just showed I did and it was reputable. 
So after working for 6 weeks in the nicest office imaginable and now having a few office work style experiences on my CV, I continued my search in July. Once again my big break came through the people I knew. You see I had gone to an interview early in the year after applying for a job on a company’s actual website. These jobs are not listed publicly on large job listing websites but are for the opportunist that aggressively looks for them on the individual company website’s career page. The bad news? I didn’t get the job, at that point someone who had worked for a few weeks at a big 4 firm made the marginal cut and was selected over me. The good news? The liked me. They said I had passion, a good nature, the interviewer said I was a neat guy and the HR employee who dealt with me knew my name. Over the year I would ring her for jobs I saw on the website, she would remember me from when I interviewed at the start of the year and would advise me on if it would be a good suited role for me or not. Many times what I was inquiring about was not for me. Finally at the beginning of August I saw something that looked like my field, economics, attention to detail, business minded, degree in quantitative discipline etc. So I called my HR contact up (let’s call her Sally). She immediately remembered me, probably a compliment on her side for good memory and amazing skill to have for her line of work. But since we had talked together about what I was after and I was a likeably quality on their records, she “green flagged” me in an application. This means that I am a priority candidate immediately and within 2 days had an interview.
So did I get this job? No! funnily enough, for a second time, it came down to it being between me and another candidate. I had aced the first interview, I had to do a presentation for the second one and apparently aced that and now I had met some of the high up managers of the sector, the really like me and wanted me to have the job. But my competition made the marginal cut once again. I got a few interesting calls basically saying that I was great and it was close but someone else had got it. But they best news was that this commercial manager dealing with me like me so much he was going to personally fit me somewhere, rain, hail or shine! You cannot believe what that kind of call goes down like. You have a manager offering to find you a position in their company due to your skills, experience, passion etc. So a few more weeks went on by and I eventually did land myself a contract. 
Now here is the funny part! All year I had searched for something between 43k – 50k as a good starting point, I was turned down after interviews for these jobs and I turned down a few myself for it not looking like what I wanted to do. I even had one place turn me down, tell me I was arrogant and wouldn’t fit their environment due to such. This was for a 43k job remember. Sometimes me confidence which is incredibly attractive to the industry is just perceived at arrogance and it can be a fine balance when played in an interview. This place asked me for a good example of my impeccable attention to detail and I very respectfully pointed out how their website’s blog page I had read was missing a few words at the start of a paragraph; a copy and paste error it would seem. Where some companies would find this a great example, thank you for helping them improve their website and eliminate an embarrassing mistake, these guys saw it as arrogant! We all know NZ is a really PC place, and that it is smack with tall poppy syndrome and had clearly walked on these guys “eggshell” egos and they weren’t going to have anything to do with me because of such. They are a small govt enterprise by the way and govt enterprises don’t breed the kind of people/managers that will take constructive criticism for its value. Their website still has the spelling mistake/omitted words too which shows the incompetency of these kind of peoples. I have strayed, 43k is what I wanted and this company that I go the job at finally told me early in the interview stage that I had completely undersold my value by saying I expected such a short fall in pay. They said I would probably be looking at the 55-65k range if everything went through. Well! I get a coffee a few days later with the commercial manager to do a “little dance” of negotiations pre-contract so we can smooth the process. He asks if I am happy with the 70-75k offer that he can present me in a few days. I play it cool and say yes. But holy shit! That is more than I was dreaming of for a starter package jesus! Then a few days later, HR calls me, they say my reference checks with my past employers have checked out and they would like to send me the contract. Get this! My starting salary will be 89k. Once again, I play it cool. But I have already gone full super saiyan with celebration when I am off the phone. That is more than twice as much as I was hoping on a starting job and I had been turned down for less than half that much this year!

So I the contract signed, I have been looking for 10 months and I have had to go through hell to get here no knowing when it will end but it finally has and with the most amazing results. The biggest lessons I can tell you guys are all my mistakes though! These are what teach us! My CV was horrible at the start and I am sure it was binned instantly for being so. Get you CV professionally done, it’s a massive investment. Tailor your cover letters for each and every position so that it has the key phrases they had in the job description. Follow up with calls as soon as possible. HR is either your worst enemy or your best friend. If you annoy them at all, you can guarantee they will bin your CV, block your progress and feed you to the dogs. If you get on their good side, they will fight for you, vouch for you and even call you personally when they hear the good news at the end. The more eager you sound the better! The more people you talk to the better! The more contacts you network the stronger and quicker you will get the job! Know the people you are interviewing with. If you wanted to play it safe perhaps I should not have called out spelling mistakes on a website of the company interviewing me, but that is just me! I still maintain it is a good example but it won’t get swallowed as one every time. Another lesson! A company sees value in you valuing yourself well. If you say you expect 43k, they are likely to think you are only work the minimum amount, if you say you are worth 50k instead, they will see that as you being valuable to them, taking yourself and your expertise seriously and being willing to work harder. Most companies are not actually going to choose the person they can pay the least to because the person who is more valuable is probably going to make that money for the company back more than twice over with their skills. Remember the choices we make will not always bring about the result we wanted but they were still the right decisions. This is what risk and probability tell us. Sometimes the right decision will be a bad result. A last insight is that I am an Arts graduate! I don’t have a commerce degree that everyone seems to want, I don’t have a post-grad degree either! I have just networked a bunch of select people who have all helped me in some way, shape or form and have held out for what I wanted. 
I know I haven’t structured this extremely well but I wanted to write you all anyway because I know how hard it is and have been reading all your posts all year for inspiration. And now I have come out in the clear with a good future and only wish I can help you guys a little with your journey. Hang in their guys! Hold out for what you want. My way of tying my expenses over all year except for the few weeks of office work was to wash windows for a living. I have gone from making about 25k to just get by to 89k in one final signing of a contract. It gets better and the light finally shines, the hardest part is now knowing when it will but it will. Once again, thank you all for helping me all year with your advice and inspiration. I hope I can at least help one other person out today.

54j31j,7,2016-09-26,About The setting. The GMs. And the Role of PCs.,siredova,herohub,https://www.reddit.com/r/herohub/comments/54j31j/about_the_setting_the_gms_and_the_role_of_pcs/,"Ok this will be long but Id like to start defining what type of game well be playing. To which I'll give my toughs on three different subjects that I think can help us defined how to move forward. The setting, the GMs and the role of the PCs.

**The setting**

So First of all I think that before we start playing we should set what are be playing. Mutants &amp; Masterminds is a very flexible system and lend itself for a whole different campaign styles.

The default settings Freedom City &amp; Emerald City seemed to be preferred here. I have some issues with the Freedomverse setting so Ill give my two cents on the issues I have with it and how I think It can be address. 

The first thing is what I see most define any superhero setting: how common or for how long superheroes have being a part of the world. 

Think of it as sliding scale: on one end you have you have stories in which superpowered being just come into appearance (be because they are new or have being hidden from the public eye) this lends to stories where the players have to come to grips with not only where they fit in the world but how to work with others like them. Examples of this are the show Heroes, X-men first class, the first Avengers movie.

On the other end of the spectrum you have a developed status quo surrounding super power individuals: superheroes and villains are a part of everyday life (wherever the people like it or not).

You'll notice that despite being technically in the same setting the difference between Freedom City and Emerald City is where they are located in this scale.

My take is is that something in between works best is something in between. There has to be a status quo and a history for the players to fit into but not to much that rob from the uniqueness of being a hero. This being my mayor gripe with the Freedomverse, is too crowded. A super on every roof so to speak: I say that we should conserve the most iconic aspects (like the Freedom League and Claremont Academy) and trim the rest so the world so doesn't get to bog down in backstory and baggage. More important: It give room for the heroes of forge this lore by themselves (more on this latter).

**The GMs.**

Now here I'll be brief since I dont think that there is one way of Gamemastering that is the best period. Different styles serve best to different GMs. I personally follow a very nonlinear way of storytelling in the games I run and then encourage player too act more out of what fells right for their characters above the objectives of the adventure even if this often mean thing like splitting the party or digressing from the original plot. Others prefers a more solid structure for they campaigns.

What I do think would be best if GMs (or those in charge of the metaplot) divide the themselves in layers or kind of adventures (note that who comes with a concept for an adventure and who actually run the game might be not necessarily be the same person). For instance: street level heroes, A-Listers, Teen Heroes, Cosmics Heroes, etc.

**The Players**

There are two types of character in every story the main ones and the secondary ones. The PC should always be on the first category. This might seem like an obvious thing but its a big problem with a lot RPG material tabletop or otherwise. This doesn't mean they should be the only relevant characters neither they are the center of the universe in which they live. But the PCs should always feel like they are the center of the story they are playing. 

This is where what I mean about when I say the Fredomverse can do with some streamlining: if they are for instance some precursor civilizations like the Lemurians or the Preservers it should be up to the PCs to discover. As a Rule of thumb the backstory should never be better than the story in a RPG campaign.

I also help the players feel relevant and more invested. Playing as an unpaid intern in the Freedom League might be fun but it gets old fast. 

Now out of necessity this game can't count on having the same players for every adventure so some mayor NPCs are going to be necessary but they very rarely (if ever) should steal the spotlight from the PCs.

Of course Im hardly the definitive word on the subject and every thing I said can be questioned. But I have being Gamemastering for over a decade and I think this are a few point to discuss before we start playing.

54jf8u,8,2016-09-26,How do I [22 F] tell an old flame [22 M] that I'm not comfortable with striking up another relationship with him?,BallinCorgi,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/54jf8u/how_do_i_22_f_tell_an_old_flame_22_m_that_im_not/,"Around this time last year I started talking to this guy that I met on OKCupid while completing an internship in a nearby city. We hit it off and after about a month, month and a half of going on dates I was ready to make it an actual relationship. However, he started to become really distant out of nowhere and broke things off with me. I couldn't see what I did wrong, but just sort of chalked it up to ""wasn't meant to be"" and came to terms with it. My internship ended and I moved back to my college town to complete my degree.

We stayed friends on Snapchat (honestly, there were quite a few times where I just thought about deleting him but for whatever reason decided not to.) This weekend, out of nowhere he messaged me that he was in town and we struck up a conversation. Since then, he's been texting me non-stop and I don't know how to feel about it. He had wanted to meet up for drinks but I was busy with other obligations and now he's back home. He apologized for what happened between us and I accepted it. He knows that I plan on moving back to the city that I did my internship in (his hometown) after I graduate in December and has been talking about us doing stuff together whenever I come back. However, I don't think it's appropriate for us to strike up another relationship again whether that be romantic or just friendly. He really hurt me when he just dropped me out of nowhere and it took me a while to get over it. I don't want to be in a relationship for the foreseeable future, I'm tired of getting hurt and that's all that ever seems to happen. I don't even want sex, I just want to do my own thing right now. I also don't think it would be right for us to even be friends because I had liked him a lot and it would probably upset me if he talked to me about dating other girls.

Am I valid in thinking this way? I don't really give out second chances and don't see why this should be a special case. How do I say in the kindest way possible, ""I appreciate you apologizing to me but I would rather you not talk to me ever again""?
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: A guy that I used to date messaged me out of nowhere. It seems like he wants to strike up a relationship again but I'm not about it for a number of reasons. How do I kindly tell him to leave me alone?"
54jy8c,3,2016-09-26,Opinions on Introverted Streamers? - Laid Back Streamers?,HoodedDemon94,Twitch,https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/54jy8c/opinions_on_introverted_streamers_laid_back/,"I apologize if someone has asked this or something similar before. I'm wondering what the average viewer thinks of introverted streamers. - Or just streamers who are really laid back?

I don't know what's allowed or not, but I'd like to give some backstory and what I'm trying to accomplish. If something ends up not being allowed, give me a chance to edit it so that I can still get feedback on this post. Thanks r/Twitch for being an awesome source of information.

Let me start off by saying I'm a 22 year old introvert that is currently is his last semester of college (except for my internship next semester that I have to line up).

I built my computer in the spring of 2016 with some refund money from financial aid. Once I built my [computer](http://pcpartpicker.com/b/MFRG3C), I decided to start streaming. I went into streaming with the sole purpose of opening myself up to people. Trying to come out of my shell. As far as I remember, I've always been the quiet kid in the back of the class. I only really talked around my friends and family.

I managed to find a [twitch team](http://castordie.com/) from an old r/Twitch mega-thread not too long after I started streaming. They understand my goals and I understand theirs. I've been a part of multi-streams that have definitely forced me to talk to people.

My parents have told me that since I started streaming this year, they've noticed it's been easier for me to talk.

I was influenced, in a way, by an old Minecraft YouTuber and Twitch streamer I used to watch: NearbyGamer. I caught his stream one time and I told myself that I wanted to do that. He was laid back, but was interactive and talked to people with ease. I still have a ways to go, but I'm happy where I am so far.

TL;DR - Are laid back introverts a bad thing if they're trying to get over their introversion?"

54kuyy,2,2016-09-26,M4F Don't Let Mondays Get You Down! Get Lucky!,BreakFromReality,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/54kuyy/m4f_dont_let_mondays_get_you_down_get_lucky/,"Hi there, and welcome to DPP Casino! I'm your host, BreakFromReality, and I'll be accompanying you in your journey to find a fun, erotic roleplay.

Please check your ID with the security guard -- all potential RP partners and their characters MUST be at least 18.

So now that you're here, how do you get started?

First, you'll sit down at our [single-deck blackjack table](https://www.random.org/playing-cards/), where you'll be deciding the kinks of the RP. You'll be dealt eight starting hands of blackjack, with each total matching up with a specific kink. (For example, a 20 is for cheating.)

Here's the full list of kinks:

* 4 -- Dealer's Choice
* 5 -- Light Bondage
* 6 -- Group Sex (MFMF, MFMFMF)
* 7 -- MFM Threesome
* 8 -- FFM Threesome
* 9 -- Interracial/Raceplay
* 10 -- Anal (Woman Receiving)
* 11 -- Filmed
* 12 -- Clothed Sex
* 13 -- Dirty Talk/Name-Calling
* 14 -- Rough Sex (Hair-Pulling, Spanking, Light Choking, etc.)
* 15 -- Public Sex
* 16 -- Creampie/Risk of Impregnation
* 17 -- Facial
* 18 -- Risk of Getting Caught (i.e. ""hold the moan"")
* 19 -- Uniform/Costume
* 20 -- Cheating
* 21 -- Player's Choice

Once eight unique hands are drawn, you will choose two kinks that you would like to include in the RP. You will also eliminate two other kinks that you would not like to include. The dealer will then choose two kinks of the remaining four.

The Dealer's Choice and Player's Choice can not be excluded.

*(To play: draw 2 cards from 1 shuffled deck. Make sure all cards except jokers are included. Repeat this eight times until complete.)*

Once the kinks are decided, you'll decide if you want to stay on the main casino floor or head over to The Den. *(While I will absolutely play with everyone, those choosing to go to The Den will get VIP status.)*

If you choose the main floor, you will head to our [roulette wheel](https://www.random.org/sequences/), where you'll help decide the character you'll be playing. The women listed on the wheel will be character models only (with one exception).

The list is as follows:

* 0 -- Player's Choice of Anyone on the List
* 1 -- You, because you're always #1 at DPP Casino!
* 2 -- Bella Thorne
* 3 -- Dove Cameron
* 4 -- Laurel Coppock
* 5 -- Alison Brie
* 6 -- Kendall Jenner
* 7 -- Candice Patton
* 8 -- Margot Robbie
* 9 -- Vanessa Hudgens
* 10 -- Scarlett Johansson
* 11 -- Taylor Swift
* 12 -- Miley Cyrus
* 13 -- Ariana Grande
* 14 -- Emma Stone
* 15 -- Milana Vayntrub
* 16 -- Nina Dobrev
* 17 -- Rihanna
* 18 -- Sarah Hyland
* 19 -- Lily Aldridge
* 20 -- Mila Kunis
* 21 -- Stella Maxwell
* 22 -- Dianna Agron
* 23 -- Chloe Grace Moretz
* 24 -- Katherine McNamara
* 25 -- Victoria Justice
* 26 -- Carrie Underwood
* 27 -- Jennifer Lawrence
* 28 -- Selena Gomez
* 29 -- Emilia Clarke
* 30 -- Emily Ratajkowski
* 31 -- Meghan Markle
* 32 -- Jourdan Dunn
* 33 -- Katy Perry
* 34 -- Aubrey Plaza
* 35 -- Nicole Beharie
* 36 -- Ariel Winter

You will spin the wheel six times (12 for two-female scenes and 18 for three-female scenes). You will then pick three characters (six for two-female scenes and nine for three-female scenes). The dealer will then choose the character he would like you to play (the Player's Choice may get excluded).

*(To play: Set the smallest value at 0 and the largest value at 36, and keep it in one column. Take the first 6/12/18 numbers in the list.)*

Finally, it's time to ""role"" the dice at the [craps table](https://www.random.org/dice/) and see just what you'll be playing. The roles are below:

* 2 -- Dealer's Choice
* 3 -- Coach's Daughter
* 4 -- Friend's Wife/Girlfriend
* 5 -- Student
* 6 -- Sister's/Daughter's Friend
* 7 -- Incest (Daughter, Sister, Cousin)
* 8 -- Friend's Sister/Daughter
* 9 -- Work Scenario (Secretary, Intern, Co-Worker, etc.)
* 10 -- Wife's/Girlfriend's Friend
* 11 -- Bully's/Bullying Victim's Sister
* 12 -- Player's Choice

*(If Celebrity is chosen, you will be playing the actual celebrity from the wheel instead of a lookalike. For 12, I am giving the option of playing either the bullying victim's sister or an interesting revenge plot with the bully's sister.)*

You will roll the dice four times. Of the four unique roles, you will then discard one. The dealer will discard one of the remaining three, and you will then choose one (or both, if possible) of the remaining two.

*(To play: simply roll two virtual dice. Repeat until four different roles are picked.)*

After that is done, we will have the RP with the characters, roles and kinks!

Now if you choose The Den?

Here's the list of characters for the roulette wheel:

* 0 -- Player's Choice of Anyone on the List
* 1 -- You, as a woman age 40+ (if you're not one already)
* 2 -- Rena Sofer
* 3 -- Nigella Lawson
* 4 -- Christie Brinkley
* 5 -- Eva Longoria
* 6 -- Rashida Jones
* 7 -- Jane Seymour
* 8 -- Elizabeth Hurley
* 9 -- Jennifer Lopez
* 10 -- Julianna Margulies
* 11 -- Patricia Heaton
* 12 -- Cheryl Hines
* 13 -- Jordan Ladd
* 14 -- Jennifer Aniston
* 15 -- Giada de Laurentiis
* 16 -- Julie Bowen
* 17 -- Alyson Hannigan
* 18 -- Gabrielle Union
* 19 -- Melinda Clarke
* 20 -- Jennifer Garner
* 21 -- Marcia Cross

* 30 -- Julianne Moore
* 31 -- Kim Cattrall
* 32 -- Ellen Barkin
* 33 -- Sharon Stone
* 34 -- Paula Patton
* 35 -- Mary Steenburgen
* 36 -- Courteney Cox

And here are the roles:

* 2 -- Dealer's Choice
* 3 -- Coach's Wife
* 4 -- Friend's Wife
* 5 -- Teacher/Principal
* 6 -- Mom's Friend
* 7 -- Incest (Mom, Aunt, Grandmother)
* 8 -- Friend's Mom
* 9 -- Work Scenario (Boss, Co-Worker, etc.)
* 10 -- Wife's Friend
* 11 -- Bully's/Bullying Victim's Mom
* 12 -- Dealer's Choice

That does it for our tour! We can't wait to play with you, and we know you'll have a good time; others have! 

If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. And from all of us at DPP Casino, have a winning day!"
54kwcr,0,2016-09-26,21F USA - &gt; Germany,clbewe,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/54kwcr/21f_usa_germany/,"Specifically, I'd like to be in Berlin.

I'll be graduating May 2017 with a BS in Finance, BS in Economics, BA in German, and an MBA with a concentration in Finance.  I'd like to move there around June 2017.  I'm only 21, so I don't have a whole lot of work experience.  The past two years, I've held an internship at a company in the travel industry where I've been able to work in or at least shadow many different departments, including finance, pricing, analysis, contract negotiation, and customer service.

I study German and spent a few months studying in Berlin.  My language skills are probably around a B2 level.  I'm working on it though (as I mention later, I'm dating a native speaker).

I'm coming out of college with some debt, all government loans (no private).  When I graduate, I'll probably have about ~$7000 saved up.

I am in a serious relationship with a German guy.  We probably don't want to get married immediately, though.  We've talked about it as a ""someday"" thing, though, and he's mentioned it in regard to being willing to marry sooner rather than later to help me be there with him.  I don't want to rush him though, or make it seem like we're just getting married so I can live there.

I really want to get out - to get to him, and to get out of here.  My family situation has always been a bit strained, and my father recently passed.  I figure there really isn't any time that's better, or that I'd rather, pick up and leave than right now.

Where do I begin?  Especially in terms of finding a job.  I know some of my classmates (mostly in more technical fields) are beginning to interview/get offers in jobs that won't start til next year.  I think I saw once that there were websites some universities subscribed to that provided help to students who wanted to work abroad.  Do these exist?  Otherwise, what job boards can I look at?  I don't want to be teaching English or nannying; I want to make use of my degrees and be over there for the long term.  Is there anything else I should be considering or looking into?

Thank you!"

I know Java fairly well (AP Comp Sci), C++ decently well (1 semester in college), and a touch of Python. I know basic concepts well, but I have basically no projects (other than a few from class) to show.

I recently exited an internship (at a community agency) because it became overwhelming (first expierence in field, large caseload, other changes in life, compounding forces of self-doubt and discouragement). I'm at a better place now but stating this simply may seem as though it was an easy decision.. it was not. Now I am currently in search of another internship but I feel lost as to where/what/who I want to work with. This is all happening around a time in my life where a lot of change is happening and simply put I'm fighting with myself to make through each day and make sure I make something out of each day. At the same time I feel incompetent in my ability to be a Master's level student counselor.. although everyone including faculty, supervisors, peers are telling me that I'm so much more than I believe in myself. 

I'm afraid of contacting the next site supervisor or director and having to go through the interview process and them seeing right through  me that I have more problems than I could probably help others. I'm also at a place where I don't want to take a break.. it's like I know I can do it. I want to be here to move forward in this career and I know I have a lot to offer, but I have this intense fear within me at the same time. I'd like to lay out the foundations of my fear but I'll wait on that. 

So questions for you all:
1. Can you relate?
2. How do you go about the interview process in keeping yourself in check?
3. Why did you choose that particular internship site?
4. Any questions for me?
5. And anything else that you think will help me get over myself, lol."

Lord Raglan, overall commander of the British forces, had intended to send the Light Brigade to pursue and harry a retreating Russian artillery battery, a task well-suited to light cavalry. However, due to miscommunication in the chain of command, the Light Brigade was instead sent on a frontal assault against a different artillery battery, one well-prepared with excellent fields of defensive fire.

An example of miscommunication and the potential devastating effects.

It's possible that there was a similar issue within the chain command of Clinton camp, leading to the miscommunication of her [""death""](http://i.imgur.com/08JOsQy.png).

On 9/11/2016 Hillary Clinton [lost her shoe](http://i.imgur.com/XI01ZoB.jpg), she also collapsed and had to be awkwardly tossed into her scooby-mobile. This was due to alleged pneumonia.

According to [ABC News](http://i.imgur.com/08JOsQy.png) Clinton ""died"" @ Montefiore Medical Hospital, which is 20.8 miles away, according to google maps.

So let's throw out some wikipedia definitions quickly before we type up a boring and unexciting paragraph;

&gt; Clinical death is the medical term for cessation of blood circulation and breathing, the two necessary criteria to sustain human and many other organisms' lives. It occurs when the heart stops beating in a regular rhythm, a condition called cardiac arrest. The term is also sometimes used in resuscitation research.

&gt; At the onset of clinical death, consciousness is lost within several seconds. Measurable brain activity stops within 20 to 40 seconds. Irregular gasping may occur during this early time period, and is sometimes mistaken by rescuers as a sign that CPR is not necessary. During clinical death, all tissues and organs in the body steadily accumulate a type of injury called ischemic injury.

*What is ischemic injury?*

&gt; Ischemia is a restriction in blood supply to tissues, causing a shortage of oxygen and glucose needed for cellular metabolism (to keep tissue alive). Ischemia is generally caused by problems with blood vessels, with resultant damage to or dysfunction of tissue. It also means local anemia in a given part of a body sometimes resulting from congestion (such as vasoconstriction, thrombosis or embolism). Ischemia comprises not only insufficiency of oxygen, but also reduced availability of nutrients and inadequate removal of metabolites.

Short paragraph time!

So basically, on 9/11 2016, Clinton lost her shoe, which is tragic in and of itself, no one wants to suffer the embarrassment of losing a shoe drunk, let alone sober; she also collapsed due to ""medical reasons"", allegedly pnemonia; however due to a **severe** miscommunication, ABC News reported on her [""death""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbbKoQX9wPo), this was likely due to her very problematic health issues she's experiencing, what actually happened was cardiac arrest, or *clinical death*, this may have resulted in ischemia if she actually did ""die"" and had to be resuscitated.

In short; one of Cronies Clinton's was delivering information, an ABC employee was having a coffee and told an intern to *""Go capture those cannons""* a la final charge of the light brigade, however instead of reporting on how she went into cardiac arrest in hospital, the new intern Bob somehow communicated she had actually *died* instead of communicating how she experienced a minor and *very ordinary* experience of clinical death, like our good friend [Mr Chow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH7Mu1PDjsw) from Hangover 2, who died temporarily.

54lsat,2,2016-09-26,"My [30F] LDR boyfriend [45M] doesn't know if he wants kids, marriage or to move.",Ldrthrowaway10111011,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/54lsat/my_30f_ldr_boyfriend_45m_doesnt_know_if_he_wants/,"My boyfriend and I have been together 8 years. We met playing World of Warcraft where he was our guild leader. We talked for around a year before we decide to meet. The sparks flew, I loved everything about him, every second together. I decided to make the 800 mile trip and move across the country to be with him. He also moved around 150 miles to be where his cousin lived. 

Before I moved across the country, he would tell me all the right things, how he wanted me to have his kids, how he would take care of me, seeing as he was 15 years older than I am. When I moved, things changed. He has a problem with p.e. and I understand it's frustrating. It's also frustrating for me. We dealt with it for 8 months, we me begging him to get help, I'd go with him, reassured him I loved him and wanted to be with him, but still no progress. It made me felt like since sex was so important to me, why couldn't we deal with it together? Ignoring it showed me he didn't really care. I would go out with friends more, and one night I came back with a hickey from the night before from one of my girlfriends. We were all drinking and having fun, even though I shouldn't have done it. Eventually it got so bad with me begging for him to get help that he moved out. After he moved out, and all the arguments, he finally did get help, however it requires us to use this special shot multiple times a week for months, and we can't do that long distance. 

I started cooking school during all this and he had an IT job. I was homesick because my mom has rheumatoid arthritis and her condition was getting worse. I finished my degree after a year living together and wanted to go back home to help take care of my mom full time. I thought he was coming with me. Boy was I wrong. My internship came and went after school, as I became my moms full time caregiver, having it be my sole job. I still take care of her to this day. 

He would come in once every month for 2-4 days to hang out. We talked every day and still played video games together. Flash forward and it's been 6 years since I moved back to Chicago. He goes back and forth about even wanting kids. 

A little backstory about him. He got married in his 20s because his girlfriend got pregnant. She was bipolar and schitzo and he married her to ""prove a point"" to his friends and family being against them in the first place. They were married 14 years and he lost custody of his kid. He paid child support and alimony for 5 years. He says he never wants to go through that again, but to me that's like saying I'll just divorce him like his ex wife did. 

So now here I sit crying all the time, waiting for him to decide what he wants. I have asked and said marriage has always been important to me, but I'm not getting any younger. I gave this man I love 8 years and I feel like he's happy the way things are. He gets to essentially be single for 27/30 days of the month and have no responsibilities. He comes in whenever he wants for good sex and cooking and video games. I think he could do this forever. I have cried and told him countless times about how it's hurting me so much just waiting. He says he isn't ready for marriage even after 8 years. He doesn't trust me enough because he doesn't want to pay child support or alimony ever again. It hurts when he says that because it feels like he thinks it's over before it even starts. He keeps telling me he wants to be with me, but it doesn't feel like it. 

Reddit what do I do? Do I just walk away? I don't want to give someone I love an ultimatum to marry me. I feel like you want to know if you want to marry someone after 8 years. Sorry if this post was all over the place. This is my first time posting on r/relationships. I just feel like I'm at a loss and need someone to talk to. Help me Reddit please, you are my only hope. Thank you for anyone that took the time to read this. I sincerely appreciate it. 

TL;DR my long distance boyfriend of 8 years doesn't know if he wants to marry me and have kids. I'm 30, he's 45 and we aren't getting any younger. "

54lw4i,1493,2016-09-26,The Perils of Live TV,iia,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/54lw4i/the_perils_of_live_tv/,"One of the biggest misconceptions about live television is that it’s actually live. Let me tell you a secret: nothing is live. Everything has a built-in delay, just in case something unexpected happens. It’s not so much out of concern for the viewers, but for the advertisers. The last thing Pampers wants to deal with is some British actor saying “cunt” on a talk show or an NFL quarterback getting paralyzed after a big hit. It’s bad for the brand.

I work for the Food Network. Over the last ten years, we’ve moved from basic cooking instruction to a more “reality TV” style; lots of competitions, celebrity cameos, that whole thing. Lots of people didn’t like the change, but we got a big uptick in the younger demographics as a result. 

One of the problems with capturing a younger demographic is holding onto them as they transition into an older one. Let’s say, for example, when we started with the reality TV shows, we got a viewer named Jenny. Jenny was 22 when she first saw Ace of Cakes and became a regular viewer of the network since then. She was fresh out of college, had few responsibilities, and was enjoying being a kid. 

Fast-forward nine years. Jenny’s 31 and a stay-at-home mom. Her priorities are far different than they were when she was 22. She has two children, and, on weekdays, she babysits her brother’s twins as well. Instead of eating out all the time like she did at 22, Jenny’s responsible for feeding a household. She doesn’t have time for reality shows anymore and she wishes her cable company offered the Cooking Channel - the sister station to the Food Network that offers more how-to programming. 

There are hundreds of thousands of Jennys across the country - first generation captures from the reality-TV era who yearn for more instructional programming. But it’s a balancing act. If the Food Network goes back to their original format, they lose the potential for new, younger viewers. If they stay with primarily reality-based programming, they lose all the Jennys out there. 

Our goal, and by “our,” I mean: me and my team at the network, was to create a show to bridge that gap. After the success of The Kitchen, a Saturday morning program featuring four of the network’s biggest stars as they cook exciting recipes and give tips and techniques, we were tasked to make something for the weekday morning viewers.

We ended up creating a show that featured two of the network’s top chefs, a live studio audience, and Q&amp;A from online viewers. It was going to be as interactive a show as we’d ever made, and the twist was, it would be “live.” Now, remember what I said about “live” TV. Sure, the audience would be there watching the chefs cook and asking them questions while they did, but the online questions would be from emails. The delay would be 30 minutes.

It was a huge success in the various test markets. We had one show to go with the stand-in chefs before the show went national, this time in Oklahoma, but there was a problem. There had been a tornado warning in the county. It had since expired, but the audience was about half of what it should’ve been. We decided to go with it anyway, since we figured a lot of the at-home audience would still be inside after the storms. They’d be watching.

Right away, there were technical issues. Even though the tornado warning had passed, there were still frequent lightning strikes and other atmospheric disturbances all around the station. Things still went on, however, and the chefs started cooking. 

The first problem came when the cream wouldn’t whip. The chef made a show out of it, poking fun at the behind-the-scenes staff and trying it again with a new container of cream. Again, nothing. In my ear, one of the producers said it might have been because of the storm. He didn’t sound like he knew what he was talking about.

The chefs gave up on the whipped cream and decided to make a creme anglaise. Those require eggs. Two eggs were cracked into the mixing bowl without incident. The third, though, was bad. It was blood-red, clumpy, and smelled terrible. The odor permeated the studio quickly and I saw the audience members holding their noses. When I held my own, my fingers came back bloody. I hadn’t had a nosebleed since I was a kid. We cut to a commercial.

Neither chef was happy. They agreed to scrap the whole “dessert first” idea and just go directly to the entree. No one would complain about the basic steak-and-potatoes main course, especially in cow country. The kitchen was reset and the show resumed.

The downward spiral continued. As thunder boomed outside, loud enough to be picked up by studio microphones, the mixer for the potatoes started to smoke and emit sparks before the chef yanked the plug out of the wall and threw the whole thing in the sink. “Just goes to show you guys, disasters can happen in any kitchen,” he joked to the audience, still obviously irritated but trying to play it cool.

Potatoes got mixed and mashed by hand and the chefs fielded questions about whether or not milk or cream should be used. There was another thunderclap and the studio lights flickered. I’ve always hated working in these satellite studios - compared to the main studios in New York, these were like living in the dark ages.

The lights stayed on, thankfully, and the half-hour delay caught up to the beginning of the show. All over Oklahoma, people watching the Food Network were about to see the show for the first time. 

Problems aside, the potatoes came out great. During a commercial, I had an intern get me a spoonful. I should’ve had him get me a bowl. Didn’t matter - after the broadcast, I’d be able to eat all I wanted. 

The studio audience, to their credit, had taken all the technical problems in stride. I hoped the TV audience would do the same, and figured they would, as long as they didn’t turn the TV off in disgust at the sight of that egg.

The chefs moved on to the steak. Each discussed their favorite techniques; one preferring a sous-vide style followed by a blast in a hot pan, while the other advocated grilling it over hardwood charcoal. Both methods would be used and the lucky studio audience would get samples to taste and choose their favorite cooking method.

The cast-iron pan was hot and the grill, despite the powerful fans sucking away the smoke, filled the studio with the savory aroma of burning hardwood. I was starving. 

Chef Bob cooked his steak first, then showed the audience the perfect edge-to-edge pinkness that only a sous-vide cooked steak can achieve. The crust on the outside was magnificent. Maillard would have been proud. Wind battered the studio walls and more thunder rolled by. The power went out.

Everyone in the studio groaned, but not as loud as the executive producer. We were in a time slot. Even with the delay, which we could shorten if we had to, there was a hard out a the top of the hour when Chopped! was scheduled to air. The last thing we wanted was to have the show just cut off entirely. If the power didn’t come back on before the delay was used up, it’d look awful. Plus, we’d have to issue refunds to the local advertisers who’d purchased that time.

We waited. And waited. And waited. We had less than a minute of delay left before the power went back on. The whole team was galvanized into action and, with only one second of delay left, we resumed filming. 

For the first time in about 20 years, the broadcast was fully live. I thanked God we weren’t in front of a national audience, because if someone screwed up and said a bad word, the FCC fines we’d have to deal with would be crippling.

More thunder rumbled outside as the chef talked about how sous-vide was a nice novelty, but almost everyone, in reality, preferred a grilled steak. He seasoned as he talked, obviously comfortable with the cameras and the audience who hung on every word. The grill, which had to be refilled with more charcoal to bring it back up to temperature after the delay, was screaming hot again. The chef used his laser thermometer to take the temperature of the coals. 733 degrees. Perfect for the initial sear.

Another clap of thunder and the lights flickered again. I felt my stomach leap with panic, but the lights stayed on. We only had 11 minutes left before Chopped! came on.

With the seasoning complete and the audience dying to see the steak get cooked, the chef picked up the rib eye with his tongs and carefully placed it on the searing grill.

The other chef began to scream. Everyone, including the production crew, jumped. With expertise honed by years in television, the camera operators instinctively turned the cameras toward the screaming man. 31 studio audience members and 14,000 households across Oklahoma watched as the chef’s skin blistered and charred. 

“What the fuck is going on?,” the executive producer shouted, his voice clearly audible over the screams of pain and panic. Before the cameras could pan away, the chef’s eyes burst in an explosion of boiling lachrymal fluid and blood. The skin on his nose, forehead, and cheeks bubbled and blackened.

As EMTs rushed toward the man, one of them knocked over a carton of eggs and sent the contents splattering across the floor. Behind me, with a sound I will never forget for as long as I live, Dave, the sound engineer, crumpled to the floor with his body in knots of hideously broken bones; his skull caved in and leaking brain matter onto my shoes.

The loudest thunderclap yet drowned out even the panicked shouting and screams of pain. And that was it. When all was said and done - whatever it was that had been said and done - Dave was dead. The chef was dead. The cameras had never stopped rolling. Not until Chopped! came on.

The Food Network settled lawsuits for the better part of a year. Needless to say, our show wasn’t picked up. No one could ever figure out what had happened, but the funerals I attended and the trauma endured by the audiences, both studio and remote, are proof enough that I didn’t imagine it. If you know anyone in Oklahoma who was watching the Food Network on April 11th, 2015 between 10 and 11am, ask them what they saw. They’ll tell you. I’ll bet they haven’t watched a single live broadcast of anything ever since.

And yes, the network got an FCC fine from the producer saying “fuck” on air. They were okay with the burning skin, for some reason.

I could use a bit of advice. I spent ~7 years at my University working towards two degrees; Electrical Engineering and Physics. During which I had multiple internships within the space/defense industry. Worked at two great companies after University before landing my dream job at a top Space &amp; Defense company.

This is what I've always wanted. I've worked my ass off to get to this place in life and now that I'm working at what is supposed to be my ""dream career"", I want out.
Everything is so shiny and interesting when you're in college but once you get into the workforce, it dulls.....real quick. 

I love creating. Anything from clothing and bags, to amphibious robots and quad copters. That's what inspired me to become an Engineer; the idea that I could spend the rest of my life creating. Now I'm in the field I love, creating and implementing the ideas someone else loves.

Maybe it's my fault. I chose a career where there really isn't as much innovation as you would imagine. Most of what we work on has been around for decades. We're just innovative in the way we apply it.

I'm ready to leave my dream career.
I have a few ideas I want to work on, and a group of friends that are in a similar situation.

I want to know if anyone else (i'm sure there are many) has been in this situation and made the leap.
What struggles did you go through? Did you miss that job security? At any point did you try and run back? Did you succeed and find what you loved?"

A bit about myself, which may or may not be relevant to critiquing:  I'm 32.  Just finished my second BA degree this past spring, in Computer Science.  I finished it in 3 years with a 3.3+ GPA.  

After my first degree in Psychology, I had an internship assisting a Human Resources department with administration, and continued my part-time job at Starbucks as a Supervisor.  Then I decided to spend two years teaching English in South Korea.  Upon returning I finished my other degree in CS, as mentioned above.

I'm a bit self-conscious about what I've included as work history since it's not very relevant to computer science, aside for the internship done last summer.  On the other hand, I can't just have a blank resume.

To explain why I put ""ASAP"" in the title: on a whim my parents, whom I live with currently, have suddenly decided to move to Ecuador within the next 2-3 months, which is much sooner than I was expecting.  I can't exactly afford to stay in NJ without a job.  

Needless to say, I'm having a minor panic attack at this prospect as I feel like moving to South America directly after graduating (and not getting a first job in the field) is a bad move.  I don't want to get pigeon-holed into teaching English again; I want to get established in a CS position in the States.  Even the most basic Comp Sci job, say, Help Desk would be acceptable.

i moved to another country because of a job opportunity, it was an paid internship and i got a lot of positiv feedback, and i still work there after my internship ended. 
my work includes caring for others, because its in the social sector. and this is ironic. i cant care for myself, but i am good in taking care for others. i did my job with responsibility and i feeling joy while doing it. 
job wise, i see a future, a path in front of me, i just need to walk it down. i could start universitie next year, but what is it worth?
i am lonely. 
i barley eat.
i sleep long.
my room looks fuckin disgusting.

currently i have three weeks holidays, and i am unmotivated. all i do is reading, play some guitar and most of the time i smoke and think about life and the world. and this makes me fuckin depressed. 
i wish there was a person out there, who could hug me, and say: everything is gonna be alright. just come with me, walk with me, lets sing and dance. i am desperate for a person in my life, who sees me as a whole, who can understand me, even if i dont. 

but people see me as a strong person. its like if i have mask on, and underneath is a depressed maniac, who would be bad influence on people. i feel like i am a bad person. i exploit people, it looks like i am caring, but in fact, i dont give a fuck, i am selfish and just look out for myself. and i know it, and i feel it, and it makes me sick. 
sometimes i have the egoistic thought of just jumping down the bridge. it would be so much easier just to sleep forever. who wants to get old anyway??
i am afraid of sharing my depression. i dont wanna be a burden on others. also i dont wanna have the feeling, they just hang out because they are afraid i would kill myself. 

i am this happy person for them for a reason. maybe i start believing it myself, and become this person after all. but my hope fades, and i all i can think of: when will this darkness end, and how??
whats the point in going forward? i could end it, right now. maybe i didnt gave up yet, and maybe i never will, but...


i know, i need help. professional help. but i dont have insurance in the moment, and treatment is some weeks/months away, so i have to wait for it anyway. but i am looking forward to it.
also i write a lot in my diary, and refelct about my thoughts and i know i should clean my room. i know i should smoke less cigaretts and eat more frequently. but it is just so damn hard in the moment, when you feel so lonely and lost in this world :(

thanks for reading, i dont know if it makes any sense, i just wrote whats up in my head.

54n5mg,1,2016-09-26,[Ombuds] Tracking Election Coverage: September 11-24,s3thcom,nprstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/nprstories/comments/54n5mg/ombuds_tracking_election_coverage_september_1124/,"Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton waves as she walks from her daughter's apartment building Sept. 11, 2016, in New York. Clinton unexpectedly left the 9/11 anniversary ceremony. Her campaign later announced she had been diagnosed with pneumonia.

Craig Ruttle/APMy office is tracking NPR's candidate coverage, online and on its morning and evening newsmagazines, in response to requests from listeners. From Sept. 11 through Sept. 24, there were 42 stories focused primarily on Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, compared with 34 stories focused mostly on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson was the main focus of [one story](http://ift.tt/2cyrl8H) during that period. Another 65 stories — or almost half of NPR's campaign coverage — looked at more than one candidate, or general election issues.

Clinton's pneumonia disclosure was the highlight of the first week of this tracking period, accounting for more than half of NPR's coverage of the candidate during the week. It was the first week (excluding convention coverage) since mid-June, when this office began tracking the newsroom's election reporting, that Clinton received more individualized coverage than her Republican opponent.

The tracking period also included an interview with [Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Kaine](http://ift.tt/2cO7kys) and an interview with [former President Bill Clinton](http://ift.tt/2cy8AB7). (Neither Trump nor his running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, has yet granted NPR an interview.)

My office continues to hear from listeners about the perceived tone of the stories about both candidates, and the amount of time devoted to each of them. Linda Katz of Philadelphia, Pa., wrote with a specific concern about the amount of time afforded to covering Trump in NPR's newscasts. My office is not tracking the newscasts, but Mark Memmott, NPR's standards editor, did examine the week from Sept. 11 to Sept. 17 (the week of Clinton's pneumonia disclosure).

He found that the newscast coverage was fairly even. Of about 220 newscasts in that period, 53 contained a story about Clinton and not Trump, and 51 contained a story about Trump and not Clinton. A Clinton-centric story preceded a Trump-centric story in 49 of the newscasts, while a Trump-centric story preceded a Clinton-centric story in 44 newscasts. In 22 newscasts, a story about both candidates was either the only campaign story or preceded another about one of them.

Expressions of concern about the lack of coverage of the third-party candidates continue to come in. In addition to the single Johnson-focused piece — which ran in the week before the Debate Commission announced that he and Green Party candidate Jill Stein [had not qualified for the debates](http://ift.tt/2cFrV2P) — the two candidates were mentioned a few times in general election coverage. Independent conservative candidate Evan McMullin was mentioned in [one general election article](http://ift.tt/2df2VE5).

Mick Hannaway of Pasadena, Calif., wrote: ""This is getting unbearable! Stop focusing on 2 presidential candidates. Gary Johnson and Jill Stein are running too. ... When there is an 'issues story', I'm begging you please to put the Libertarian and Green Party candidate into the issue.""

Listeners and readers who have been asking for more issues-focused pieces were well served last week, thanks, in part, to the latest series of _A Nation Engaged_reports.

To single out a few, there were stories about [Trump's tax plan](http://ift.tt/2cKObvz), and the candidates' differing views on [homegrown terrorism](http://ift.tt/2d4z68o), [combating rising crime rates](http://ift.tt/2cJtC2O) (also [here](http://ift.tt/2cnW5Y5)), boosting [American economic mobility](http://ift.tt/2duEFLk) (also [here](http://ift.tt/2d4z1kZ) and [here](http://ift.tt/2cY2NpY)) and [energy policy](http://ift.tt/2d4y8ZU).

The previous week also included four platform pieces, looking at how the candidates approach the [Afghan War](http://ift.tt/2cUMA7A), [taxes](http://ift.tt/2cXS01s), [helping veterans](http://ift.tt/2duFtQu) and [family policies](http://ift.tt/2d4A8ky).

Finally, I'd call attention to this [guide to tonight's debate](http://ift.tt/2doXv6U) that tackled the issues in depth. And for those who are looking for real-time debate fact checking, NPR is planning something new online. Several NPR correspondents will be annotating a transcript of the debate as it happens at NPR.org. More details on NPR's debate plans can be found in this [press release](http://ift.tt/2d4yGi7).

I'm a 24 yo Master's Degree student in Electrical Engineering. Did a lot of signals and machine learning applications (MATLAB dominated, so yeah... no bueno)

Thinking ahead about jobs, I realized that for the jobs I wanted, I really needed more legit software experience. I've done lots of Python and MATLAB stuff for my own ends both in and out of my degree, but didn't seriously use anything else or do anything in any real workflow. I realize I should probably have addressed this earlier, but better late than never.

I figured that my next move is to take an internship to gain experience. The only thing I'm worried about is the fact that I might be perceived as too deep in EE with a Master's to be considered for internships where I'm going to be competing with sophomore-senior undergrads, even though I'm not that far removed from them in terms of age. I also feel insecure because I simply don't have the background CS students have and may not be able to answer questions as well (data structures, algorithms... didn't get any of that since the EE curriculum). However, I do have over a year's worth of internship experience (EE related) plus my research experience for my degree, so at least I have that. I'm also running through lots of coding exercises.

In short, is the fact that I'm competing with a bunch of students in a different phase of life going to hurt in my search for an internship? Are companies gonna say ""wtf is a guy with a Master's doing looking for an internship""?

This field being one of the main reasons I became a CS major, I'm really hoping to land a summer internship with the company. Java is also my main language and the company is located pretty close to my house, so getting this internship would be pretty amazing for me.

That being said, the recruiter really just took my resume and said they will review it and get back to me. What is a good way of following up with the company and make sure I express my interest? From my experience, most of the times I give my resume without filling out a formal application in these fairs, I usually dont ever hear back. Any advice on how to follow up with this?"

Katheyn or what she preferred to be called Katy was the new intern at the company. A big industry in downtown Los Angeles that dealt with many movie, tv and rock stars. Basically, offering rich and famous people services to handle their careers while also giving fresh faced wannabes the opportunities.

Katy was one of them, a young girl that wasn't even 21 yet dreams of making it in music, becoming a world known star. She had tried numerous times and had many meetings with companies to try and get her talent across to no avail. Eventually the money she saved up from her part time job while she was in school dried up and she had to pick up a job in L.A she she thought why not a business in a similar field to her dreams.

Katy remembered when she walked into the office for the first time, people couldn't believe what she looked like and you think they would be accustomed to seeing gorgeous people all the time. She had worn a pair of red 6 inch stilettos and a tiny pencil skirt that would of been the shortest a woman could wear. Thigh high stockings that hugged tight to her legs that were held up by clasps attached to a garter belt. The tight blouse she wore strained her rather biggest assets, her double DD breasts that were pushed up in her black bra. They bounced around as she worked around the office, attracting the attention of many guys. The man Katy worked for was always delighted to see her, his eyes filling up with lust as he looked her body over before leading her into his office and shutting the door.

Katy regularly wore clothes that brung her attention, it was always another pair of 6 inch heels, short skirts and stockings accompanied by a tight low cut blouse. Guys around the office started to talk about Katy, about how they would love to ram her as she bent over their desk. Many guys often tried to get with her but she always refused.

Soon Katy developed a reputation for being a strong feminist supporter. She thought that all men were pigs for treating women as nothing more than a pair of tits and ass with a pretty face. That's how Katy felt in meetings, guys would get sidetracked around her and just stare at her boobs or ass. They wouldn't take her seriously and thought that she was just a slut. She thought that guys only chatted to her because they wanted to fuck her and weren't even calling her by name around the office, she overheard them calling her by her big tits.

Though what Katy did, didn't always match up with what she said. She would scold men for staring at her body when she wore revealing clothing everyday. She would also find every excuse to bend over to give everyone a good look at her, regularly dropping things on the ground. She would get angry at guys all the time for flirting with her as they obviously wanted to fuck her but she would flirt with guys all the time brushing her hand near their groin and giving them a sexy, sultry look as she walked away.

One day the CEO came to the office and went to a meeting room with about 30 other businessmen. They were all aged between 50-80 years old. After about an hour, Katy was called into the meeting room. Jason, a fellow coworker had a desk right in front of the room, he watched her strut in their, clad in her tight clothes. She closed the door behind her. It must of been 4 hours until the doors opened again, with the old guys walking out with satisfied looks on their faces. They talked about how great that was and how they must do it again soon. Out Katy stepped as they finally all left. Her hair was disheveled while she was fixing her rumpled blouse and rolling down her skirt while carrying her stilettos. As she walked she pulled out a curly hair from her mouth and wiped away a bit of stickiness from her lips. Going to her desk and continuing work like nothing happened.

-----------------

I want this role play to involve scenarios following the womens career such as trying to break into the industry (a lot of time spent as the secretary), dealing with the sudden fame, hook ups with celebrities, sex tapes, paparazzi, fans, relationships, becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol and turning into a nymphomaniac.

The prompt above doesn't have to be the start or involved in it... just an example of some writing.

Can be different and have a male celebrity and their journey. (Check out my 'Famous Life' posting in my post history for that)

I want to play the males the celeb will encounter. I want someone to play the main lead which will be the young female starlet. I would love for the young starlet to be Katy Perry or Kylie Jenner but I like a lot of other celebs as well such as Taylor Swift, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande, Megan Fox, Margot Robbie, Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Alba. Though.. the female celebrity can be an original character that is made up would love her to look like Madison Ivy or Lana Rhoades though also into Lindsey Pelas, Emily Sears and Claudia Alende.

I prefer to roleplay on Google Docs and use messengers to chat and set things up such as K , skype, yahoo msger and google chat/hangouts. Want this to be a long term rp

If you are interested and wish to talk about this further send me a message. Please make your message to me detailed and include any character/ scenario ideas, which celebrities you like and what platforms you use.

P.S Also have a recent posting in which I mention all the rp's and things I'm interested in for a long term rp, so check that out if you want, particularly interested in doing a Marvel Black Widow RP or a Post apocalyptic/dystopia world that is similar to Fallout or a Bioshock rp.

54nvcq,1,2016-09-26,Looking to secure a business analyst position after I graduate. What should I start doing now?,valuemachine,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/54nvcq/looking_to_secure_a_business_analyst_position/,"Hey everyone, I'm looking to work as a business analyst (I know, broad term) when I get out of school because it encompasses what I want out of a job and my interests. I like the balance of working with people while being able to find technology solutions to business problems.

My situation: I'm a MGMT Information Systems (MIS) major at a top 25 business school in my Senior year. I just switched to this major and started taking the classes last semester after completing pretty much all of my required core classes in business and liberal arts. I ended up taking 3 finance classes and realized I didn't want to work in that field so I switched to MIS and I'm enjoying the classes a lot more.

Problem is, I never took the initiative to get an internship or any real world experience partly due to being unsure of what I even wanted to do at the time. I have gathered some skills along the way, but nothing amazing. I have basic proficiency in Java, HTML/CSS, Javascript and C++ so I know how coding works. I actually wanted to be a web developer at one point but realized I would hate punching in code all day without any human interaction. I'm also working on my SQL skills (I find SQL extremely fun to use so far, don't ask me why) and taking a databases class at the moment. I could also see myself working with databases as a DB admin so that's a possibility as well. I just don't have amazing skills yet. I'm also taking a business analysis class and learning about different data visualization tools and how to use them. I like the idea of working with data as well.

My question for you guys is, should I try to get an internship 20hrs/week if I'm taking 5 major classes at once or would that be too much do you think? I'm afraid of graduating with no experience and frankly I have a lot of free time right now despite taking all these classes.

What types of internships should I be looking for and where can I find them? I'm kind of a newbie when it comes to finding jobs and networking. All I have on my resume are part time jobs. What else should I put on there? I can do basic stuff like host Wordpress websites and can figure out most things involving computers. I put up a basic Wordpress site with a theme for a family friend. Should I mention something like this? What should I be doing in the meantime to sharpen my marketability in the eyes of employers? I just feel very behind and don't know where to start, as the career services at my school has a heavy focus on finance/accounting people but leaves MIS majors in the dust IMO.

Would love to hear from current/former business analysts or anyone with MIS degrees. Thanks a bunch!"

I do have work experience but they're not related so much to business. Although internships and job opportunities would be nice, I believe that I'm unqualified for most of them as I don't have any background in business, which is why I'd like to start with volunteering. I've tried applying for jobs such as bank tellers but I've had no success, which is why I'm here. In the future I would like to be doing accounting as my main job if that helps.

Does anyone know any good places where I can start at that gives training for those who don't have any business background? I live in Richmond so the lower mainland would be convenient for me."
54o0hz,57,2016-09-26,Business major CEO snapped at me after I found a bug in the application. Should I leave this startup?,cheeekyslug,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/54o0hz/business_major_ceo_snapped_at_me_after_i_found_a/,"I've been working with a 1 year old start up. Today, I brought up the fact that the app they're using to code has bugs in it, and despite the fact I probably wouldn't be able to fix it, I know there is a bug in it since the app restarts on it's own.

This is a $1k, 3-month coding camp for children ages 7 - 11, with about 20 kids registered in the class. I am not paid for any work. The CEO profits from everything because the computers are all funded by the school. 

Basically the CEO snapped at me, told me that there's nothing wrong with the app. Later tonight he told me he needs to ""talk"" to me. Mind you he's a *incomplete* business major, not a CS major with little CS experience besides college. He treats me disrespectfully and never formally trained me to be an intern and is quite unprofessional. 

I've been a month into this start-up and I don't think I can take it any longer. But it is also my first CS/CE related internship so I'm a bit conflicted if I should walk or not. I do kinda feel shitty that I wasted a month with this, so I'm thinking about staying at least to say I was there for 3 months. 

What would be the smartest move?  

UPDATE: Called the labor office, highly advised that I should file a claim. Will be talking to the CEO later today, will tell him that this was not the right fit and that I am not learning anything from this company. Will make updates if anything changes! 

UPDATE 2: CEO canceled are morning ""talk"" in which we planned out yesterday. I emailed him a resignation stating that this position wasn't for me and that I did not feel like I was learning anything / utilizing past experience or knowledge to benefit from the company. Told him, thank you for your time. "
54o4om,1,2016-09-26,A Waste,j_ellie,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/54o4om/a_waste/,"I'm in my junior year of college, and ever since the summer time I've started to feel like an absolute waste of space. There isn't anything I'm particularly good at, or passionate about, which is making my college career seem more and more like wasted time, especially since the only thing I am remotely interested in is Theatre (which is not only an incredibly difficult field to break into, but I don't believe I'm talented enough to do anything with it). 

I feel like the weight of what is expected of me is too much even though it isn't. Out of our entire family, mine is the wealthiest. My dad started his own business that my mom helps with and I've had a very privileged life, so I know that the expectations of me are very high (which is worse because my cousin is a successful lawyer who just got married and had her first baby). I feel like I'm letting my parents down if their only child doesn't do something with her life. But I've been spoiled by my parents and have never had to work, so now that the time has come for me to begin looking at internships I have no idea where to start. I have no references. I have no prior employment. I'm the worst candidate for a job or internship I've ever seen.

I have a wonderful and incredible boyfriend of two years who I know I won't be marrying. He's intelligent and driven and I know if we don't break up before the end of college, I'll be what's holding him back from achieving his dreams. The amount of things I would give up in order to keep him is ridiculous, which is why I know the relationship isn't exactly healthy and can't survive out in the ""real world"". Although I realize that I'm young and I'll meet many more people in my life, the thought of losing him right now is unbearable.

I have one close friend who has been with me since high school and she's recently been going through struggles of her own, so I always try to be her support and motivator. Even though I know I could talk to her, I don't want to burden her with the way I'm feeling because her problems are infinitely worse than mine. Ever since my close friend has snagged a boyfriend of her own I see less and less of her, which has started to make me feel more and more alone.

Sometimes I really wish a large radiation event would go off in our galaxy and destroy the earth in the blink of an eye just so I wouldn't have to wake up the next day and continue on. I don't know how people look at 60+ more years of life and don't wish for it to be over sooner rather than later. I don't know what to do when the weight of existing feels like it's too much."

I've been working part time at various places that are not related to software development at all, as a result of this I've saved up a good chunk of money. Originally my plan was to take half a year to a year traveling with my girlfriend of 6 years with my savings. Unfortunately those plans fell through due to family problems that I don't want to go into full detail, but basically after I graduate I have to take care of my mom and sister financially. My mom currently does not work due to medical issues and my sister is currently a sophmore in high school.

I know that people have already been applying for post grad jobs, and I am worried I won't secure one since I have not done anything yet, even more so since I am graduating in March. Is it already too late to start applying for jobs? I also have a really bad GPA (2.4 - 2.5) and no relevant internships. I have a few projects from my CS classes to put on my resume, but that's really it when it comes to showing off coding skills. What can I do from now to March that can help me secure a good job after graduation? My family is from the bay area, so the job would preferably be there, but I am afraid that it is very competitive in Silicon Valley. I have just purchased Cracking the Coding Interview after searching around here, and I'll be going through it during my free time. Should I also try to come up with any personal projects? My course load is not that bad since I am taking a networks class, combinatorics, and two GE's that shouldn't take up that much time.

Is there much hope in securing a cs-related job in March with my bad resume and lack of experience? I really don't want to continue working at these part-time jobs if I have to take care of 2 more people."

You would probably think I had a bright career waiting for me, considering I graduated with a 3.8 GPA and two previous internships. Unsurprisingly I had no trouble securing good offers and ended up starting my first job at a well-known software company... and ended up getting fired after 4 months for performance issues. After spending six weeks job searching, I found a new job at a startup with a 15k pay cut (102k to 87k)... and got fired again last Friday after two months for different reasons.


It has been less than a year since I graduated and now I have to look for my third job. I don't even know if I want to put this startup on my resume since two short stints make me look super bad to potential employers, but the 3-month employment gap might be worse. I honestly don't know why I keep getting fired. The first company said my code wasn't good enough and this startup said I'm doing an amazing job (ironic because they fired me for being constantly &lt;1 min late). 


Some advice for my situation would be great appreciated. I want to grow my career and be able to stay at a company long term. Constantly bouncing between multiple short stints isn't good, and as time passes since graduation I'm already starting to have an increasingly hard time securing new employment. Please help!"

54oyyk,2,2016-09-27,Confusion on Side Projects,unknownchicken,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/54oyyk/confusion_on_side_projects/,"Hello,

In this subreddit you often see that people put a pretty big emphasis on the having side projects in order to earn positions at internships. I am currently a 2nd year Computer Science &amp; Engineering student, and I am just kind of stumped on this ideal. I don't know what exactly I should be looking at when I try to create a side project. Is one language ideal over another? Does it have to be an actual application? I have only learned to compile and run files through Linux/Ubuntu in my year of Computer Science classes learning the basics of C and more in-depth with C++. In that situation, I don't really have a clue on how to make an actual application to show off to recruiters or what kind of project would actually be considered good enough to show off. Any help or suggestions would be appreciated...

Thanks."
54pebk,1,2016-09-27,I have a newly acquired chronic health condition: what are some options to consider now that my life has been altered due to a disability?,Shakkabuku,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/54pebk/i_have_a_newly_acquired_chronic_health_condition/,"Tl;dr I have many degrees, but they only qualify me for low-paying jobs, and now a chronic health condition is further limiting some of my career options.

I'm in the US, and I have an assortment of degrees and nearly finished degrees. My bachelor's is in speech-language pathology (cannot practice at the bachelor's level), my Master's in applied linguistics, and I also have a graduate certificate in educational technology/instructional design. I'm also done with everything but my final internship in another masters in counseling psychology, and I'm ABD (just that pesky dissertation left) to finish a PhD in psycholinguistics. Halfway through my PhD I realized my department wasn't giving me the training I'd need to be competitive, so I used my PhD funding (teaching jobs) to concurrently do a practical program (counseling) while I finished my PhD courses and dissertation.

I was actually doing quite well with keeping up with both of these, and I was on time to graduate from both at the same time, along with selling and publishing a science fiction novel. Then I had an acquired spine condition from being a passenger in a really bad spine accident, and ended up needing neurosurgery. Since the surgery (7 months ago), nothing has gone well. I have constant migraines from the tension in my neck, and continuing myelopathy/neuropathy/radiculopathy from the surgery. I've had almost every spine injection and outpatient surgical procedure, including radiofrequency ablation done through most of my c-spine. Still, nothing works, and I'm just in constant pain. Several specialists have told me this might just be how I'm stuck permanently, which is extremely sad.

Along with that, I'm now way behind on finishing both of my degrees. It's just not going to happen this semester, and I'm out of my funding period. I just have to beg for jobs and hope my PhD department takes sympathy on me.
So I'm not sure what to do. I don't know if I can or should finish either of my current degrees, and I don't know how functional I'd be trying to get a regular job--and all the job options are low-paying, since I'm drawn to helping or artsy careers. Another factor is that even when I'm not sick, I have a delayed sleep phase, and morning work is difficult for me. I do it, but it just slowly makes me sick because I don't get enough sleep, and none of my previous jobs/degrees are really suitable for night shift work. I was a veterinary technician for many years prior to this, and worked a night shift easily, but techs make almost no money, and it's a very physically demanding job.

Any advice about what to do? I wish I'd been able to do a clinical psychology program because they make so much more money, but I don't know if I have another five years of grad school in me.

Another *probably* bad idea I've been noodling with is getting an MFA in Creative Writing. I'm already published, but you make basically nothing in that industry as well. Since I already have a TESOL credential/years of experience teaching ESL, if I had an MFA I'd hopefully be attractive to English departments or programs. I know it's very hard to find a job teaching creative writing job full-time, but sometimes it's easier if you can teach one or two creative writing classes and fill in the rest with the always-needed ESL and basic writing courses. Writing is my true passion (and if you asked if I could do anything for a living, I'd say writing, if money weren't a factor).

Big rambling post, but if anyone has any thoughts or ideas I haven't considered yet, I would really appreciate it. I'm open to pretty much anything. Thank you.

Edit: the fixation with salary isn't because I'm money-hungry so much as I'm now drowning in medical bills, and that's probably something that won't ever stop. Unless I want to live under a bridge somewhere, a low-paying not for profit job or something of that nature isn't going to work anymore :/ "

54pokr,3,2016-09-27,Not sure where to go from here,FlowBiggerThanFatJoe,findapath,https://www.reddit.com/r/findapath/comments/54pokr/not_sure_where_to_go_from_here/,"Im 28. Basically I spent a few years volunteering off the mainland. Moved to New York last year with a Bachelor's in Broadcast Communications but can't seem to get a stable position. I've revamped my resume and while I do get calls, every interview I've had comes back with ""we went with someone who better suites our needs and has more experience."" my problem is I don't have a lot of experience in my field. My previous jobs are kind of all scattered.  

In college I wanted to move towards editing film- I took a lot of classes for it in college but it has been so long and I can't afford my own camera or equipment to do it freelance. I only have 2 videos I have done on my own and old college film that hasnt been moved to a USB. Also I feel like at my age the younger generation are a lot more technically inclined, I haven't kept up with it.

I did volunteer for non profits and I really enjoy helping other people. I thought maybe I could even shoot some film for an organization after landing a job with them. I haven't landed a non profit job either.

I did get various temp jobs, that lead to very high stress for me with the ""not knowing when i'll get another call or my next gig."" I was only doing it really to get me started here but it never led to any full-time positions. especially since I learned the company has to pay out to the agency if they want to hire you... or so I was told.

So im stuck. Applying for jobs constantly and getting turned down. Entry level positions I apply for want more experience but I can't afford to do an internship at my age and try to make ends meet with another job. 

I'm just ready to throw in the towel and give up. I did get accepted on shiftgig so I'll be able to bring in some income but I wan't someone to give me a chance in my field of interest. It's just not happening for me.

Any advice on interviews, standing out more, or how to land an entry level position I want would be greatly appreciated.

54pucq,594,2016-09-27,"I think my sister was attempting to hit on my then boyfriend, but it was just weird.",thrwawaytimee,fatpeoplestories,https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/54pucq/i_think_my_sister_was_attempting_to_hit_on_my/,"When I first started dating my husband, C, he used to be really hot. He was working out 2-3h/day, so yes, he had a fantastic body in addition to a gorgeous face. Before this incident happened, I didn't know that my sister gets extremely, extremely cringe-y with men she found attractive. How cringe-y? Well, let's begin....

So when this happened, C and I were still in a complicated part of our relationship. I can't remember if we've made it exclusive yet at this point, but I remember it was at that stage were I didn't want to be open with our relationship yet. C was giving major player vibes, and I wasn't sure I was ready to commit even though he kept insisting he was completely committed to me. At this time, I was still trying to get closer to my sister, so I decided to tell her about C. Thought it'll help us bond or something...no idea what I was thinking. 

I told her that C and I met through mutual friends (didn't trust her enough to tell her about okcupid), and that was it. 

Anyway, we met up for drinks, and the first thing he said to her was, ""Hey, great to see you again! Remember me?""

Yes, C is a year younger than me, and used to be my sister's classmates. Loads of, ""OHMYGAWWWDDD!!!!"" from my sister, because she loves being loud and drawing a lot of attention to herself.

Turns out, in the presence of men she found attractive, my sister gets extra loud and extra attention seeking. She wants them to know she's *attractive*. How does she do it? By being extremely, uncomfortably sexual and making up a lot of sexual stories to make her sound sooooo experienced. But of course, she's a virgin and not a slut ""like most girls"", she knows she can ""exchange [her] virginity for a billionaire"" (her actual words from a different conversation). She's smart that way. Totally not a ho. She forgot it's not a job interview where you can lie about your abilities to make people think you're capable of doing the job. People can actually *see* you and judge your attractiveness. 

Now, I'm hardly a prude who gets uncomfortable around sexual situations. Hell, I took an entire intern batch to a strip club. What? They were teasing me about taking my boyfriend to a strip club as soon as I wasn't not around, but they were planning to go to the shitty strip club. I had to correct them and take them to the good one. If they were planning on spending $20 on entrance fees, might as well go to the club where there's less botched up boob jobs and depressed faces.

Anyway, my sister started off by doing her usual habit of making up stories. My sister lies so much (must be a habit from constantly lying about what she eats), she lies about even mundane stuff. She went, ""Don't worry about being a year younger, all the women in our family like younger men. All my cousins' husbands are a year younger! My grandma's all, ""Thrwawaytimee is just following the footsteps of her cousins...all us OurSurname women love younger men.""

Oh yes, thanks to GoT, my sister loves using our surname GoT style as if we're royalty or something. So she'll say bloody stupid, pretentious shit like, ""We are the OurSurnames..."", ""She comes from the Surname famiy"", ""He is a OtherSurname"". I'm sure she tried using, ""from the house of Surname"" too but people probably laughed at her too much. 

Anyway, of course C was confused, because we were supposed to keep our relationship a secret. How the fuck does my grandma know he's younger than me? 

Obviously, I knew my sister was making another story up, since she only knew about C's age when he introduced himself. I stupidly decided to correct her while still giving her face by going, ""That's weird, how does grandma know C's age? She doesn't even know we were dating.""

Now this is where you graciously accept that you've been caught bullshitting and mumble something about, ""Oh, I think I mixed you up with someone else."" and quickly change the subject, right?

No. My sister bulldozed on and said, ""Oh, the OurSurname family has amazing stalking skills. I'm an expert at it...""

And she started talking about her amazing stalking abilities and how she found out dirt about so many people. She kept name dropping all the rich kids' names throughout the story. Also added about how she made sure her friend snagged a ""*very, very prominent*"" guy from the Rich family, by using her awesome stalking skills to figure out his schedule. 

C was obviously freaking out. Can't blame the guy. I mean, he was still at that stage where he was thinking with his dick, but even if all his blood were stuck in his penis, he'd still have enough sense to be freaked out. I tried kicking her to signal to her to shut up, but she went, ""Ow! Why did you kick me?""

Now it looked like I was in on the craziness. 

Oh, and all this while, C and I couldn't get a single word in. She had been talking nonstop for over 30 min. Pretty shitty date. 

My sister then claimed that:

* My mom has a fat fetish, and deliberately fattened my dad up (no, my dad just ballooned because he quit smoking while still eating crap)
* By the way, that is a great strategy to keep a man. Make him unattractive so no one would go after him (yes! She admitted fat is unattractive here!!! No idea why she still insist guys who don't find her attractive are shallow!! I don't understand how her brain works. Someone please explain it to me. I guess fat women are beautiful while fat men are unattractive?)
* C should watch out because that's probably what I'd do to him (what the fucking fuck.)

Oh yes, by now, she had been doing a nearly 1h long monolog, pausing only to much and order more food &amp; drinks. Not that I minded, I mean, at this stage, I just wanted to run off and have 0 interest in joining the conversation. The only thing stopping me was that a part of me kept hoping she would leave so I could clarify to C that I'm not crazy, and then fuck his brains out. No, she was oblivious to all the glares I gave her, and wasn't checking her text messages. Knowing what I know now about her, I wondered if it was a deliberate attempt to sabotage my relationship rather than liking to make up weird stories for attention. 

I ordered dessert, because I need sweet, sinful sugary goodness on top of booze to handle the night. My sister went, ""Oh my *god!* You're ordering *dessert*? At *this* time?"" 

She turned to C, emitted what she probably thought was a flirtatious giggle, and went, ""She's always eating!""

Kettle, you're black.

And then she went on, and started jumping from one sexual topic to even more sexual topics in random haphazard fashion. It's as if she just wanted to squeeze in as many uncomfortable sexual topics in as possible:

* My brother and I found my mother's dildoes and they were huge (wat.)
* My mom talked about dicks with her, and she prefers them huge (WHAT THE FUCK.)
* Maybe because she's so open and knowledgeable, my mom just loves talking about sex with her (help me.)
* In fact, everyone loves talking about sex with her, because she just knows so much about it (she has never gotten a man to fuck her, even though she tried. All she ever got was a pity fingering. Her experience is just with dildoes. You move it in and out. Get lube if you're not wet. That's all you need to know about dildoes ffs!)
* She, my aunt, uncle, and cousin walked in on my other cousin having sex with her boyfriend (never happened. I'm sparing the graphic details she shared, because this isn't an erotica sub)


C had this petrified smile plastered on his face. C told me way later in our relationship that he only stayed because he was still trying to impress me. Honestly, it's probably just because our relationship was still at that stage where I could've told C I ate boogers for breakfast, and his response would just be, ""How fascinating, shall we fuck?""

I already asked for the bill by the time she mentioned dildoes, but unfortunately, the bill took nearly an hour to show up and C was stalling (he grabbed the bill and insisted on paying for all of us) hoping sex was still on the table. I went home straight away, because the idea of my mom and my cousin, who's like an older sister to me, having sex pretty much killed my mood.

Oh yes, and my sister ended up finishing 2/3s of my dessert, in addition to ordering 3-4 drinks. She still can't figure out why I'm mysteriously so thin while she's large even though she eats so little, of course. I guess in her mind, the calories must go to the one who orders the dessert, regardless of who actually did the eating.

I'm your host, BreakFromReality, and I'll be accompanying you in your journey to find a fun, erotic roleplay.

Please check your ID with the security guard -- all potential RP partners and their characters MUST be at least 18.

So now that you're here, how do you get started?

First, you'll sit down at our [single-deck blackjack table](https://www.random.org/playing-cards/), where you'll be deciding the kinks of the RP. You'll be dealt eight starting hands of blackjack, with each total matching up with a specific kink. (For example, a 20 is for cheating.)

Here's the full list of kinks:

* 4 -- Dealer's Choice
* 5 -- Light Bondage
* 6 -- Group Sex (MFMF, MFMFMF)
* 7 -- MFM Threesome
* 8 -- FFM Threesome
* 9 -- Interracial/Raceplay
* 10 -- Anal (Woman Receiving)
* 11 -- Filmed
* 12 -- Clothed Sex
* 13 -- Dirty Talk/Name-Calling
* 14 -- Rough Sex (Hair-Pulling, Spanking, Light Choking, etc.)
* 15 -- Public Sex
* 16 -- Creampie/Risk of Impregnation
* 17 -- Facial
* 18 -- Risk of Getting Caught (i.e. ""hold the moan"")
* 19 -- Uniform/Costume
* 20 -- Cheating
* 21 -- Player's Choice

Once eight unique hands are drawn, you will choose two kinks that you would like to include in the RP. You will also eliminate two other kinks that you would not like to include. The dealer will then choose two kinks of the remaining four.

The Dealer's Choice and Player's Choice can not be excluded.

*(To play: draw 2 cards from 1 shuffled deck. Make sure all cards except jokers are included. Repeat this eight times until complete.)*

Once the kinks are decided, you'll decide if you want to stay on the main casino floor or head over to The Den. *(While I will absolutely play with everyone, those choosing to go to The Den will get VIP status.)*

If you choose the main floor, you will head to our [roulette wheel](https://www.random.org/sequences/), where you'll help decide the character you'll be playing. The women listed on the wheel will be character models only (with one exception).

The list is as follows:

* 0 -- Player's Choice of Anyone on the List
* 1 -- You, because you're always #1 at DPP Casino!
* 2 -- Bella Thorne
* 3 -- Dove Cameron
* 4 -- Laurel Coppock
* 5 -- Alison Brie
* 6 -- Kendall Jenner
* 7 -- Candice Patton
* 8 -- Margot Robbie
* 9 -- Vanessa Hudgens
* 10 -- Scarlett Johansson
* 11 -- Taylor Swift
* 12 -- Miley Cyrus
* 13 -- Ariana Grande
* 14 -- Emma Stone
* 15 -- Milana Vayntrub
* 16 -- Nina Dobrev
* 17 -- Rihanna
* 18 -- Sarah Hyland
* 19 -- Lily Aldridge
* 20 -- Mila Kunis
* 21 -- Stella Maxwell
* 22 -- Dianna Agron
* 23 -- Chloe Grace Moretz
* 24 -- Katherine McNamara
* 25 -- Victoria Justice
* 26 -- Carrie Underwood
* 27 -- Jennifer Lawrence
* 28 -- Selena Gomez
* 29 -- Emilia Clarke
* 30 -- Emily Ratajkowski
* 31 -- Meghan Markle
* 32 -- Jourdan Dunn
* 33 -- Katy Perry
* 34 -- Aubrey Plaza
* 35 -- Nicole Beharie
* 36 -- Ariel Winter

You will spin the wheel six times (12 for two-female scenes and 18 for three-female scenes). You will then pick three characters (six for two-female scenes and nine for three-female scenes). The dealer will then choose the character he would like you to play (the Player's Choice may get excluded).

*(To play: Set the smallest value at 0 and the largest value at 36, and keep it in one column. Take the first 6/12/18 numbers in the list.)*

Finally, it's time to ""role"" the dice at the [craps table](https://www.random.org/dice/) and see just what you'll be playing. The roles are below:

* 2 -- Dealer's Choice
* 3 -- Coach's Daughter
* 4 -- Friend's Wife/Girlfriend
* 5 -- Student
* 6 -- Sister's/Daughter's Friend
* 7 -- Incest (Daughter, Sister, Cousin)
* 8 -- Friend's Sister/Daughter
* 9 -- Work Scenario (Secretary, Intern, Co-Worker, etc.)
* 10 -- Wife's/Girlfriend's Friend
* 11 -- Bully's/Bullying Victim's Sister
* 12 -- Player's Choice

*(If Celebrity is chosen, you will be playing the actual celebrity from the wheel instead of a lookalike. For 12, I am giving the option of playing either the bullying victim's sister or an interesting revenge plot with the bully's sister.)*

You will roll the dice four times. Of the four unique roles, you will then discard one. The dealer will discard one of the remaining three, and you will then choose one (or both, if possible) of the remaining two.

*(To play: simply roll two virtual dice. Repeat until four different roles are picked.)*

After that is done, we will have the RP with the characters, roles and kinks!

Now if you choose The Den?

Here's the list of characters for the roulette wheel:

* 0 -- Player's Choice of Anyone on the List
* 1 -- You, as a woman age 40+ (if you're not one already)
* 2 -- Rena Sofer
* 3 -- Nigella Lawson
* 4 -- Christie Brinkley
* 5 -- Eva Longoria
* 6 -- Rashida Jones
* 7 -- Jane Seymour
* 8 -- Elizabeth Hurley
* 9 -- Jennifer Lopez
* 10 -- Julianna Margulies
* 11 -- Patricia Heaton
* 12 -- Cheryl Hines
* 13 -- Jordan Ladd
* 14 -- Jennifer Aniston
* 15 -- Giada de Laurentiis
* 16 -- Julie Bowen
* 17 -- Alyson Hannigan
* 18 -- Gabrielle Union
* 19 -- Melinda Clarke
* 20 -- Jennifer Garner
* 21 -- Marcia Cross
* 22 -- Christina Hendricks
* 23 -- Angela Bassett
* 24 -- Elizabeth Banks
* 25 -- Isla Fisher
* 26 -- Natalie Imbruglia
* 27 -- Mary-Louise Parker
* 28 -- Kate Beckinsale
* 29 -- Sofia Vergara
* 30 -- Julianne Moore
* 31 -- Kim Cattrall
* 32 -- Ellen Barkin
* 33 -- Sharon Stone
* 34 -- Paula Patton
* 35 -- Mary Steenburgen
* 36 -- Courteney Cox

And here are the roles:

* 2 -- Dealer's Choice
* 3 -- Coach's Wife
* 4 -- Friend's Wife
* 5 -- Teacher/Principal
* 6 -- Mom's Friend
* 7 -- Incest (Mom, Aunt, Grandmother)
* 8 -- Friend's Mom
* 9 -- Work Scenario (Boss, Co-Worker, etc.)
* 10 -- Wife's Friend
* 11 -- Bully's/Bullying Victim's Mom
* 12 -- Dealer's Choice

That does it for our tour! We can't wait to play with you, and we know you'll have a good time; others have! 

If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. And from all of us at DPP Casino, have a winning day!"

I know this happened with lawyers a bit while back, and I know that most of the demand for CS is with experience in certain frameworks and technologies (but there seems to be still plenty of entry level jobs).

I had no issues getting an internship last year in three months (at a non-tech company).  Alot of my peers also have internships, and most are graduating into a job (our school isn't top, but it still has a 95% job placement rate, and our alums usually don't know anyone that also graduated without a job offer).  Is it mainly oversaturated at large tech companies, which I see happening, or are smaller companies, contracting firms, and non-tech companies' ITs also tightening up?  I think maybe that the problem is too many people are looking at Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Facebook, and not anywhere else?  Or bad resumes/interviewing skills?"

54r9vn,3,2016-09-27,Can you help someone who sort of knows what they want to do?,running4beer,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/54r9vn/can_you_help_someone_who_sort_of_knows_what_they/,"While I jumped around a lot in college as far as career ideas, the one I toyed with the most was becoming a professor. I decided late last 2015/early 2016 that while it really would be a nice career, and I think grad school could be a fun way to spend my twenties, I do not want to pursue it due to job prospects and other reasons. This meant I had to accent my B.A. in Philosophy some to be a competitive applicant. For a college grad my resume isn't terrible, I have worked at a law firm doing case research (legal assistant), been a marketing intern for a campus outreach program, wrote for the school's economics magazine, completed research in an organic chemistry lab which resulted in my name on a paper(I went through a pre-med phase) and worked as a line cook all throughout college to pay the bills. I also began to teach myself Python last December, making slow progress.

I applied to about 50 jobs in the spring in a panicky, ""I'm going to graduate with 35k debt in 8 weeks and I have no definitive plans!"" frenzy. I was trying to use the qualitative and quantitative research experience I have from the law firm and lab coupled with my writing skills to get a job as a research associate as a D.C. think tank, or non-profit. I heard back from a company in Boston offering me a part-time job, and got 2 rejections letters. I understand that I was inexperienced at writing cover letters and tailoring my resume, so I wasn't too let down.

I decided to teach English in South Korea for year (I arrived in Seoul in August) to save some money, pay down my student loans, travel a bit, and use the free time to work on skills for jobs. My one year goal is to become proficient (read: not an expert, but ahead of the curve) in Python and Google Analytics, familiar with another language (C++, Javascript, Ruby, or R) and try to build a small portfolio of projects I've completed. After my year in South Korea is up (Aug 2017), I want to move to a bigger city like Denver, D.C., Boston, or Seattle with the money I've saved.

I mentioned knowing what I want to do.. The truth is I know what I like doing and I need help figuring out the career for me. I still like the idea of working for a political think tank, and I think with more ""hard skills"" to pair with my liberal arts degree I would have a better chance. I'm thinking of journalism as well, maybe even ""data journalism."" I have also thought about trying to get an internship or even a position as a junior data analyst for some company as well. I really like thinking hard about problems, imagining solutions, and writing about them- it's why I studied philosophy. What are other fields that would use the mixture of hard and soft skills I'll have in a 8 months when I'm applying for jobs in the U.S. again? I kind of want to work in something at least tangentially related to public or foreign policy, because I find it interesting.

If I felt like I could handle teaching for two years, I might consider staying in Korea, because at the end of 24 months here I will have just turned 24, I can have paid off over 18k in student loans, saved up 5k+ in cash, and done a lot of traveling (I've made an excel sheet to make a budget, and predict all of this based on my spendings and monthly salary). I would be scared of becoming a less desirable applicant though, as well as suffering from burnout here.

Sorry for writing so much, I think I just wanted to write my story down to get it off my chest.

**TL;DR:** Liberal arts grad is learning some programming to broaden his skill set. He likes writing, problem solving, researching, and learning new things. Give him some advice or insult his B.A."

I go to a large public university. I’m a Senior, and I’m majoring in a field that is basically IT and minoring in IT (literally IT). I’ve worked two on campus jobs in IT. One was a walk in helpdesk for the general public, the other was a department specific help desk. Right now I’m doing an internship with an actual company, so when I graduate I should have 3 years of level 1/level 1.5 experience. Right now I’m studying for the A+ which I should’ve done over the summer, but I’m not sure if I should try and finish, go for a different cert, or learn something like PowerShell/SQL/some programming language. So the question is, what do I do from here? I'm pretty much banking on my degree and experience. Do you its are enough to get a decent job (L2, SysAdmin, Support Analyst) in Washington/Oregon? 

So there are a lot of things I should've done over the summer which I have not done, so I will try and get things done now before graduation. "
54rp33,193,2016-09-27,Graduating from college and transitioning to work life is the best thing that ever happened to me,doorway84760138,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/54rp33/graduating_from_college_and_transitioning_to_work/,"So I graduated from a public school near the SF Bay Area with a degree in CS in June and after 6 weeks of vacation I started working at a local software company. I’ve now been working for a while and have a decent sense of what is going on. Most importantly, I enjoy my job and the people that I work with. My job is fun and my company culture is very exciting. Even though it is a private company (and we get no stock) we are accommodated well for our efforts and we have competitive salaries.

When I was in college, I was incredibly depressed most of the time. I had very little free time to go to the gym, play sports, and do other things. I had severe anxiety almost all the time and I developed an alcohol addiction. I hated the stress of having so many programming assignments and having to spend so much of my damn time getting work done. My professors were mostly terrible, my assignments were boring and uninteresting, and I was surrounded by a good amount of assholes that only cared about getting jobs at the Big 4 and bragging about their internships. It was a very toxic environment. I was about ready to drop out my senior year. I absolutely hated everything about going to school.

Now that I am working, I am in the best shape of my life. Everyone would always tell me that college is supposed to be the best 4 years of your life, but those 4 years were hell for me. I’ve now lost a good amount of weight by lifting and playing sports almost every day, I have disposable income and can do lots of fun things in the Bay Area, and I have made a lot of good friends at work. I have never been this healthy or felt this good about myself in my entire life. I love my job and I look forward to going to work every day.

Anyway I just typed this (on a throwaway account) for… actually I am not sure. I just want to give people some hope I guess. If you don’t like college, it will get better. It feels great to have some disposable income and finally have some free time. Life is great. 

Did anyone else have similar findings? I am interested to hear your stories.

I've been reading up on what kinds of parts to pick out for a ~1k€ gaming pc. but it is my first time and i don't know much about computers so i'd appreciate some advice. Here is the list of parts:

Processor: Intel Core i5 6600 4x 3.20GHz

CPU Cooler: Hyper 212 Evo

GPU: MSI GeForce GTX 1070 Gaming X 8G

PSU: EVGA 600B Non-Modular 80+ Bronze

Motherboard: Asus H170 PRO GAMING Intel H170

RAM: 8GB Crucial Ballistix Sport LT DDR4-2400 DIMM CL16 Dual Kit

DVD Drive: LG Electronics GH24NSC0 DVD-RW SATA intern 

SSD: 250GB Samsung 750 Evo 2.5"" (6.4cm) SATA 6Gb/s TLC Toggle (MZ-750250BW)

HDD: 1000GB WD Blue WD10EZEX 64MB 3.5"" 

Tower: Corsair Carbide Series 200R Mid Tower

Monitor: 24"" BenQ GL2460HM 2ms response time

This all rounds up to about 1250€ which is stretching the budget a bit but it's fine, but it shouldn't go higher than this. I plan to play all kinds of games such as World of Warcraft, CS:GO and League of Legends on this computer, as for the graphics i'd love to play on highest graphics available on said games, but really what im looking for is as smooth a gameplay as i can get, i'm more into the competetive side of gaming as opposed to looking at shiny trees. I don't plan on overclocking considering i have no knowledge of such. I'd also like to be able to livestream but that's not the main focus.

I'd be forever thankful if you could check it out and maybe give me some advice on better choices, for example i wasn't sure if the MSI or Asus GPU was better. Also i'd like to know if everything is compatible with everything.

I live in Finland and I'm ordering from the German site Mindfactory.de

Thanks in advance :)

54s9hq,14,2016-09-27,Ideas for Water Con Session,JackedAlf,Pararescue,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pararescue/comments/54s9hq/ideas_for_water_con_session/,"I've been reading training ideas and whatnot here and cannot access wiki.. So maybe this is redundant, but for some.. maybe not. I won't cover workouts unless someone wants to, but let me at least give a little background about me to attempt to give some credibility. PJ Cone, Kinesiology degree, sports performance internships and was a trainer for a national team for women's LAX - I won't say the country but it wasn't the US. So, hopefully that will give what I say a little more weight.

Pool session (water con, always be safe, have a training partner or notify lifeguard)

Underwaters - 5-10 (yes 10) x 3 min interval work down to a 1:30 (5 at a 1:15 if you're feeling bold). Now that con has moved to the chap - try and practice in a 50M pool without a push off aka going towards deep end, but do both.

Mask and snorkel - Start by just familiarizing yourself, but do 5-10 sets. To increase challenge or at least make it less boring - do 7 rounds of :30s hands up treading above your mask and snorkel go down recover properly.. take off and then begin treading again for your rest. So, :30s hands up tread - mask and snorkel recovery (right below you) - drop them and begin again for about 7 times. Less more as required.

Buddy breathing - Training partner? None? Don't matter.. If you have people - work up to full harass + start SLOW don't freak someone out by beginning with full harass for their first time. But, work up to 3 minutes full harass  +.. so do 4 caps not just 2. Do a couple rds and rest between. No buddy? Self buddy breathing to start - Float, clear snorkel, move it away.. clear again and get the hang of it. Practice clearing without breathing for as many as you can, conserve your air.

Ditch and dons - You can absolutely do this, but need to buy at least a weight belt + fins + mask - Google it

Knots - Get a rope, learn the knots you need to know. practice doing it under water.. literally that easy. You don't have to have a rope to tie them to. For example, tie a bowline, untie it, tie it again. Do this above water.. underwater... underwater eyes closed.. Then multiple times with multiple knots. Make sure your rope is finger thickness maybe 24 inch in length.

Treading- Hands up - Get that egg beater down, but make this gradual.. :30 on :30 off for 5 - 10 sets, move to 1:00 on -:30 off for 5.. basically make it so that you can do 3 min hands up easily.. You can do weight belt treads with fins as well if you desire (and it will be good practice). Same idea... Practice with flooded mask for one, the other or both.

I would recommend spending the couple hundred dollars to get an Atlantis 2 mask, jetfins, 8 - 16 lb weight belt, 24"" length of rope, Horsecollar BC if you really want to get the right feel and some booties.

Once a week or 2 weeks or month, you NEED to practice underwaters and other events with ABUs/sweats/jeans/BC whatever you have in order to simulate what you'd do on a black Thursday. Keep the interval long or short 2:00 - 4:00.. Play around with how it feels. Practice 10 ups and crossovers and random things with flooded masks.

So, to reiterate, try and do this 2-4 times a week and progress slowly -

UW - 5-10 x 3:00 - 1:15
Mask and snorkel - 10 minutes ish work out to a 30M, change to what I said with treading if you'd like to try that
Buddy breathing - 1 - 3 Min sessions : work up to full +
Ditch and dons &amp; knots - if you have equip
Treading + Wt belt treading - work up until 3:00 for multiple rds

So, that's a breakdown of what I would recommend to be OVER prepared for Indoc. In all honesty, if you can do all that, watercon will be a lovely 3 hour break for you every day until about the 7th week.

If anything needs clarification, youtube first and if it still doesn't make sense.. I will do my best. If anyone is in the ABQ area feel free to PM me and we can maybe try and work something out to do a pool session.

I'd really appreciate any advice you have and would love to hear about similar experiences. 


I recently earned my Associates at a CC and planned to finish up a BS degree in computer science at a university. However, I took on an internship this semester that is making me second guess whether I am cut out for this line of work, including the corporate world. I really do not enjoy my current job (IT analyst) or the people I work with. Every day is extremely dull and slow and I feel like any soul I use to have has slowly shriveled and disappeared. I have been here for just about 4 months now. During this time I have definitely become depressed, but I reassured myself that it was just because of the change (moving away from home, sitting all day, little to no work to keep busy, and super boring coworkers). 


This probably has a lot to do with the fact that I'm accustomed to a much faster paced workplace. Before I took on this internship, I was a meat cutter. I absolutely loved my work and felt very confident in it. My coworkers were amazing and I loved meeting new customers who I'd exchange recipes and cooking tips with. I really loved working hard and pushing my body to its limits (I'm a female, so it was quite strenuous for me at times). However, I never viewed the job as a career choice due to the lack of decent salary and 50+ hour work weeks with no weekend or weekdays off. 


I never realized how much I would miss the job until I left. I assumed I could make the most out of any work experience and while IT isn't considered to be the most fun, I figured the salary, weekends and holidays off, benefits, and regular hours/routine would make up for any lack of excitement. 


A major concern of mine is that I am giving up the chance to challenge my mind, if I decide to rejoin the food world. I really enjoy learning new things and I was looking forward to continuing school, but I also don't want to waste two years and $30,000 to find out I'd be happier where I started. 


So where would you go from here?


Sorry for the lengthy narrative. I realize this has become the money vs happiness quandary, but I would love to hear any productive thoughts. Thanks!

This isn't an interview, so I won't spend most of my time patting myself on my back for my life's accomplishments-some readers will appreciate that.
I just wanted to introduce myself to the community, and maybe inspire someone my age to think  "" I can try too!"". I currently work 6-6, Monday-Saturday as a middle manager for a large pest control company. I'll be 30 in December and I had to ask myself ""what do I want to be when I grow up?"" If you're like me, perhaps you hoped lighting would strike- Eureka!  Lighting doesn't strike for many of us. 

My degree is in Business Administration/Marketing, but I didn't aggressively pursue the field upon graduation. Maybe it was self-esteem, but I seemed to aim low in my job prospects only to end up with a  promotion I didn't ask for.  My advice to the college kids, do the internships, network and have a basic plan for when you graduate. Seems simple enough, but we don't all take good advice.

 Although some of my family members code for careers, it was an Uber driver that watered the seed of my pursuit. I saved his information... I have this fantasy that I will get the entry-level coding job one day and show him how much I appreciated our conversation. 

I have taken teamtreehouse and codeacademy lessons for a few months now, but I'm also not getting any younger. I'm going to take the plunge and do a coding bootcamp. I will have to move to a part time job waiting tables to pay the bills, but it will allow me a lot more time to study and focus. Even though the bootcamp is 6 months (3 days a week with 20-40 hours of homework a week). I'm not fooled by the claims of the camp.  I wouldn't be surprised if I had to work an additional 6 months to a year to be job ready.  I'm terrified, but excited and driven.

Part of my bootcamp pre-work is to create a game in ""Scratch"", a kid's programming website. I wanted to encourage all of the ""wannabe"" programmers like me to take a stab at designing something on this site. It was a lot of fun! You'll impress yourself with the problems you solve as you create your own projects. If you're too advanced, share it with a friend that could take an interest in coding-  who knows, you could be THEIR ""uber driver"".

54t269,3,2016-09-27,[Ombuds] Behind The Scenes: NPR Fact Checks First Debate In Near Real Time,s3thcom,nprstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/nprstories/comments/54t269/ombuds_behind_the_scenes_npr_fact_checks_first/,"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump answers a question as Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton listens during the presidential debate at Hofstra University on Sept. 26, 2016.

David Goldman/APNPR listeners and readers have [said they want fact-checking](http://ift.tt/24wKUQQ) during this political campaign season and NPR responded with what I found to be a very impressive new offering Monday night: a close to real-time [annotation of a transcript](http://ift.tt/2dxUy6P) of the first televised debate between Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.

As the debate transcript rolled by, supplied by an automated transcription service, a team of some 30 newsroom staffers, including reporters, editors and members of the visuals team, jumped in to fact-check and annotate what the candidates were saying and keep the process moving along. By the end of the process, the transcript contained 74 annotations, some adding context and others pointing out statements the candidates got right or wrong.

NPR's audience clearly appreciated the massive effort; as of Tuesday afternoon, more than 6 million people had checked it out.

My office heard great praise for and some criticism of the effort. Some of the critics were unhappy with the errors made by the automated transcription service. My take on that is that most of those looked to be hand corrected by NPR staff by the morning.

Others saw bias in which candidate statements got fact-checked and which didn't. That's always an inherent risk in fact-checking a lengthy candidate speech or 90-minute debate.

Here's how the totals broke out, according to our tally. NPR fact-checked nine Clinton statements, and 33 Trump statements. Another 32 annotations added context for what the candidates were saying (11 added context to Clinton, and 21 to Trump). The vast majority of fact-checks on Trump concluded that he was wrong; by our count just a handful of Clinton's statements were judged wrong.

Some emailers sent lists of Clinton statements that NPR did not fact-check. One example, sent by Grant Cates of Orlando, was this Clinton statement:

""Well, let's stop for a second and remember where we were eight years ago, we had the worst financial crisis — the great recession, the worst since the 1930s. That was, in large part, because of tax policies that slash taxes on the wealthy, failed to invest in the middle class, took their eyes off of Wall Street and created a perfect storm.""

Cates wrote: ""Seems like an obvious opportunity for NPR to summarize the causes of the great recession. What were the tax policies and failed investments that led to the recession? What about subprime loans for housing and how government policies promoting home ownership had unintended consequences?""

I'd agree with that, and I see other Clinton statements that could be checked, too. I also see Trump statements that went unchallenged, like this one: ""Let me give you the example of Mexico. They have a VAT tax, we're on a different system. When we sell into Mexico, there is a tax when they sell, an automatic 16 percent, approximately. When they sell into us there's no tax. It's a defective agreement.""

I asked the newsroom about the methodology behind the fact-checking. Domenico Montanaro, NPR's lead political editor, emailed:

""We wanted to try something new and comprehensive that focused on the facts and built on what we have done in recent months — annotations of convention speeches, economic addresses and more. In the planning stages, we reached out across desks to policy and beat experts and editors from business to foreign affairs to education and created a shared document that everyone who wanted to be involved could do so in an easy way. Our team of political and visuals editors behind the scenes filtered, managed, checked and updated. The editorial was organic. We told our folks essentially if you see something, say something. Like viewers at home, when we heard something that made us go, 'Is that true?' Or 'That's not true.' Or 'well that's not the whole context,' our reporters were on it. As the night evolved, more got added and updated. If something stood out to an editor that hadn't been fact checked, then we reached out to a relevant reporter. But honestly, this very sharp collaborative team left very few rocks unturned in about as fast a way as you can.""

As for the emphasis on fact-checking Trump, he wrote:

""What's fair isn't always equal. Our reporters across multiple desks, across multiple beats with deep content knowledge did a stellar job of fact checking in real time. We certainly are always cognizant of providing balance and focusing on both candidates, but if the numbers show that one candidate was fact checked more, it might be because that candidate said more things that needed fact checking.""

My take: It's not possible to fact-check every candidate statement. Some additional statements could have been checked but, overall, I think NPR's team offered a valuable service that met the goal of providing citizens with information they need to make their November decisions. For more on the impact of fact-checking in an election, I'd recommend reading Danielle Kurtzelben's [piece](http://ift.tt/2dhoB27) at NPR.org. Meanwhile, NiemanLab had [more on the technical gee-whiz](http://ift.tt/2cIPXwU) behind the project.

I'm sure I will be happy attending any of these schools. Would just love to hear your opinions on which you would choose and why.

Most important things for my decision in order:

1. Ability to get a job/internship in the future
2. Quality of Education Received
3. Having CS related organizations and events to attend (such as ""Hackathons"")
4. How nice the campus itself is."
54tdpj,4,2016-09-27,How to deal with burnout as an engineering student?,MrCaptainCody,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/54tdpj/how_to_deal_with_burnout_as_an_engineering_student/,"Every semester I try so hard to keep up with all my classes but it never fails that by mid semester I am so burnt out, hating my classes, feeling like shit, and in general just feeling miserable. Last semester I dealt with the stress with smoking a ton of weed and putting off sleep with a TON of adderall I could cop off of friends. Over the summer I decided to give up both of those with internships coming up and I decided I need to grow up at some point and quit treating my body like shit. I have tried so hard to keep up with my class work but as soon as I'm done with a heap of work, I get stacked with more horseshit work. I'm 5 weeks in and I am drowning in stress and school work. I average less then 6 hours of sleep per night, I am popping caffeine pills like no other, and week by week I am hating my life more and more. I am currently taking 15 hours as 3rd year MEEN student but probably go to class between 16-19 hours a week w/ labs, and am taking all core classes(thermo, diff equations, mechanical analysis, etc). I go to a very good engineering school notorious for weeding the fuck out of their engineers. I work about 10 hours a week. Pretty much Sunday - Thursday I am busting my ass 24/7. Fridays I have off. Both Fridays and Saturdays I am normally lying around with a migraine from lack of sleep during the week and caffeine withdrawal and sometimes being sick. I was excising for a while, doing a running club but I no longer have time for that. Guys I am hating my life so much right now, what can I do to ease up the pain? What is some advice you fellow engineering students can give me to prevent this horrible burnout I experience and general hatred of my life by the mid semester every fucking semester. Also when does it get better? I am still not enjoying most of my classes (with the exception of the design classes I have taken, those are really cool). Most of it is really tedious and time consuming that really feels like something put in the coursework to weed me out (especially those god damn 3 hour labs with lab reports that take a minimum of 5 hours to do).

54ti24,2,2016-09-27,Leave physics PhD after 4 years to live a year in Asia and learn data science on my own?,newstart86,careeradvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/54ti24/leave_physics_phd_after_4_years_to_live_a_year_in/,"Hi,
the fact is, that I'm four years into my physics PhD and I don't have much to write about yet. My contract at uni ends in 12 months and there is no hope for renewal. I feel like I am too far behind in my research to catch up and somehow make it work in the remaining months. I am almost sure that there is no way I can succeed in getting that PhD even if I give it my all. There is also the problem that going to uni and to my lab makes me profoundly unhappy. I avoid going there and break down crying on a weekly basis.  I don't like my topic and don't care that much anymore about the title.  But most importantly I don't really live anymore and I have been feeling like this for over two years. I don't want to go on like this for another year. So I need a plan B.

I am really interested in data science and think that I could be good at it. Unfortunately, at the moment, I do not yet possess the necessary skills to get hired as a data scientist, such as Python, SQL, statistics and math, Hadoop and its ecosystem,...
I have the following idea:
to quit my Phd and move to Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam for a year. I could use this time to learn the skills and build a portfolio I need to get hired. The cost of living would be less then in my current country. Obviously I wouldn't use this year primarily as vacation time but really focus on progressing as a data scientist to be and also start the application process before returning home.

I currently have around 14000€. A year in asia would cost me about 8000-9000€. This is my calculation for one year: 2555€ hostel costs + 800€ flights + 4400€ food + 350€ health insurance.
This would leave me with 3000-4000€ for unexpected costs, emergencies and resettling home afterwards.
Am I totally mad? Or could this actually work?
I would move around by bike (have done this before) and stay predominantly in hostels with wifi so I can access MOOCs and other online resources.

I have parents who I think would take me in for a few months if it takes too long to get a job after return. I am aware that I probably won't get hired as a data scientist without experience and that the skills acquired during that year might only land me an internship. I'm ok with that. I just really like the topic and want to work my way up.

Plan C could be to stay here and find a ""stupid"" part-time job outside of physics and use the remaining time for data science education. But then I might not make enough to pay for health insurance and a flat and food in Europe,...
Please tell me if I'm totally crazy and delusional. Also any other advice will be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

I am currently a junior majoring in mechanical engineering.  I have had several great internships already in the field of engineering, and I am worried that it may not be what I want to do with my life.  I am obviously going to finish out my degree (It will take me 4 years, and I have a 3.5 gpa at the moment).  I really do like engineering, but law has always interested me and I would like to know more about it.  So my questions for y'all are these: Have any of you ever gone from engineering to law school? If so, how was the transition?  What kind of job prospects were you looking for upon completing law school?  And then just for everyone in general, what as a college junior should I be doing now to prepare myself for the LSAT among other things, to give myself the best opportunity to get into law school?

54tvwk,1,2016-09-27,Am I getting exploited by this internship?,weslehh,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/54tvwk/am_i_getting_exploited_by_this_internship/,"Long story short, I'm an MIS major with some professional IT experience (I do IT for a psychiatrist's practice), and am looking for more valuable experience in the cyber security field. Naturally, an internship is what I'm focusing on getting. I went to my school's career fair last week, saw this cyber security company that was offering internships. Within 5 min of talking to the guy, he basically offered me an internship (unpaid, would've been paid if I had prior security experience). I met up with him the next day to talk it over, and that's when I was officially offered it. My first ""task"" is to web crawl on Linkedin and pretty much grab whatever IT-related people in my area and toss 'em into an Excel doc (over 2,000 people).

What should I do at this point? I realize it's not even a week in, but this is my first internship so I really don't have an idea of if I'm getting exploited or not. Only reason I'm asking is because it just seemed so sketchy that I was offered an internship so quickly. The office is on my school's campus, so that's not as sketchy, but it's still very iffy to me. Any help would be appreciated!"
54twh3,4,2016-09-27,Current High School Senior,Snailic,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/54twh3/current_high_school_senior/,"As the title states, I am a current High School Senior who is planning to pursue a career in IT, specifically Network Administration.

Currently have 26.5 credits and only need 3 more credits from required courses in order to graduate with an advanced studies. School didn't offer any IT classes, regrettably did not find out about my local community college's classes until after the classes were already a month and a half in, technically they are still open to enrollment but they are almost halfway through for this semester so I do not believe that will be best. My GPA is above average for my school though not the best (3.5).

Highest math right now is Calculus and only technical class is AP CSA (Java).

I am currently planning to start studying for the A+ Certification in the next few days even though some people claim that it is useless. I personally feel that it isn't entirely useless, no matter how much I think I know about computers, there will always be things I do not know. And I plan to study for the Net+ Certification. These are just to have some entry level certs for an entry level job.

My plan is to get an entry level IT job and study for other certifications as I gain experience and then use the experience and certifications to apply to WGU for the IT Bachelors Network Administration program and complete the courses while I work to move up in the field and gain experience. I do not want to rack up an absurd amount of debt at a typical 4 year school though community college is always an option along with Federal Aid.

From what I gathered from this sub:

- http://www.opsschool.org/en/latest/ is a great resource, although it doesn't seem to be entirely related to Network Administration but seems to have some good information to know, should I read the entirety of it?

- I should setup a homelab. I haven't used Linux very much other than basic Ubuntu for a short period of time and know next to nothing about servers, most I've done is setup NoMachine for remote PC access. Someone had suggested to get familiar with Linux and I think that is a great idea.

- attend conferences and whatnot to meet people who work in the field and to have contacts (I believe the saying is ""its not about what you know, its about who you know"" though I doubt that is always the case)

- internship. I actually have a possible internship lined up, I really hope it works out.

- volunteering. I've done some volunteer work though nothing IT related. I think I have the possibility to volunteer at my school's IT.

- programming. I've taken AP CSA and got a 4 on the AP Test. I also had worked a fair amount with it outside of the class prior. I looked at Python some, feel that I need to work with it more.

- keep up to date with current technologies and trends, read stuff such as the State of IT on this subreddit. I think that is something I will start doing as I only recently discovered this sub but wish I had discovered it months ago.

If anyone can critique my ""plan"" or offer any words of advice, please feel free to.

Thank you for your time.

54u2ws,2,2016-09-27,F4A - The Dark Journey To Fame,Undisclosed_Desires7,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/54u2ws/f4a_the_dark_journey_to_fame/,"Katheyn or what she preferred to be called Katy was the new intern at the company. A big industry in downtown Los Angeles that dealt with many movie, tv and rock stars. Basically, offering rich and famous people services to handle their careers while also giving fresh faced wannabes the opportunities.

Katy was one of them, a young girl that wasn't even 21 yet dreams of making it in music, becoming a world known star. She had tried numerous times and had many meetings with companies to try and get her talent across to no avail. Eventually the money she saved up from her part time job while she was in school dried up and she had to pick up a job in L.A she she thought why not a business in a similar field to her dreams.

Katy remembered when she walked into the office for the first time, people couldn't believe what she looked like and you think they would be accustomed to seeing gorgeous people all the time. She had worn a pair of red 6 inch stilettos and a tiny pencil skirt that would of been the shortest a woman could wear. Thigh high stockings that hugged tight to her legs that were held up by clasps attached to a garter belt. The tight blouse she wore strained her rather biggest assets, her double DD breasts that were pushed up in her black bra. They bounced around as she worked around the office, attracting the attention of many guys. The man Katy worked for was always delighted to see her, his eyes filling up with lust as he looked her body over before leading her into his office and shutting the door.

Katy regularly wore clothes that brung her attention, it was always another pair of 6 inch heels, short skirts and stockings accompanied by a tight low cut blouse. Guys around the office started to talk about Katy, about how they would love to ram her as she bent over their desk. Many guys often tried to get with her but she always refused.

Soon Katy developed a reputation for being a strong feminist supporter. She thought that all men were pigs for treating women as nothing more than a pair of tits and ass with a pretty face. That's how Katy felt in meetings, guys would get sidetracked around her and just stare at her boobs or ass. They wouldn't take her seriously and thought that she was just a slut. She thought that guys only chatted to her because they wanted to fuck her and weren't even calling her by name around the office, she overheard them calling her by her big tits.

Though what Katy did, didn't always match up with what she said. She would scold men for staring at her body when she wore revealing clothing everyday. She would also find every excuse to bend over to give everyone a good look at her, regularly dropping things on the ground. She would get angry at guys all the time for flirting with her as they obviously wanted to fuck her but she would flirt with guys all the time brushing her hand near their groin and giving them a sexy, sultry look as she walked away.

One day the CEO came to the office and went to a meeting room with about 30 other businessmen. They were all aged between 50-80 years old. After about an hour, Katy was called into the meeting room. Jason, a fellow coworker had a desk right in front of the room, he watched her strut in their, clad in her tight clothes. She closed the door behind her. It must of been 4 hours until the doors opened again, with the old guys walking out with satisfied looks on their faces. They talked about how great that was and how they must do it again soon. Out Katy stepped as they finally all left. Her hair was disheveled while she was fixing her rumpled blouse and rolling down her skirt while carrying her stilettos. As she walked she pulled out a curly hair from her mouth and wiped away a bit of stickiness from her lips. Going to her desk and continuing work like nothing happened.

-----------------

I want this role play to involve scenarios following the womens career such as trying to break into the industry (a lot of time spent as the secretary), dealing with the sudden fame, hook ups with celebrities, sex tapes, paparazzi, fans, relationships, becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol and turning into a nymphomaniac.

The prompt above doesn't have to be the start or involved in it... just an example of some writing.

Can be different and have a male celebrity and their journey. (Check out my 'Famous Life' posting in my post history for that)

I want to play the males the celeb will encounter. I want someone to play the main lead which will be the young female starlet. I would love for the young starlet to be Katy Perry or Kylie Jenner but I like a lot of other celebs as well such as Taylor Swift, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande, Megan Fox, Margot Robbie, Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Alba. Though.. the female celebrity can be an original character that is made up would love her to look like Madison Ivy or Lana Rhoades though also into Lindsey Pelas, Emily Sears and Claudia Alende.

I prefer to roleplay on Google Docs and use messengers to chat and set things up such as K , skype, yahoo msger and google chat/hangouts. Want this to be a long term rp

If you are interested and wish to talk about this further send me a message. Please make your message to me detailed and include any character/ scenario ideas, which celebrities you like and what platforms you use.

P.S Also have a recent posting in which I mention all the rp's and things I'm interested in for a long term rp, so check that out if you want, particularly interested in doing a Marvel Black Widow RP or a Post apocalyptic/dystopia world that is similar to Fallout or a Bioshock rp.

54u41r,1,2016-09-27,Advice for transitioning into IT field with a Bachelors in Biological Sciences,iaskrandomkwestions,ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/54u41r/advice_for_transitioning_into_it_field_with_a/,"Hi all! 

I've read the FAQ and done some research for the past week and I have an idea of how to get into the field. I would like some feedback and advice on my plan.

I am 25 Y/O and reside in Orange County and Los Angeles. I graduated with a BS in Biological Sciences in 2015 (GPA wasn't too good at all, around 3.0-3.2) and was going to pursue healthcare. During my year off, I decided that I want to work in the tech field instead, and leaning towards system administrator field.

I have no tech work experience (although I do build computers occasionally and do some admin work at physical therapy workplace), and the only experience I have is as a physical therapy aide, physical therapy volunteer, and many years of working in a restaurant as a server.

What I'm thinking is:

1) Go back to school for a BS in Computer Science.

2) Pursue certifications while continuing to work part time and look for internships (working on A+, planning on studying for MCSE and Server+).
I would also actively look for a fulltime entry level job ie helpdesk or junior system admin job; but looking around on craigslist and indeed, it seems like many job postings require 1-2+ years of experience (so much for entry level postings).

I'm leaning towards option 2 because I don't want to be in debt and read many success stories about the individuals getting into the IT field without the relevant degree. I would appreciate any advice on what entry level IT positions are the best to shoot for, and what general path would be best for me to take in my current situation. Thanks all!"

As the title reveals, I am a freshman at UIUC studying Mechanical Engineering. However, due to a lot of AP Credit, I am starting to take my engineering courses already. This semester (fall) I am taking Calc 3, Mechanics, ME 170 (which is a CAD course here, teaches Creo 3.0), as well as a Python course. I have an array of high school accomplishments, leadership roles, service, grades, you name it (The only school to reject me of my 13 was Harvard, and it was probably due to the fact I didn't write the additional, ""optional,"" essay). All of this is on my resume (for now). I was pretty much brushed off at the fall career fair and had a couple questions.

One, are there any companies out there that you think would give me a chance, especially in the Chicago area? I'd have to apply online but I really would like this opportunity. A couple of companies at the career fair pretty much told me they'd love to give me an interview, took down my availability, etc. but they also mentioned that preference has to be given to upperclassmen. Needless to say, no one called me.

Two, how are things at the spring career fairs? Will I still have a shot at internships during that time or is everything pretty much filled up? By then, I will have solidified GPA (working hard to keep 4.0 through the semester) and a couple of applicable skills (Creo and Python). Also, my next set of coursework will be Design for Manufacturability (more 3D modeling and design processes/methods/tolerances/etc.), diff. equations, electricity and magnetism, and statics.

Tl;dr: I am a freshman taking somewhat advanced coursework for my age and was wondering what kind of internship opportunities are out there, especially with respect to spring career fairs.

First time poster here and I'm actually very new to this subreddit. I was searching around in r/relationship_advice for a situation similar to mine when I stumbled on a comment suggesting this subreddit! I'm going to try to keep this as concise as I can because I really really really would like people to read it and give their opinions. I could really use the guidance and from what I've seen, this subreddit is very caring towards its users :)

My girlfriend and I have been dating for about 6 months now. We met at the college that I attend in Wisconsin because for the last three years she had been going here. Her school performance had been suffering and she kind of attributed it in part to this university not being a good atmosphere and fit for her and she decided she was going to be returning to her family in Missouri and transferring to a school in that state. This was before we began dating. So we started hanging out and hooking up and that led to us dating and really enjoying spending time with each other. The school year ends and summer comes, she leaving. Originally I didn't want a LDR, but I didn't want to lose her either so I go for it. Everything is going fine in the LDR, but they we start to lose touch a little bit and communication kind of breaks down.

About two months ago I'm out at a bar one night and we start talking through text about the time line of our relationship, and how we will be a LDR for the next 2 years at least probably 3. She tells me she can't do that and was expecting me to move down to Missouri while in my head I see myself starting my career off at the company I currently intern for. This night essentially ends up with her breaking up with me, but I figured things would be fine in the morning so I remain calm. We talk in the morning, she apologizes and we're back to normal again

Another thing that has happened is one night about 2 weeks ago we get into a discussion about if she's the girl of my dreams and if I see myself spending the rest of my life with her, and these questions kind of take me off guard and I respond with I'm not sure. I don't really know that I believe in all of that girl of my dreams, she's the one kind of stuff. I believe in finding a good connection with someone and building it, so that's kind of my outlook on relationships. This causes a fight, she tells me I need to figure out what I want and then the subject gets dropped until this past weekend. It gets brought up again and I tell her that I'm afraid that I'm not going to be able to make it in a LDR and she pushes me to make a decision and in the heat of that situation I say we should call it quits. We break up, talk a little bit in the remaining days about maybe getting back together.

I met with a councilor at school today and talked about this and kind of decided that my gf and I are kind of in limbo right now. After searching around on here and relationship_advice I realize that we never had an endgame plan and our communication quite honestly sucked. Her and I talked about this and we kind of set up what would be our endgame and how we would improve communication if we got back together. I want to talk about those things next.

She didn't have any friends upon moving back to Missouri outside of coworkers from returning to her old job. This put a lot of pressure on me to kind of be her go to instead of her making new friends, but I never told her this and kind of let that just bottle up. I told her how I felt about this and she realizes that kind of pressure was not something she should have been putting on me and that she is going to make a much larger effort to make friends and make sure to allow me my space as far as that is concerned. 

I tend to think of myself as someone who enjoys my connections with others, but I also enjoy my alone time to just do literally whatever I want. I think most people enjoy this as well. So between school, my friends here at school and my girlfriend in Missouri I was having a hard time finding time for myself. I felt that if I was going to be staying home for a night and not doing something with my friends here, that that kind of meant that I was obligated to be spending time on the phone or on skype with my girlfriend and this kind of bothered me. Now, I'm not saying I don't want to spend time doing these things with her because I do, I just was having a difficult time finding a balance. Tying in her lack of friends and peer social life at her new school also influenced me to feel the way I did because I felt wrong leaving her to be bored by herself when I'm just alone at home doing homework or playing a video game or something. This is another thing I didn't communicate to her and left to be bottled up and factor into the break up. When her and I talked she said that she absolutely understands this and that I just need to communicate it to her and that would be fine and that she will be making new friends to spend some of her time with as well so this won't be such a pressure on me to worry about. 

We also talk about how we need to figure out a better system to see each other. Previously she said she wouldn't be able to make the drive solo and her mom wouldn't let her, so outside of when she had the financial stability to fly here or if her mom was coming this way to visit family, visiting would mostly be on me to drive. After breaking up, she had a conversation with her mom and she said her mom says she would let her drive here one weekend every month because she know what it would mean to her. So she came up with the plan to switch off months of visiting (she drives here, I drive there, she drives here...) and she's often up here for holidays due to family visits. It is also more difficult for me to get off of work than it is for her because I'm interning at a professional company and she is a server at a restaurant so she said she would also be willing to come up for school breaks so that she could be here with me and I wouldn't have to worry about missing out on work and not meeting the expectations of my bosses. 

She is studying education in Missouri and originally wasn't willing to come back to Wisconsin as she wants to live in Missouri and see's herself ending up there in her life. I personally have no idea where I see myself ending up, but I do know I want to start my career here in Wisconsin with the company I currently work for after I graduate. She will be in school still for a little while when I graduate and I she knows I want to start my career here so she says she will come back here to live after graduation and substitute teach. She won't have a teaching license for the state of Wisconsin so I'm not sure how this would work, but I also don't want her to leave where she wants to be just because I want to start my career somewhere she doesn't really want to be. I could honestly see myself having a long career at this company. 

Ultimately we're still broken up at the moment, but I'm seriously considering getting back together with her. I love this girl, I really do but I also know LDRs aren't for everyone and I do love physical connection and support. She is telling me to take my time and really think about what would make me the happiest because that's what is most important in life. She has shown that she's willing to compromise so now I'm just seeking some guidance from you lovely people. So so sorry that this is so long, I just needed to try and provide all my thoughts.

Thanks so much in advance!!! &lt;3

**TL;DR - Gf and I are in a LDR, communication and planning suffered and ultimately lead up to blow up and break up, guidance needed.**"

We met freshman year of college and have been happy together since then, excepting the occasional argument that every couple has. Over the summer, she went abroad for an internship. Michelle had always been a bit of an introvert, and was really worried about going, as she didn't really know anyone there and was afraid she wouldn't make any friends. But, at my and a few of her friend's urging, she did go, and it worked out amazingly for her. She made a lot of new friends, loved the job, and they even gave her a full time offer when she graduates in the Spring.  


I am, of course, super happy for her. She's got a well paying job already landed in a city she really likes, with a boss she likes, and friends there already made. The problem is this: We are very different majors, and while the city where her job is has amazing opportunities for her, there is a slim to none chance I'll be able to also get a job there as well. Previously, when talking about post-college plans, we always talked about staying in the same city, assuming we would move in together and see what follows. (We talked about marriage and both decided we would like to get married someday, but ultimately decided we were too young to think a ton about it yet)


With this new job though, everything has changed. The company gave her only until the middle of October to accept, and while both her and I have been applying to a ton of places, there hasn't been anything yet. She has a smattering of interviews, but nothing quite as appealing, and I have gotten jack shit (her field starts hiring much earlier). Michelle doesn't want to reject the job offer, especially if she doesn't get another offer before then, basically shooting herself in the foot (maybe in the head if she doesn't get anything else good). On the other hand, she knows that accepting the current offer does not mean well for our relationship.


If that wasn't bad enough, ever since she got back from the internship, she seems... different. We don't kiss as much as we used to, and physical contact seems like it's lessened. Whenever we got back from summers before, we were all over each other for a good week, but this time it seems like we skipped that phase. We've had sex only 4 times since she got back about a month and a half ago. I know that sounds whiny, but it's a huge decrease from before, where we would have sex every night for the first week we saw each other, and then sex about 2 times a week once we settled into our normal routine again. In general, it seems like she's checked out of the relationship, and when I asked her about it (we ended up talking for ~2 hours), she said that while she is worried about the relationship, she feels when I initiate sex, I seem too pushy and that takes her out of the mood before she has the chance to get in the mood, and then ends up getting annoyed. I sorta get what she means, but I'm not sure what to do. I find her extremely attractive, and of course I want to have sex, and even more so than usual, since I've been missing the sort of closeness that we had before she returned from her internship. It seems like a positive feedback loop, as the more I want to be with her the more ""desperate"" I seem. I get not wanting to come on too strong for a girl, but that's generally something for someone you've been dating for a month, not 4 years! It makes me feel neglected and completely unloved by the person I should feel closest to.


As I said before, we have talked about this, and she wants time, saying that things will stabilize and go back to normal, but I'm worried that there's not much point. It's been a month and a half already. If she's checked out of the relationship, sex and closeness are greatly diminished, and the relationship seems doomed anyway, then why am I here? I've been in a relationship all of my college life, skipping the stereotypical ""crazy college years"" for a girl I genuinely care about and love. With most of what I've just written talked about already on the table between us, she is very against breaking up. I'm worried that if we do end up breaking up, I'll be the ""bad guy."" since we've been dating since we got to college, we have the same friend group, and I'm also worried that it'll cause a huge divide, alienating either her or me from the group. We've been dating since most of our friends have known us.


Thanks for reading through my book. :/ If anyone has any advice, I'd love to hear it.

  ---   

  **tl;dr**: I feel like my girlfriend has checked out of the relationship and am worried I'm wasting my time in a relationship that is doomed to fail."

I recently bought this TA in June as a gift to myself. I'm currently in college with a daughter, and I was blessed enough to get an internship that afforded me the opportunity to continue my passion for cars, specifically Pontiac. Here she is:

1991 Trans am. Originally a 305 LB9 car, but was swapped with a 350 crate motor with &lt;10k miles. I'm not 100% sure of the engine since I can't reach the numbers by the distributor, but I do know it's the 5.7LG, and based on the head humps it was intended for TBI trucks. Currently TPI. Transmission was completely rebuilt with a shift kit right when I bought it. 125k miles on body, less than 10k on motor, and less than 1k on rebuilt trans. Mastercraft tires with brand new off-brand Welds. Paint is a Toyota color actually, painted by previous owner. Originally Maui Blue. WS6 suspension.

All I have done to it so far is remove the sagging headliner, replace the airbag wheel with a mid-gen 3 spoke, and replaced the gauge lights with red LED to match the later Pontiac gauges. It currently needs an aero spoiler, new rear end in the next 1-2 years, and the headlight motors rebuilt.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRFES6i0s_Q

Not trying to brag by any means, just wanted to share my car and my passions for Pontiac (currently have an 87 project and an 06 G6 coupe as a daily). And anyone willing to talk about theirs or living around Ohio who would like to get together as well while the weather is nice.

Thanks for reading!"
54uy7j,0,2016-09-28,Software to Embedded?,throwaway-CSCQ,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/54uy7j/software_to_embedded/,"Background: I graduated with a B.S. in computer engineering and a background mix of hardware and software (C/C++, parallel/GPU programming, microcontrollers, robotics). No internships, but some good class projects, a very good senior design project and some personal projects mixed in (Arduino/electronics related).

I've been trying to find a job for the last four months, but it seems like most companies want people who do web development and full stack stuff, and those that *are* looking for firmware/embedded engineers are trying to fill mid/senior-level roles that require years of experience I don't have. I've tried applying to both software and hardware jobs, but the furthest I've gotten are coding samples (not even a phone screen). I'm not worried about trying to get a back-end software engineering or web development job, but I'm worried if I accept an offer I won't be able to eventually move to firmware or embedded engineering. Is it realistically possible to start in software/front-end and move to hardware/embedded, or would I just pigeon-hole myself? I would love to do firmware/embedded engineering, but as this job search gets longer I'm starting to consider accepting nearly anything."
54v25d,5,2016-09-28,[OFFENSE] Vigil,antiquatedCreator,OverwatchHeroConcepts,https://www.reddit.com/r/OverwatchHeroConcepts/comments/54v25d/offense_vigil/,"Here's my second attempt at making an Overwatch hero, after my first (Astromancer).

Hero Name: Vigil

Real Name: Daniel Adamsson

Age: 20

Occupation: Holographic engineering intern

Affiliation: Overwatch

Role: Defense

HP: 250 (100 shields, 150 health)

Pros: Sacrificing almost all ranged capabilities, Vigil is a very close quarters defensive hero. Utilizing his sword, Vigil can quickly dispatch enemies before him by slashing his sword. His alternate fire gives him a bit more range.

Cons: He can be seen as an 'inferior Genji', as Vigil lacks the mobility that Genji does. He doesn't have a way to heal himself, and coupled with his poor mobility, this can be deadly if Vigil cannot escape combat fast enough.

***Contributors:***
Myself, Crappy_Warlock (Holographic Arena), Ultisaurus (Sword damage buff)

#Abilities

***LMB – Hard Light Sword*** Vigil's only weapon, capable of delivering 60 damage per slash. It makes a high pitched digital whistle as he slices through the air. It is weaker than Reinhardt's hammer, but makes up for this with its attack speed.

***RMB – Blade Shot*** Vigil aims his blade at someone and fires it at an enemy (in the same vein as Mei's alt fire). Deals 40 damage, 2 second cooldown for blade to reform. Takes one second to charge a shot. Makes a computerized 'rippling' sound as it is fired.

***Shift – Holographic Arena*** Vigil raises a cylindrical barrier around him and one enemy hero that he targets that's within range of him. The barrier has 500 health and cannot be climbed, but immediately falls if either one of the heroes in the barrier die. While up, Vigil and the enemy hero must engage in personal combat. Naturally, you don't want to encase a Roadhog with this, but it can be used to block off a healer from their party or to box in a mobile hero to fight alone. It lasts for ten seconds, and has a twenty second cooldown. You must be on near level ground with the targeted player, and within fifteen meters of them. The wall is five three meters high, but you cannot jump into the arena. You'll 'slide off the top'.

***Passive Ability – Parry*** Vigil always blocks quick melee strikes with his sword.

***Q – Pillar of Holography*** Vigil kneels as he drives his sword into the ground, erecting around him a circular wall of holographic light that extends into the sky. This wall expands for five seconds until it reaches about fifteen meters. It protects anyone inside the wall (as allies can pass through it) while enemy projectiles are eaten by it. Enemies that touch it take 30 damage per second, and get knocked back as the wall expands. A sound reminiscent of digital windchimes echoes through the air as Vigil creates this sanctum of holographic light. It lasts ten seconds. It stays at max size for seven seconds before shattering like glass.

#Character

***Nationality:***

Icelandic

***Personality*** 

A reserved young college student with a brilliant mind for holographic engineering. He interns at the company that supplies forces with holograms and hard light technology (such as Reinhardt's shield), and takes his job very seriously. He isn't the greatest at teamwork, and the company he works for notices this, and opted to send him into Overwatch to have him build his teamwork skills.

***Appearance***

Wearing a padded grey coat with a double layered hood, Vigil has plenty of room to swing a blade.It's similar to what the Assassin in this video wears, minus the beaked part of the hood and the backpack: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAgHeqxpXVk

***Backstory***

Born to caring parents, Vigil was raised in the aftermath of the Omnic Crisis in a place where Omnics were greatly despised. He did not grow a hateful prejudice to the Omnics, but was very wary of them regardless. Since he was a child, he had a very talented mind for understanding the intricacies of holography and hard light. Fascinated by holograms and the things that could be done with them, he grew up watching English and German documentaries on them, even if he couldn't understand them. He just wanted to watch. There were few videos in Icelandic about holography. He loved science fiction, and often emulated playing with toy swords in his yard like they did in the movies, which prompted him to briefly go into fencing. Unsatisfied with the competitive play, he quit and continued to pursue his hobby of holographics.

Soon, he entered university and began to major in holographic engineering. Soon, he began to intern at a company that produced holograms, hard light, and shields. He was brilliant, and the scientists loved the efforts he put to his work, but found that he had a difficult time working in a team. To get him more accustomed to working with others on projects, they sent the young Daniel to work for Overwatch as a holographic technician. At first, he didn't seem to fit with the 'hero posse', and instead kept to fixing their ship's holographic displays. They didn't seem to interact much with Daniel.

During one of Overwatch's training matches, Daniel had to go out into the field and repair a broken hologram fixture. He used his holographic technology to give himself a personal 'hard light tube' to sit in while he worked so he wouldn't get pelted with incoming fire. One of the heroes saw Daniel and had him figured to be one of the heroes in the match, trying to shoot him. It was a no-sell, and Daniel barely noticed. After seeing Daniel's own hard light technologies capable of defending himself, an Overwatch agent approached Daniel and asked if he wanted to try fighting once. Daniel didn't know how he'd fight, considering he had no experience with a gun. The agent tells him that he didn't need one, and that he can use whatever weapon he was comfortable with. They were supposed to get him into working with a team anyway, so pairing him with five others in combat practice would be effective in helping this. They had Daniel make himself a combat kit that he would use in a payload practice mission in the Numbani practice map, where he would put his hard light technology to the test...

***Emotes***

1. Flourish: Vigil spins his blade around him quickly, and points it ahead.

2. High Ground: Vigil points two fingers forward as he levels his sword with his cheek. (This is a reference to Star Wars' Soresu stance that Obi-Wan uses in ROTS)

3. Feel the Breeze: Vigil puts his sword away and lowers his hood, as a wind flows by him and relaxes him.

4. Homework: Vigil sits down with his laptop and begins doing his university work.

***Highlight Intros***

1. Heroic: Vigil activates his sword and holds the blade before his face before looking warily at the camera.

2. Holographic Kata: Vigil spins his sword about, a trail of blue energy marking the air as he drags it through it, before spinning it and holding it in front of his face with a determined expression.

3. One on One: Vigil tosses out some sort of device, which raises the Holographic Arena. He activates his blade, and holds it aloft, anxiously ready for combat.

4. Stab the Ground: Vigil kneels as the camera pans to his face. Anxious yet determined, he shuts his eyes and pushes his sword blade into the ground. The Pillar of Holography spawns around him and begins expanding, and Vigil opens his eyes as his sword's light illuminates his face from the ground.

***Skins***
Four main colors:

- Rauður (red)

- Blár (blue)

- Gulur (yellow)

- Grænt (green)

Epic skins:

- Snjór (white)

- Skuggi (black)

Legendary skins:

- Vísindamaður: Vigil adorns a form fitted, padded lab coat. Colored a dark grey.

- Tæknimaður: Identical to Vísindamaður, but gold and black instead of grey.

- Hermaður: Ancient icelandic armor, with dark fur and metal. His ultimate becomes a vortex of wind instead of a wall of light. His sword now has glowing Anglo Saxon runes lining the blade, and instead of firing blades, he shoots a more 'magical blast' from his sword.

- Hetjulegur: Same as Hermaður, but with white fur, lighter metal.

54v3mf,10,2016-09-28,Scared about first official day at work...,incessantnoise,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/54v3mf/scared_about_first_official_day_at_work/,"So I recently was offered a software engineering job in a pretty big company. I still think that this is a miracle... I never thought I'd get a job, let alone at a good company. My grades were average, I was okay in classes, but only were really good a in a few classes. My transcript is a spectrum of a small amount of As and a lot of Bs and Cs and a small amount of Ds.. I also never had any internships in my 4 years of college. Regardless, I got an interview with this company.

When I interviewed, I thought I screwed it up. They asked questions that I didn't know how to answer, there were things that I didn't remember because I only studied the night before.. I did well in the Java part of the interview, but that was about it. I feel like any first year CS can do the things that I was asked to do.

After just one interview, I got an offer.. It felt too good to be true. I accepted, thinking that I got lucky and vowed to learn more so that I can live up to the position I was given. I attended orientation... and everyone was friendly and the company sounds great... but in the back of my mind I have this feeling that as soon as I start working I'll probably get fired because they're gonna find out I'm not really good at programming, especially for the project I'm going to be working on...

Tomorrow I'm going to finally meet my manager and I'm super super scared... Like I'm frantically trying to study up so that I won't sound like an idiot in front of him... And I'm afraid I won't be able to cover everything before I meet him...

Has anyone here felt like this before? What was your experience at a first job like? Are there any ways to get over this feeling besides just absorbing as much information as possible?"

Hopefully this subreddit may be able to help me out, although I have noticed a lot of this subreddit is based in the US but any advice would be helpful.

I'm 24 with a Bsc (Hons) in Consumer Marketing, I have 1 year and a bit of experience in Marketing related jobs, be they social media marketing, to events marketing, guerilla marketing etc. 

I would say that I'm a good all rounder, I can graphic design, I can video edit, I can come up with exciting marketing campaigns ideas to generate consumer involvement, I am constantly looking at ways that various marketing campaigns are engaging with potential consumers and how I could improve it.

Anyways, I recently finished an internship for a digital marketing company, I was good at my job but they weren't able to afford me after the internship so I was let go. It was a handy job and I picked up a few more skills but in some aspects I sort of knew more than my employers. The thing that annoyed me about the job was that I was able to give ideas and they loved them but I was never able to meet the client to put forward the ideas, to look at the physical space and see what I could come up with.

Now that, that is over, I have been applying for jobs (Marketing Assistant etc) and I get rejected, even some jobs I am a bit more than over qualified for I get rejected. The job market is tough at the moment here in Ireland but it's looking more and more likely that I may have to apply for another internship and not get paid, just to add more experience to my CV/Resume, something I don't want to do.

What advice would you have for me?


Many thanks!"

I'm a senior CS student outside of the US. I'm planning to apply PhDs in the US. I've done a 4 months research internship at UMD, CP (at UMIACS MC2) this summer, and I've liked it there, I like the professor, and the topics we worked on. He personally invited me to do a PhD there with him. (I think I'll be a RA with him.)  But he also said that I have a good shot at first tier schools as well, and I may apply for them. But the problem with that is if I get admitted to another school, I need to do TA and find a good supervisor for the first years of my PhD.

So the question is:

1) School vs supervisor, which one is more important for a PhD in CS? 

2) Where does UMD, CP stand in terms of CS Grad schools? (Reputation, opportunities, quality of education etc.)

3) How does the school affect my future, if I don't consider joining the academia. (I want to work in private sector.)

4) What other schools should I consider, if I want to work on ML/Cyber security?

Thanks for helping, I would appreciate any advice and recommendations.

I'm your host, BreakFromReality, and I'll be accompanying you in your journey to find a fun, erotic roleplay.

Please check your ID with the security guard -- all potential RP partners and their characters MUST be at least 18.

So now that you're here, how do you get started?

First, you'll sit down at our [single-deck blackjack table](https://www.random.org/playing-cards/), where you'll be deciding the kinks of the RP. You'll be dealt eight starting hands of blackjack, with each total matching up with a specific kink. (For example, a 20 is for cheating.)

Here's the full list of kinks:

* 4 -- Dealer's Choice
* 5 -- Light Bondage
* 6 -- Group Sex (MFMF, MFMFMF)
* 7 -- MFM Threesome
* 8 -- FFM Threesome
* 9 -- Interracial/Raceplay
* 10 -- Anal (Woman Receiving)
* 11 -- Filmed
* 12 -- Clothed Sex
* 13 -- Dirty Talk/Name-Calling
* 14 -- Rough Sex (Hair-Pulling, Spanking, Light Choking, etc.)
* 15 -- Public Sex
* 16 -- Creampie/Risk of Impregnation
* 17 -- Facial
* 18 -- Risk of Getting Caught (i.e. ""hold the moan"")
* 19 -- Uniform/Costume
* 20 -- Cheating
* 21 -- Player's Choice

Once eight unique hands are drawn, you will choose two kinks that you would like to include in the RP. You will also eliminate two other kinks that you would not like to include. The dealer will then choose two kinks of the remaining four.

The Dealer's Choice and Player's Choice can not be excluded.

*(To play: draw 2 cards from 1 shuffled deck. Make sure all cards except jokers are included. Repeat this eight times until complete.)*

Once the kinks are decided, you'll decide if you want to stay on the main casino floor or head over to The Den. *(While I will absolutely play with everyone, those choosing to go to The Den will get VIP status.)*

If you choose the main floor, you will head to our [roulette wheel](https://www.random.org/sequences/), where you'll help decide the character you'll be playing. The women listed on the wheel will be character models only (with one exception).

The list is as follows:

* 0 -- Player's Choice of Anyone on the List
* 1 -- You, because you're always #1 at DPP Casino!
* 2 -- Bella Thorne
* 3 -- Dove Cameron
* 4 -- Laurel Coppock
* 5 -- Alison Brie
* 6 -- Kendall Jenner
* 7 -- Candice Patton
* 8 -- Margot Robbie
* 9 -- Vanessa Hudgens
* 10 -- Scarlett Johansson
* 11 -- Taylor Swift
* 12 -- Miley Cyrus
* 13 -- Ariana Grande
* 14 -- Emma Stone
* 15 -- Milana Vayntrub
* 16 -- Nina Dobrev
* 17 -- Rihanna
* 18 -- Sarah Hyland
* 19 -- Lily Aldridge
* 20 -- Mila Kunis
* 21 -- Stella Maxwell
* 22 -- Dianna Agron
* 23 -- Chloe Grace Moretz
* 24 -- Katherine McNamara
* 25 -- Victoria Justice
* 26 -- Carrie Underwood
* 27 -- Jennifer Lawrence
* 28 -- Selena Gomez
* 29 -- Emilia Clarke
* 30 -- Emily Ratajkowski
* 31 -- Meghan Markle
* 32 -- Jourdan Dunn
* 33 -- Katy Perry
* 34 -- Aubrey Plaza
* 35 -- Nicole Beharie
* 36 -- Ariel Winter

You will spin the wheel six times (12 for two-female scenes and 18 for three-female scenes). You will then pick three characters (six for two-female scenes and nine for three-female scenes). The dealer will then choose the character he would like you to play (the Player's Choice may get excluded).

*(To play: Set the smallest value at 0 and the largest value at 36, and keep it in one column. Take the first 6/12/18 numbers in the list.)*

Finally, it's time to ""role"" the dice at the [craps table](https://www.random.org/dice/) and see just what you'll be playing. The roles are below:

* 2 -- Dealer's Choice
* 3 -- Coach's Daughter
* 4 -- Friend's Wife/Girlfriend
* 5 -- Student
* 6 -- Sister's/Daughter's Friend

While at the Senate she made the mistake of wearing a distinctive suit jacket and blouse and she ran across Senator Hillary Clinton who was wearing the exact same suit jacket and blouse that day.

Then Senator Clinton saw Andrea in the hall and snapped her fingers and said ""Get rid of it.."" at which time Senator Clinton's Secret Service detail grabbed Ms. Petersen and pushed her up against a wall in a doorway alcove while Senator Clinton and the rest of her detail continued down the hall.

Ms. Petersen was prominently wearing her Senate Staff ID at the time, and stated she was allowed to be where she was. The Secret Service ignored her and let her go once Senator Clinton left the hall.

Andrea Petersen-Brown is the daughter of Tulsa Mayor Dewey Bartlett. And this is how Hillary Clinton treats other women, so why does she care about Donald Trump calling a Miss Universe contestant Miss Piggy?"
54wlgk,0,2016-09-28,Advice for Moving to Dallas/Forth Worth Area and Texas in general.,MizzouTiger2016,Dallas,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dallas/comments/54wlgk/advice_for_moving_to_dallasforth_worth_area_and/,"I was wondering if the individuals of this subreddit could shed some light on a couple of questions I have for seeking employment in the Dallas-Fort Worth area in Mechanical Engineering or engineering in general. A little back story I am a 22 year old college graduate that has been working in the MEP consulting engineering field for approximately the last eight months. While I do love my job unfortunately it is in Missouri and Missouri, well its Missouri not much more than that, however a few summers ago I spent all of summer break down in Texas working at an internship and completely fell in love with the state for a multitude of reasons. Thus, I would love to find employment in a state in which I want to live for a vast majority of my life. I have been applying to job boards like Indeed and other websites like that religiously for the past couple of weeks but haven’t heard anything back yet. So here are my questions:

1. Can anyone shed some light on the current market for hiring out of state engineers and having them relocate to Texas? Basically I’m just curious if any cities in the state or the state as a whole are struggling to find engineers or are the markets so saturated with engineers that it’s next to impossible to find a job.

2. Are there any suggestions in order to make myself look more valuable to engineering companies that they would take a chance hiring an individual from outside the state? I like to think I have a good resume, 3.13 GPA, worked 30 hours per week in college, vice president of a racing team, registered Engineering Intern in the state of Missouri, trying to get into a distance grad school and currently employed. But by all means if there anything that somebody would recommend that would be great.

3.I guess the third and last question builds off number 1 but if anyone has been in successful acquiring a job within the state how long did it take you? 2 months, 3? A year?

Again if anyone has an advice/feedback for my current situation that would be great!"

54x4hi,3,2016-09-28,Quarter Life Crisis.......what now?,sterlingarcher00021,quarterlifecrisis,https://www.reddit.com/r/quarterlifecrisis/comments/54x4hi/quarter_life_crisiswhat_now/,"In a nutshell: I'm a mechanical engineering student. I'm on my last class and I'm looking for big boy jobs now. I can't bring myself to accept the life that is in front of me. Odd you might think...because most people would kill to have a mechanical engineering degree. That is perhaps one of those the ""grass is always greener"" things I guess...people need to believe there is something better in front of them for their own sanity I guess.

     Anyways...I'm 27. School has been very hard since I got depressed around 4 years ago (probably had something to do with horrible co-op experience too...I know internships usually suck, but I observed the senior engineers at work and it made me want to vomit). I guess I realized I don't really ""like"" any degree major enough to be interested for 4-5 years and then the rest of my life after. So I threw as much adderall, anti-depressants, binge drinking, and coffee at school work and coping as I could and I've made it this far. In hindsight, the damage that did to my body, mind, and spirit was probably not worth it (I'm pretty sure I've lost some years off my life)...but, I was too far in to get out due to the school debts. Probably TMI...but when I was 24/25 I got so depressed I couldn't achieve a proper erection for like 5 months...I was terrified. It is from this time in my life that I learned that when someone is THAT unhappy, literally nothing matters or is good enough to compensate...thus making all of the sacrifices to get the degree in the first place pointless, which is just a whole extra level of depressing.

     So yea...I'm smack in the middle of my quarter life crisis. My main problem is that I don't see it as a ""phase"" to ""get through"" and ""grow from"". It seems to me that the quarter life crisis is actually a process in which your mind is run through a meat grinder until the ""Theory of Cognitive Dissonance"" changes your outlooks and opinions as a means of psychological self-preservation...those people who struggle with objectivity seem to complete the process so so fast compared to the very objective minded. I wish that I could unlearn the psychology stuff that I looked into. So I actually feel that this process is involuntary and something foreign being imposed upon me. I feel trapped. How does one overcome this?

     I used to be a bit arrogant...I was a big seeker of knowledge and truth. I've now hit a point where I'm like...wow, I guess the truth doesn't really matter at all. At the end of the day, what matters is how you feel and what you believe...because we live we die and that's the end of it. Would you rather know the truth or be happy? So I find myself wishing that I could just believe in this career path and be enthusiastic about it...brainwashed or otherwise. Although, that may just delay the implosion until my mid-life crisis...it's a crap shoot...it really is. I'm basically that guy ""Cypher"" in the matrix who wants to get plugged back in because reality sucks so bad haha...

54x4xf,2,2016-09-28,How should I rate myself?,Chrisl008,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/54x4xf/how_should_i_rate_myself/,"I am asking this question in the context of a junior level recent college graduate. I recently applied for an explicitly stated Junior Level Developer job. They were pleased with my application/resume and asked me to complete a take pre-interview assessment. Now this assessment is made of 6 questions 3 personal and 3 technical. Of the three personal I was able to answer two of them no problem; the third question is a self assessment of my skill level on a scale from 1(heard of it but no experience) to 5(expert) with ""2"" being ""entry level &lt; 6 months real world experience"" as it pertains to specific Computer Science skills(ex JavaScript, Angular, C++ ect). 

My dilemma comes in having trouble deciding if I should rate some skills as a 5(ex C++) because my educational background is in it, or as a 2 because I only have 4 months real world experience(1 internship and a 1 month temp job). 

I know the purpose of a question like this is to test honesty, humility, and confidence simultaneously but I am unsure of how to go about assessing my skills to convey both experience and honesty. Does anyone here have a good rule of thumb for questions such as these?"

A big industry in downtown Los Angeles that dealt with many movie, tv and rock stars. Basically, offering rich and famous people services to handle their careers while also giving fresh faced wannabes the opportunities.

Katy was one of them, a young girl that wasn't even 21 yet dreams of making it in music, becoming a world known star. She had tried numerous times and had many meetings with companies to try and get her talent across to no avail. Eventually the money she saved up from her part time job while she was in school dried up and she had to pick up a job in L.A she she thought why not a business in a similar field to her dreams.

Katy remembered when she walked into the office for the first time, people couldn't believe what she looked like and you think they would be accustomed to seeing gorgeous people all the time. She had worn a pair of red 6 inch stilettos and a tiny pencil skirt that would of been the shortest a woman could wear. Thigh high stockings that hugged tight to her legs that were held up by clasps attached to a garter belt. The tight blouse she wore strained her rather biggest assets, her double DD breasts that were pushed up in her black bra. They bounced around as she worked around the office, attracting the attention of many guys. The man Katy worked for was always delighted to see her, his eyes filling up with lust as he looked her body over before leading her into his office and shutting the door.

Katy regularly wore clothes that brung her attention, it was always another pair of 6 inch heels, short skirts and stockings accompanied by a tight low cut blouse. Guys around the office started to talk about Katy, about how they would love to ram her as she bent over their desk. Many guys often tried to get with her but she always refused.

Soon Katy developed a reputation for being a strong feminist supporter. She thought that all men were pigs for treating women as nothing more than a pair of tits and ass with a pretty face. That's how Katy felt in meetings, guys would get sidetracked around her and just stare at her boobs or ass. They wouldn't take her seriously and thought that she was just a slut. She thought that guys only chatted to her because they wanted to fuck her and weren't even calling her by name around the office, she overheard them calling her by her big tits.

Though what Katy did, didn't always match up with what she said. She would scold men for staring at her body when she wore revealing clothing everyday. She would also find every excuse to bend over to give everyone a good look at her, regularly dropping things on the ground. She would get angry at guys all the time for flirting with her as they obviously wanted to fuck her but she would flirt with guys all the time brushing her hand near their groin and giving them a sexy, sultry look as she walked away.

One day the CEO came to the office and went to a meeting room with about 30 other businessmen. They were all aged between 50-80 years old. After about an hour, Katy was called into the meeting room. Jason, a fellow coworker had a desk right in front of the room, he watched her strut in their, clad in her tight clothes. She closed the door behind her. It must of been 4 hours until the doors opened again, with the old guys walking out with satisfied looks on their faces. They talked about how great that was and how they must do it again soon. Out Katy stepped as they finally all left. Her hair was disheveled while she was fixing her rumpled blouse and rolling down her skirt while carrying her stilettos. As she walked she pulled out a curly hair from her mouth and wiped away a bit of stickiness from her lips. Going to her desk and continuing work like nothing happened.

------------

I want this role play to involve scenarios following the womens career such as trying to break into the industry (a lot of time spent as the secretary), dealing with the sudden fame, hook ups with celebrities, sex tapes, paparazzi, fans, relationships, becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol and turning into a nymphomaniac.

The prompt above doesn't have to be the start or involved in it... just an example of some writing.

Can be different and have a male celebrity and their journey. (Check out my 'Famous Life' posting in my post history for that)

I want to play the males the celeb will encounter. I want someone to play the main lead which will be the young female starlet. I would love for the young starlet to be Katy Perry or Kylie Jenner but I like a lot of other celebs as well such as Taylor Swift, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande, Megan Fox, Margot Robbie, Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Alba. Though.. the female celebrity can be an original character that is made up would love her to look like Madison Ivy or Lana Rhoades though also into Lindsey Pelas, Emily Sears and Claudia Alende.

I prefer to roleplay on Google Docs and use messengers to chat and set things up such as K , skype, yahoo msger and google chat/hangouts. Want this to be a long term rp

If you are interested and wish to talk about this further send me a message. Please make your message to me detailed and include any character/ scenario ideas, which celebrities you like and what platforms you use.

P.S Also have a recent posting in which I mention all the rp's and things I'm interested in for a long term rp, so check that out if you want, particularly interested in doing a Marvel Black Widow RP or a Post apocalyptic/dystopia world that is similar to Fallout or a Bioshock rp.

For as long as I've been concerned about online privacy, Facebook has been enemy number one. For some reason it always seemed more insidious than other services, even Google, because it felt like there was very little you could do to protect your privacy or opt out of invasive data collection. It always seemed to be the most greedy, the least shameful with their data collection, the least afraid of crossing boundaries, etc.

I've recently started to come to grips with the fact that I may have to get a Facebook for college. I've seen the message that you should protect your privacy but not in a way that's going to cause serious damage to your social/professional life and make you isolated and unhappy echoed numerous times on this sub, but I still feel extremely hesitant. Most of the social clubs, professional clubs and organizations, and a bunch of opportunities/news for internships, jobs, and student research positions are now primarily or even exclusively advertised on Facebook. Facebook is the primary mode of communication for most student organizations. It seems to be the primarily mode of communication for clubs, study groups, and other school events. My first year of college I missed out on so many things because I felt like I was kept in the dark not having any social media whatsoever. It really does alienate you from other people too.

So now I'm in a catch-22. Sacrifice some of my privacy for an improved social experience and more professional and academic opportunities at my university, or continue to be a ghost online and miss out. I know most people my age would pick option one in a heartbeat, but I just feel so sick. I've tried so hard up until this point to retain at least a little bit of my privacy, and I feel like all of those efforts will be for nothing if I cave in and get a Facebook. I don't want to see my hard work come crashing down. I'm terrified that whatever browser I use, no matter how many adblockers, cookie cleaners, VPNs, and other addons I use, no matter how many settings I tweak or if I religiously sign out of Facebook after I'm done using it and never click on their adds, click the like buttons embedded in other web pages, or sign into other websites using Facebook - that it won't be enough.

What should I do?"

so as title says, I'm completely lost and I'm getting desperate.

So, first of all I love IT related to systems; I enjoy reparing PCs, doing some help desk tech support, administrating domain servers, taking care of server racks... can't say the same thing for programming tho, I made some shellscript,coded a nice PHP page for my personal use, selflearned advanced javascript... but It doesn't fulfill me at all.


I'm 20 years old, and I studied an official 2 year course (Grado Superior) of ""Computer Systems Administration in Network"", we call it ""ASIR"" here in **Spain**. I don't know what's the equivalence in american or other european education systems, but basically I learnt a lot of SQL, Windows Server, Linux and I'm somehow prepared for a CCNA R&amp;S exam. I did some internship work (mandatory for completing the course, for free sadly) in a computer consulting company... I enjoyed it a lot despite being exploited 11hours a day w/o payment (they can't pay me by law, but they didn't ""thank me"" too haha).

Now here's the problem. I don't know how to continue. 

I started Computer Engineering this september, but I realized I don't want to do it: it's 60% programming and 20% non related to what I want to do. Also, the big amount of math is making me suffer from anxiety again after a lot of time trying to beat it. I feel no motivation at all and I'm 95% going to abandon it.

So... I don't know what to do now:

- Certifications? There are too many and I'd love to study every one of them, but my money is limited. Like 1000€ and a RHSA exam costs 450€

- The 2 remaining official computer courses are only for web developing (programming) and the other is basically java (android), I know they won't fullfill me.

- Internship working for getting experience? (companies, at least here, love IT) I know some friends who do nothing related to it too, and that scares me.

- Do a 1 year course of something (called master here)? I've found advanced courses for Linux, Windows server, networking...

- English certification, not really a doubt.

So so few options, so many doubts... I know my grammar/vocabulary isn't the best nor my formal english. Sorry.

I hope you can illuminate me a little bit"

54xs2w,2,2016-09-28,"Me [25 M] with my Girlfriend [25 F] 3.5 years, Not sure if I should continue in this relationship, feel stuck.",someguyabroad751,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/54xs2w/me_25_m_with_my_girlfriend_25_f_35_years_not_sure/,"Long Post Ahead.

My girlfriend and I have many problems, which I'll detail below, but before anything I must say I'm pretty sure I love her and that she loves me back.
The first year or so of our relationship was all I could ask for, and then some more she was loving and cared for me a lot. As time passed we had a few fights because she acquired a habit of mistreating me publicly, E.G. we’d be on the car and an argument on which music would be put on would derail onto her calling me her bitch and just do what she tells. I do understand that was one of the messed up ways she dealt with her insecurities, I got really fed up with a lot of it was clear to her something was bothering me, after some resistance I told her I was unhappy with our relationship, that was just before she travelled for a show in another state, when she got back things got a little better on that regard.
During that same time our relationship had already started cooling off our sex life was slowly dying and I tried to understand what was causing it, I asked her, we talked about it many times during the past couple of years, and as she asked me to, I didn’t stop taking initiative, but taking initiative has resulted on me being thoroughly rejected literally hundreds of times. For the past couple of years our relationship has been getting steadily colder with a few spurts of heat throughout the year, it always hurt me pretty bad so I’ve been constantly dissociating myself from this part of our life. 

Meanwhile as I tried to rekindle our flames I was focusing on other aspects of our relationship such as each other’s companies, watching movies, series and eating together things have been peaceful but unchanging, and another bad habit started to form, she became very dependent on me for many aspects of her life, I helped on her job applications, college work, took her to doctors, helped paying for the groceries in her home, and I’m happy to do it, but sometimes it feels she sees it as more of an obligation of mine that I MUST do, instead of something I do out of love, and she’s sometimes harsh when I’m late to pick her up at work and things like that. So now we’ve gotten to a point in which her life is in a dark place, she feels like I’m the only good thing in her life, and tells me she doesn’t know what she would do with her life if I left.

My company started lifting up, I’m getting better known, better looking, and she sees a potential homewrecker in any girl she doesn’t know who approaches me, especially with beautiful women. And a lot of those insecurities are getting projected on me, demanding me to stop being so nice to my new intern (who happens to have a crush on my business partner as I found out on her coaching sessions, as I explained to my girlfriend). Last month we almost broke up because I literally broke down crying from all the pressure and rejection, but we decided to give it a last shot. 

Things were feeling like they were improving and there was hope, but he had a fight Sunday, because I said I was forward a political reform on social security, she flipped out, called me a son of a bitch, said I was a spoiled rich mother fucker who cares about nothing but money, among many other things, and I just completely disconnected from our relationship since. She still wants to continue trying to work on things, I’m not sure we should. Not anymore, so well, should I stay or should I leave?.
 
PS: her father passed away long ago and her mother in completely nuts and unable to provide her with any support whatsoever.
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: my girlfriend of 3.5 years and I have been trying to improve things on our relationship for over 2 years, without success, she's very reliant on me, and implied she would die if I left. I don't know what to do."
54xu6u,21,2016-09-28,Jim and Sam being diplomatic is enraging,twinkskc,opieandanthony,https://www.reddit.com/r/opieandanthony/comments/54xu6u/jim_and_sam_being_diplomatic_is_enraging/,"Sam used to spend time with Opie and his family outside of radio stuff all the time. Sam said that, after Ant got fired, Opie hadn't spoken to him in over a year and when Sam told him he'd be happy to fill in for Opie when he's on vacation and whatnot, Opie never once asked Sam to do the show in his place. He only came on after Jim asked him, because Opie was out.

Opie made it clear that he didn't want Sam on their show unless he was going to do **all** the heavy lifting for Opie with things like Jocktober or the Intern Scuffles that he would cover on the After Show. Opie just wanted to sit back and commentate on the work Sam already did.

Sam should despise this guy the way we all despise a manipulative, asshole of a boss.

Jim was being less diplomatic but still to a maddening level.

Stop with this ""yeah we both can't stand each other but I don't hate the guy, he's done a lot for me"" attitude. There's no way Ant and Jim didn't, at least occasionally, talk about how terrible it was to work with Opie and how much it drained them to deal with him, day in and day out.

Jim said O&amp;J was so bad that it reduced his draw at standup shows, which is the only benefit he got from exposure on the show. He can pretty much solely blame Opie for the drop in ticket sales because he did stuff like shun Uncle Paul, not just from the show, but from Best Of's, etc. Or how he would just not have fun or go along with any of Jim's jokes, treating him like an outcast or some kind of poser on a show that he's a part of.

I'm annoyed that they got this reaction out of me but it's really time to drop the pretenses and just say what they want to say. Anthony finally did it and he's glad he did.

**EDIT: I forgot about Jimmy saying he would get vicious if he had to, there is hope yet.**"

54yovj,16,2016-09-28,Ways I had it easy when I deconverted,spongue,exchristian,https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/54yovj/ways_i_had_it_easy_when_i_deconverted/,"It's been interesting reading the posts on here and all the struggles people had when leaving their faith.

For me, the hardest part was the overturning of my basic worldview; everything I thought was true, wasn't anymore, and it was disorienting. I was no longer an immortal being; belief in heaven had helped me get through scary times (open heart surgery). Along with this came the realization that I'd been shaped in many ways growing up that made no sense. It took 2-3 years of mental turmoil before I was finally able to accept that I just didn't believe in God and I had to move on to figure out what I did believe.

But some parts of my deconversion were pretty easy compared to a lot of what I'm reading here. 

I started dating my first girlfriend at age 17. We'd known each other since age 12 but she'd more recently joined my church and youth group, we went on a mission trip together, and after realizing we were passionate about God in all the same ways (and emailing daily for months), we started dating. 

We got married 2 weeks after I turned 20, having spent one school year overseas at a bible course, and another year at university; she had gone straight to university. While in Bible school I had really started to doubt the validity of God, the Bible, etc and eventually I would realize that I had absolutely no evidence that he was present with me or had made any difference in my life. At the time of our marriage I was still clinging to my faith desperately.

At age 21, after 1 year and 9 months of marriage, my doubt got to the point where I just couldn't take it anymore. I had to come out. I'm not someone who can pretend to believe something I don't. So, I wrote up a 3 page, single spaced word document about my process of deconversion. Why I doubted, the problems I saw, what I was afraid of. I was at work and I sent this email to my mom, dad, and wife. I was super nervous about what they would say.

I got a reply pretty quickly from my wife, which she included my parents in. She was 100% on the same page as me! We had been sharing our doubts for a while, but I didn't know if she was ready to make the jump like I was. So that was awesome. We had each other to go through that whole process with. In our whole process from rabid Christians to atheists, and then even exploring ideas like pantheism and other ""universe"" mysticism and Buddhist-ish thought, we've pretty much always been on exactly the same page. The same is true for politics and social issues. We eventually got divorced, but that was for other reasons.

My parents weren't on the same page, it kind of made my dad uncomfortable but after a couple more exchanged emails he basically accepted it. Last I heard, he was thinking of himself as an agnostic; he says that my loss of faith really affected him. Funny because I'm pretty sure that the earliest hints of doubt in my life were because I could tell he didn't really believe. My mom didn't try to argue with me, she's a Christian to this day but what's cool about her is that she doesn't make her fears my problem. She probably worries and prays about it somewhat? Just like she's concerned when I go hitchhiking or thru-hiking. But she never tries to control me and actually our relationship is quite good. So I had it relatively easy on the parent front too. The rest of my religious relatives probably know by now but they don't bring it up with me.

Socially, I also had a pretty easy time making friends who weren't believers. I was living in Portland, OR, working as an engineering intern, and then back in Corvallis to finish school, and within a year I had at least a few good friends who were atheists. The metal scene is also a very safe place to be an atheist, especially in Portland.

So I don't know why I'm sharing this, I guess partly to say, wow I'm sorry for those of you who had it so rough in those areas! I don't really know what that's like. And maybe to encourage others of you that if you do come out more publicly, it's not necessarily guaranteed to be as hard as you think."

Mistakes I made that I wouldn't have gotten without practice:

what's expect output, 
go through a case/sample, 
preferred data structures to use?

I tried to hammer it out since it was mid range. Also I should have focused on the output rather than making conditional statements out of written prompt

I've been talking to this agency (for an internship) since a couple weeks after graduation. After the interview I was told to contact them in a couple months as they couldn't take anyone on. The CD who interviewed me seemed to really enjoy my style, attitude, and work.

After I contacted them again I waited two weeks without a reply. So I followed up again and the CD asked for me to send work (beyond what we reviewed during the interview) and that we would keep talking. I understand it takes a while to make decisions like this, but that was last week. I would like to have some type of status report because this is pretty frustrating as you can imagine. 

I've been applying other places as well without much luck. What should I do? I'd like to at least ask how far along they are in reviewing my work but I do not want to pester them. However, these long gaps in communication seem rather unprofessional to me. Going so long without work after graduation has been disappointing but I am holding out hope for this place since it has always been one of my top choices. 

I can provide more info about the situation specifically if anyone can offer advice. But I find it distasteful to plaster it right on the sub.

There are no obvious internships for Diablo (ALL the other franchises got at least one), which is strange because it's a natural entry point - there's a hardened development environment and infrastructure to learn on with predictable season-to-season updates.  Even with D4/D3X2/D2HD/WoD/Diablonopoly on the way, you'd think there'd be some movement there, but not even a mention?  Curious.

54zwk0,93,2016-09-28,Is getting an internship THIS hard?,throwaway_CoESenior,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/54zwk0/is_getting_an_internship_this_hard/,"Major: Co. E. , Senior finish classes by Oct 2017 but graduation is in May. 

I haven't had any experience in engineering besides coursework. I have the most experience as a ""computer tech guy"", but I really don't want to go this route. I have been doing tech work for 6-7 years and I don't want to do it as my livelihood. I can be lazy as hell but I have a monstrous amount of discipline. If I am guaranteed something for a task, I can bet my life that it will get done on time and correctly. My GPA is on the low end, 3.0. Early on in college I was learning for the first time. In high school I put no effort towards my classes and still passed with a 3.0. All my effort was towards my hobby (computers and gaming, mostly computers), I am the guy people call anytime they need tech help. 

I have been applying for a while, 30 resume revisions later (I used to submit cover letters too) and I still haven't received an offer. Am I doing something wrong, missing something? I have been working as a computer tech for a few years but it's not something I REALLY want to pursue.

Sorry if it's a bit ranty but I just feel lost. I really want to show off my skills in an engineering environment and I can't for the life of me find an internship. I guess I just want some insight from those that have actually gotten offers or any others that might help. 

A little about me, I'm early 20s, hispanic and first-gen. student. I am quiet but not shy. I only speak when I have to speak. If I know something that has been overlooked you will hear me. If I don't know something, I will ask like any human being. I have always been the person that listens. I just like listening to other people, I don't care about talking I know enough about myself and I don't care to let others know about me. If they ask they will probably get an answer but that's it.  Something that might not help me either is that I am very serious, resting bitch face type serious when I'm working. When I am working, I'm working and when I'm hanging out I am doing just that. 


EDIT: Just noticed this post blow up, thank you all for the advice"
5502gy,2,2016-09-28,Strain on Our Friendship,FutureProg,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/5502gy/strain_on_our_friendship/,"For the past few months I thought I was doing better at controlling my anxiety. This summer I had an internship and other than the flash of anxiety I had when presenting something to my boss I was in what felt like complete control. Looking back I wonder if I just shoved aside any triggers and am only thinking about them now (as in they've all suddenly caught up with me). 

Today my best friend said to me ""I'm tired of taking care of a six year old girl"" referring to how I react to certain things. I told him I've been trying to control how I act better, but clearly it wasn't good enough. He's always been there for me and for him to say that he must have been fed up. My insecure thoughts keep bubbling up, and I can ignore some of them but usually they slip out and we can normally talk about them. 

I don't think it's right for me to rely on him anymore though—I was wondering why he was so open to talking about my anxiety anyways. The most I can do to make him more comfortable is practice ""hiding"" what's bothering me I suppose. I'm thinking it's time for me to go to the councillors at my university but of course I'm afraid to do so (I don't want to become dependent on a councillor, and I don't want my parents to think about this..). 

I don't want to make him feel uncomfortable with these worries, and I don't want these thoughts of mine to keep interfering with my relationships. Sorry if this is so disorganized, I don't know where my head is at right now. 

Any thoughts? "

So I'm a Computer Science major. I'm currently looking at applying to junior webdev jobs in my area. I have a 6-month internship already under my belt working for a large company as a paid web dev intern. 
The trouble is, beyond that, I don't have a great portfolio right now. All I really have to show code-wise is just a lot of random half-baked projects on GitHub (Currently working on solving that with an actual project, a pomodoro timer). 

**My question is**, even though I don't have a solid portfolio yet, would it **hurt** me at all to apply to jobs in my area anyway? Or should I wait until I have a few projects under my belt and THEN start applying for jobs. I'm thinking the latter is obviously more *likely* to get me a job or internship, but is there a solid reason I shouldn't just start apply now even though I don't have any projects to showcase yet?    

Thanks everyone. 😁"

I am planning on majoring in CS(engineering school) from UVa, and wanted to know how I could get an internship over the summer. I don't have a GPA yet, but I plan on it being at least a 3.5(calc 3 may say otherwise, but we will see). I am taking an intro to programming class this semester, and some other stuff like chem, calc, and a required class interdisciplinary engineering class. This is probably jumping the gun a little too much, but I also wanted to become a quant analyst in the finance sector. An undergrad adviser suggested I should try for Fannie Mae and work in their IT division. 

I honestly wouldn't care that much if the IT internship(doesn't necessarily have to be IT, I just thought that field was in high demand)had nothing to do with finance, but it would be a plus considering it is harder for a person in e school to learn more about business, economics, and finance.

Does anyone have thoughts on this?"
550jbf,1,2016-09-29,Recreating an existing site in WordPress,HarmonicNole,Wordpress,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/550jbf/recreating_an_existing_site_in_wordpress/,"I've been tasked with updating a website for a company, as well as making it so they can edit things manually themselves.  I've gone with WordPress as I felt that was probably the easiest option for them to later be trained on how to use it and make minor adjustments.

The website currently is a mix of html, css, and php files someone else made.  I'm wondering if there's a way to get all of that together into a theme of sorts for WordPress to use, or if it's better to just start from scratch and try to recreate what they've got (with some tweaks)?

I'm admittedly a bit in over my head, as I've never used WordPress in depth, and before this hadn't worked on much more than rather simple sites.  This is an unpaid internship so it's not like I'm charging for my time, but I would like to learn and go about this in the best way possible.

Currently I have a local server going and a site setup in WordPress that I've been messing with a free theme to try and learn how to manipulate.  But I'm wondering if I'm approaching this wrong.

Any suggestions?"

One of my clearest memories of my childhood was playing games with the local kids in my neighborhood in Mumbai, India, and always pausing to admire the planes that flew overhead. My interests in aerospace grew further when my father would regularly take me to local air and space museums throughout my childhood. I knew I wanted to spend my life studying aerospace or space-related technology after seeing space shuttle Atlantis at Kennedy Space Center. I graduated from ___________ with a degree in Mechanical Engineering in June 2015, and currently work as a New Product Introduction (NPI) Manufacturing Engineer at __________, which manufactures parts for the semiconductor industry. I am excited to pursue a degree in control systems and dynamics so I can achieve a lifelong goal to work in the space industry, specifically autonomous systems in spacecraft.

My interests in engineering began in high school after discovering my strength in mathematics and interests in space. Through my core mechanical engineering classes in college, I became more curious about dynamics, vibrations, and control systems. Although each course presented extremely daunting and difficult coursework, they were also extremely rewarding. I was eager to apply this knowledge when I revitalized the __________ CubeSat project which aimed to design and build a functional satellite. I was the project manager for the majority of my senior year while working with Professor _____________. One of the specific challenges I took on was determining the structure of the CubeSat. The CubeSat’s structure was required to have 2 liters in volume, which poses interesting structural challenges when considering the heavy vibrations associated with take-off of up to 3000 Hz. I conducted a modal analysis of the CubeSat structure in SolidWorks Finite Element Analysis and was able to determine the most ideal locations to place bolts to protect the satellite from its resonant frequencies. This project helped me take a deeper look into vibrations and has since inspired me to pursue a degree in this field.     
During my senior year, I held an engineering internship at ____________, a startup biomedical engineering company. During this internship I learned how to scientifically set up and, conduct experiments, and make data driven decisions.  My main project was to determine the highest performing degassing unit which the company would ultimately rely on to remove dissolved gasses from the working fluids. To do so I designed the experiment while working under a senior mechanical engineer, then I personally designed and fabricated the fixtures, then used the design in an accelerated time study. I collected the data using a dissolved oxygen meter and the system’s dissolved oxygen meter and compared the results between different units to determine the best performing units as well as the best configuration of units. This experience has greatly helped me become a better engineer and I hope to apply this skillset in graduate level research in control systems.  

As a NPI Manufacturing Engineer at _______________, I have taken on monumental responsibilities and learned many new skills not attainable at the university level. I have successfully led the company’s first conversion of a part from new process introduction to mass production in the last five years, and lead another project which is responsible for 10% of the company’s revenue. My main responsibility is to design the manufacturing process to machine parts from raw material to match the customer’s design. This task requires expertise in multiple fields of manufacturing including solid modeling, Geometric Dimensioning and Tolerancing (GD&amp;T), machining, inspection methods, cleaning processes, packaging solutions, customer relations, and teamwork. In this position I am regularly required to diagnose manufacturing failures at any stage of the process, determine the root cause of these failures, and develop temporary and permanent corrective actions through a structured problem solving analysis. Although not directly related to my interests in aerospace and space, I have gained a strong sense of design for manufacturability through this work, and this skill will be critical when designing any device or instruments when developing research and professional work as a controls engineer.

I want to study the control of autonomous systems at the University Of Boulder, Colorado because it is a leader in the field of space craft controls, with groundbreaking research conducted in Colorado Center for Astrodynamics. Furthermore, Boulder also offers one of the only programs directly in my field of interest: Astrodynamics &amp; Satellite Navigation Systems.  The idea of reaching further into space demands for better technology in this field. One of many hurdles is time delays between communication systems. For example, there is a twenty six minute delay when communicating to spacecrafts on Mars. This calls for the technology to rely on real time autonomous systems which can operate in extreme situations and provide accurate and optimized solutions. I am interested in working with _________ to further efforts of low energy autonomous orbit transfers. I am also interested in working with ________________ to further innovate the field of real time satellite orbit and attitude determination. Additionally, I am interested in developing my own research and becoming a subject-matter expert so I can apply this knowledge and hopefully lead the effort to developing complex autonomous systems for the future of navigation systems and the space industry as a whole.

Pursuing a graduate degree in this field has been a lifelong dream, which I am ready to make a reality. Though working as a practicing manufacturing engineer has been enlightening and invaluable, I am excited to begin my graduate studies and work towards achieving my dream of becoming a Guidance Navigation and Control Systems Engineer in the space industry.

550vpu,70,2016-09-29,"OK, now I am at the end of my wits for 2017 summer internships. 100+ apps, 10+ explicit rejections, no interviews",zero2g,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/550vpu/ok_now_i_am_at_the_end_of_my_wits_for_2017_summer/,"Currently I am really at the end of my wits with regard as to why I am not getting any interviews and a whole lot of rejections. I am seriously expecting that my current resume looks to be something that is good and can land me interviews at top companies... however, that doesn't look to be the case.

The reason I am aiming at top companies is that I consider my previous internship to be a top one, and I fear if I were to take one that is well obviously lower, it would be considered as regression of sorts in my career which will be set backs.

My current approach is really apply to companies through online only (I am currently in an unique situation where I do not have access to my school's job board). I do have leveraged referrals to some companies.

The reasons on why as to I believe I should at least get interviews from top companies are:

* I have a 3.51 gpa
* I go to a what I presume at least a tier 2 target school (Waterloo)
* My previous internship is at what I considered to be a top location (Nvidia)
* My previous internship has involved me in top quality work (Application architecture and design)
* I have personal projects that does show some type of brilliance or achievements

Reflecting back on it though, there are might possibly be reasons as to why I am not getting such interviews even

* Maybe my resume isn't as good as I think (achievement wise and/or design wise)
* Companies maybe want US citizens (I require work authorization)
* I actually do not fit the roles?
* Maybe I am using the wrong channels... applying online has way too high rejection or ignore rates

By also analyzing some of the rejection letters I did get, a few do say they explicitly want 2018 graduates. Many says there is not a good fit or openings that match my skill set (assumed to be standard rejection).

My resume is available to be viewed [here](http://imgur.com/a/GOb0U).

Are there maybe any suggestions or insights? I am truly at my wits end because I feel like I have played my trump card but I guess it's not as powerful."
5511d1,1,2016-09-29,I'm wondering when life is going to stop violently fucking me up the ass.,yamzies,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/5511d1/im_wondering_when_life_is_going_to_stop_violently/,"This is a really long post. You don't have to read it. I just need to write all this out.

This past year (September to September) has been the worst in my life. I've dealt with general anxiety disorder since I was 12, but even then I was still a happy person. I had hobbies - I loved to read, I painted, I had a thirst for knowledge and wanted to learn everything about everything, I was always laughing (when I wasn't having an anxiety attack), everyone loved me. Now, I'm just a shell of who I used to be. I'm not the girl my fiance fell in love with. I'm not that amazing daughter parents cherished, I'm not the amazing owner to my dogs that I used to be. 

Last September I started school again to finish a diploma that I didn't complete because I failed a couple classes. It's a common trend with me... go to school, fail, drop out rinse and repeat. Still, despite that, I was still a generally cheerful person. This time was different. This time I knew exactly what it meant to be truly depressed. 

I had no motivation to do anything... simple tasks were absolutely brutal to try and attempt. I remember one day I had a dream that I died in a car accident. I was telling my fiance about it and I paused and I said, ""the fucked up part is... it wasn't even a bad dream"". That was when he realized that I was not in a good place at all. 

In November he proposed to me... I was happy, but it wasn't that burst of joy that I would've experienced had I not been in such a terrible place. The anxiety started kicking in. I felt worthless, I felt like I didn't deserve him, that I'll never be the partner that he should have. I still feel that way. 

In December I realised I failed a class. I wasn't going to graduate with my peers. Ironically, it was the easiest class too... the reason I failed? I didn't do the weekly homework assignments. Because I couldn't motivate myself enough to do them. I did the homework for the other classes because I was in teams and I felt pressured not to fuck them other... but when it came to myself, fucking myself over is easy. I didnt tell my fiance about it for so long because I knew he would be disappointed in me. He urged me to go therapy. 

I went to a few sessions of therapy and it helped, it really did. It was free because it was offered through school. I started feeling better. Until one day I got a call from the office saying that my appointment was cancelled that day, and I'd have to call back and book another appointment. I never did. 

In March I started my internship. I was supposed to complete 3 assignments for my practicum boss. I completed one, and I did a really good job. He was impressed. I had hope that I would get hired afterwards. Then the depression got really bad... I never finished the other two assignments. I basically ghosted them. I never passed the internship. My fiance doesn't know about this. 

In May I was feeling like I needed something to pick me up. I needed some excitement in my life. With my fiance's approval, I started posting on GoneWild. I've always been a bit of an exhibitionist, and I just felt like I needed something... praise and validation from strangers. He was ok with it... he had one request though, that I didn't send private pictures to people I was talking to. I ended up breaking his trust by doing it. He didn't tell me when he initially found out, just tried to justify it to himself. But one day he broke down and told me he knew. I felt like complete horse shit. These men were nothing to me, I just wanted to feel appreciated and feel beautiful... so I went ahead and did the one thing my man asked me not to do. 

In June, I lost my engagement ring after a night out partying with my friends. I still haven't gotten over it. I put it in my purse after washing my hands, and at the end of the night when I was really drunk, I saw a homeless person begging for change. I reached in my bag, scooped up my change, and dropped it into his cup. I realised when I went home that I must have given him my ring as well. I was devastated. My fiance was devastated. I was sure he was going to leave me, for some reason he never did... he's a saint. 

In late June, my parents found out I was posting on Gonewild. My dad called me a whole bunch of horrible names, my mother ignored me and would hardly talk to me for a whole month. I begged and pleaded for them to forgive me. I told them I would stop posting. And I did, for a short while. But posting was the only thing, is the only thing, that made me feel the slightest bit better about myself. It became like a drug. I started posting again, they found out, and they disowned me and kicked me out of the house. 

One night my fiance and I were discussing the wedding. He wanted to just go to the courthouse and not throw a party. I wanted a party because it's what I've always dreamed of as a little girl. He broke down and started crying about how he doesnt know how we'll afford it, and that he feels like shit because he knows I'm hurting so much, and he feels like he's not doing a good job taking care of me. I felt absolutely horrible that he's been keeping these feelings inside for so long. I was so caught up in my own bullshit that I never stopped to think how it was affecting him. When did I become so selfish?

For a while after I moved out from my parents house things were going fine, until I got the call on Sunday from my boss that business is really slow and she has to lay me off. I'm jobless. My fiance is supporting me now but I just don't even know anymore. Nothing is worth it. I need to find another job, I can't find the motivation to write a fucking cover letter. I can't go to therapy, because I can't afford it. 

The only reason that I haven't gone and killed myself yet is because I don't want to cause him pain. He's done so much to try and help me, I can't throw all that back in his face. I can't leave my two dogs behind, who both need me and love me, despite the fact that I've been a really shitty owner lately. If I knew that no one would get hurt, I would've offed myself a long time ago.

I'm exhausted. I don't know what to do anymore. This isn't who I am... I used to be fun, outgoing, carefree. Now I'm a shell of a person who does nothing with her life except post naked photos of herself online for people to jack off to, while hurting the ones she loves.

I'm your host, BreakFromReality, and I'll be accompanying you in your journey to find a fun, erotic roleplay.

Please check your ID with the security guard -- all potential RP partners and their characters MUST be at least 18.

So now that you're here, how do you get started?

First, you'll sit down at our [single-deck blackjack table](https://www.random.org/playing-cards/), where you'll be deciding the kinks of the RP. You'll be dealt eight starting hands of blackjack, with each total matching up with a specific kink. (For example, a 20 is for cheating.)

Here's the full list of kinks:

* 4 -- Dealer's Choice
* 5 -- Light Bondage
* 6 -- Group Sex (MFMF, MFMFMF)
* 7 -- MFM Threesome
* 8 -- FFM Threesome
* 9 -- Interracial/Raceplay
* 10 -- Anal (Woman Receiving)
* 11 -- Filmed
* 12 -- Clothed Sex
* 13 -- Dirty Talk/Name-Calling
* 14 -- Rough Sex (Hair-Pulling, Spanking, Light Choking, etc.)
* 15 -- Public Sex
* 16 -- Creampie/Risk of Impregnation
* 17 -- Facial
* 18 -- Risk of Getting Caught (i.e. ""hold the moan"")
* 19 -- Uniform/Costume
* 20 -- Cheating
* 21 -- Player's Choice

Once eight unique hands are drawn, you will choose two kinks that you would like to include in the RP. You will also eliminate two other kinks that you would not like to include. The dealer will then choose two kinks of the remaining four.

The Dealer's Choice and Player's Choice can not be excluded.

*(To play: draw 2 cards from 1 shuffled deck. Make sure all cards except jokers are included. Repeat this eight times until complete.)*

Once the kinks are decided, you'll decide if you want to stay on the main casino floor or head over to The Den. *(While I will absolutely play with everyone, those choosing to go to The Den will get VIP status.)*

If you choose the main floor, you will head to our [roulette wheel](https://www.random.org/sequences/), where you'll help decide the character you'll be playing. The women listed on the wheel will be character models only (with one exception).

The list is as follows:

* 0 -- Player's Choice of Anyone on the List
* 1 -- You, because you're always #1 at DPP Casino!
* 2 -- Bella Thorne
* 3 -- Dove Cameron
* 4 -- Laurel Coppock
* 5 -- Alison Brie
* 6 -- Kendall Jenner
* 7 -- Candice Patton
* 8 -- Margot Robbie
* 9 -- Vanessa Hudgens
* 10 -- Scarlett Johansson
* 11 -- Taylor Swift
* 12 -- Miley Cyrus
* 13 -- Ariana Grande
* 14 -- Emma Stone
* 15 -- Milana Vayntrub
* 16 -- Nina Dobrev
* 17 -- Rihanna
* 18 -- Sarah Hyland
* 19 -- Lily Aldridge
* 20 -- Mila Kunis
* 21 -- Stella Maxwell
* 22 -- Dianna Agron
* 23 -- Chloe Grace Moretz
* 24 -- Katherine McNamara
* 25 -- Victoria Justice
* 26 -- Carrie Underwood
* 27 -- Jennifer Lawrence
* 28 -- Selena Gomez

* 30 -- Emily Ratajkowski
* 31 -- Meghan Markle
* 32 -- Jourdan Dunn
* 33 -- Katy Perry
* 34 -- Aubrey Plaza
* 35 -- Nicole Beharie
* 36 -- Ariel Winter

You will spin the wheel six times (12 for two-female scenes and 18 for three-female scenes). You will then pick three characters (six for two-female scenes and nine for three-female scenes). The dealer will then choose the character he would like you to play (the Player's Choice may get excluded).

*(To play: Set the smallest value at 0 and the largest value at 36, and keep it in one column. Take the first 6/12/18 numbers in the list.)*

Finally, it's time to ""role"" the dice at the [craps table](https://www.random.org/dice/) and see just what you'll be playing. The roles are below:

* 2 -- Dealer's Choice
* 3 -- Coach's Daughter
* 4 -- Friend's Wife/Girlfriend
* 5 -- Student
* 6 -- Sister's/Daughter's Friend
* 7 -- Incest (Daughter, Sister, Cousin)
* 8 -- Friend's Sister/Daughter
* 9 -- Work Scenario (Secretary, Intern, Co-Worker, etc.)
* 10 -- Wife's/Girlfriend's Friend
* 11 -- Bully's/Bullying Victim's Sister
* 12 -- Player's Choice

*(If Celebrity is chosen, you will be playing the actual celebrity from the wheel instead of a lookalike. For 12, I am giving the option of playing either the bullying victim's sister or an interesting revenge plot with the bully's sister.)*

You will roll the dice four times. Of the four unique roles, you will then discard one. The dealer will discard one of the remaining three, and you will then choose one (or both, if possible) of the remaining two.

*(To play: simply roll two virtual dice. Repeat until four different roles are picked.)*

After that is done, we will have the RP with the characters, roles and kinks!

Now if you choose The Den?

Here's the list of characters for the roulette wheel:

* 0 -- Player's Choice of Anyone on the List
* 1 -- You, as a woman age 40+ (if you're not one already)
* 2 -- Rena Sofer
* 3 -- Nigella Lawson
* 4 -- Christie Brinkley
* 5 -- Eva Longoria
* 6 -- Rashida Jones
* 7 -- Jane Seymour
* 8 -- Elizabeth Hurley
* 9 -- Jennifer Lopez
* 10 -- Julianna Margulies
* 11 -- Patricia Heaton
* 12 -- Cheryl Hines
* 13 -- Jordan Ladd
* 14 -- Jennifer Aniston
* 15 -- Giada de Laurentiis

* 31 -- Kim Cattrall
* 32 -- Ellen Barkin
* 33 -- Sharon Stone
* 34 -- Paula Patton
* 35 -- Mary Steenburgen
* 36 -- Courteney Cox

And here are the roles:

* 2 -- Dealer's Choice
* 3 -- Coach's Wife
* 4 -- Friend's Wife
* 5 -- Teacher/Principal
* 6 -- Mom's Friend
* 7 -- Incest (Mom, Aunt, Grandmother)
* 8 -- Friend's Mom
* 9 -- Work Scenario (Boss, Co-Worker, etc.)
* 10 -- Wife's Friend
* 11 -- Bully's/Bullying Victim's Mom
* 12 -- Player's Choice

That does it for our tour! We can't wait to play with you, and we know you'll have a good time; others have!

I've been thinking about Google Practicum(opens Oct 3, apparently from the recruiter) and Explore Microsoft(open), and am still working on my resume, but I do plan to do these applications before mid October. 

While she was speaking to our club, she told us that it's possible for ALL of us to get in. And the fact we were all unrepresented - all girls, basically - that we all deserve a spot at Google. It seemed a bit odd, mostly because I know a lot of people who get rejected from this internship. 

I personally told the recruiter afterwards that I've been studying for interviews since mid July. I also told her that my first CS class was taken at a community college during the summer. She told me it was fine, that I just need to send in my transcripts. However last quarter someone was stalking me and I have a whole set of withdraws on my transcript which also concerned me. I know I really should have no excuses for that, but I do have official documentation from a Title IX office. I know GPA doesn't really matter but I'm a bit worried. I'm guessing Microsoft will be expecting the same.

So **A) Should I be worried about the interview process this much?** and **B)Will my transcripts possibly raise a red flag?**

I'd like to change that by potentially joining a club that not only helps me get experience in my field but is also fun and won't feel like a chore to go to. Also shouldn't be a wild time commitment.

I emailed a few clubs like buckeye bullet and the ASME club but I don't think are active currently (didn't know they weren't active until now)."

552h46,3,2016-09-29,Need a little advice (another one of those),PP8900,advertising,https://www.reddit.com/r/advertising/comments/552h46/need_a_little_advice_another_one_of_those/,"I posted my portfolio on here a few months ago (probably around March.) I received some positive and some negative critiques. But hey, it's subjective. I went to the One Show portfolio review to get some feedback, and sent my book around to past instructors (I did Continuing Ed at SVA) with the preface that I know my book isn't perfect, but I'd like to get a read of where I'm at and what I need to improve on.

The main feedback seemed to be that I write well and have some good headlines, but I need better ideas. I had a few food products. One instructor said that I need to diversify the products in my book because I'm maintaining too similar a voice throughout. Also, from looking at graduates on Modern Copywriter, I realized that I had too much print and not enough digital.

So I took a class that focused on 360, digital in particular, and developed a few new campaigns. I'm currently working on these campaigns and building them out. Pretty much I'm taking my insight and any headlines I have and designing everything on my own. It's not perfect, but I have some (enough) skills to make a semi-decent book. 

So here's the thing: I currently work in-house as a copywriter. I'm not quite sure if this works for or against me. I wanna work in advertising. It's been my dream for some time now. Seeing as my book will never look as good as someone from VCU—I don't have the design skills and can't seem to find an AD— do I apply for internships? Do I apply for a junior position? Will the fact that I've worked as a CW in-house for over a year mean anything?

I think my main concern is taking an internship then not being brought on full time. Does this happen often? Would I have to suck to not get offered a full time or do agencies sometimes offer internship then give a handshake and pat on the back when it's over?

I know I'm counting my eggs before they hatch but it's been bothering me as of late. 

Thanks in advance."
552hn8,206,2016-09-29,"I have an update for everyone, I asked for help here 2 years ago when I was 17 and told my imam stepfather and mother that I couldn't be Muslim anymore. Long story of everything that happened inside.",RebornSpartan,exmuslim,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/552hn8/i_have_an_update_for_everyone_i_asked_for_help/,"Hey everyone. Good morning. 

I made [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/29c8an/i_snapped_today_and_i_think_this_is_going_cost_me/) 2 years ago. 

Here was my situation:

Lived in the US since age 7 with with stepfather and mother. 

Physically abusive parents who enforced islam on me, broke my bones (literally), pushed me to my limited mentally, and put a road block in my education.

My parents had messed up my immigration situation as well, so I wasn't able to get a job, drivers license, any of that. 


The situation I described in the thread had happened, and then for a few months or so (if my memory is correct here), I told them I had just ""lost my temper"" so as not to become homeless and literally be sent away from home with nothing. 


I had a savings account with about $1300 in it saving up for this situation, as I knew it was coming. This was literally years of me saving up from mowed lawns, 4 winters of shoveling driveways, buying fixing and selling xboxs and gameboys from craigslist, etc. 

I met someone from that thread I made that helped me figure out my immigration situation. I owe all of emancipation to him. 

So fast forward to when I had to leave home. It was finals week at school (senior in high school), and I couldn't take my motorcycle to work so I had to borrow our only car. My stepdad texts me and tells me to come home because he wanted to take the car and go somewhere. I couldn't really argue. I used to get put in situations like this all the time from him. 

He values good grades, so if I leave in the middle of my AP statistics final he would hit me. If I didn't bring the car to him because I had finals he would do the same. 

He wouldn't stop texting me so I left, knowing I would get a zero. He was already angry I tried to stay out of the way as much as possible so he wouldn't take it out on me. 

He did, and something just snapped in me. I had been cultured, forced to just accept everything that happens to me in that household because islam said so, because I had no other options for a place to stay, because I wouldn't know where my next meal would come from. 

After he hit me for the last time, and I use that word lightly here it was always much more severe than a slap or something mild like that. I've had 3 broken fingers, broken my hand on multiple occasions, my back is covered in scars, the list goes on. 

Anyways after he hit for the last time, I kind of just stood there blankly and waited to see what he would do afterwards. He told me to get in the car, and implied that he would be taking me to school again. Not only was I in no condition to go back to finals while bleeding and in no state to perform final exams, but I knew he would likely keep hitting me in the car. 

This was legitimately the first time I said no to him, going against what he was saying directly, it was always Yes Sir (in arabic) and whatnot. 

He tried to chase me and gave up pretty quickly. He said if I didn't come back now that I wouldn't be able to come back. I didn't say anything and just kept running.

I know his schedule pretty well, so I knew he'd be out of town for a little while. I waited outside for 16 hours in the rain at the forest behind our house with my phone off to save battery life. 


I went to gas station and got some water after that, and looked on craigslist for somewhere to stay. I found a room with no bills for $400 a month. I texted the ad poster and kind of told him what was going on with me, but that I had an internship lined up and had $1300 in savings that I would be using to pay him. 

I had been calling places all week looking for an internship and finally landed one that paid $150 a week. It was only a matter of time before I got started there. Getting my immigration situation sorted was an absolute must for me to get hired *anywhere*. 

I went back where home used to be, looked in the garage window to see if he was still there, which he wasn't. I climbed up to my window and got inside. My room had been locked from the outside, what a surprise. I filled two backpacks with of clothes and tossed them out the window. I packed a suitcase of my belongings and whatnot, my xbox, halo books, extra motorcycle gloves, whatever I could fit in a carry on luggage bag and hid it in the woods. This was pretty painful because there were a lot of things I really wanted to take with me. My cat, the 3D printer I had just spent $400 building from scratch, the 3D modeling PC I built, some other things from my childhood that I couldn't really transport. 

Anyways, I hid that bag in the woods in a trash bag so it wouldn't get wet. It was really late at night at this point and I didn't want my mom knowing I was in the house because she would probably call my stepdad or just generally scream at me. They had hid my motorcycle keys but I found it, and I found the spare too. I strapped one my clothing bags to my motorcycle and put the other on my back, and finally left. This was one of the weirdest feelings I had ever, ever felt. I was so incredibly scared. I cried on the way there. My mother didn't treat me like her son, but I didn't have anyone else. I felt like I was betraying my family, but I felt so free. So alive. Like I had been in jail for decade and forced to memorize half the quran and got beat up my the other inmates when I forgot to pray or couldn't provide evidence that I had.  

I got cash for the first month and deposit on the room I was going to rent from an ATM and drove over there. The owner met me outside, I paid him, put my bags in the room and went back to get my belongings from he forest. I strapped those to the bike and came back to the room, my new home. It was an 8x15 room, but it was mine. No one told me I had to made wuduu, pray fajr, fucking read quran. I was safe. I was free. 


My motorcycle was my best friend for the longest time. He took me everywhere and I owe my life to it. Its taken me to work, its survived 2 accidents from texting drivers without needing repairs, its taken me through rain and snow, happiness and fear. I likely just needed something to get attached to so I wouldn't break and turn into a psychopath, but I felt like I needed to say something about here about it. 

The internship worked out. The placed sucked and the work was awful, but I didn't have a choice. I got 3 more jobs and literally worked 4 jobs at one point. 

My internship turned into a full time job eventually so I quit my jobs and focused on that. Learned as much as I could to hopefully upgrade to somewhere better. 

Its been 2 years. 

I got car after about 5 months of saving. The winters in the midwest don't spare anyone. 

I got new job after about 1.5 years. Much better place than my last. 

I got the title to my motorcycle after some fighting and threatening. My stepfather (Peace and Shittings be upon him) is a public figure and I could easily cause some trouble for him and his long term plans, so I finally ""owned"" my motorcycle. 

I got my cat back. I missed him so much. I went over when I knew everyone was out of town and he kept trying to get to me through the window when he heard my motorcycle. I don't think I had ever felt more sad in my life, but I got him back eventually when I found a way in. He's a champ. He lived in that tiny room with me (thank god he had an amazing litter box) for so long. 

I got my own apartment now. I have free time. I have freedom. There's so much that I can do now, and so much that i'm actually doing. 

This post was meant to be sort of an update as to what happened, and a way for me to vent. I don't want to ""voice my story out to the world"" but I want others here to know that its possible to live outside of the world of your family, whether or not they're abusive, Muslim, or just assholes. 

If anyone has any questions about the process, please ask. It wasn't easy but I got a nice job without college and i'm even working on starting my own business now. 



I've spoken to a few people about my situation and almost everyone has told me that my hate for islam is because my abusive parents, that whole deal about how theres too much bias in my past for me to have an actual opinion. 

I know more Quran than Muslims and i'm not Muslim. I don't *hate* islam with a passion, I don't speak out about it, or anything like that. But I will never, ever, **ever** support it ever again. When Allah refused to answer the prayers of 11 year old me asking not to get hit because I forgot to make my bed, or because I forgot to take my dish to the sink, is the day Allah became a joke in my life. I still prayed with authenticity until I was 13 because I thought maybe I wasn't praying hard enough? It never worked. It doesn't work. It will never work. If you're a muslim in the US and you have a completely functional family with no complications and you like the teachings of islam, then great. I won't hate you but the second you ask me to pray with you or try to tell me what I ""should be"" doing is the second you end our relationship. Share your beliefs, share your insight, but don't share your plans for me. 






**TL;DR** I lived, my cat is happy and my motorcycle get oil changes every 2000 miles. Life is good.

I sort of just whipped this post up at work so forgive any typos please.


People I'd like to thank:

The lawyer who helped me. I owe so much to you. Him and I are still in contact, he's a great guy but I won't link his account. 


My motorcycle and cat. Both are great beings that take in money and spit out happiness. 


This subreddit. Although /r/AtheistHavens wasn't able to help me, you guy (ex moose sub) was really helpful. Some people here are too liberal at times, but I still like you guys. 


Things I think are worth learning from this post:

Don't let anyone tell you how to think as long as you aren't harming yourself or others. 

Moving out is fucking hard don't do it unless you have a job. Going homeless seems scary as hell. 

Get a job

Have a hobby that makes you active. Motorcycles were mine. 

Get another job

Be happy.

We can discuss specific prompts in private and please, do not message me with a scene already started, that’s the easiest way to get blocked. The same goes for one line/word messages.

I'm fairly open with my kinks with my only hard ""no""s being scat, unrealistically huge cocks, 3rd person writing, and vomit.

Without further ado, here are some of my prompts:

**The Lawyer and the Con**: For this one, I was thinking I’d play a young and up and coming lawyer tasked with defending you. We can discuss the specifics in PMs but one thing is for certain, I’ll be taking my payment in the form of cock.

**Breaking the Law**: For this one, the roles are reversed, I was caught committing a crime and you’re the officer/journalist/detective who caught me. Where that leads? Well that’s up to you.

**Wrong neighborhood**: What happens when me, a young and sexy girl finds herself in the wrong neighborhood? Do you help me find my way or decide you want to take advantage?

**Sports Star and Reporter**: A classic scene were I’m a reporter and you’re the sports star, that can only lead one place, right?

**The intern and the boss**: Fairly self explanatory, I’d love to be the intern at her dream job who meets you, her boss and potentially so much more.

**Opposite Sides**: For this one, I want to play a FBI/CIA/DEA Agent who is tasked with infiltrating your organization, now what that organization does we can discuss in PMs but I basically want you to turn me from righteous agent of the law into your slut.

**I’m gonna fuck your sister**: For this one, you’ll play my little brother’s best friend, I’ll be his big sister who is now recently single and back in town. You guys always joked that you would fuck each other’s mom/sister only this time, you’re not joking.

**Giving back**: In this RP, I’ll play someone  famous be it an actress or singer or sports star. You’ll be the person tasked in helping me set up some sort of event to give back to the community, only you want me to give you something more than this event.

**Bullies always win**: In this one, you’ll be as the title suggests, you’re a bully who grew up terrorizing my son (or brother), only unlike the stories we tell our kids to make them feel better, you know better. You get what you want, when you want it, in this case, me.

For those of you so inclined, I do like playing celebs in any of these roles so we have visual aids, if you’d like me to be any, just ask!

As for celebs I’d play, here are a few, feel free to ask about ones not listed:

Celebs: **Mary Elizabeth Winstead**, **Maisie Williams**, Anna Kendrick, Selena Gomez, Hailee Steinfeld, Taylor Swift, Willa Holland, Daisy Ridley, **Melissa Benoist**, Emma Stone/Watson/Roberts, Hayley Williams, Alison Brie, Alexandra Daddario, Aubrey Plaza, Bella Thorne, **Alicia Vikander** Jennifer Lawrence, Keri Russel, Neve Campbell, Jennifer Connelly, Scarlet Johansson, Sophie Turner, Oliva Munn, Olivia Wilde, **Miranda Kerr**, Jessica Biel/Alba, Victoria Justice

Acid house techno cyborg disco geisha bears. Clashing colours, ethnic prints, straight-out-of-a-video-game shapes, sci-fi obsession, holographic finish, high-tech synthetics. “KISS THE FUTURE! FUCK THE PAST!” The wild world of Walter Van Beirendonck is an exuberant place, where outrageous styling and upbeat shows are underlined by serious messages, and serious talent on the part of the designer himself – something which is being celebrated by Antwerp’s Fashion Museum as an exhibition opens next week exploring 25 years of output from Walter Van Beirendonck’s eponymous line.

[Van Beirendonck](https://i.imgur.com/6csD4Zu.jpg) studied fashion at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp, before showing his first collection in 1983, as part of the ‘Antwerp six’ along with Dirk Van Saene, Dries Van Noten, Dirk Bikkembergs, Ann Demeulemeester and Marina Yee. What set Van Beirendonck’s work apart, not just from that of his fellow Belgian designers, but also from the prevailing moods in fashion at the time (the over the top glamour of Parisian couture, and the dark deconstructivism of the emerging Japanese school) was its light-heartedness and humour, combined with the designer’s bold visual statements and judicious use of colour and pattern. Van Beirendonck’s collections played on political messages about the environment, society and safe sex, while remaining optimistic, joyous and unerringly upbeat. If Rei Kawakubo’s counter-culture approach was to make everything dark, and perturbing, and semi-abstract, Van Beirendonck’s was quite the opposite: dress it up and pump it full of unstoppable energy almost to the point of madness. Everything screamed of youthful vitality – anarchy almost – and the postmodern mash-up of (youth) subcultures, from punks to acid house ravers to gay ‘bears,’ would come to frame a whole new attitude in menswear which persists today, with designers taking inspiration from further afield, including from womenswear, while pushing social boundaries with their work.

From 1993 to 1999, Van Beirendonck worked under the label W. &amp; L.T. (Wild &amp; Lethal Trash – or ‘Walt’ as it was known), staging elaborate fashion shows which often resembled huge warehouse parties more than anything else, featuring clothes with a distinctly futuristic vibe: ‘talking’ voice boxes, flashing lights, and holographic appliqués were common additions to the garments, many of which were constructed from high-tech synthetic materials. If brands like Boy London and BodyMap were espousing the vibe in a rough-and-ready way in London, while the likes of Moschino and Castelbajac were interpreting it with couture refinement in Milan and Paris respectively, Van Beirendonck occupied a unique position, blending high-end with ‘trash’ and cutting-edge with elements of mainstream pop culture. WVB’s work frequently blurs the boundaries between fashion and art (indeed, the designer has collaborated with the Austrian artist Erwin Wurm on several collections), and his ‘anti-fashion’ approach always provides an interesting meta-view of the haute couture world.

“I am so surprised that in 2010 people are still shocked by elements of sex and sexuality, as well as race and religion. These differences in people seem completely normal to me, and I am rather confused that it is not like that for everyone. I am trying to achieve an open vision and I want to show that there are many things socially possible today.” - Walter Van Beirendonck

When designers embrace a particularly ebullient aesthetic, there is often a danger than their true talent for making clothes (mastering the elements of material, cut, proportion, and so on) gets overshadowed by the overall aesthetic and energy. I wouldn’t call this a failure on the part of the designer, but it does mean a trained eye and some knowledge of the context is required. For the layman, the easiest response to much of Van Beirendonck’s work is to lay it off as mere absurdity – evidence of the ridiculousness of high fashion. What most people don’t know is that Van Beirendonck is a director of the fashion course at the Royal Academy in Antwerp, where he has helped now-famous designers including Kris Van Assche and Bernhard Willhelm on their way. A whole generation of young designers have been influenced by Van Beirendonck’s work too, from Jeremy Scott to Henrik Vibskov to Cassette Playa’s Carri Munden. And if any further explanation is needed for why I’m a huge Walter fan, consider this: he was partly responsible for turning to Raf Simons, a former intern of his, away from industrial design and towards fashion.

552qa4,0,2016-09-29,Thighs during first one night stand,ronald87,gonewildstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/gonewildstories/comments/552qa4/thighs_during_first_one_night_stand/,"Angie was 32. She lived in an apartment with two other women in Brooklyn, had been laid off from her job at a jewelry store, was looking for freelance work for making jewelry on Craiglist. That was how she put it. She had long brown hair and freckles, came from what I sensed was a wealthy family on Long Island (they actually lived on another Island, off the LI coast), but she dressed like she was a college student from the 70s and had a plain, earthy demeanor. Well, she was the 70s. This was 2009, so she must have been born in 1976/77.

I...was a twenty-one year old college student on an internship in New York that summer. Read some of my other stories and perhaps you'll glean a summary of me.

I met Angie at a summer movie screening at Brooklyn Bridge park. It was early July and I was staying in my aunt and uncle's house...and they were gone on vacation with their kids. So it was just me, housesitting. I couldn't make up my mind on where to sit and also, I kind of in general wanted to get laid that summer. It had been a few months since I'd had any women.

So I saw Angie, sitting alone on a blanket, and I sat down next to her. Not right next to her, but close enough so she glanced over at me and I at her. I wasn't sure if she was waiting for somebody or if she was just lost in her thoughts. She turned to me finally and asked if I knew when the movie would start.

The movie was 'Raising Arizona.' At this point, I ask you to please look up the theme music from that film and play it to the action of the rest of our night.

Hours later, once the movie was over and the crowd had dispersed we found ourselves wandering through Brooklyn in search of a bar. Angie's fat roommate, who had shown up later on, had said to Angie, ""This guy's really cute Angie. Congratulations."" It was awkward for both of us, but it also paved the remainder of the way for me to get with Angie. Thanks fat roommate! 

Angie and I had a single beer at a bar near my aunt and uncle's place and I kissed her on the cheek there at the bar, on impulse. As soon as we exited the bar, she began acting drunk. It had just been one beer. We stopped in the middle of the sidewalk and made out while standing. 

She was doing it to tell me something even if she didn't know it yet. She was saying that she should get home and I started proposing that she come back to my place for a little while. She was reluctant. I kept saying it. 

Guess who won that debate?

Let's flash back for a second; there was one point during the screening when Angie was coming back from the bathroom and I saw her looking around for us, confused. I called out her name and looked at her legs as she turned. She wore corduroy pants that made her thighs look truly, idiosyncratically, sexy. As I watched her walk back to her spot I couldn't wait to get those legs wrapped around me...

...Back to present. We lay on the couch in the living room. I finger blasted her. I licked and sucked on her tits. She wore a teal colored bra. I'd never seen the color against another woman's tits. It was, like everything else about her, eccentric. But I liked it. 

She touched my hand and told me to slow down a little and I slowed down a little. I worked two fingers in a circle around the inside of her dampening pussy and she ran her fingers through my hair. Her breathing got heavier until it had turned into a series of inhales and gasp-exhales. When the gasp exhale that coincided with her thighs going
SQUEEZE
around my hand, I thought, why is she not contracting around my waist already?

She apparently thought the same thing, because she asked, 
""Where's your room.""

First we tried her idea; she sat atop the dresser after I put on a condom and I took her while I stood. I moved back and forth but my cock kept slipping out. It was then that I felt the-

SQUEEZE

of her thighs against my waist. They squeezed me in her attempt to keep me inside of her.

But it wasn't working, so we moved over to the bed. She lay on the bed sideways, legs open, arms outstretched, whispering, ""Come here..."" and I steered myself toward the flappy pink mess between her thighs. She helped guide me in and I went back and forth, back and forth, while she went 

AAAAHHHH uuuuuhhhhhh AAAAAAHHHHHH uuuhhhhh

until I started cumming and my cock throbbed inside her and-

SQUEEZE

went her thighs around my waist, once again.

After she was dressed again and I was ready to walk her to the train and I'd gotten her number and we'd kissed again, she asked me how old I was.

I told her, ""Twenty-One.""

Something passed over her face. She said,

""Oh. Well, I'm thirty two. So...that's what that is...""

I walked her to the train and we said goodnight and I never fucked her again."

5537hj,5,2016-09-29,School Selection Advice,MBA_TrashAccount,LawSchool,https://www.reddit.com/r/LawSchool/comments/5537hj/school_selection_advice/,"Hello, r/LawSchool

First, if I am posting this in the wrong place please let me know. I gathered that the 0L sticky was for people already accepted?

Looking for advice. Be warned, this is a long read filled with detail that probably isn't necessary.

Background:
Graduated in 2013 with a B.S. in biology, math minor. 3.15 GPA from a Midwestern state school (due to full ride scholarship). No idea what I wanted to do with it, but biology had always fascinated me. Screwed around and had too much fun hence the low GPA, but I'm an excellent standardized test-taker (will elaborate on that below). Wasn't into the idea of medical school or medical practice. Worked part-time in IT (tech support) all through college. After graduating, worked same gig full-time for a while and then accepted a project management position with a construction company (father was a contractor so I grew up around it). Also, no good bio/biotech jobs around here. Did that for a year and a half and then went back to IT doing technical pre-sales for a F500 fintech company where I have been for the last two years. Getting that job took some serious self-selling. I am moving into a project management position with this same company at the beginning of the quarter. 

After working some time in construction, contemplating a move back into IT, wondering what the hell I actually want to do with my life, I started realizing how interesting I found our contracts / contract negotiations to be. As a PM I had to be very familiar with our contracts while managing commercial construction projects. 

I had also been doing IT work on the side through two different companies I started with two different partners. One does wireless networks and the other does web design. I mostly do sales and back office work for these as my partners are the hardcore techies. I still have these companies and continue to do some work for a few customers, very small gigs, but not as much as I did before I started my MBA. The point of this is I took great care in coming up with contracts for some of that work (which were probably garbage from a legal perspective, but gave a bit of legitimacy to my operation and made customers feel better about forking over money) and I really enjoy the process of forming an entity, coming up with an operating agreement, and negotiating contracts. 

I also excelled at debate through all four years of high school (marginally relevant). So, in summary, I thought maybe law would be interesting. Specifically business / transactional law. 

I wasn't immediately in a position to explore this idea too thoroughly. There are no law schools close to home and since we were expecting a child I needed to stay here and earn money for now. But I knew I wanted to work toward that so I started following some law-related podcasts, studying for the LSAT, and reading as much as possible- trying to maintain a critical perspective on arguments I would read. I took the LSAT and got a 166 (strong background in formal mathematics and logic, and have always been a solid test-taker). I knew that this score was pretty good but knew little else. 

At this point, with baby a few months away, I took the higher paying IT job where I could work remotely and earn more money while staying close to our family / support network. This company was fine with my side-gigs as long as I didn't sell to financial institutions or recruit away employees. Learned that this company has a good tuition reimbursement program. Started looking at an MBA as something to do in the meantime since I wanted to learn more about business and ultimately get into business law. Got a 710 on the GMAT (good enough score to get into a top B-school assuming matching GPA and experience) which got me some nice scholarships to a small, local (and locally ""prestigious""), fully accredited private school. These would cover a good part of what my employer wasn't covering. The idea of going to a better school wasn't an option since I was still pretty tied to my locale. I also wasn't trying to use the degree for a big consulting job or investment banking job or anything, really just to learn and network and potentially advance my position with my employer (which has seemingly worked, hence the change to a PM role - most of our PMs have MBAs). So I started that MBA in fall of '15 and will be graduating this upcoming spring with a 3.9 (assuming I don't screw up an easy class- got the tough ones out of the way already). Next step is law school. I will be in a good position to be able to move and I want to select an appropriate school for my background and interests. Even going into a new role with good pay, I still feel drawn toward law school after 2+ years of thinking about it. 

I know the MBA is mostly meaningless with respect to law school admission, but I think it fits in with the story of what I want to do and what I have learned. So... What do you guys think? Any schools you would recommend where I have a decent shot? I tend toward wanting to go somewhere where I have some scholarship opportunities, and I have this idea that I could intern with my current employer's legal department and potentially work in it after the JD since I work with our lawyers a fair bit on contracts and have a rapport with them. Would prefer to stay in the Midwest where it doesn't cost a fortune to survive. But I don't want to end up at a school where my opportunities are non-existent post-graduation. Especially since I'll have to take on substantial debt to go to law school. 

Tl;dr: lowish UG GPA, solid MBA GPA, pretty good LSAT (will probably retake though), decent work experience. Schools I should be looking at?

Apologies in advance for any typos / errors. On mobile.

As soon as I get home I eat then go to sleep. And it seems I can never sleep enough. I'm always tired and ready to go back to sleep.

I was diagnosed with anemia a little over two years ago. It used to be really bad but my doctor recommended I change my birth control from the pill to the depo shot so my periods could go away. Without periods a majority of my anemia symptoms went away. I tried taking iron supplements but they gave me serious stomach pains. So I don't take them. I just try to maintain an iron-rich diet. 

Because of the anemia I sometimes don't have a lot of energy. And now since I'm so busy I don't have enough time to rest &amp; unwind. I'm exhausted and really stressed out as a result. What can I do to have more energy throughout the day?"

I've been more or less doing it informally in my company as I am the liason for Business to IT and do IT support and strategy myself. I started off as an IT intern because I had some experience and after my supervisor left, I just kinda took over. Now I'm the sole IT person here. I've been doing business revenue gain based projects from start to finish here and am comfortable, but like I said, it's pretty informal from an actual BA point. For instance, I don't use any sort of analysis program besides a database I designed in Access to keep track of technology and am now working on moving it to a cloud based issue tracking system that we can extend to our actual business clients for increased value to them and an advantage in the market.  

I guess my question/concern is that I may be pigeonholing myself into a very specific type of position. I'm afraid if I don't move while I'm still just starting my career then I'll either not be employable elsewhere or continue doing this and never really meet any potential as I'm already as high position wise as I can get in this company. I've looked at BA positions in a few companies, they all require familiarity with business intelligence software and work with SQL and other related softwares. I've taken SQL/database classes and understand relational algebra to some degree but I haven't had any hands on work with either BI or SQL systems directly. I've led several projects that I designed and implemented but didn't use any project management software besides basically setting up my own environment specific to that project. I based a few of the projects on a cut down AGILE model but I'm not sure how to present that as a possible portfolio besides just describing the project. And to be honest, I mostly just designed it to be iterative so I didn't have to deal with all the parts at the same time. I also have very little experience or desire to deal with programming hands on. I can somewhat understand it if someone puts it in front of me, but I don't code. Is there any advice on how to mitigate some of these issues? Or how to get familiarity with some BI and or SQL systems? Keep in mind I'm low on income and time for extra schooling. "

I am currently only taking 12 hours of classes, but next semester I will be taking 15 hours, and working 20 hours a week at my job. My half time job is only open from 8-5 so it is nice that I still have my evenings to spend time with my fiancée and to study and work on homework during that time. But my problem is that between 8 and 5 when I am not in class I am at work and because of this tight schedule I do not have time to stay after class to ask question or go to professor’s office hours. What I am doing now is not working for me as I am starting to fall behind in my math and chemistry class and I know I need to seek help from a tutor or a study group but everything I am finding ends at 5:30 or earlier. 

With my half time job I am not bringing in a whole lot of money but I am saving it for between semesters and fall/spring break when I will not be getting BAH. I can afford to quit my half time job with the BAH that I am receiving but I am afraid if I quit my half time job I will not be able to find a job over the summer. I am only a freshman so there are not any internships that I can apply to as most of them you need to be in at least in your second year. The job I have now is an office job which is perfect for me because of my disability from the military I cannot stand for long hours. So if I lose this office job I might be forced to work retail or fast food over the summer and basically make my life a living hell from standing all day long. 

I am probably going to quit my job so that I can take advantage of my professor’s office hours and attend those study sessions/tutor times. I am just afraid for what is going to happen once summer begins but I guess I will get there when I get there. 

So I guess my question is how have you all dealt with juggling work and school and the summer months?

TL;DR School is kicking my ass and I am going to have to quit my half time job but that makes me afraid for the summer months.

I'm a current ChemE Junior, and I'm starting to apply for some internships right now. I applied for a few last year, but never got one, so I'm hoping the fact that I'm a year older will help out now. I have a pretty decent GPA (~3.5) and have a solid lab research position, so I think I have some good qualifications to get at least a couple interviews.

I know from reading on here that some people had to apply to a TON before getting an offer. The only thing keeping me from going on a full application-rampage is the cover letter. I write a new cover letter for each position, which takes a bit of time considering I'm specifically catering each one to the company. 

Do you guys have any advice about how to streamline the process? Should I just write one and modify a couple things in the cover letter but make it less personal? I'm a bit at a loss on how to do this.

It's been 4 months since I've graduated uni, and of course friends have left to go back home or move to where their career takes them; but a good amount of my close friends are still here - post-grad and undergrad. The only issue is timing. I think back 2 years and it seemed like hanging out was second-nature. Now, it is a real task to get to see people between everyone's work, classes, and internships. It doesn't seem like all that much has changed, yet the reality of the situation is drastically different.

Now, the past year has been a bit of a rollercoaster; a lot of friends found a significant other and others are no longer friends. It just seems like I've lost many close friends to emotions (romance and frustration). I relied on these people as my pillars. They were people I could always just show up to hang out with, no warnings necessary. It's all changed now and it's difficult to adjust. 

Everything that seemed set in stone a year ago is now in transition. The absence of those supports I once relied upon is an intermittent reminder of the past. I have made new friends this past summer, but I do not feel so close to them yet, though they are each amazing people in their own regard. Hopefully, these friendships can grow into something more concrete.

With all this being said, I have one pillar that has remained a constant: my best friend here in Ithaca. I am so thankful for her. She was a major support this past year when I needed it most. Now, she is having a rough spell and I need to be there for her. 

tl;dr: I lost my peer support and have yet to fully re-establish the level of what I once had, leaving me feeling lonesome. I am still thankful for those I do have though."

I'm currently studying Computer Science in Romania. I'm in the second year out of 3 years total. This summer I started an internship at a very importat bank in Romania. I work with SAS and SQL processes. After I will finish the last week of internship I can choose to keep working here on a 4 hour schedule so I can cope with school also. 
My question is: What should I do next? Keep learning SQL and in my spare time should start learning PHP? And of course, I will focus also on finishing my college."

A couple of months ago I was sent out for my internship to Surinam for eleven months to educate the youngsters out there, very overwhelming to see the major difference compared to my country, anyways, finally the last week came near and I got excited to go home, once coming home I checked my RS account I had to leave behind for nearly a year only to find out it got locked. 

This is very unlikely as I couldn't even connect to my account for eleven months, I do have a feeling that my account got hacked tho, because certain people have tried and succeeded to enter my email account. Whilst in Surinam my dad called me a couple times to tell me that he received emails from outlook that I need to change my password as someone from China (or at least from a Chinese IP address) at first tried to enter my email account (my dad's email is my security check email address for cases such as recovery), but I didn't take it seriously at first, because it sounded very sketchy to me. Until warning two came in, someone from the US now tried to enter, when I went up to a local computer to set a new password for my email account I noticed I was too late. I had to recover my email address, for that I waited until I headed back home.

When finally recovered my email account, I figured out that my OSRS account (Bad Form) was blocked/locked permanently. And then when you find out your account gets permanently banned for something you couldn't have possible done, makes me sad and pretty mad, the time I've putten into the account is just unreal, it might not have been the best account out there but for me it was heck of a work I've putten into it. And actually can't be asked to start all over for that matter, all motivation is gone.. I was really looking forward to play again.

Are there any people out there that have also experienced any kind of related bans/hacks? If so did you contact Jagex and in what kind of way? Did they help? I'm lost..


Thanks guys,

Bad Form

I don't know how good their CS program is compared to other more well known schools. I've always wanted to intern or work at some of these cooler tech companies or the big 4 but I feel like the fact that I'm going to this school will look bad. Everybody on this sub is graduating from a Top 10 school or already lives in the valley. Am I fucked before I even begin?

EDIT: I guess what I'm asking is for any of you recruiters or hiring managers out there, do you look at the school that a fresh grad came out of and how important is the school compared to all the other things on the resume?"
554int,2,2016-09-29,[Breeds] What breeds/mixes should we look for?,serindrana,dogs,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/554int/breeds_what_breedsmixes_should_we_look_for/,"**Introduction**

1)  Will this be your first dog? If not, what experience do you have owning/training dogs?

* This will be our first dog on our own (i.e., not a dog primarily belonging to a family member). We've both grown up in houses with dogs, and have family members who have dogs currently and are good models/resources for basic training and crate use. We’re also not planning to get them until we’re settled in at our new house, which won’t be until early December (at the earliest) so we have some time. :)

2)  Do you have a preference for rescuing a dog vs. going through a [reputable breeder]( http://ownresponsibly.blogspot.com/2011/07/identifying-reputable-breeder.html)?

* We honestly aren’t sure. On the one hand, tons of shelter dogs are perfectly awesome and need good homes, and don’t come with the premium price of a purebred dog. On the other, supporting great breeders is definitely a plus, and we’d have more control over the history of the puppy.

3)  Describe your ideal dog.

* Probably 15-30 lbs, medium energy level, interested in learning commands. Good with small children (we don’t have any yet, but will within the lifespan of any pets we get now), good with cat(s). We also currently have three rats, and while we don’t plan on getting more when they pass in the next year or two, we would obviously prefer that they’re not stressed because of a terrier looking at them as play things! Their large, metal cage is in the living room, and we will be doing out-of-cage time with them either with the dog crated or in a closed-off room

4)  What breeds or types of dogs are you interested in and why?

* I have a preference for herder dogs, though I don’t think I could keep up with the work requirements of a purebred border collie, for example. I really like their appearance, focus, size, and general behavior, though I can’t put my finger on what it is exactly about their behavior that sets them apart. I tend towards liking medium size to big size dogs, but given the size of our house, smaller would be better for now. My husband prefers dogs like spaniels due to experience with the breed, as well as terriers, lurchers, and sight-hounds for aesthetics and working reasons, but doesn’t believe their temperaments will work well with our behavioral requirements.

5)  What sorts of things would you like to train your dog to do?

* Aside from the basics (sit, stay, heel - we consider all of these no-argument, “safety” skills for the dog and their people), we’re just planning on handling any general manners or behavioral issues that come up. No obedience trials/competitions.

**Care Commitments**

  6) How long do you want to devote to training, playing with, or otherwise interacting with your dog each day?

* Probably an hour focused only-dog time (walks, training, etc), and general morning/evening sharing space together and low-key interaction (probably 5-6 hours a day?), usually with both of us involved.

7) How long can you exercise your dog each day, on average?  What sorts of exercise are you planning to give your dog regularly and does that include using a dog park?  

* At least half an hour to an hour today, largely walks but also trips to dog parks or hikes out in the woods. 

8)  How much regular brushing are you willing to do?  Are you open to trimming hair, cleaning ears, or doing other grooming at home?  If not, would you be willing to pay a professional to do it regularly?

* Not too much brushing - maybe once a week or so. Not a lot of at-home grooming besides baths.

**Personal Preferences**

9)  What size dog are you looking for?

* 15-30 lbs.

10) How much shedding, barking, and slobber can you handle?

* No slobber, eh on barking and shedding but that’s part of having a dog! But a less “talkative” breed would be nice.

11) How important is being able to let your dog off-leash in an unfenced area?

* For me, not very. For husband, very important - he intends to take the dog with him on hikes and camping trips and would prefer that the dog stay with him without needing to be tethered 100% of the time. If the dog is up for it, some casual hunting.

**Dog Personality and Behavior**

12) Do you want a snuggly dog or one that prefers some personal space?

* Leaning towards affectionate/snuggly. Having the dog hang out with them pressed against our legs is great, but not on top of us licking constantly!

13) Would you prefer a dog that wants to do its own thing or one that’s more eager-to-please?

* Eager-to-please.

14) How  would you prefer your dog to respond to someone knocking on the door or entering your yard?  How would you prefer your dog to greet strangers or visitors?  

* Alert, watching them, but not necessarily barking. No jumping on strangers/visitors. Super friendly.

15) Are you willing to manage a dog that is aggressive to other dogs?

* Not really - not past the point where good training can eliminate the problem in most situations.

16) Are there any other behaviors you can’t deal with or want to avoid?

* No, not really.

**Lifestyle**

17) How often and how long will the dog be left alone?

* 5 days a week, for a maximum of 9 hours. This is likely to decrease with time, but we can’t say for certain. We’re also planning on making sure that during the puppy phase, the dog is left alone for only a few hours at a time. If necessary, we’re happy to hire a walker.

18) What are the dog-related preferences of other people in the house and what will be their involvement in caring for the dog? 

* Just me and my husband!

19) Do you have other pets or are you planning on having other pets?  What breed or type of animal are they?

* We have three rats, and are planning on getting a cat both because we love cats, and so that the dog has a buddy in the house when we’re busy.

20) Will the dog be interacting with children regularly?

* Not yet, but in the next three to give years we intend to have a child or two.

21) Do you rent or plan to rent in the future? If applicable, what breed or weight restrictions are on your current lease?

* No, we own our house.

22) What city or country do you live in and are you aware of any laws banning certain breeds?

* Beaverton, Oregon.

23) What is the average temperature of a typical summer and winter day where you live?

* Summer is 80-90 degrees with occasional (maybe seven days a year) around 100. Winter is 30-45.

**Additional Information and Questions**

24) Please provide any additional information you feel may be relevant.

* We’ve got some training experience, both with rats (treat-based trick training), and my husband with dogs (interned with a dog obedience training business), but the rats are put away every day except for their designated play time, and obviously the dogs at the internship didn’t live with us! We’re very excited to work with our puppy, but there’s going to be a learning curve."

For the past year I've been networking well and taking any bootcamp classes I could to get back into the software and programming world in preparation for finding a job this Fall. I've had multiple contacts in this field comment that I shouldn't have much issue finding a job due to my abilities and degree, even so far as to refer me to their companies, but I've yet to get a positive response.  I have applied to countless companies with only one response - being a no.

A little background to help: I started in Computer Engineering and programming in C, I programmed microprocessors but ultimately decided to switch to Computer Information Systems.  In that major I programmed mostly in Java with some experience with the LAMP stack and command-line Linux, learned algorithms, design patterns, and all that good stuff. I haven't worked in those languages recently, but feel I could pick them back up fairly quickly.  Since graduation I've worked in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript &amp; jQuery, and have just cracked open the door to Python. I have Java and HTML/CSS/JS listed on my resume and always include a cover letter showing I've researched the company, how I believe I can contribute value, and offer some guidance translating my banking skills and previous programming (albeit not professionally) to the company I'm applying. I'm mostly interested in software development or cyber security, but at this point I really just want to get my foot in the door to switch careers - even its a Jr. position or paid internship. I try to program every day, use github, have a portfolio website in Bootstrap but it's lacking any major projects yet which I know can really set me back, and use websites like freecodeacademy.com and cybrary.it to supplement what I know and expand my knowledge.

TLDR: Former banker trying to get into Software Development with his Computer Info Sys degree. Used to program in Java &amp; C, currently programming front-end and considering Python. Interested in Software Development or Cyber Security.

Could y'all give insight into anything I might be missing or languages I should abandon in support of others? Am I not portraying my skills well enough or think I don't have enough practice under my belt?  Any input helps.  Thanks everyone!"
554nsy,3,2016-09-29,Chances applying with a Mechanical Engineering degree and some professional programming experience,GJ-667-CC,OMSCS,https://www.reddit.com/r/OMSCS/comments/554nsy/chances_applying_with_a_mechanical_engineering/,"Hi- I heard about OMSCS recently and am considering applying for a Fall 2017 start. I'm coming from a mechanical/aerospace background, so I was hoping current students or other applicants could give me an idea of whether I'll have a reasonable chance of admittance.

**Background:**

Education: 

* 2015 graduate, B.S. Mechanical Engineering (concentration in aerospace) at a mid-tier engineering program (top 50-100). GPA 3.07, strong upward trend last 4 semesters. Took standard Mech E classes in intro programming (C/C++), and plenty of Matlab programming throughout my degree.
* Hopefully mitigating my GPA somewhat, I was on an athletic scholarship and was in season for sports year round. Also involved with engineering extracurriculars.
* Took a 2 year college level CS course in high school and scored well on exam (International Baccalaureate CS, higher-level, scored 6/7 -- approx equivalent to 5/5 on AP CS plus additional topics). It included a pretty substantial project developing and documenting a Java application.

Work:

* I work for a well-regarded federal gov consulting firm that has great name recognition.
* My project for the past 1.5 years since college has been a role as a systems engineer on a DoD engineering software product. I work on data analysis, migration, software implementation, and systems engineering for the core software (requirements management, case tracking).
* As part of my job I develop analytic scripts with Java/Python for bulk data processing and manage a Git repo for myself and a couple teammates.
* Certified Agile Scrum Master (kind of a bs certification, I know)
* I'm the primary system admin for the developmental version of my clients' software and work backend on data loading.
* Working on a secondary project developing a data warehousing solution proposal for a DoD logistics office responsible for $10B in annual budget.
* Intern experience in college as a Python back-end developer for a small startup.
* FWIW, work will pay everything if I'm admitted.

I realize the work experience doesn't replace the educational experience, but wondering if it's enough to supplement the Mechanical Engineering background. I wouldn't venture as far as saying I am equivalent to a BS CS, but I'm definitely several steps above the level of CS taught in other engineering disciplines.

I appreciate any and all feedback!"

I am competent, but lately im starting to have issues. The problems are always the same. Kinda gets boring, and stuff like *user inserts new password and instantly forgets it* or *""i cant change my windows password"" -computer was off* is starting to trigger me.

Currently i have a CCNA cert, and basically some Windows Server notions, like AD, DNS, DHCP. I have worked with several applications such as VMWare vSphere, MS Exchange, Enterprise Vault, Cisco Call Manager, Symantec Netbackup, but its always end user related stuff, so i have 0 implementation experience other than Windows Server stuff.
I am trying to fix this lately, learning linux and other stuff.

My contract ends in December. I am pretty sure it will get renewed, but i would like learning new things and face new problems.

What path should i follow in IT? Should i apply for Sysadmin jobs? Or should i get more know-how beforehand? Almost every job description i read asks for stuff that i have never worked with or for # years of experience that i don't have."

I've also been going to every career fair I can. 

Of course I apply to the big 4, but I also apply to every internship I can find that's open to PhD students. When I was a senior in undergrad, I applied to hundreds of SWE places (though I, admittedly, had less experience then). Last year I applied to 50ish (there are less opportunities for graduate students), and so far this year have applied to around a dozen.


I know DS&amp;Algorithms fairly well. I've helped friends prepare for their interviews. I really feel like I could pass an interview if given a chance at a couple of companies.

I've had my resume reviewed by my adviser, by career centers at my undergrad and grad career centers, etc. It can be viewed [here](http://imgur.com/a/BwKDl)

This whole process is becoming very discouraging/frustrating. If I could get to the interview and fail, I'd at least know where to improve upon. As it stands, I have no idea what to do next to get my foot in the door.

I just had an interview with ""a big social media company"", that went pretty well until I got to the technical questions.

I think the experience is great, but as a computer engineering student, I didn't know a lot of the terminology to answer the more  IT/CS questions well during the interview. When applying for ECE internships, I don't have any relevant experience.

555gy7,1,2016-09-29,Might only have room for one summer internship in my degree program...how much of a disadvantage will this be?,MukLukDuck,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/555gy7/might_only_have_room_for_one_summer_internship_in/,"So this is my second bachelor's degree, so I'm doing it in 3 years and graduating May 2019 (don't need gen eds, just CS/math/stat classes). That means only two summers are ""available"" for me to do internships, and for summer 2017, I'm only going to have the 2 intro CS courses under my belt and no previous experience in this field, so I doubt I'll really be competitive for many internships. I'm also planning to take classes this summer. However, I'm worried that I'm going to be at a huge disadvantage compared to other students, considering that I'll only be able to do one internship--and since I'm only doing one, I can't imagine it'll be at a top company without any other experience. On top of that, some internships aren't even open to me because I'm not a full-time student. What can I do to make sure I have the best chance in the job market after graduation?

Some alternatives I've considered are:

1. Picking up a second major (probably math) so that I can be a full-time student; however, taking 5 CS/math classes at once would likely mean not being able to work during school and, therefore, a lot more in loans.

2. Stretching out my program an extra semester to get a third summer/second internship in there--maybe taking a couple electives/adding another minor/taking lighter course loads in a couple other semesters. Not ideal, as I'm already going to be 27 when I graduate and I fear the older I get, the more of a disadvantage I'll have in the entry-level job market. Also, more loans.

3. Trying for a co-op (after a couple more semesters). Financially, if I could get one, this is probably the best option for me. The disadvantage to this is that I'll end up being even older when I graduate...

4. Trying to intern during the semester. Not sure how this would work or what the availability would be.

5. Just doing a lot of personal side projects. I'm not sure yet how to even go about this with my very limited knowledge, but I definitely plan on doing some of my own stuff at some point; probably need to learn a bit more first, though--I don't feel like I even really have any ideas at this point."

A big industry in downtown Los Angeles that dealt with many movie, tv and rock stars. Basically, offering rich and famous people services to handle their careers while also giving fresh faced wannabes the opportunities.

Katy was one of them, a young girl that wasn't even 21 yet dreams of making it in music, becoming a world known star. She had tried numerous times and had many meetings with companies to try and get her talent across to no avail. Eventually the money she saved up from her part time job while she was in school dried up and she had to pick up a job in L.A she she thought why not a business in a similar field to her dreams.

Katy remembered when she walked into the office for the first time, people couldn't believe what she looked like and you think they would be accustomed to seeing gorgeous people all the time. She had worn a pair of red 6 inch stilettos and a tiny pencil skirt that would of been the shortest a woman could wear. Thigh high stockings that hugged tight to her legs that were held up by clasps attached to a garter belt. The tight blouse she wore strained her rather biggest assets, her double DD breasts that were pushed up in her black bra. They bounced around as she worked around the office, attracting the attention of many guys. The man Katy worked for was always delighted to see her, his eyes filling up with lust as he looked her body over before leading her into his office and shutting the door.

Katy regularly wore clothes that brung her attention, it was always another pair of 6 inch heels, short skirts and stockings accompanied by a tight low cut blouse. Guys around the office started to talk about Katy, about how they would love to ram her as she bent over their desk. Many guys often tried to get with her but she always refused.

Soon Katy developed a reputation for being a strong feminist supporter. She thought that all men were pigs for treating women as nothing more than a pair of tits and ass with a pretty face. That's how Katy felt in meetings, guys would get sidetracked around her and just stare at her boobs or ass. They wouldn't take her seriously and thought that she was just a slut. She thought that guys only chatted to her because they wanted to fuck her and weren't even calling her by name around the office, she overheard them calling her by her big tits.

Though what Katy did, didn't always match up with what she said. She would scold men for staring at her body when she wore revealing clothing everyday. She would also find every excuse to bend over to give everyone a good look at her, regularly dropping things on the ground. She would get angry at guys all the time for flirting with her as they obviously wanted to fuck her but she would flirt with guys all the time brushing her hand near their groin and giving them a sexy, sultry look as she walked away.

One day the CEO came to the office and went to a meeting room with about 30 other businessmen. They were all aged between 50-80 years old. After about an hour, Katy was called into the meeting room. Jason, a fellow coworker had a desk right in front of the room, he watched her strut in their, clad in her tight clothes. She closed the door behind her. It must of been 4 hours until the doors opened again, with the old guys walking out with satisfied looks on their faces. They talked about how great that was and how they must do it again soon. Out Katy stepped as they finally all left. Her hair was disheveled while she was fixing her rumpled blouse and rolling down her skirt while carrying her stilettos. As she walked she pulled out a curly hair from her mouth and wiped away a bit of stickiness from her lips. Going to her desk and continuing work like nothing happened.

---------------

I want this role play to involve scenarios following the womens career such as trying to break into the industry (a lot of time spent as the secretary), dealing with the sudden fame, hook ups with celebrities, sex tapes, paparazzi, fans, relationships, becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol and turning into a nymphomaniac.

The prompt above doesn't have to be the start or involved in it... just an example of some writing.

Can be different and have a male celebrity and their journey. (Check out my 'Famous Life' posting in my post history for that)

I want to play the males the celeb will encounter. I want someone to play the main lead which will be the young female starlet. I would love for the young starlet to be Katy Perry or Kylie Jenner but I like a lot of other celebs as well such as Taylor Swift, Iggy Azalea, Ariana Grande, Megan Fox, Margot Robbie, Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Alba. Though.. the female celebrity can be an original character that is made up would love her to look like Madison Ivy or Lana Rhoades though also into Lindsey Pelas, Emily Sears and Claudia Alende.

I prefer to roleplay on Google Docs and use messengers to chat and set things up such as K , skype, yahoo msger and google chat/hangouts. Want this to be a long term rp

If you are interested and wish to talk about this further send me a message. Please make your message to me detailed and include any character/ scenario ideas, which celebrities you like and what platforms you use.

P.S Also have a recent posting in which I mention all the rp's and things I'm interested in for a long term rp, so check that out if you want, particularly interested in doing a Marvel Black Widow RP or a Post apocalyptic/dystopia world that is similar to Fallout or a Bioshock rp.

Vale - Boyfriend's Best Friend [21F]

Sally - Abby's (Former) Friend [20F]

  ---   
**RELATIONSHIP(S) BACKSTORY:**

My boyfriend and I met about three years ago. We were friends at first, but about a year into the friendship, I began to have a huge crush on him. I would giggle with Abby about him and swoon, and Justin would do the same with his friend, Vale, about me. During the year we were just friends, he and I started a ""movie night"" tradition. I'm a weirdo who never really got into ""classic"" Disney movies, so he offered to watch them with me. One evening, he blurted out how much he liked me, then (LITERALLY) ran away. I was so flabbergasted, but it was adorable, and we talked, then found out we liked each other. We got together, and everybody was happy.

About a year and a half into our relationship (meaning Justin and I known each other about two years by now), I met another girl named Cee. We were acquaintances more than anything, really. At the time, she had had another best friend, Sally, and although Abby and I were fine with Sally, we weren't uber close with her or anything. Sally and I got along well, and we did have a few inside jokes, because we were both in love with a superhero character that goes pretty much ignored. Regardless, I was not *close* to her. Most of our interactions only ever happened when we were in big groups. I know this all seems irrelevant, but bear with me.

So, unknown to myself, Sally turned out to be a bit of a bitch. She talked shit about my relationship with Justin a *lot* for almost...no reason? She talked a *ton* behind my back to Cee, who would agree with her because she didn't know me very well. One day, Cee and I picked up conversation, however, when I expressed concern for her when I noticed some things that pointed to abuse in her household. We had a late night conversation where she confided in me about some issues with her family, how bad things were for her and her sister at home. Both of them are in college, and were desperately trying to raise money to move out, which they have now. We hit it off after that conversation, and she eventually me some of the things Sally had said about me to her. Cee said something along the lines, ""Then you and I started talking, and she would says stuff about you and things you'd done, which confused me, because all I could think whenever she did this was, 'What the hell? Cammie would never do that. She's a sweetheart...'""

It all eventually came out that *every* single one of the issues that Sally would tell Cee about me (just a bunch of petty shit that I was apparently doing that pissed her off, and ""kept doing"" even after she apparently confronted me and told me to stop) were lies. Sally made it all sound like everything I was doing was deliberate to anger her, when the truth was that I had *no clue* she had a problem, and she always only ever smiled to my face. It basically felt like we were all back in goddamn high school, because rather than speak to me (as was Justin's mistake later), she talked shit without merit. When all this came out, so did a lot of things that Sally had done to the others behind their backs, and so Sally was dropped from our group like a hot potato.

This event was what set off Cee and I becoming even closer. It got to the point where we hung out all the time with Abby and the rest of our group. By now, Justin's best friend, Vale, was also in the mix a lot. For some reason, I got the feeling she never liked me, even though I don't know why. It's been months since I've spoken with her, yet I still don't get why she dislikes me, to this day. I was always fine with her, though, which is why this situation started to piss me off with Justin and how he was reacting. I could tolerate Vale's awful behavior toward me (ignoring me whenever I said hello, trying to bond with her with just the two of us, including her in activities with Cee and Abby, etc) and shrugged it off. I mean, you don't have to *love* your boyfriend's friends, right? I understood maybe that's just the way she was.

Another thing to note is that our group also has mixed orientations. To put it all easily, I'm bisexual, which Justin knows. Abby is bisexual as well, while Cee has no clue what she's doing concerning liking people; she's more into ""eh. I like you if I like you."" Justin has always known this about all of us, and he himself is not even heterosexual, because he's asexual, which was never a problem, either.

  ---   
**MOST RECENT ISSUE:**

Now, I said everything above for a reason. It has come to light recently that Justin is extremely jealous of Cee. After the blow-up with Sally, Cee and I were closer than ever. I would speak to her about girly things, things that Justin had never expressed interest in before and brushed off if I chatted with him about it. The moment he seemed to notice Cee was just as excited about those sort of things as I was, he would comment on it, such as saying, ""Wow, you two are really into that, huh?""

One example is horses. Justin hates horses and basically all animals. I, however, *love* them. He tolerates them for my sake, and we've already agreed to get one dog when we move in together. Cee also loves animals, so we would make plans to horseback ride. At the moment, I'm also studying to become a zookeeper, which is something that has never interested Justin. When Cee found out, however, she told me she was also in animal study (she had been even before we met)

With that example, conversations with Justin would follow as...

**Justin:** Why are you guys going to the zoo again?

**Me:** (patiently, since sometimes I tell him things and he forgets) My internship requires so many hours, remember? Cee's just making it more fun.

**Justin:** Yeah, I know, Cammie, but why are you chilling with just her? Can't Vale go?

**Me:** Vale doesn't like me, remember?

**Justin:** That's not true. She likes you just fine

**Me:** (texting Vale if she'd like to go and getting rejected) See?

**Justin:** What about Abby?

**Me:** She's got work. What's wrong with Cee going with me?

**Justin:** Nothing. I was just wondering.

This would repeat. Whenever I'd press about why he had a problem with Cee, it was always, ""Nothing. Just wondering,"" after he got done questioning me. Keep in mind that Abby and I going to the zoo and hanging out or horseback riding together was fine by Justin, as well as me geeking out with Abby about animals and talking about my classes. Only when I mentioned Cee and I were hanging out would he get upset -- even if it was me, Abby, *and* Cee hanging out, he would remark, ""What's Cee even going to contribute to that? What's wrong with just you and Abby?""

Studying to become a zookeeper is extremely important to me, and during some of these instances, I'd ask him if he want to go instead (with or without Cee) and each time, he'd just wrinkle his nose and say something along the lines of, ""With your internship, don't they kinda use you as an assistant or whatever? So you have to help muck out the cages and everything? Nah, I'm good.""

(And to be fair, that does happen sometimes. I just don't mind spraying down the habitats, etc. It balances out with being able to help bottle feed the baby big cats/being set to babysit them while the big cat parents got their shots from the vet or helping set up mental stimulation for the gorillas, etc.)

We've had many conversations about Cee before, too, where I reassured him (even though he never mentioned being jealous at the time) that she and I were just best friends, that I don't see her that way, and all that. Cee is literally on the same scale to me as Abby: a sister. Cee has said the same thing about me, and due to past bad relationships (which Justin doesn't know about; Cee has only told me and Abby), she has a literal fear of getting with someone. I've given Justin the hedged version of it, because I'd never break Cee's trust in what she's told me and Abby. To try to reassure Justin, I would just say saying Cee has commitment issues and if nothing else, he should trust me when I say that she and I will *never* be like that. Every time I said it, he looked extremely doubtful, but he'd let the issue drop for the moment.

  ---   
**THE PROBLEM:**

Well, things finally came to a head after a few times of the above example happening in various degrees, whether it was Cee and I hanging out at the movies (with or without Abby; if Abby was there or not with us didn't seem to matter to Justin) or just having fun. Justin and I got into a *huge* argument about some really stupid shit. It was about me forgetting to text him back at lunch because I was interning and my break was cut short due to an issue at work. I forgot to tell him my hours had been extended that day...he didn't seem to care at the time, because he was hanging out with Vale, which I was fine with?? So I don't get why he was upset? He and I didn't have plans or anything! He was only mad because he thought Cee was there, but she wasn't.

Regardless, I told him that we needed a break, because he had been getting angrier and angrier with me lately, and he would never tell me why he was upset. I mean, I *know* it had something to do with Cee, but he wouldn't tell me *why* exactly he had a problem with her. So we were on a ""break"" basically, and after that fight, I went to my mother, sobbing. I hung around the house alone for a a few days, trying to pull myself together, and during that time, Justin mailed me stuff like chocolates and flowers from Edible Arrangements as apologies, I suppose. I would text him thank you, but conversation was always very tense.

This relationship break happened around the time that Justin and I were coming up on our two year anniversary. The break began a week or two before the anniversary, which really upset me, because I had planned some great things for us, including anniversary sex, cooked dinner, etc. Instead of doing all that, we were essentially on our way to breaking up. I was hoping we would just take this time for a breather. We would meet up to try to talk occasionally, but it only ever ended with us storming off furiously, and me going to Cee and Abby in tears. Both of them were extremely helpful, and Abby even started spending less time with her own boyfriend of 2 years to try to cheer me up with old movies while we were all on the couch.

Fast forward a little to actual day of what would have been our 2 year anniversary and shit hit the fan. Justin, for some reason that I have no clue (especially since our last quarrel was 2 or so days before our anniversary) went on Facebook and on my wall, for everyone to see, he sort of wrote a...passive aggressive love letter? I've got no clue. It was sweet, I guess, but Abby says it stank of insecurities.

To shorten it, let's just say it was summed up with: ""Even with all these challenges and certain people trying to get between us, all arguments we've had these past few weeks, I still love you, baby.""

Actually, that's not even summing it up. That was a literal line in the love letter, and it was the concluding sentence to it. It was a *whole message,* guys. I'm talking an essay. Any other time, I would have basically swooned, but this time, I was furious. Not only was he dirtying our laundry out in public, on Facebook (I've got younger cousins and family members there, hello!), but he kept insinuating shit about Cee in the letter, too, and that was genuinely pissing me off more and more.

Needless to say, I called him, and in the fight that ensued (""I put a lot of heart into that!"" from him when I deleted it from my wall, and me saying, ""WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU?""), he finally said that he was, like, 484829% that Cee was in love with me. He said he knew I was going to her during this break. I interjected, ""Abby is there every time, too!"" And he said, and I quote, ""This isn't about Abby,"" and I said, ""But apparently it's about Cee?!"" but he just said he was certain that Cee was trying to ""white knight"" me. He said that she was making it to where she was always the shoulder I cried on because she was in love with me, and trying to ""usurp"" him or something. I have no clue, honestly. All I heard was a roaring in my ears. I told him that he had better fuck off, and I reminded him that I *never* had any problem with Vale and him being so close, so why was it so different for me and Cee? Because I was bisexual, she was undecided, and he suddenly came to the conclusion out of nowhere that she wanted to get with me? He had no response for that, I guess, because he didn't answer. After about a minute or two of silence, I hung up.

I wish I could say that was the end of it. I think my problem is that I really love this guy, and I've always been stupid with love. My last relationship wasn't the best, either, and she really fucked me over. She was the reason I got into therapy, actually, and waited so long to get into another relationship. It's been nearly 3 years with Justin, though, which...I mean, I guess I feel is a lot of time invested? Either way, I calmed down, then spoke rationally with Cee and Abby. Cee was actually the one encouraging me to talk to Justin, while Abby was against it, saying he was too controlling. She said she had never seen Justin act like such a shithead and that if he wanted to be a big baby, then so be it.

Well, I heard from Justin a few days after that. This time, he texted me in private, and sent me a very long message. Justin has always been really good with his written words; the guy is basically a poet, which I've always loved. He expressed how sorry he was, how he didn't mean to let his jealousy get in our way, and that he wanted to fix this. He mentioned couples therapy, which I'm dubious of, because he's never been in proper therapy before. I'm in therapy myself, like I said, and have been for two years due to the anxiety I mentioned before as well as my depression. Justin attended a few sessions with a separate therapist, but he always said the woman never knew what she was talking about, and that she was talking out of her ass. At the time, I reminded him that it takes time to find a good therapist, but he claimed they were full of shit. Regardless, he never talked shit about me still going to therapy. Because of my own therapist, I'd like to think I have become more confident in myself.

But I feel so torn. Abby says Justin can fuck off, while Cee says to give him another chance. Abby has also admitted to me privately that she thinks Cee is doing that out of guilt, feeling that she's breaking up an almost 3yr relationship and that she should break off our friendship since I've not known her as long as Justin.

Any advice?
  
  ---   
  **tl;dr**: I've become best friends with a girl called Cee, and my boyfriend of 3 years is extremely jealous of her, believing she is trying to get between us and break up our relationship, even though that's the furthest thing from the truth. He has now contacted me after a huge quarrel, and wants us to work on our relationship with therapy (something he's always claimed was hogwash and said is full of shit, 'cause ""the therapist doesn't know me!"") but I'm scared of being burned twice and going through this all over again. What would you do?"
5560ec,10,2016-09-29,The NSBE/SHEP Career Fair: Some questions and... why don't we have more career fairs?,ijustwantjobs,RPI,https://www.reddit.com/r/RPI/comments/5560ec/the_nsbeshep_career_fair_some_questions_and_why/,"Perhaps I've missed a resource, but there's some information and questions I have about the career fair that I haven't been able to find answers to.

What happens to all the money collected by companies? I'm guessing the organizations collect and keep it, but does it go back to the school? Scholarships? What is it helping?

Why is it hosted by NSBE/SHEP? The [CCPD Career Fairs](http://rpicareerfair.org/) page makes it seem as if its entirely separate from the CCPD despite being pushed from Freshman year on as 'the career fair'. If isn't truly connected, why is it so much bigger than than the one in the Spring that supposedly is supported by our institution? Both of these things feel weird. If it is just NSBE/SHEP, why hasn't it ever expanded to other organizations?

Why do we always have huge events like this in the armory. It's always incredibly hot and gross. The dress standards (which weren't enforced 3 years ago at least, as I know someone who got in wearing far less than a suit) feel almost cruel, at least for males, and there was reddit post earlier about someone getting shoved away for the wrong shoes... why would they ever do that? Wouldn't it be a smart thing to use some of thousands of dollars collected to help enable those who may come to the door unprepared to enter by having a few pairs of dress shoes in common sizes (and doesn't the CCPD have something like this already?)?

**Is there anything stopping us from having another career fair?** I feel like Honor Societies could do a huge thing here in taking this over or starting a separate career fair. Imagine if The CSE, CS, and IT honor societies banded together with RPISEC and the like to have more focuses fairs for those that need it. I know plenty of EMACS/ARTS/GSAS majors that have a terrible time finding internships as is because this fair doesn't help and the companies that visits classes are slim pickings compared to the Engineering focused offers.

I've been to a few hackathons in my time here and I've seen the number of CS focuses companies that show up there compared to things like this-- it'd be great if Hack RPI had a career fair leading up to the hackathon, or more organizations on campus got involved in doing things like this.

Right now I'm more than anything freaking about landing a job, which is making wonder why we don't have more  and better opportunities?

I'm not totally ugly (I think), I'm actually pretty smart, and I'm not very weird. A little bit quirky, but nothing crazy. I wear makeup, work out, dress nice, and basically do whatever else a teenage girl does. However, as long back as I can remember, I have found that I have never been able to fit in. I didn't have a lot of friends in preschool... or elementary school... or middle school... and even going to one of the nerdiest, geekiest high schools, I haven't been able to fit in. I was never popular. People always talked about me strangely. I've always felt isolated. At the beginning it was probably more of the fact that my English was bad and I had a thick accent. I lost that in elementary school. People still called me a weirdo. I felt glad if people approached me. Today, it's no different. No one wants to talk to me. I have very few friends who I actually like. Guys have never really taken interest in me other than wanting to hook up (and I'm not about that life). I don't know what to do. Even at internships or any situation outside of school, I struggle to converse with people because I don't want to give them a weird vibe. I'll admit, I'm kind of shy, but I'm also friendly and I greet people and hold doors open for them. Interviews have been a hassle. I'm even a stranger to my family, I don't identify with their culture, but that's a different issue. What am I doing wrong? I just want to be seen as a normal, intelligent human!"
5563ky,5,2016-09-29,20 F4M- Capital Hill Intern,Cosplay_Slut,dirtypenpals,https://www.reddit.com/r/dirtypenpals/comments/5563ky/20_f4m_capital_hill_intern/,"I couldn't believe it, I was so excited. My first day as an assistant to a prestigious senator. This was a dream come true. Walking into capital hill I couldn't help but remember all the hard work it took to get this position. The essays, the presentations, the interviews. I must have beat out at least a hundred other applicants but here I was. I beamed with pride as I knocked on your door. I could feel my heart thumping in my chest as you called me in. I opened the door and saw you hard at work at your desk. 

""Hello Alexis, nice to finally meet you."" you said gesturing for me to sit. ""You're are here for the intern position correct?"" I nod my head. ""Yes I'm here to be your personal assistant. I think what you're doing is great and I can't wait to be a part of it. If you need anything just let me know. Also you can call me Lexi."" You nod your head not listening. I keep going. ""Also if you don't mind I'd like to suggest some things like.... and....""

My voice droned on as you pretended to care. You occasionally ""mhm'd"" at the right times but mostly you looked at your computer. Your eyes were glued to the monitor as you flipped through all the pictures on my instagram. A tightness in your pants formed as you saw a picture of me in my bikini. I had a fit petite body, with a nice tight ass and slender legs. Huge breasts were slung in a revealing bikini top and my crimson hair fell like a silken curtain around my shoulders. You looked back at me and stared at my thick, luscious lips. They looked so full and with the red lipstick on they really popped. You started undressing me with your eyes; picturing me in my bikini or some sexy lingerie. To see my tight little body in person. Those great big tits of mine. 

Cutting me off mid-sentence you said, ""Alright, well here is what you'll be doing here."" I shut my mouth and listened, leaning in a bit closer. ""You're going to be my personal assistant which means if I need you to do anything you're going to do it."" I nodded and said, ""Yes of course! I'll do anything! If you need something, anything, don't hesitate to tell me!."" You smiled and said, ""Alright then, first things first. I'm going to need those lips of yours to suck my cock."" You can see an inquisitive look on my face. ""I'm sorry...what?"" I must have heard wrong. What did he say? You leaned in closer and said, ""I need you to suck my cock."" 

You saw the look on my face turn from joy to disgust. ""What?! No!?"" I said. ""Do I look like a whore to you? You're ridiculous, thinking I'd suck your cock."" I said as I started to collect my things. I stood up and almost stepped out the door when you said, ""Being an assistant to a senator can go a long way in your career. A lot of doors can open in the blink of an eye, endless opportunities await. But only if you stay here with me."" I stopped walking and paused. It was true. It was the reason I tried so hard to get this position. 10 years of my career could be bypassed in an instant. But at what cost?

I turned around and saw your sleazy look. You were an appalling asshole, but maybe this would be worth it. Later on I could enact real change, real reform. I could clean all the people like you out of DC and make way for others that actually want to help the nation. People that will use their power for good, not coerce girls to be their personal prostitute. At this rate the sooner the better.
I waited a little before I walked back and sat down in the chair. It took every once of effort I had to completely let go of my self respect. ""Alright... you have a deal."" I said."
556a2e,4,2016-09-30,Molested by Older Half-Sibling and Stepfather. Family doesn't want to deal with the situation.,KLloyd14,abuse,https://www.reddit.com/r/abuse/comments/556a2e/molested_by_older_halfsibling_and_stepfather/,"Before I get into discussing my story, I just wanna say that my family is really dysfunctional on both sides of the aisle. My mother's relatives have been at each other's throats for years and my father's side just uses money to cover up how they really feel. Back in 2011, I told my dad that my stepfather molested me several years prior. The last incident with him happened around early '04 and that's only because we moved out of his house. 
However, my darkest secret was about my older half-sister molesting me first. The earliest memory of this was sometime between 1997-98 and lasted until mid-2004.We had another incident together around late '05. After the brunt of the abuse ended, I remember acting sexual or inappropriately. My mother's boyfriend noticed this and once witnessed me masturbating in her car (shortly before we went to the mall of all places). When I think back to these times, I think about how many f***ked up people I was around. Although my mom started talking to me and my sister about sex as we started to physically mature, when the abuse first started I had no idea what it was. 

Furthermore, I don't know whether or not my sister was molested by someone else beforehand, but it's definitely possible. 
If it wasn't our late-uncle who did this (he was suspected of doing so back when she was an infant/toddler), then it had to be someone else perhaps even a teenager.
 We went to quite a few babysitters between 1990 and 2000 (I was born in '92 though). We also went over our grandmother's a lot when she still lived here in Baltimore. 
Since coming out to my dad about what both of these monsters did, I feel liberated in a way even though what I did may have made everything worse. 
But, at least I know where everyone stands on this matter. My mother's side of the family doesn't want to deal with this and my aunt in particular is suggesting I forgive and forget.
 Yet, if someone were to touch her grandchildren, she'd kick their ass and then some. 
My father's side of the family is leaving me to deal with this on my own because I lashed out at my paternal grandmother a couple years ago on my old blog.
 But, I apologized and it's still not enough. To make matters worse, my grandmother doesn't believe me and is siding with my half-sister on this. 
She's basically comforting the abuser!! It's awful and one of the lowest things she could do. My half-sister is not even related to her! As of this summer, she and my aunt (dad's sister) aren't speaking and we (my dad and I) are wondering if she (paternal aunt) is using prescription drugs. Dad said she took my grandmother's codeine because she thought she was allergic to it, which isn't true. My grandmother's had a tooth infection from a dental implant she got years ago. But, she's getting it taken care of. In a whole other situation, my aunt's marriage of over 20 years is ending (they're heading for divorce any day now). However, I wonder if she realizes something is wrong in regards to me, but isn't saying anything because my grandmother's influence. On dad's side, even if a relative isn't speaking to her, she still has influence on what goes on in the family. It's really sad. I'm starting to think that the only way I'll be able to speak to my paternal relatives (besides my father) about my situation is when my grandmother passes away. She doesn't want to hear what I have to say and it's pretty obvious she doesn't like me anymore. Even when I asked my dad if I could speak to her on the phone someday, he was hesitant about it. So, that speak volumes right there. 

I just wanna leave this place. I hate Baltimore with every fiber of my being. There are too many bad things that happened to me here. I have been seeing a therapist though for the past six months. While she has helped me realized that the abuse wasn't my fault and even explained the concept about how a 5 year old isn't expected to make an adult decision, I still feel dirty and disgusted by what happened. It makes me feel slimy. Despite what ""good"" my sister has done for me, I realized that overall our relationship was toxic even before I entered therapy. I don't ever want to see her again and if I do, I'll be two seconds away from kicking her ass. When she decided to stop being my friend on Facebook, I wished I could say more to her, but only said very little even then. I wished I warned her that I was gonna tell everyone who she really is. I also feel like since moving in with my dad others have tried to control my life. I feel limited. There are days when I don't know how long I can take it in this house. I keep asking dad if we can move away, but he just wants to move nearby to some apartments by the neighborhood elementary school. I also hate that I'm near where the abuse first happened. Sometimes when I try to talk to my dad about the subject, he'll try to turn me away and other times he says he's sorry. I'm not sure he even knows how to respond. He also didn't realize how bad my situation with my half-sibling was. He himself considered her as another daughter and once suggested we reconciled shortly after I told him. Then, my grandmother keeps saying I'm making this up and shortly after she found out suggested I say stuff like this when people make me mad. It couldn't be further from the truth. However, I'll also say that most of the time the abuse that happened was consensual. And when I do want to talk to my father about this whole situation, it's never a good time to discuss it because he's busy with work or whatever. I just feel like I'm at a crossroads. My mom's side of the family has been in chaos for years. It's not the first time an issue of incest has come up (don't know if there was any inbreeding several generations back). There are also other skeletons in their closet which included one of my mother's cousins with diabetes being refused his medicine so his family could collect on his life insurance (he eventually died in '83 from diabetic complications at age 28). That's a whole other story for another time. I don't want to face either side of my family on these issues. It's pretty obvious they can't help me. Dad can only do so much. I already told myself that once I leave his house, I am not coming back not even to visit. I just wanna leave this place and never return. Dad's pretty much complacent here and doesn't understand my situation to the fullest. 


I want to go into a transitional housing program. I thought about a homeless shelter, but realized it's not such a good idea after reading all the bad reviews online. I'm 24 now and have HFA (high functioning Autism). I don't belong in a group home nor do I wish to go to one. I really need to leave ASAP. I even asked a local state agency I was with for seven years to stop supporting me because it'll just take me in the direction I don't want to go in. I already tried going to school for something I don't want to do. And I did a brief internship at a hospital. Meanwhile, I'm also trying to start my own website and publish books on kindle. What else should I do? Any ideas?

I applied on my school career website, and then completed a HackerRank challenge that the recruiter sent out. In their job description that I applied under, they mentioned 4 teams (out of which, I was mostly interested in Data Mining/Backend).

I'm pretty nervous, since this is the largest company I'll have ever interviewed at. All my previous experience have been at smaller local companies, and the interviews haven't really been *that* technical, so I'm not sure what to expect.

Does anyone have any information of the internship interview process at Yelp? How difficult are their interview questions? Is there anything I should spend the next few days focusing on? How many rounds of interviews do they have for interns? Obviously I should be expecting the worst, but it'd be nice to have an idea as to what to expect.

It directly breaks one of the rules here, and I am no mod, but if I was, I would at the very least make a change to the rule about self promotion, while not one single user us self promoting site, but a collective of many users are doing so, it sort if avoids the rule, but still breaks it or otherwise do something about the reposts of the same stuff someone else reported on then another shared here first.  No big deal if they are the first to share the story here, but there us no need to clutter this up.  I enjoy spending time in this sub, and I only have limited amount of time to spend here, I don't like reading the same thing twice. 

&gt;Save this stuff for the off season.  There is enough to talk about during the season that this just looks like clutter in the sub and degrading to your sites reputation.

&gt;I don't mean to be a dick, because a majority of your posts are good posts, but you have some that are questionably click bait, and if it weren't for the good stuff you post, and I did not frequent the Lions sub, I would believe this was click bait if I was say a fan from another country or just a football fan who wants to know what is going on with the Lions, I would see all the posts made by Detroit podcast and would think this sub is run for profitability as there is no other site that self promotes as much as this site does.  I think there might be lines being crossed with writers of the site/podcast voices being part of the mod team of the sub that causes the mods to turn a blind eye to the fact that there is obvious self pronotion even if it isn't for profit, it's the kind that can lead to profit when so done else offers you a job because they like your work.  

&gt;I don't disapprove of the sites post 6/10 times, but when the posts are just replicating what someone else has already said and likely been posted here, or just something like this that doesn't have much to do with the ongoing part of the season.  Don't you think post should be posted in the r/nfl_draft sub unless it is off season, as it will get more views and comments there at this time of year than it will here.

&gt;Just skimming the top 30 ""new"" posts, this site is linked to six of them not including the actual podcast post which would be seven.  4/6 of them are just repeating a post that was made a couple posts before the one linked to this site, and one is this that doesn't really belong here until off season.  The only post that I feel was worth taking up space in this sub is the ask the intern post, ad that is original content in which you are answering questions but why even that us somewhat crossing the birder because you could just make a direct post on reddit that answers the questions tour Facebook fans have or just answer them on Facebook.

I may have been being generous saying 6/10 of the posts from this site shared here were good posts.  I never actually counted until I just did the top 30, I seen enough to not go any further with it with only 2 out 7 posts with original quality stuff, and 5 of what I would call click bait.  


Edit: I would not have made this post if there wasn't rules posted on the sidebar about what isn't allowed to be posted.  The rules were being broken, and more than just one in my opinion....   In case you do not know about the rules I will post them here.

&gt;1. Follow Reddiquette - The basic rules of Reddit will be enforced.
2. Do not make personal attacks - This includes attacking people based on their flair or fandom.
3. Do not post a duplicate topic - Please check to see if the topic has been posted already, before posting.
4. Do not follow and harass users with and between the sub, including PMs - Doing so is against reddit's TOS, and doing so can result in reddit-wide consequences. If any user is following you and harassing you, message the administrators. If you are unsure, and need an opinion, message the sub moderators to discuss the issue.
5. Do not downvote opinions out of disagreement, and do not upvote opinions out of agreement - Upvote any post or thread that you feel adds to or promotes discussion. Downvote posts or threads that you feel do not add to or promote discussion.
6. Please stay on the topic of the Detroit Lions - This will be enforced loosely at times, but keep in mind that this sub exists to discuss the Lions. Anything else may be subject to deletion.
7. Do not create ""Upvote"" threads - In addition to being in violation of Reddit's TOS, there are a lot of threads and posts to upvote. Be a little more free with your upvotes if you're happy.
8. Do not use Reddit solely to advertise your own content - If you're a poster here, feel free to link to your own content. If all you're posting is links to your website, then you will probably be shadowbanned. If you're unsure if what/how you're posting is acceptable, message the moderators to check.
9. Please use descriptive titles - Something like, ""I saw this today"" doesn't describe the content. Feel free to use the title to highlight an important part of the posted content, though.
10. Do not post porn"

Does anyone have any insight on how these compare with just getting a regular Coop job in terms of building valuable skills?

Microsoft's internship for example says that you will be working on a new project with a group of interns. This does not sound like a real world Coop experience to me. Will having the name on the resume be worth forgoing potentially more intensive dev worth from a Coop experience? 

Also how do the actual Coop positions that these companies post compare to respective intern positions?

I'm your host, BreakFromReality, and I'll be accompanying you in your journey to find a fun, erotic roleplay.

Please check your ID with the security guard -- all potential RP partners and their characters MUST be at least 18.

So now that you're here, how do you get started?

First, you'll sit down at our [single-deck blackjack table](https://www.random.org/playing-cards/), where you'll be deciding the kinks of the RP. You'll be dealt eight starting hands of blackjack, with each total matching up with a specific kink. (For example, a 20 is for cheating.)

Here's the full list of kinks:

* 4 -- Dealer's Choice
* 5 -- Light Bondage
* 6 -- Group Sex (MFMF, MFMFMF)
* 7 -- MFM Threesome
* 8 -- FFM Threesome
* 9 -- Interracial/Raceplay
* 10 -- Anal (Woman Receiving)
* 11 -- Filmed
* 12 -- Clothed Sex
* 13 -- Dirty Talk/Name-Calling
* 14 -- Rough Sex (Hair-Pulling, Spanking, Light Choking, etc.)
* 15 -- Public Sex
* 16 -- Creampie/Risk of Impregnation
* 17 -- Facial
* 18 -- Risk of Getting Caught (i.e. ""hold the moan"")
* 19 -- Uniform/Costume
* 20 -- Cheating
* 21 -- Player's Choice

Once eight unique hands are drawn, you will choose two kinks that you would like to include in the RP. You will also eliminate two other kinks that you would not like to include. The dealer will then choose two kinks of the remaining four.

The Dealer's Choice and Player's Choice can not be excluded.

*(To play: draw 2 cards from 1 shuffled deck. Make sure all cards except jokers are included. Repeat this eight times until complete.)*

Once the kinks are decided, you'll decide if you want to stay on the main casino floor or head over to The Den. *(While I will absolutely play with everyone, those choosing to go to The Den will get VIP status.)*

If you choose the main floor, you will head to our [roulette wheel](https://www.random.org/sequences/), where you'll help decide the character you'll be playing. The women listed on the wheel will be character models only (with one exception).

The list is as follows:

* 0 -- Player's Choice of Anyone on the List
* 1 -- You, because you're always #1 at DPP Casino!
* 2 -- Bella Thorne
* 3 -- Dove Cameron
* 4 -- Laurel Coppock
* 5 -- Alison Brie
* 6 -- Kendall Jenner
* 7 -- Candice Patton
* 8 -- Margot Robbie
* 9 -- Vanessa Hudgens
* 10 -- Scarlett Johansson
* 11 -- Taylor Swift
* 12 -- Miley Cyrus
* 13 -- Ariana Grande
* 14 -- Emma Stone
* 15 -- Milana Vayntrub
* 16 -- Nina Dobrev
* 17 -- Rihanna
* 18 -- Sarah Hyland
* 19 -- Lily Aldridge
* 20 -- Mila Kunis
* 21 -- Stella Maxwell
* 22 -- Dianna Agron
* 23 -- Chloe Grace Moretz
* 24 -- Katherine McNamara
* 25 -- Victoria Justice
* 26 -- Carrie Underwood
* 27 -- Jennifer Lawrence
* 28 -- Selena Gomez
* 29 -- Emilia Clarke
* 30 -- Emily Ratajkowski
* 31 -- Meghan Markle
* 32 -- Jourdan Dunn
* 33 -- Katy Perry
* 34 -- Aubrey Plaza
* 35 -- Nicole Beharie
* 36 -- Ariel Winter

You will spin the wheel six times (12 for two-female scenes and 18 for three-female scenes). You will then pick three characters (six for two-female scenes and nine for three-female scenes). The dealer will then choose the character he would like you to play (the Player's Choice may get excluded).

*(To play: Set the smallest value at 0 and the largest value at 36, and keep it in one column. Take the first 6/12/18 numbers in the list.)*

Finally, it's time to ""role"" the dice at the [craps table](https://www.random.org/dice/) and see just what you'll be playing. The roles are below:

* 2 -- Dealer's Choice
* 3 -- Coach's Daughter
* 4 -- Friend's Wife/Girlfriend
* 5 -- Student
* 6 -- Sister's/Daughter's Friend
* 7 -- Incest (Daughter, Sister, Cousin)
* 8 -- Friend's Sister/Daughter
* 9 -- Work Scenario (Secretary, Intern, Co-Worker, etc.)
* 10 -- Wife's/Girlfriend's Friend
* 11 -- Bully's/Bullying Victim's Sister
* 12 -- Player's Choice

*(If Celebrity is chosen, you will be playing the actual celebrity from the wheel instead of a lookalike. For 12, I am giving the option of playing either the bullying victim's sister or an interesting revenge plot with the bully's sister.)*

You will roll the dice four times. Of the four unique roles, you will then discard one. The dealer will discard one of the remaining three, and you will then choose one (or both, if possible) of the remaining two.

*(To play: simply roll two virtual dice. Repeat until four different roles are picked.)*

After that is done, we will have the RP with the characters, roles and kinks!

Now if you choose The Den?

Here's the list of characters for the roulette wheel:

* 0 -- Player's Choice of Anyone on the List
* 1 -- You, as a woman age 40+ (if you're not one already)
* 2 -- Rena Sofer
* 3 -- Nigella Lawson
* 4 -- Christie Brinkley
* 5 -- Eva Longoria
* 6 -- Rashida Jones
* 7 -- Jane Seymour
* 8 -- Elizabeth Hurley
* 9 -- Jennifer Lopez
* 10 -- Julianna Margulies
* 11 -- Patricia Heaton
* 12 -- Cheryl Hines
* 13 -- Jordan Ladd
* 14 -- Jennifer Aniston
* 15 -- Giada de Laurentiis
* 16 -- Julie Bowen
* 17 -- Alyson Hannigan
* 18 -- Gabrielle Union
* 19 -- Melinda Clarke
* 20 -- Jennifer Garner
* 21 -- Marcia Cross
* 22 -- Christina Hendricks
* 23 -- Angela Bassett

* 25 -- Isla Fisher
* 26 -- Natalie Imbruglia
* 27 -- Mary-Louise Parker
* 28 -- Kate Beckinsale
* 29 -- Sofia Vergara
* 30 -- Julianne Moore
* 31 -- Kim Cattrall
* 32 -- Ellen Barkin
* 33 -- Sharon Stone
* 34 -- Paula Patton
* 35 -- Mary Steenburgen
* 36 -- Courteney Cox

And here are the roles:

* 2 -- Dealer's Choice
* 3 -- Coach's Wife
* 4 -- Friend's Wife
* 5 -- Teacher/Principal
* 6 -- Mom's Friend
* 7 -- Incest (Mom, Aunt, Grandmother)
* 8 -- Friend's Mom
* 9 -- Work Scenario (Boss, Co-Worker, etc.)
* 10 -- Wife's Friend
* 11 -- Bully's/Bullying Victim's Mom
* 12 -- Player's Choice

That does it for our tour! We can't wait to play with you, and we know you'll have a good time; others have! 

If you have any questions, please feel free to ask. And from all of us at DPP Casino, have a winning day!"

There's an internship that is focused on IT through cloud computing and virtualization. Now, from my limited understanding, it should deal with distributed systems, computer networks and such, which is exactly what I'm looking for.

 What I'd like to know, is how would those areas be applied to IT?

558ayl,144,2016-09-30,Meatwagon,IamHowardMoxley,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/558ayl/meatwagon/,"The last job applicant looked like he pushed open his coffin and walked in fresh from the grave. 

&amp;nbsp;
His gray shirt was as filthy and wrinkled as his disheveled black slacks. His greasy hair hung in a tangled mess around eyes dark and sunken, set deep in a pudgy and sallow face that looked genuinely sick. That was strike one. 

&amp;nbsp;
To say his resume was skimpy was an understatement. RANDAL GANES took up a quarter of the page, his contact information made up the bulk of the ink. He had listed:

&amp;nbsp;
1.  high school graduation date 11 years ago

&amp;nbsp;

2. mortician's assistant, 3 months, 10 years ago

&amp;nbsp;

3. 1 year experience driving an ice cream truck 2 years ago.

&amp;nbsp;
That was dismal for more than a decade worth of work. Normally, that's strike two and I would move on to other applicants, but there was something about this man, even if it was only wanting to know what the hell he did with his life, and  he *did* have the licenses I needed. I personally saw him ace the road test.  I asked him what happened after high school. He cleared his throat and began to murmur before collecting enough of his courage to say:

&amp;nbsp;
“I want to tell you this right away: I am not going to lie. I don't lie anymore. I will tell you exactly what happened. Some of this may offend you... shock you. You may ask me to leave at any time, I will understand. Otherwise...I will tell you what I did with my life as vividly as I can.” 

&amp;nbsp;

So he did. 

&amp;nbsp;

Randal Ganes was a substandard student. His job options in the small town were the army, working at the gas station or living with his older sisters
Contessa, Mallory and Claire Ganes. All of their room and board was cared for by dear great aunty Viatrix Ganes, leader of the nameless self-proclaimed coven. Viatrix was already deeply obsessed with a native American legend by the time Randal joined to help resurrect a god no longer known by the people, of X'hawana Ihlaxwsa: *Zwana* *Hal*-*wah*, “she who shall be feared”. Viatrix deeply believed that giving this elemental force a human body to loan would grant the Ganes family favor with the goddess, especially if Ganes family blood was used in the ceremonies. Randal never specified what these ceremonies entailed despite my questioning. 

&amp;nbsp;

The Ganes coven found that locating a proper body for Zwana was very hard for them- according to the incomplete resources Viatrix had at her disposal, the sacrifices needed to have died in a very specific way- young, healthy, beautiful and yet dead ONLY due to natural causes. Nothing violent or unnatural would take hold Zwana during the binding ceremonies, so obtaining bodies by murder -even drowning or asphyxiation- would ruin the bodies. Bodies taken by burning or poisoning wouldn't work either. Graveyard corpses were too decomposed, and too risky. So were most hospitals. 

&amp;nbsp;
The four woman and man coven came to terms with the fact that they would never get anywhere stealing 1 body every 3 weeks; to be successful, they needed *volume*.

&amp;nbsp;
Viatrix unveils her new plan a few months after Randal joins them. She had overheard a very strange conversation concerning the nearest mortuary, how they always had “beauty pageant winners” among them.

&amp;nbsp;
“I had no choice. They had already pulled the strings. They were all working at legitimate angle for a while with the intention of establishing a supply line of bodies directly to Viatrix's house. The countywide mortuary was a one man show anyway, and the Coroner, Eustace Dust, needed unpaid help. Out of the 13 that applied, 3 of which were med students, my sisters got a 19 year old kid inside that facility somehow. I'm not going to ask how. Ever.”  

&amp;nbsp;
Randal described Eustace as a hunched ratty man who always spoke in a bawdy, twangy accent, hanging between French-Southern and cocky English. Eustace's long hair had curled into gray tubes that snaked alongside his bald dome, “perfect for an outdated face that was hard and thick...like if newer, fresher flesh had been slapped over the real face.” Randal described the head mortician's two long single horseshoe shaped teeth, as sharp as guillotines jutting out of constantly inflamed gums. Randal turned even sicker when he described Dust's wormy gray tongue that constantly probed his tender gums and licked his thin hard lips. Randal never knew if he was born that way, or somehow, he was *made* that was. 

&amp;nbsp;
Randal apparently never had a chance to say more than two words to his boss Eustace- the head mortician gushed words like he would never speak again. They would discuss things such as the fall of modern and ancient empires, world diets, politics, music, humor, religions and remodeling. Randal said the man was “disturbingly intelligent”, and that the coroner grew to trust Randal quickly after Randal demonstrated that he was a capable assistant. 

&amp;nbsp;

The oddest of Mr. Dust's quirks became apparent after the 1st month, when Eustace began carting the attractive women off behind a steel door before their autopsy had been preformed. The women who went into what Dust called “the meatlocker” had two things in common; they had no obvious wounds, and they were with families wishing for cremation. We swapped other bodies in the cardboard burn box for the witnessing ceremony. When Randal asked him why Mr. Dust kept these women, the coroner supposedly said the following with a smile: 

&amp;nbsp;

“I like you. You're *good* *people*. It's hard to meet good people, but you find them everywhere, you know? You know where I find a lot of “good people”? At the poshest parties, I swear. *Rich* *people*...ones that would hate to see all these pretty ladies go into the ground without one last final...hurrah. I personally do not partake in such acts, but hold no qualms with those who do...so I take them back to the meatlocker and show them my...well, what could be beauty pageant winners...you seen ALL of them, you can judge fairly, yes? And those people, mostly rich, white, single, young men, present me with a *problem*. They want to visit my pageant winners again...but they don't want to be seen frequenting a mortuary, even if they ARE well disguised. I had to become mobile...so I purchased an unused van from one of my most trusted frequent First Responders...it keeps the bodies cool and the *conditioner* flowing through their veins...” I asked Eustace what van he was talking about. He playfully replied “Oh, my meatwagon?”

&amp;nbsp;

It was a large plain white Sprinter van that was parked in a different secured location every night, except for when the bodies needed to be changed out. A collapsible ladder folds out, allowing the client to step with class up to four bodies of what had once been very beautiful women, each a different race, fully nude and strapped to their gurneys with silk restraints woven through the stainless steel. They wore makeup. One still wore sunglasses over unnaturally white eyeballs. Each had infected red ports near the base of their neck pumping several cocktails of chemicals in at once. Eustace made Randal to touch one of their bodies- warm. Eustace said: “not living- their brains are disposed of with honor. Not metabolism-The heat is exothermic preservation solution that keeps the living cells tender and free from decay as it kills all bacteria while keeping the body at 96 degrees for up to a month, or until we find a new pageant winner. I call it “conditioner”, and I'm always improving on it.”  

&amp;nbsp;
Eustace finally made his move and asked Randal how keen he was on the idea of “operating” the meatwagon- the venture was making more money than ever, and Dust didn't trust anyone else to take over the sole operation. Dust assured the young man that he would *just* be driving, he wouldn't even need to interact with the bodies, except through the security monitor to ensure that no goods were stolen or damaged in the back. Randal agreed instantly; he would have done it for free. Randal saw his chance to create a flow to the coven. Even when Randal retold it, I could see that bringing his family bodies seemed to be the most important thing in his life. I wonder if he had full control of his faculties, or if his drive was part of the coven's influence. 

&amp;nbsp;

“Dust paid me under the table after my 6 month internship in the mortuary was up. From then, I really don't know...exactly how long I drove the meatwagon. Years. I got my class A when Dust needed massive amounts of chemicals privately delivered from Mexico. Business was booming as Dust took over bodies from neighboring mortuaries and morgues...he would have a new girl every three days for the dozen -and growing- clients. They would tell me to drive to farmhouses. Abandoned lots. Cemeteries, of all places. I would try to ignore the *squeak* *squeak* and the security screen showing me four dead women an a molester. I had to to do my job well, and that meant always keeping my guard up...if Dust ever found out that every one of his “pageant winners” was given to Viatrix and the sisters to preform the ritual on, he would do worse than fire me.” I asked Randal why he kept working with his aunt and sisters when he now had steady check. He went on as if he didn't hear me. 

&amp;nbsp;

“None of the hundreds of naturally-dead pretty corpses took to Zwana...or maybe visa versa. None of the customers seemed to notice the tiny incisions left over from the ceremonies on the bodies. Neither did Dust. Still. We were failing; Viatrix knew she was missing vital information. I felt like *I* was failing. So I started getting drunk at bars between destinations. The...last time, I got so drunk that the only thing I remember about the ride home was that there was a full moon. I must have passed out on the bench seat; it would look like no one was in the van at first glance...I guess Dust didn't see me, cause a wet slapping sound woke me up around 1 in the morning. The image of Eustace was burning in the monitor, thrusting a bright white bare bottom into a pair of limp legs of another failed Zwana experiment, a girl who was a true medical anomaly, dead in her bed without any sign of trauma or illness. Dust was changing her out- I wasn't usually here for this process. I never believed him for a second when he said he “didn't partake”; I never needed to see the proof of it either.” 

&amp;nbsp;
“Dust was usual reserved, musing...but this man operated with the strength of goddamn madman, busting open the back doors to carry out the dead body he just fucked. He walked through a moonbeam with his pants and underwear around his ankles as he dragged the gurney out. When the body passed through the beam of white light, I saw the woman's feet spring up as if she was shocked with a bolt of electricity and leap out of view. Then I heard Dust yelp and then shriek, absolutely *shriek* with no regards to Ego...oh but Eustace, you chose this place because the mortuary was so remote, nobody could hear or help you...or us.”

&amp;nbsp;

“I heard groaning scratches on the side of the van, so deep that it sounded like giant's knife was carving into the metal...I couldn't see, couldn't move to see, couldn't do anything but hold but cry as I held my breath to listen to Dust's cries of agony slowly shrivel to moans. Then I heard the bar-door open and nothing else. I spent at least half and hour making sure it's safe before getting out- I can't see shit, it's pitch dark everywhere outside the moonbeam that brought Zwana to life. I used my cell's flash as a light and saw 5 symbols had been carved on the side of the van. I took a picture of them just as I heard Eustace somewhere in the dark. My light revealed Dust holding both hands between his crotch as he gave the last few weak kicks of life. There is a fleshy bloody lump next to his head laying in the same fatally large pond of blood that Eustace was in. I didn't know what to do, so I ran. I heard the police eventually came and impounded most of the operation. The police never contacted me.”

&amp;nbsp;

“None of my family believed what happened; Viatrix refused to believe the moon was the key until I showed them the symbols carved on the side of the van. They all recoiled and threw my phone back at me- they symbols said, in our crude language, “all in this cursed vessel shall remained cursed”. My family disowned me, claiming it was my fault that I didn't SPEAK with the Goddess, that the ceremony made it bound by Ganes blood, that Zwana saw the fear in my heart and was disgusted and decided to roam the Earth instead, judging me on behalf of all Ganes...all of this was conveyed into the symbols, I guess. So. I have no money. Nowhere to go. My only employer for my whole working life is dead. I have no legitimate work history and no real assets other than my ability to drive. But I heard that Howard Moxley is a charitable man. Hiring me would be saving a life, I- I'm cursed, and sleeping behind a CVS tonight. And *SHE'S* out there.” I looked out the window. A storm was arriving. 

&amp;nbsp;
“I will hire you,” I began, “if you can you get me access to your Aunt's house. I would very much like to see what her necrotorium looks like.” His eyes flashed nervously, then in guilt, he said yes. 

&amp;nbsp;

I hired him on the spot. "

Recently turned 18 and I've been recommended here after posting in the wrong subreddit. 

**What I look like**: Petite, slim, Asian 5'5, 110lbs, my ex could practically wrap around my waist with his hands, A cup (yay if that's your thing, if not, sorry)

**Kinks &amp; Fantasy Scenarios:** 

1. *Snugglefuck* 
I have a particular fantasy of having a taller and stronger partner/stranger protecting me. 
I would imagine us going to a bar/club/festival etc and someone would try to grope me or do something that makes me very uncomfortable. You would step in and tell them to back off and basically be alpha. I'd be extremely grateful and feel safe and protected. When we get home, I would thank you in many ways.... ;)
Then after we've finished I would tuck myself beside you and cuddle with you with my head on your chest and wait for round two. 

2. *Daddy* 
Basically you're a very successful, driven and ambitious man, I'm a new intern at your company who's a little clumsy but eager to learn. We run into each other one day and I fall for you (literally). I'm thinking this can either evolve into a sugar daddy scenario or just a daddy one where you're my mentor and we have fun in the office. One of the things I really want to do is blowing you under the desk while you're in a call with a client/doing work related tasks and you're trying to concentrate but I'm just too damn distracting and we can end up 69ing or whatever you want. 

3. Teacher/Student 
I've had a crush on you, my English teacher, for the past few weeks. I always sit in the front closest to your podium, first to arrive and last to leave because I'm a straight-A student and...well you're teaching it (Orwell's 1984 if that's your thing). At first I think I'm just one of the many girls sighing over your good looks and charisma but then I start noticing whenever you start teaching sexual content, you make eye contact with me just long enough to catch my attention but not to get caught by the others.
""Class dismissed, don't forget your chapter readings, have a lovely weekend everyone!""
""You too, Mr ______ !"", I answer back cheerfully. 
As I strolled out from the building, I was greeted with pouring rain and howling winds. Shit. I checked my phone and saw a message from mum that saying she has a work emergency and that I'll have to catch the bus home. I rubbed the goosebumps on my arms and trudged along in the rain, instantly soaking my white blouse and pleat skirt. Suddenly I hear a voice....

4. Brazilian Jiujitsu/Judo Class
This is my first time going to a self defence class and you're one of the black belts there, tall, built and confident. 
The instructor walks in and announces 'hey everyone listen up, new student today NomNom.' I feel the weight of the stares of everyone watching as I set down my gym gear and stripped down sweats and shirt to reveal my sports bra and running shorts. 
'Today we're going to practice some submission holds, partner up!' 
I look around as people paired up and just as I was about to see if the instructor was free I felt a tap on my shoulder. 
'Looks like you're stuck with me', you smirked mischievously. 
It would be awesome if you have knowledge of BJJ classes, basically I have the idea of building up sexual tension as I get put into uncomfortable positions by you, then after class you can maybe offer to teach me 1 on 1?

So these are the scenarios I've thought of so far, I'm very new so I'm open to any spins you may have or completely new scenarios :) 

I'm especially turned on by being eaten out, light bondage, and height difference (taller haha). 
I'm also up for just chatting especially if you genuinely fit into the scenarios above.

Look forward to reading your messages when I wake up!

558fp6,2,2016-09-30,Question regarding when best to apply for my certificate of eligibility.,MythzFreeze,japan,https://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/558fp6/question_regarding_when_best_to_apply_for_my/,"Hey,
I will try to keep this as short as possible.

First off, i already called the japanese embassy in belgium but the lady didn't seem to quite understand what i was asking so im turning to you guys.

1. I found a 3 month programming internship in Japan.

2. I called the embassy in belgium and they said my company needed to apply for a certificate of eligibility 3 months before i planned on working (interning) in japan (2weeks - 2 months). Then i would have to get someone to send me the original certifcate (1 week) and finally apply for a visa in belgium (1 week).

3. If i look at it from a worst case scenario pount of view this would take 2 months + 1 week + 1 week. Meaning i would only have 2 weeks left over to buy plane tickets and rent an appartment (although a local said she would take care of that for me). This 2 week window worries me.

Now for the question. If i did my research right i believe i will have to apply for a 6 month training or student visa. (i believe you need to have a buffer before strarting the internship and leaving japan).Since i will have a 6 month visa can i apply for the CoE 1 or 2 months earlier? Or is it seriously normal for people to only have 2 weeks to plan these things.

Now, I work in a field that's overwhelmingly male. The company has been trying hard to become more diverse, and so part of that has shown in our hiring now.

Ok, long story short... the new intern on my project is smoking hot. She's an 11 probably. She's also engaged, as am I. I'm also more than 10 years older than her.

But that doesn't change the fact that she is *very* attractive. She nails all the little things that I love. She's in good shape. She lifts weights actually, and it shows. She's got a perfect hourglass.

I'm often very distracted by her legs - those smoothly shaved white legs with good muscle definition... she could probably kick my ass, and I'd love it. I have to really work hard to not try to peek up her skirts. She sometimes wears this one that's just above the knee. There's a perfect amount of teasing thigh visible when she's sitting.

I can't tell if she knows how attracted I am or not. The best part of videoconference calls is that when I stare at her image on the screen it's not obvious that I'm admiring her breasts.

Does anyone want to chat? I'd love to hear about any of you that are attracted to a coworker or colleague you shouldn't be, when you first noticed them, and what's happened after. And I'll tell you about what today looks like, what she wore, and how it made me feel."

When I went to a Tech career fair, career reps saw all of this on my résumé and looked at me funny because I was studying CS but have very little CS stuff other than coursework, and have all of this unrelated federal internship stuff.

I'm not looking towards a Big 4 or anything like that , but I will be applying to financial institutions that conduct Data Structures + Algorithm interviews.

I took Data Structures and Algorithms at my local community college over the summer due to the lower cost / more convenient location, but the course didn't cover much. It only went through basic sorting algorithms, linked lists and stacks + queues. (No Big O, Trees and anything else not listed) The credits transferred to my main four year institution but I've been reliant on self-studying on my own.

I've been going through a Data Structure / Algorithm textbook on my own, but want to make sure I've studied everything I need to know. I've been given conflicting information on what exactly I should be reading through.

Here are roughly the chapters of what I've went over thoroughly from the textbook:

- Review Chapters (Strings, Arrays, OOP)
- Algorithm Analysis (Big O)
- Linked Lists
- Stacks, Queues
- Trees (book mainly focused on BST's)
- Hash Tables
- Searching/Sorting

I'm comfortable with these topics and have completed some of the related chapters in CTCI. However, I skipped several chapters that are covered by my university's Data Structures class. These topics include many data structures such as tries, graphs, skip lists and heaps. I'll get around to studying them once the semester is over, but as of now my time is limited due to school.

Is the list I have enough to be going into an interview? As I said, I've read conflicting information on how important some of these other topics are for internship interviews. "

I am a recent graduate with a bachelors in CS and I graduated about 4 months ago now.

I've been struggling to find a job. I ultimately wanted to find a job out of state because I live in a rural area (this is sort of key to my question). After a couple months of not being able to get anything, I started applying more locally, still with little to no success. Yesterday a company finally contacted me (locally) asked me a few questions about salary and that sort of stuff. They asked me into an interview today and I went at 10am.

Now, around 2pm they actually emailed me just now and gave me a job offer for a programmer/data analyst position WHICH I'M SUPER STOKED ABOUT! The pay is a bit less than I was looking for though. I was looking for around $40,000 a year which I don't think is TOO unreasonable for entry-level in this field. Is it? Anyway, they offered me the hourly equivalent of about $16 an hour which is only $1 more an hour than I made at my internship while still in college.

I plan to take the offer (will probably accept it right after writing this) even though it doesn't really meet my salary requirements. I obviously can't afford to be too picky though right now since I have no other offers.

There is a company in NC that was looking at me, and they did say it would pay minimum $50k a year to start. I have been through many phone interviews with them and they have shown genuine interest. I even had a 3 HOUR webcam interview with them which was crazy. The interviewer (from internal) said he thinks I have a pretty good chance at getting it and to keep contact with the recruiter for an update. It's been about 3-4 weeks now since the interview and the recruiter keeps asking me to wait a bit longer but won't specify a time frame.

Like I said earlier, I really wanted to move out of my current state (KY). My question is, say I take the job with this company local to me, and then 2 weeks later the NC company actually gives me an offer. What would you do in my position? Would you up and leave the job that gave you a real chance with low pay in favor of the out of state job with better pay? Or would you stick it out with the local company and ""rough it"" for probably about 6 months (at least) and then try to apply for even better jobs?


I don't think I have room to ask for more pay (from the local company) considering I'm entry level with very little internship experience. What do you think? I really don't want to push them and have them revoke the offer. Personally, I think 18 an hour would be better for me. I would be a lot more comfortable taking that, although I would probably settle for 16 right now given my options.


**Update:** I accepted the job offer, they said they will officially sign me on pending my background check (which should be squeaky clean)! They said it will take a few days for the results. At the same time I emailed the NC company recruiter and let them know if they're going to make a decision they need to make it ASAP. So this buys them (NC company) a few days at least.


**Update 2:** For all of the people that are currently unemployed and looking for jobs, don't give up! Yes, this was not my IDEAL job in terms of pay and location, but it is work nonetheless! I probably submitted a million applications over the last 4 months and I was starting to feel depressed about it to tell you the truth. Seriously do not give up hope."
559jh6,86,2016-09-30,The Haunting of Ao Shin,Terroking,leagueoflegends,https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/559jh6/the_haunting_of_ao_shin/,"According to the Gregorian calendar, the year is 2016, but according to the history books it's the year of the apocalypse. The first day of worlds was full of incredible plays, huge disappointments, and shocking upsets.

It was punctuated, though, by a shocking event: In the TSM vs. RNG game, Aurelion Sol's stars became invisible, causing a remake. 

Because Mata gets Alistar, Svenskeren knows he will need to carry the game. In an ironic twist of fate, he finds that he is a descendant of Bruce Lee, and is able to channel Bruce's spirit during the game to perfect his Lee Sin mechanics. But it's not enough to stop the rampage of Mata, who decimates TSM, shouting ""You can't milk those,"" and ""You mess with the bull, you get the horns"" out loud the entire game. 

But Mata was playing Alistar *too* well. After the game he isn't able to break out of character, and starts smashing his head on the ground to stun random passerby. 

""He was a free kill! Where was my follow-up?"" Mata said angrily when questioned. He was later sent to a mental institution to be cared for, and therefore was not able to carry RNG in any further games. 

Fast Forward to day 2.

Riot has promised an answer by the end of the day, so they call in every intern and get them to work attempting to reproduce the bug. 

The day is drawing to a close, and Riot Magus cracks his whip angrily at the interns, ""How hard can it be to find one bug! Get it done by the hour or I'll force you all into unpaid slave labor for eternity.""

""You can't do that! It's illegal!"" shouts one foolhardy intern, only to be silenced by Magus's whip. 

""Sure I can. It's in a clause on page 734 of the contract you signed."" Magus says calmly, and returns to his office to begin writing a statement about Aurelion being disabled for the rest of worlds.

However, Magus was never seen again. The last message from him was a simple ""The bug has been fixed. Enable Aurelion Sol for Worlds.""

Day 2 comes, and begins with a swift 3-0 for SKT against C9, despite heroic plays by Jensen on Syndra. FW similarly demolishes IMAY, but something peculiar happens in game 3 when TSM is up to play SSG. 

Before any bans are locked in, Aurelion Sol gets insta-locked in for Bjergsen. This happens again and again when Riot restarts the draft, so they shrug and decide to just leave it.

The game begins, and Bjergsen sees the spirit of another dragon, not Aurelion Sol, but similar, appear before him. ""You! . . . But you're dead!""

The ghost of Ao Shin says nothing, but slides into his body like CLG slid into Worlds, and takes control. Suddenly, each Aurelion Sol's 3 orbs transform into a relic of the distant past. 6-turrets Hiemerdinger, release Kassadin, and initial-juggernaut Mordekaiser appear, to the surprise of everyone. Everyone but Bjergsen, who crackles with blue energy as he controls them all with flawless micro skill and proceeds to stomp every lane and carry the game. Riot attempts to pause and remake the game, but find they are powerless. Bjergsen is in control.

He doesn't get involved with the jungle though. Instead, Svenskeren picks Lee Sin and solo kills Ambition's Rek'Sai 7 times, while stealing every buff. Because Doublelift, playing Jhin, never appears on screen, he is given MVP for his dedication to the 'hidden sniper' motif.

The rest of the day is fairly standard. Splyce do surprisingly well vs. RNG, but still lose. INTZ demolishes H2K off the back of Yang's Gnar, with a huge outplay in a Tockers vs. Ryu 1v1 near the end of the game. Ryu is asked for a comment after the game, but only replied with -________-. EDG vs. AHq is such an even game that at the 120 minute mark it is declared a tie.

Something is clearly amiss when Huhi takes the stage for the opening game of Day 3. He crackles with blue energy, and doesn't respond when his teammates talk to him. As the game begins, Aurelion Sol is insta-locked for CLG. The game begins similar to TSM's previous one, but this time Huhi's teammates argue with him and ask what's going on. Angry that he is being questioned, Huhi moves Darshan, Stixxay, and Aphromoo to ANX's side and locks xmithie in the jungle alone.

This time Aurelion Sol's orbs transform into release Xin Zhao, reworked GP, and dodge Udyr. Again, Ao Shin's ghost uses his chosen mid laner to stomp every lane, and single-handedly win the game, despite being 1v8. Xsmithie was the only one not upset about this in the post-game interview, stating ""I had fun just clearing all the jungle camps. It was very peaceful.""

Every time TSM or CLG play, this same phenomenon occurs. Aurelion Sol is insta-locked, and breaks through time and space to win the game, by the hands of a possessed mid laner. It takes its toll on the team after a few days. Doublelift throws a fit about not being able to carry, and threatens to quit, though Bjergsen spends some alone time with him and they sort it out. Xmithie announces that he plans to retire to live peacefully with nature in the amazon jungle.

""I've had a long career killing animals, and I've recently had a change of heart"" the NA pro responded when interviewed after his announcement. He started to say something about a gorilla, but was quickly cut off by surrounding Riot employees.

Unsurprisingly, TSM and CLG secure first place in their groups. C9 also manages to get out of groups with the #2 seed, making it a historic Worlds for the NA LCS. No EU teams come close to making it out. SKT and CLG meet in semifinals, and Faker puts up a surprisingly good fight with Riven mid vs. Aurelion Sol. Huhi seems to respect the 1v1, and uses pure mechanical skill to outplay Faker. He sends release LeBlanc top-lane, and AP Rengar bottom. Huhi activates URF mode for these two champions, making them strong enough to kill anyone who to enters the lane.

For their semifinals, TSM play the breakout 1st seed from group A, INTZ. The game ends in 7 minutes and 53 seconds, a quick execution by the dragon-possessed Bjergsen.

After all these years, the fated rivalry reaches its height. TSM vs. CLG Grand Finals. Each team turns to their midlaner, knowing that this battle is out of their hands. Huhi and Bjergsen are silent, staring at their monitors as CLG insta-locks Aurelion Sol. It's an easy 1-0 for CLG as Bjergsen controls 4 Tahm Kenches and prevents his allies from leaving the base. The next 3 games progress similarly, each team trading wins until the score reaches 2-2.

The circumstances are pretty weird, and through an odd loophole in the drafting rulebook under the ""WTF 2 SHENS?"" clause, the final game ends up being an all-for-one mirror match with Aurelion Sol on both sides. Huhi and Bjergsen invite their teammates to join them, as all 10 players unite under the control of Ao Shin.

Each team tries to Q+E combo towards the enemy base for an enormous stacking stun, and they meet all meet in mid lane and detonate. The black holes combine together and become real, exploding and destroying earth. 

~~-                                                                             -~~

One decade later, a lone figure looks down on the remnants of Earth from the secret spaceship he never released to the public. The SANDBOX. His name is Marc Merril, and he barely survived the explosion and escaped into space. Fortunately, Riot had enough spaghetti to last him centuries. He has spent years working to uncover the origin of the original bug. The one that awoke the ghost of Ao Shin and caused the downfall of humanity.

He punches a string of numbers into his supercomputer, and jumps with surprise when it shows him the answer he's been searching for all along.

Marc exclaims ""Doh! That was a really bad call by me. The stars were coded as minions the whole time!""

559p4o,1,2016-09-30,Day 14 - Disjointed Account - Ups and Downs - Multiple Addictions,SpiritofInvictus,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/559p4o/day_14_disjointed_account_ups_and_downs_multiple/,"Hey there. I apologize in advance if this is somewhat disjointed, I just wanted to write some of it down and get it off my chest. 

Since I started NoFap two weeks ago, completely abstaining from PMO since then, I’ve come to experience at least some of the alleged benefits. I definitely noticed an increase in confidence, in that I just went up to a fellow intern and started a conversation while concentrating on her face and not her tits, and had fun doing so. (Though admittedly I also admired her figure when she wasn’t looking, but nothing quite as extreme as I used to do.) I also caught her staring at me and after getting over the initial surprise I looked back, and we grinned at each other. She had amazing eyes. 

On the flipside, I’ve a lot of porn flashbacks and sometimes it’s not that easy to focus on something else. Not quite an urge yet, but it could quickly become one were I to indulge my thoughts further. It’s par for the course as far as I’ve read on this subreddit, so I guess there’s not much I can do but endure and show some fortitude. In regards to emotions, today was also a first for me. The last two weeks have been great and I was in a good mood, but today I noticed that I was really apathetic and annoyed by simple things like people talking in front of me. I’ve read the 101 so I wasn’t taken completely by surprise, but it was still a disheartening experience after the last few days. 

Once I’m back home I’ll have more opportunities to indulge in hobbies like writing and exercise (started cold shower and journaling already), and I’ve been doing meditation on and off for a while now. I hope that’ll help me move forward. The goal is a complete reboot. It’s my first time in NoFap; I’ve been an addict for most of my life. I started at age 11 or 12 and continued onwards up to age 25, steadily moving into stranger porn fetishes. 

Adding to that (and something that made me fap even more) is that I’m experiencing HPPD. It’s a byproduct of intensive and high dosage LSD (and other psychotropic drugs) use that made sure I have visual representation of my thoughts when I focus on it (which happens quite often). This can be bad (which it was for quite some time – think spiders) but it can also be incredibly “good,” which it became after I started healing from the trip that made me abstain completely. Once that happened it kinda flipped a switch in my mind and suddenly I had all the porn stars and pictures and movies at my command with a simple thought . . . ultimately leading me further into another addiction, one I couldn’t have foreseen even had I tried. So, that’s me. Free of drugs for ~9 months now (but with visuals) and NoFap initiate since two weeks ago. 

I actually found this subreddit after a vacation where I had no opportunity to spank it for five days. I felt good but once I came back I fell into old behavior. My aim back then was to do it once and then stop for another few days. I binged, of course. The Chaser effect as I now know is a bitch. But at least it made me aware of this place, so I guess it’s all good now. I don’t know if I’ll hold out for 90 days or even longer, right now I’m concentrating on just doing one day after another, hoping for the best.

So, fellow abstainers, a shout out to all of you: Keep holding out! And for further motivation, take a passage from Invictus:


*In the fell clutch of circumstance*

*I have not winced nor cried aloud.*

*Under the bludgeonings of chance*

I'm currently applying to colleges and I really enjoy computer programming. I've got an internship at a large well known development company and I genuinely love it. I look forward to going there and I really really love learning about coding. It's just really interesting to me. That being said. I want to do more practical programming as opposed to theoretical stuff. I'm more into the engineering aspect.I don't really like hardware as much as I like software. But not many colleges have a software engineering major, so would I be better off majoring in Comp Sci even though it's a science not engineering and isn't ABET accredited or would a Computer Engineering degree also be a good option."

My sister and I used to call her the Prophetess of Doom, because nothing good will ever happen, and she can turn anything positive into a negative. But I hesitate to use it here because it seems too light-hearted for her nastiness. 

I've been sharing these stories with DH lately so that he can develop a better understanding of my past, which unfortunately still rears its ugly head from time to time and affects me in the present. We also may be moving back to the home state and have to deal with Nmom more, so it's helpful preparation for both of us.

I'm not fond of kids. We don't and won't have any. A LOT of that has to do with my own abusive background and self-hate for the helpless child I was, jealousy of anyone who appeared to have a ""normal"" childhood, etc. But I don't hate kids, and I feel like I've made a lot of progress with my knee-jerk hostility towards them.

My Nmom, however, hates a lot of people/things. She derives a scary amount of enjoyment from her hate.

This conversation with her took place a little over a year ago. I was on the phone with her and told her about my luck in securing a six month internship at an extremely prestigious national museum--one of several within a specific institution. She says she's happy for me, which is all well and good. But she can't stay on a positive note. Nope, not my Nmom! 

She then proceeds to tell me a story about an encounter she had at one of the partnering museums a few years ago. She and my dad were on a big trip and one of the options was to visit this museum, which they jumped at. This was a bucket-list museum for my parents, especially my dad. Now, this museum is located in DC, so ALL the museums there are crowded MOST of the time. TONS of school field trips. It's just the way it is, and everyone knows this.

Nmom told me that she had never, EVER seen so many terribly-behaved children in her life! (Sure, Nmom. Sure.) I'm mostly tuning out her bitch session, until she shares this gem: Apparently she and my dad were stuck in line behind some of these horrible young children, who noticed a dog tag display and booth where you could have your own made. The kids were pointing them out to each other, thinking they were cool but not really understanding what they were. Nmom loudly interrupts the kids and says to them: ""*I* know what they are and I wish you had some in your mouth RIGHT NOW!""

Holy fucking SHIT I wish I had called her on it! Instead, I just got off the phone ASAP. What a horrible fucking thing to say to ANYONE, let alone little kids! And she has this nasty, nasty tone of voice. I'm certain that her tone has killed happy, innocent beings. Add that to her obvious glee in relating/reliving the encounter. She didn't say a single thing about the awesomeness of the museum, what they saw, how my dad enjoyed it, etc. Just gloating about how awful she was to some elementary school kids.

And that is my lovely Nmom. Feel free to suggest a name!

Edited to add: If you think this is the place then I have more stories to share. Dammit.

55a2df,5,2016-09-30,Molding into the complete data scientist ( or atleast thats what im aiming for),Antreas93,datascience,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/55a2df/molding_into_the_complete_data_scientist_or/,"So, i am currently in my last year of my Bs in Business Administration with a specialization in Management Science and a minor in Accounting. I should also add that i am from Cyprus(and my primary intention is to stay here)  and study in the University of Cyprus. In my degree i have stats courses, quantitative methods for businesses(which  most of it is basically linear programming in SPSS), some information technology courses like python for business purposes and e-commerce and now i have applied programming models(using excel and General Algebraic Models(GAMs) ).
 
The past 2 years i learned about data science and started liking the idea of it so i started the famous JHU data science specialization through coursera. I only studied during the summers and christmas so i just finished everything except the capstone. I also did some courses about Internet of Things and a more theoretical course about data science, to better grasp the key concepts, through FutureLearn (IoT and Data to Insight). I also did a basic course for SQL through Udemy. I think thats most of it.

This summer i had a one month internship in a big4 company in the data analytics department. The problem is, because of the duration and the fact that they used other programming language than R and Python, i couldnt contribute much. I was, of course, assisting and working with the team on the logical aspects of the coding and i learned many things. I would like to have a more hands on approach but one month wasnt enough. 

Anyway, i felt that i could do that job and enjoy it(most of the time) but its not easy to find many jobs that are willing to train you in Cyprus. So, i was thinking that i should do a Ms in Computer Science to get the programming background needed for that job, but i would need to get a full-time job and do the Ms part-time. I liked the Distance Learning master that Georgia Tech offers for CS and might look more into it.

According to these, and the fact that i do not want to work in a totally unrelated sector, i looked into some jobs regarding actuaries. I researched it a little bit and thought of starting as a Junior Actuarial Analyst while studying the Ms of CS. I even thought of completing the Certified Actuarial Analyst qualification. 

The way i see it an Actuarial Analyst is a data analyst more focused on insurance, health and investment sector. If i can accomplish both the part-time Ms and the CAA( it consists of 6 modules and i can study and pass the first one before i finish my Bs) together along with a job , in 3-4 years i could become a CAA and hold a Ms of CS.

I know its going to be hard but i think it would mold me into the ideal data scientist. Background in business from my Bs, computer science from my Ms and advanced analytical and statistical skills from CAA and the work experience as an actuarial analyst would be great.

I know i wrote a lot(also late night writing) but there arent many people to talk here and having read many threads here, you seem like you could help me out.
A big thank you to anyone who makes it out alive from this post and any insights appreciated.

tl;dr no summary feasible"
55a8b3,1,2016-09-30,Internship Return Offer Advice,Mandias09,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/55a8b3/internship_return_offer_advice/,"I am a freshman, and this upcoming spring semester I will be working with a company that has an office next to my campus. I have accepted the spring internship (and am excited for it!), but they just offered me an extension to also work for them during the summer as well. I told them I want to wait for a little bit, and they said there's no rush and the offer will always be on the table.

The company is a financial/bank company, but is trying to become much more of a tech company, and the office seems very tech-company esque, and the pay (for the area) is pretty good. 

My one gripe is that this area is not somewhere I'd want to live over the summer -- there's nothing here.

My question is: should I accept the return offer for the summer? Or is it a good idea to try to work somewhere else during the summer (to experience a larger variety of companies)?

If I were to try to get an internship at a different company for the summer, what is the best way to leverage my current and return offer to get an interview / offer? 

(Since I'm a freshman, so far, the hardest part has been getting the interviews). And I don't know if it impacts anything, but I go to what is considered a top school.

Thanks in advance for the advice!"

I recently received an developer internship offer at Bank of America in NYC (thanks to the amazing resources in this subreddit!) as part of the Global Technology Summer Analyst program. Has anyone else had experience with Bank of America SE/dev internships or this specific program?
In particular I'd love to learn about the culture in the tech division of the company (workplace dynamics, office environment, dress code, hours, etc.), projects interns work on, the experience there compared to tech companies (or what the experience is like doing dev work in big financial institutions), cheap housing nearby, the intern community (and any events), etc. My fears are working on menial/insignificant projects and the reputation of outdated tools in banks. Any insights would be appreciated.
Thanks!"

Before coming to my uni, I had not known how to code and just recently learned from the classes different ideas such as linked lists/stacks/classes/pointers etc. and am now in my (standard) C/Assembly class, which I assume I would not be using for any potential internships or data work.

I used Python over the summer to create an analytics software, and also use it for general purpose coding. What does it mean to be proficient in a coding language enough to be able to do tech interviews in it, or what does ""language proficiency"" mean in general? I know python enough to use a SQL-connected library like pymysql/MySqlDB and also create classes and so forth, but dont know the full extent of what I should know if I were to use it as a language."
55apk1,4,2016-09-30,I'm trying to become a graphics software engineer. Help?,screenlit,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/55apk1/im_trying_to_become_a_graphics_software_engineer/,"Hi, I've been looking for a second job for ~4 months now with limited success. My dream is to be a graphics software engineer, and most of the positions I have applied to have been that title or related. Unfortunately, my lack of experience in that specific field seems to be holding me back. Since I don't know anyone who specifically does this sort of work and online resources are limited, I was wondering if:

1. Anyone knew of any companies hiring for associate/entry level graphics SWE positions in the Bay Area.
2. Anyone is/knows a graphics SWE who can give me advice on how to break into the field.

My background: I graduated with a bachelors in CS from a top tier CS university in May 2015. My grades were mediocre and probably would not be enough for me to go into grad school. I've taken courses on linear algebra and computer graphics, as well as operating systems and computer architecture. I have graphics side projects and am pretty solid in C++. I currently work at a mid-sized mobile game company writing tools to process and manipulate graphics assets, making shaders, writing camera code, and other graphics related tasks -- but my title is Technical Artist, which for much of the games industry means ""some scripting, mostly art"" but at my company means ""mostly engineering, little bit of art"". I also had an internship as a developer at a mobile game startup."

I find myself in an awkward situation right now. Last summer I had an internship with a tech company and I enjoyed very much what I did and learned. Now I have to choose whether next summer I should stay with the same company for another 3 months and develop new technical skills or go abroad and do pretty much the same thing that I did last summer for another company. 

The international experience would be very useful but job-wise, staying and learning new skills could be better. Given that I'll soon graduate and next summer is pretty much the last time I can do an internship, I don't know which one to choose. Some advice would be appreciated.
