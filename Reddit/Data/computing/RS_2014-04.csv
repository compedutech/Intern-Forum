Insights Please!,bringmysonicsback,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/21vpt1/thinking_of_switching_from_me_to_cs_insights/,"Hey guys I'm sure you answer these types of questions all the time but I wouldn't ask unless it was really bothering me.

I'm 2 years into my ME degree, almost enough for a minor, and starting to think that Computer Science might be a better fit. I have an internship where I do very basic programming and I enjoy it very much.

Basically, I want a bad ass job. I just want to be fascinated and challenged for a living with MINIMAL REPETITION. I'm told that CS opens more doors and the job security is certainly much better. Level of difficulty is no concern.

What do you guys think Stick with ME or take the ME minor and pursue CS?
What cool stuff could I do with a CS major and ME minor?

Thanks!"

I'm a couple semesters away from graduating college, this summer I'll be applying to medical schools. This has been my dream for as long as I can remember, unfortunately my grades are not where I want them to be and my chances are very very very slim if they even exist at all.

On top of this I am trying to better my odds at getting accepted to any medical school by finding related work. A few months ago I managed to convince a lab researcher to take me on for a few months as an intern. I applied for funding two months ago and today I was informed that my application was unsuccessful and that I will not be getting funding. I screwed up by letting my grades get so low when I was 18 and 19 and now that I'm almost 22 and trying to rectify the matter, things just seems to keep getting screwed up for me.

This has been bumming me out more than anything else has ever before. I wake up in a funk, I spend my entire day in a funk and I end it in a funk and I don't really know how to shake this feeling. I'm used to waking up the next morning and forgetting whatever's bothering me from the night before but this has been ongoing for a while and I don't really know what to do.

I still have work ahead of me and this is seriously affecting me ability to get anything done, I just sort of feel hopeless. I need to get my head on straight and cheer my self up so I can get back into the swing of things and at least finish my degree on a high note but I just don't know how to. On top of that, i'm seeing everyone around me and their successes and it just makes me feel like a failure.

I feel like I've fucked up my whole life and the goals I had set for myself because  I wanted to party and enjoy myself and not do a single productive thing when I was 18. Now I'm worried that I'll never reach my goal. 


There's even this girl back home who I really like and  I think she likes me but I've been lying to her about how things in my life are going especially about the potential for medical school. I thought I was going to have this internship, but even that's been shot down. She really prides herself on success and looks for it in other people, and I know I can be successful, I just need the chance, but I can't seem to get it.

Any advice on how to get out of this?"

I'm a junior undergraduate student.

But I'm so unhappy.  Four months ago, I broke up with my long distance boyfriend of three years.  I didn't really care at all at first, probably helped by the fact that I went straight into another relationship.  That relationship did not end up working, and now I'm dating someone else.  But now I miss my ex so much.  I can't even masturbate without crying I miss him so much.  I think it's something to do with the spring weather, it reminds me of him and our happy times so much.  In total I""ve dated three guys and all of them ended with the guy not really caring about me very much.  The guy I'm dating now keeps making little comments that makes me so sad, like what really arouses him in women, traits that I don't have (dyed hair, piercings).  He never wants to hold my hand and sexually the relationship has been moving slowly.  I ended up giving him a blowjob the other night but we've never even made out.  I feel so hopeless and sad.  Everything makes me cry.  I want to reach out to my ex but I feel like a loser because as far as I know he already has another girlfriend.  I was pretty crazy in the relationship too so I'm sure know that he's away from he realizes what an absolute psycho I am.  I""m starting to be unable to concentrate on any of my work.  I don't know how to connect with people, I went on a trip over spring break and everyone made friends with each other really quick but I was just unable to interact like a normal person.

DPD
$15,785
Internship high estimate $12,000
Apartment ~$21,600 for 3 years
Total: $49,385

CPD
$48,378
Apartment ~$15,600 for 2 years
Total: $63,978

Difference: $14,385

As you can see, cost is a really important factor for me.  However, my main question is whether it would be more worthwhile to spend an extra year on an internship (or possibly longer if I do not get matched the first time around) and save ~14,000 or finish the CPD in just two years.

I am 23 years old and I am quite anxious to start my career.  The CPD greatly appeals to me if only because of the guaranteed length of time but I would like to avoid as much debt as possible.  Obviously my calculations do not take into account supplies, transportation, living costs etc. but $14,000 even as a rough estimate is a significant amount of money to me.

I am also worried about the course load of the CPD.  I would like to work/volunteer/participate in extracurricular activities but I don't know if I'll be able to put much time in if I'm busy keeping up with the school work.  For those who have completed a CPD, how did you manage your time?  Did you ever wish you had gone with the DPD route?  Is GPA as crucial in a CPD as opposed to a DPD since you don't have to go through the matching program?

I've been thinking myself in circles and I only have a few weeks left to make a decision and reserve my spot.  Any advice would be helpful!"

- My GPA is 2.4, 2.9 in my major, and 4.0 in my MIS classes.

That's basically it. I haven't joined any clubs or anything because I basically work after classes and can't make meetings. I have experience with computers (As should anyone in a major dealing with computers) and have fixed computers for payment.

21w89p,23,2014-04-01,Ellen Pompeo and the current state of the show.,bothanspy1337,greysanatomy,https://www.reddit.com/r/greysanatomy/comments/21w89p/ellen_pompeo_and_the_current_state_of_the_show/,"Is it just me or has Meridith's screen time been greatly reduced since season nine?  I hardly feel like we see her now.  The show seems to have moved from following the life of Meredith Grey to an ensemble  cast with Ellen Pompeo serving as the narrator.  I got me thinking about the current state of the show and I think I have an answer to that popular question of ""how long is the show going to last?""

First, let me discuss something I found rather interesting.  Some people may or may not have noticed the importance of a small detail in season nine.  But I think it actually has a large significance:  The name change of Seattle Grace Mercy West to Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital.

Obviously, the way the show went about announcing it made it seem like a ""fresh start"" kind of deal.  It was a welcome change of the hospital was nearly shutdown and we lost so many main characters.  But why exactly?  Well SGMW is a mouthful and quite frankly an awful name.  So that was probably one of the reasons.  But consider this:  With Ellen Pompeo's fading screen time, is it possible that the entire name change was a move to ensure they can still call the show ""Grey's Anatomy"" without Meredith?  I suppose that they could always use the medical textbook ""Gray's Anatomy"" as an excuse for the name, but the spelling is different.

The show isn't about her anymore.  She gets the same amount of screen time, if not less than every other cast member.  We see far more of Callie and Arizona, Jackson and Avery, Owen and Christina, and pretty much every other cast member but Meredith.  She maybe is getting like two to five scenes an episode now.  It shouldn't be a surprise or a treat when the supposed star of the show finally has a scene...

The leaving of Meredith would be like a domino effect.  If Meredith leaves, she likely wouldn't die.  That would just be a tragic and depressing ending for her character which wouldn't make a lot of sense, especially when you consider that the show is kind of like her own memoirs.  So if she leaves, that means Derek leaves.  So now we're missing the two stars of the show.  This means the writers have to make a crucial decision:  Liquidate the rest of the cast  à la Scrubs, meaning you reboot the show and start from square one.  Or, you attempt to go full ensemble (which they're already kind of doing) with the shell of the cast.  Now I know I said earlier that Meredith isn't already a major character anymore, but the story is still centered around her at the end of the day.  How much of an impact would that have on the show?

I really feel like season nine was pushing in this direction with all of the new interns.  Parts of their internship felt just like Seasons one and two, except a lot shorter and not nearly as interesting.  In fact it felt so similar to the beginning of the show, I have a feeling some of their plot lines were taken directly or at least inspired by some of the original scripts.  We even had an intern die unexpectedly!  But the reason the show backed down so quickly was because no one really liked the interns.  They weren't really interesting and just seemed to argue and complain.  The only one whose gotten an positive feedback is Jo, which explains why she's the only one who won't be getting the axe next season.

Either way, I can picture (just like Scrubs) Grey's Anatomy getting one or two seasons at best after Pompeo's departure.  The show will try to pick up the broken pieces and make something fresh, but it will ultimately fail because after countless deaths and departures of so many cast members, the main start leaving is like the final nail on the coffin.

I feel like we're moving closer and closer in this direction.  It's very important we pay attention to all of the released information for the show that's coming out; especially contract renewals.  Most TV shows sign main cast members for at least two seasons.  And I think it's very obvious at this point Pompeo doesn't want as much to do with the show as she used to.  Same with Dempsey.  In fact, I think it's public knowledge that Dempsey had to be convinced to renew his contract again.  So let's keep our eyes and ears open the next few months and see how long the contract renewals are.  I think it's safe to say anyone who is signed on for only one season will be departing at some point during season eleven.

So what do you guys think?  I know this is way too much text, but this has been on my mind for a few months now."
21wbmx,4,2014-04-01,Could someone help me out / offer advice?,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/21wbmx/could_someone_help_me_out_offer_advice/,"Hi all, 

I thought I would post here and get peoples opinions / thoughts. 

I think I have struggled with depressive thoughts since I was 15. I am 23 now. I used to live abroad, I moved back to the UK when I was 16 after eight years. Since living in the UK except for study, a few very good friendships and some internships. I have lived a very isolated life. Some aspects of my life are healthy. I'm a funny, caring and empathetic person. Have some great friends. I would like to think handsome and intelligent. When around people I trust in an environment I know, I seem to be the life of the party.

I graduated from University last Summer at the top of my class. Straight out of University I was offered an internship with a very well known established brand in Zurich. I declined it due my very insecure thoughts. The same happened with a shoe brand for a job in another country. 

I have had some more interviews for work since then, locally. Nothing has worked out though. Due to not being offered the position. It really brings my depressive thoughts to the forefront. 

At the beginning of this year I moved half way across the country with my parents. I don't know anyone here, having trouble securing a job, very lonely. 

Some days I wish I just didn't exist. On the job front, silly things worry me. Traveling alone, trains, people seeing how depressed / insecure I am, not living up to expectations. 

It's not the job front. I am a deeply, deeply unhappy person but due to this I feel as though I am also wasting my potential.  

I never open up about all of this to anyone but the thoughts are getting so dark, I need to. 

A side note I should mention. I don't think about the incident a lot but when I was 18. I was attacked by 12 people walking home after a night out. My cheek and nose broken. Some minor injuries to my back. Went to court. My depressive / anxious thoughts occurred before the incident but can't help think it plays some part.

21wd9a,4,2014-04-01,My resume is going to be mighty thin.,Historiun,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/21wd9a/my_resume_is_going_to_be_mighty_thin/,"I've been reading multiple online articles discussing the types of things you should and should not put on a resume. Specifically one for a undergrad seeking student employment or an internship, like me. They mention things like, ""List conferences you've attended, or had work presented at."", ""Give examples of projects you've worked on outside of school."", or ""List the various technical books you've read."". I paraphrase of course. 

This is all well and good, but I have a problem. I have exactly zero of those things under my belt. Reading the technical books is a relatively easy fix sure, but the rest? My main problem, I suppose, is that I'm getting started very late in the game. I'm 25, have a bachelors in history, and am currently working towards an associates in Computer Science with an emphasis in computer programming. I spent the time after my graduation desperately seeking pretty much any type of job I could find, that's a history degree for you, and working at various non cs related places. I realized I liked computer science and figured it would have much more opportunity for jobs and advancement than I currently had. So I enrolled at my community collage and got started. 

I do very much like this field. It's fun, challenging, and I'm not awful at it. However, I feel like I have almost nothing to offer. Maybe once I finish school, but I see these people all the time who either somehow stumbled into a cs job with no experience, or knew as much or less than me and got lucky. I just don't know what to do. Ideas? Suggestions? I'll take all I can get."

He is in his second and final year and I am in my first. He was my assigned mentored throughout the beginning of the program and helped me a lot. After his duties were fulfilled, he would still regularly check in on me to see how everything was going. As time went on and regular conversations began in which we realized we had a lot in common, we became good friends.

It didn't take long for me to start falling for him. Another girl [28/f] in the second year of the program is good friends with both of us, so I asked her what my chances are. She informed me that he is very closed off. He is very into his religion and she's not sure if he will marry outside of it (he's Jewish, I'm Catholic but not practicing) and she is pretty sure he has never had a girlfriend. She warned me that he is very bashful and easily intimidated so I should not go ""hard and fast.""

I liked him enough that I agreed to these terms but that was about two months ago. I have slowly began to flirt with him more and I get very mixed signals. Sometimes he will flirt back and sometimes not.

The second-years have an internship which they go on part way through the year. On their last day of class which was about a month ago, he stopped by to post up a poster on the wall of our classroom for me to see the next time I was in class; it was a bit of an inside joke between us and it actually belonged to him and was something he treasured. When I texted him about it the next day, he said he knew I would take care of it and felt he had to leave something behind.

Since they've been on internship, I've heard from him less, but I figure it is because they are busy. I invited him to my birthday and he didn't show up, texting me in the morning to apologize and say that he accidentally passed out after the exhaustion of his first week of internship (he starts at 5 a.m. and only leaves when he's finished). He told me he'd make it up to me though by hanging out sometime. He also came to visit last week, staying to chat for two hours.

Do I bug him about hanging out? Do I tell him I like him? Do I leave him alone and give up? Any input is welcome. :)

21wo0y,2,2014-04-01,Extremely confused and in a dark place over a break.,[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/21wo0y/extremely_confused_and_in_a_dark_place_over_a/,"My ex GF(23/F) decided that we needed to take take a break. I'm assuming it's a break up now, and not just time apart for a while, due to all the stuff I've seen and read from her online. I understand I shouldn't contact her, or look at her Facebook or Instagram since it'll hurt me more. I just can't help it since I still truly love her and care about her. Sure she's my first true GF, but I've never had a connection with anyone else like I have with her. She made it seem like she did too. I know that since I have no friends, I've attached all myself worth and happiness to her. I just can't seem to stop wanting her, while it seems like she's over me. Like someone told me, I need to stop obsessing over her, but I can't. There's some stuff I haven't posted or included in here since I don't know where to put it. If need be, I can include it.

The night before she decided we needed to take a break, she seemed to love me, but when we were driving back, she started talking of how she hates that my parents control me, and I'm to afraid to stand up to them. I've talked to them since, and realize that I was under the impression that I had to ask them to do things. I just had to let them know I was going to do something. They might of gotten mad, but that's probably it. It also didn't help that I lied to them about a lot of things, which led them to assume things themselves, which caused a lot of tension between myself, my parents, and my ex.

I have one friend, but we don't hang out much since I don't know how to ask him how to hang out besides when we have classes at campus. I haven't attempted to make new friends since I don't go anywhere or really have much to do besides classes. Even then, I don't have much motivation to go to classes. I just feel down. Even before this, I never wanted to go. Why? I'm not sure. Not to go off on a tangent, but when I do go, I'm fine. It's the motivation to get up, get ready, and go that I lack. I don't go anywhere since I used to do it all with her. I've tried, but I just can't bring myself to. I start, then I start to ask myself, ""do I really need to go?"" I've been really close to ending everything. From dropping out of school and just getting a job, to wanting to die. 

I'll be honest since I didn't put it in my previous posts when I needed some advice. (Here's the previous post I made if you want to see some of the backstory: http://redd.it/200bds and http://redd.it/204c2x) I've looked at her texts and messages before because I felt that's the only way I could know things since she usually never told me or only told me when she remembered or someone else asked and I was there to hear. I stopped for a while, then I started again, but not as bad as I used to. A lot of it was just stupid stuff, but some of it made me think she had either thought about cheating on me, or did. I confronted her about some of it a long time ago when I saw it, and she said it was just out of context how I was reading it, or it was so that her friend who was cheating, would know she wouldn't say anything.

Well I think a month or a few weeks before we took the ""break"", she showed me how some guy she used to have lunch with when she was completing her internship started messaging her after she added him, well I think she added him. He was what seemed like flirting with her. That raised red flags to me, but I brushed them off because I wanted to trust her. She made it seem like she was in love me with me no matter what. Now I don't remember fully, I just remember parts, but later I saw he told her if they could hang out. Now I'm no prude and I could careless if they hung out. What upset me was she never told me about it and I didn't tell her that I saw. He also asked if she was, I think bad? She said no, but that she wasn't boring. Then later a friend asked if she wanted to go out to some bars. I told her go since she complained that she didn't have friends and I was leaving since I had class early the next day. I don't know why, but I went in her facebook and saw she messaged him to go out with her. Again, it didn't bother me until I saw he said, ""I want to see you"". And she said to meet her at her car. That just freaked me out bad. Again I never told her I saw and knew and she just acted like it never happened. She's since deleted the messages. 

Also, she told me that some of her co-workers at her new job, which was a non-profit, told her that it seemed like she was single since I was only there on the weekends. It never bothered her before, but I'm assuming it is now since she's done with school and can do things with not much worry. 

Then the first week after we took the ""break"", I freaked out and looked at her facebook, her emails, and looked where she went on icloud. I know it sounds like I turned into a stalker, and I realize I pretty much did. That's when I found out she went to the bars, ordered new furniture, and she got a new job. I shouldn't have done that because it just led me to feeling more hurt. I thought she was with someone else or already moved on from me. Maybe she has, maybe not. Seeing her posts also made me feel bad. Her post of a picture of herself saying temporarily alone made me think there was a chance still. Then her out with her roommate made feel bad because I, for some reason wanted to be there with her. 

I couldn't help but I kept looking at her page and saw her post a picture of her with a baby and she looked happy and said she wanted one. Again it brought me down because she seemed happy without me. The next post that brought me down again was a picture of a bracelet she has that says love. She captioned it, ""All I need is love!"" It just hurt so much because I still love her and haven't stopped. I wanted to say that she still had my love. It made me think she stopped loving me. Next seeing her post that picture of getting hurt in a relationship is like a toothache made me lose it and pretty much breakdown and want to end everything. The latest post that I saw and probably shouldn't have is a picture of herself saying how she's going out and going to have fun. It didn't hurt really, but just made me start thinking she moved on. Sure I'm probably over thinking things like I usually do, but I can't just help it. I love her so much. I hate to admit it, but I have from time to time, logged into her facebook and instagram to see what she posts or says. 

I mean I know I have let her down before because I've said I would change, and I did, but not fully. Also, because I'm still in school. She told me before she had this plan where I had graduated when I was supposed to, and we'd probably be married by now. Then she said she might want to have kids, but wants to do things like travel and whatnot before that. But I can't since I have school and I was under the impression that I had to ask my parents. I mean, I could now since I know that I don't have to ask them, just let them know. Then I had just been going through the motions of the relationship lately, instead of trying like I used to. I don't know why I stopped. I guess I took it for granted that she was still with me even though I've fucked up instead of getting better. 

She's given me chances to change but I never fully did. I'm pretty sure she wanted to take our relationship to the next level, but I couldn't because of school and I was too afraid to stand up to my parents. I also realize that I never really wanted to do anything because I was scared to ask my parents and I didn't want to spend money since I would have to ask my parents for it and felt I needed their permission. That and I was always tired for some reason, even though I slept more than enough. I had started to think that I could move over there with her and just commute to classes. But that idea is gone since we're on the ""break"". Like I said, I'm probably over thinking things. I still have stuff at her apartment, and I would like to go get somethings, but I don't know how to go about it. I was thinking I could go and not tell her, but I don't want to seem like a creeper or anything. 

I hate to admit this now, but I recently logged into her facebook after about a little over a week of not being tempted. I looked at her messages and saw that she talked with an old co-worker from her internship. The lady told my ex ""I asked Curtis if he was talking to you heart heart :)"" and my ex replied ""Omg lol"". That led me to how I felt before again but worse. Like I want to end everything and die. Not quit school and just give up like before, but to end everything. I can't help but think they flirted while she was at the internship and now they're talking and she might move on from me to be with him when she had told me ""You haven't lost me"". I don't know what to think now and I can't focus or think of anything else now. I'm just really really lost. If I don't feel any better in a few days. I'm going to go see the therapist on campus about this.

Sorry for this wall of text and if any of this is confusing or what not. I'll explain anything as best as I can if need be.

**TL;DR- My ex made it seem like this would just be time apart and I could later try again at the relationship. Saw her posting things making me think otherwise. Fucked up and logged into her Facebook and saw she might be talking to another guy. No I'm really confused and want to end everything.**"
21wpum,3,2014-04-01,I [22 M] am just about to start a relationship [22 F] with a girl who was fairly severely emotionally abused by her parents. This is her first dating relationship. What do I have to watch out for?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/21wpum/i_22_m_am_just_about_to_start_a_relationship_22_f/,"I'm asking because the psychology of abuse is kind of freaking me out. I have the ability to really control this relationship if I want to (I don't) and her stunted relationships with people in general, and men in particular means she has no idea how I should be acting. What specifically can I do to begin to help foster a right understanding in her of a healthy relationship?

A quick background on her: deeply religious parents, and while I have deepy religious parents as well, her mother is clearly unstable. Would lock her in her room on weeknights in highschool, steal her keys so she couldn't leave the house, and yell at her for long periods of time while she would lay unresponsive on her bed. They had complete access to her phone and Facebook, leaving no room for privacy of any kind, and tell her things like ""God will never love you"", ""Why can't you just be happy"", ""You're ruining everything"" etc. There's more, but that should give you a picture.
 
(The following is the very brief version of the story)

So about a year ago we started talking, and then when I found out how her parents treated her, I challenged her to understand that their response was not normal. She was struggling with anxiety and depression and a compulsive disorder (pulling hair) and so I implored her to seek counseling. Through counseling she has dealt with all of these issues and has become a much happier person. But she has not yet challenged or separated herself from her parents. She is going to soon, with the help a guidance of her counselor. Once that issue is dealt with, we are going to officially ""start"" our relationship (we live about 5 hours apart right now, but I'll be moving into her town, by coincidence, starting in the summer).

I really care about this girl. She's beautiful, incredibly intelligent, and the most compassionate person I have ever met. But this relationship has deeply affected her ability to relate to people. She has never dated, or had any kind of intimate relationship with a man before. 

As far as I'm concerned, I'm very well equipped to deal with these issues. I've worked as a student intern in hospital and prison counseling centers. I've read a lot of material on abuse and trauma because of this (like books worth) so I have a solid grasp of the situation and how to counsel her through it. But being a counselor is not being a boyfriend. 

TL;DR Does anyone who has been in a relationship with someone who was abused have any words of advice/warning? "

Prayers/advice appreciated.,[deleted],TrueChristian,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueChristian/comments/21x90i/going_through_a_tough_storm_prayersadvice/,"Hey guys, first off I'd like to say God is good. I've been battling with a lot of things here in the past few months, but I want to give you guys a bit of backstory first.

If you ever heard of Passion it's basically one of the biggest christian conferences known for their annual spiritual awakenings of young adults. Anyway it was there that I felt God calling me to ministry. If you want I can give you the story on how that went down via message, but that's not the reason I'm posting this.

No, I'm posting this because after Passion I decided to get more involved in church. I intern for my church's youth pastor and help with teaching, organizing lessons, leading youth events, and the like. On  top of that I'm finishing up school, so at times it can be a bit overwhelming. For the longest I've been battling my addiction with drugs and it's a battle I feel like I'm losing. Satan knows this and is constantly giving me temptations that lead me away from the church. 

I want to be clean for God, for my church, and for the kids that look up to me. But it's just so hard. I'm not the best when it comes to dealing with stress so I sometimes find ways to just, ""Get away"". And sure I can find better things to do with my time, but one of the reasons I do drugs in the first place is for recreational purposes with my friends. I don't want to lose them either and I don't see them getting clean anytime soon. Now I don't necessarily condemn drugs like weed and stuff like that, but it's something that I can't be doing with the line of work I want to get in to.

Basically what I'm asking for is some solid advice, and prayers are always a good thing. What do you guys think would be the best thing for me to do?"

One of my professors is in charge of a lab group and was looking to hire an intern. 

He gave me a chance with an interview. I could tell by the end that I was not what he was looking for. A lot of that had to do with me starting the masters program in the Spring and only having one semester while the other applicants have two semesters. 

I didn't think a whole lot about it when I left. 

Yesterday I interviewed to be a Teaching Assistant for another professor in the same department. The interview was going well enough. Then the whole essence of my being sank. I didn't know how to respond when the interviewer mentioned something that happened in my other interview. 

While interviewing for the internship, I had a complete brain fart. Total lapse in thought. I have my BS in Computer Science and forgot what programming languages I knew. Totally blanked on the names. I thought I had played it off and it wasn't a big deal.

In my Teaching Assistant interview the interviewer mentioned how my other professor had interviewed someone that couldn't remember what programming languages he knew. I almost fell to the floor and hoped to blend in with the carpet when he said that. The TA interviewer did not remember the name of the person that was being interviewed for the internship (me) or he did and realized it after he made his statement. 

I have never done something so stupid in an interview, and then to hear it as a funny story from someone else a week later.... "

I don't have the creative freedom here, and I'm not certain that it's the place for me to succeed.

One of the issues I'm running into is my workload.  I've been here a year, and I've been on over 40 projects with anywhere from 3-100 different elements in the project (we do custom signage and architectural elements) and ranging in price from $5k-$4mil.  Each element requires site drawings and engineering, and I'll do upwards of 15-20 pages of engineering drawings for a single complex design complete with product research/BOM, electrical diagrams, finishes, etc.  I'll often be working on drawing 2-3 projects at once, while working production support for another 2 or 3, and aiding installation for another job.  Recently I've been added to the business development team and helping out on estimating as well. Deadlines usually range from 2-3 days (small projects) to 2-3 months (large projects).

I'm still pretty new (1yr), so I haven't gotten entirely into the groove, and am noticing that my design training isn't the best for translating into drafting/design engineering.

I even found out through this job that I had ADHD and never knew about it, hahah (I got supremely frustrated at my attention span about 3 months in, and went to talk to a psych, and he tested me, since then the level of detail required has been more manageable.  Ironic because I failed engineering before Design in college for the same reasons).

I guess I'm looking for some perspective.  I never got beyond internships for a year after graduating with a degree in Industrial Design in 2009, and was lucky to grab a job using technical skills I learned in school, but I want to know if I make the switch back if I can expect more grueling work or less?

And apparently I'm the only Doctor on call.

Our computer patient in the most critical condition is being used by 4 different people.

They come in at different hours of the same day and some on different days then the others.

It shouldn't be that bad of a computer.  It's an Apple G5 Tower.  ""State-of-the-Art"" as my Boss put it.  

However, I don't know my patients technical-medical history.

It had suffered from abuse, that much I know, but it doesn't want to tell me what's wrong with it.  Even when I get close to finding out what's wrong, she just shuts down and I have to start all over.  

Poor girl.  

Must've been put through so much.

The Boss bought it when it first came out so the price of it when it was new ($2K and change) in 2006 is the reason we can't replace it, it cost so much in his view.  It was used by the Boss before being passed down to the children therapy center where for a while it was used by the children before being designated a work computer for graphic designers and interns. 

I don't know why I feel an affinity with this computer.  Maybe it's because she's a workhorse that's been ground down over the years by a Boss that used it for whatever he needed it for and neglecting its needs, just like us workers he employed.  

When I first met her she had no updates done on her, yet had 3 different versions of Adobe Creative Suite installed on her.  

She was timid, temperamental, and unpredictable. She lashed out at any sign of work wanting to be done on her, throwing up her rainbow wheel on almost every click.  Depending on how she felt that day, she would connect to the internet/network drives and then disconnect for seemingly no reason at all.

Every day at this hellhole I was bogged down by stupid projects that would never get done, had to listen to demanding clients who thought we were their in-house IT, or forced to try and fix an issue with a co-workers computer who couldn't get work done until it was fixed.

Not today.  

On this day I decided to dedicate the whole day to helping this poor girl. 

I cleaned out the crayon shavings inside her, uninstalled unnecessary applications, deleted non-essentials files to free up her hard drive, and even diagnosed her connectivity issues.  I gave her all her updates and even brought her up to the latest OS (which she was something like 2 full versions behind on) and gave her a restart.  If she failed to work better by the end of this, I couldn't justify my trying all day and the Boss would be pissed I hadn't worked on other things, but a fuck I did not give.

She started up, got to the desktop login, and after entering the credentials, she ran like I'd never seen her run before.

I took her random blinking light in front as her way of saying ""thank you"", smiled, and made my way back to my office.

&gt;ZD: ""So what's the status?""

&gt;Me: ""She's gonna make it.""

&gt;ZD: ""You know in the end they all get replaced, right?  With a shit version of the former compy to save money, but still..""

&gt;Me: ""It matters to me, because it mattered to her.""

&gt;ZD: ""Uhhh...ok.""

It mattered to her.

21xtq8,1,2014-04-01,Fiancee has been lying to me about a past relationship,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/21xtq8/fiancee_has_been_lying_to_me_about_a_past/,"My fiancee and I have been together for two years.  Before we started dating and before she and I even started hanging out, she would talk fondly of a certain friend from her school (we met during a summer internship.)  I asked if they had ever dated, and she said no.  No big deal, as I didn't care at the time.  We weren't interested in each other at this point, so I took her statement as honest.

We start dating about a month later, and about two weeks after we start dating she sat me down and told me that she and this guy actually had hooked up...and emphasizes they hooked up once.  I was upset that she lied, and I also felt the normal amount of jealousy that anyone feels when they hear stories about their sig-o's ex.  As time went by and our relationship progressed, I became okay with the idea that she had an ex-lover of sorts, but still uneasy about her lying.

Flash forward about a year.  She gets all nervous all of the sudden one night while we're about to go to sleep, and then tells me that she lied to me, she actually slept with this guy on more than one occasion.  It hurt...again hearing about her ex-whatever, but more this time because she had lied to me.  Her excuse was, ""I didn't want to upset you, that's why I didn't tell you.""  So, I ask more questions, and get what I think is the whole story.  But after that, I couldn't shake this feeling that she was still holding something back from me.  I tried to talk about my hurt feelings several times, but she would yell at me, telling me I need to forgive her and not hold on to it.  The real problem, she said, was that I wasn't forgiving her.

I should add at this point, this is the ONLY thing I've ever not trusted her.  She's always honest with me and is usually very straightforward with me.  I know she loves me dearly.  She's very good at showing it and telling me daily.  I feel very secure in our relationship, with this issue being the one thing that gave me even the slightest pause.  But, she told me what happened and kept insisting that I knew the extent of it.  It was the end of that saga (or so I thought...)

For the most part, I have remained relatively forgiving and forgetful about the incident.  I haven't let it bother me at all, and it's been nice moving to the same city and building our lives together.  

But yesterday, I'm taking a nap after she and I practice our wedding dance (we're getting married in June.)  I have a really weird dream that involves my fiancee and her ex-whatever.  In my dream, the two of them are working at the same place where I work.  

After I wake up, and get that weird feeling again that I used to get...that she wasn't being very honest with me.  So, while she's in the shower, I do something really dumb---I look through her phone.  I find 1) a grouptext with her friends where they ask her about it and she says straight up ""He doesn't know the whole story."" 2) An email between her and this guy from the summer when we met, after we started dating, telling him ""sorry for not being there to accept your call.  I was out drinking with my friends.""  That day, however, was a day that she and I left a work thing early and went back to watch a movie at her place.  There was no drinking.  No party.  No bar.  3)  An email to this guy at the end of the summer saying that she didn't want to be with him because his temper was just too much.  No mention of the fact that she was already telling me she wanted to be with me long-term.  No mention of me at all.  Very weird.

So now I'm left with this issue.  She lied to me, but the only reason I know is because I looked through her phone, which was a stupid thing to do and a breach of privacy.  I know that's stupid.  But I want to know what to do!  How do I talk with her about this.

I don't care about their past relationship, really, as long as she didn't cheat on me.  My problem is the trust.  All of the sudden, I'm calling into question my trust I have for this person who, up until yesterday, I thought was very honest with me.  It turns out she was lying about something we've talked about A LOT, and that makes me question how honest she is about other things as well.  It wasn't like she forgot, and it wasn't like this topic wasn't something we've talked about several times (mostly right after she told me.)

What do I do?

I find 1) a grouptext with her friends where they ask her about it and she says straight up ""He doesn't know the whole story."" 2) An email between her and this guy from the summer when we met, after we started dating, telling him ""sorry for not being there to accept your call. I was out drinking with my friends."" That day, however, was a day that she and I left a work thing early and went back to watch a movie at her place. There was no drinking. No party. No bar. 3) An email to this guy at the end of the summer saying that she didn't want to be with him because his temper was just too much. No mention of the fact that she was already telling me she wanted to be with me long-term. No mention of me at all. Very weird.

So now I'm left with this issue. She lied to me, but the only reason I know is because I looked through her phone, which was a stupid thing to do and a breach of privacy. I know that's stupid. But I want to know what to do! How do I talk with her about this.

I don't care about their past relationship, really, as long as she didn't cheat on me. My problem is the trust. All of the sudden, I'm calling into question my trust I have for this person who, up until yesterday, I thought was very honest with me. It turns out she was lying about something we've talked about A LOT, and that makes me question how honest she is about other things as well. It wasn't like she forgot, and it wasn't like this topic wasn't something we've talked about several times (mostly right after she told me.)
What do I do?

I will be a freshman this fall in Computer Science. **I was wondering what should I do before college** (right about know) **and during college** (especially my freshman year) **in order to get the most opportunities (academically and non-academically) and basically do great in college.** I should say that I know some programming (C++) and most of the curriculum for the freshman year in CS and math is 90% familiar so going to class and studying would not be ""the most important advice that you can give me"" (not that I will not go to class, but I am looking for more stuff to do outside class). I would like to get an internship for the summer after freshman year (I need to so I can pay) and I understand that some average ones pay like $10k over the summer and was thinking of doing something so I can make some extra pocket cash while in school. What advice do you have? (Please something serious) Thank you!!!"

Please critique my resume and cover letter!,SirCloudbear,resumes,https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/21ya06/i_am_late_20s_male_trying_to_get_back_into/,"Here's a brief background about myself since I think it's relevant.  I graduated from a top tier university with a double major in economics and mathematics.  I went to Japan to teach English for 2 years after graduation and decided to go to film school.  After I graduated, I did a couple of internships and freelanced as an editor but it was a struggle the entire time and I had to rely on my parents to help me with my finances from time to time.

After struggling for a few years, I have decided to fall back on economics degree.  I have been accepted to Masters in a work-and-study data analytics/big data program but I am currently trying to find work that's related to economics/data.  When I say *""related""*, I use that term loosely.

Truth is, it's hard to find relevant work in that area since I've been away from economics from so long, even though I got quite decent grades as a student and my professors are more than happy to provide me with a reference.

So far, my applications haven't been going anywhere, so I would really appreciate it if I can get some feedback for my resume and cover letter to get it into the best shape you can be.

----------------------
Also, I have some concerns with my resume that I would like your opinion on.
- I don't know if I should keep this line at the top ""Economics and mathematics major with a strong analytical, technical, and quantative skills.""  I feel like my resume is filled with all kinds of jobs, and it might be hard for recruiters to know what I want to do without it.
- As for my cover letter, although I have a wide variety of work experience, most likely none of them is relevant to the jobs that I am searching for.  This brings up an issue - specificity:  I don't know how to make my cover letter specific to the company and I don't know how to highlight my skills and experience and connect it to the job without it sounding like BS, since most likely they will be vastly different.

Thanks for reading my long post.  I am really grateful for any feedback I get.

21ycg5,0,2014-04-01,My Chances?,[deleted],college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/21ycg5/my_chances/,"Hey Guys, I am currently a Junior and Highschool and to be honest I am a little freaked out.

I keep hearing all these kids getting rejected and denied from colleges and it scares me like crazy. Honestly, I am not a Straight A student.
My first two years of high school I was mostly B's. and B+s (nothing below a B). This year its been a few A's and B+'s once again. I think my gpa un-weighted is a 3.3 (my school does not weight the grades). I have taken 3 honors classes Sophomore and Freshmen year and am in 3 Honors classes this year. I am Pre calc for math as well as AP Chemistry this year. I guess Pre calc is considered one level up for most Juniors.

I think it is something about me and school, Not that it is hard to get A's, but I just never seem to pull it off. There is always that other kid in my class who is far stupider then me who has 4.0's. My course load is pretty rigorous compared to others I would say, but I guess its kinda of hard to describe.

I got a 720 on the Math, 650 on the reading and 650 on the writing on the Sat's, not super scored. This is my third year as a member of the First Robotics team which I absolutely love. 2nd year on the Varsity Lacrosse Team, (Freshman was on JV). Member of FBLA. I also have a full time payed internship this summer at a school software company. They develop software and websites for private schools. I only add this because not a lot of Juniors seem to have internships already. I have other stuff on my resume, those are the biggest things. I also develop iPhone apps and love technology.

This reason I list all this is I am curious to know what people think my chances are of getting into schools like Stevens Institute of Technology, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Rochester Institute of Technology, Worcester Polytech Institute, Wentworth, and pretty much any other more STEM focused school. I want to become an Engineer.

For any still reading I just wanted some input on what people think my chances are, and what I should do to improve. 

Thank-You

21yu5t,2,2014-04-01,Student Loan Question + PF question: graduated pmt plan actually costs more in interest than a straight pmt plan?,[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/21yu5t/student_loan_question_pf_question_graduated_pmt/,"Will be graduating in May from a CSU school. I transferred from a junior college, which saved me some money on loans. These are UNsubsidized Stafford loans @ 6.8% interest. My principle is $15,000 and the interest accrued (I have not made a single pmt towards it) is currently $1819.05 for a total of $16,819.05

I was watching the required video that explains that basically I will have to be paying back this loan, loan officers' roles in the collection process, and a few of the different methods of paying. A couple questions:

1) Why does is it that the graduated repayment, which increases the monthly fee every two years, [actually costs more in the long run with interest](http://imgur.com/kpHky7m)? 

2) Is there anyway I can try to get a lower interest rate? 

 I plan on paying at least double the monthly bill amount to try to knock this out as soon as possible. I have had a good job all throughout college, but I have blown all my money essentially (couple trips, owned a motorcycle, bought a car) except the money I have in my retirement plan at my job. Even with all these expenditures honestly I should still have like $20,000 saved but I digress. Thankfully, my car is a 2002 I bought used outright, and I have no bills other than this loan + my rent and stuff when i move out. I have a job lined up making a little over 50k- so I'm planning on turning a full 180 and becoming extremely financially responsible.

At the beginning of this year I started an internship at a financial firm, and have since been absolutely enlightened and hate myself for wasting money. The internship plus this sub has helped me and I plan on saving (already started) an emergency fund of about $5000 (for now), saving a few grand to move out, pay the loan, and invest in some indexed MFs every month. 

Can you guys answer my loan question and give me your thoughts on my financial position now as well?

Last summer I had an internship with the company ranked as the highest paying internship in the country. I was one of the few interns to not receive a return offer because my internship position no longer existed as a full time position due to a restructuring in hiring. I go to one of the top schools in the country and I've been rigorously applying to jobs since September. I've had many interviews but have not received a single job offer. All of my friends now have offers and I'm going to be graduating in 4 weeks- possibly without a job lined up.
I'm still waiting to hear from one company where I thought I did very well interviewing but since it's been a week since my final interview and I haven't heard anything I'm afraid they are going to reject me too. I'm not sure if I'll be able to pick myself back up again after this rejection. I've been fighting for the past few months to keep trying but looking at the deadline for graduation fast approaching I don't know if I can get anywhere with any other company in that time.
I'm quickly losing faith in my ability to do things and am struggling to finish up my last month of school. I can't even be excited for graduation because all I see waiting for me afterward is failure and I honestly don't think I could live with myself if I reached that point. The only feeling I have felt in the past 3 months is stress and the anxiety and depression that it brings. I have fought my whole life coming from one of the poorest counties in the country to get to this point and now I feel like I've worked so hard for nothing. I'm so tired. I just can't fight anymore..."

21z5v2,5,2014-04-01,Looking for some validation on a startup,Raptor3861,startups,https://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/21z5v2/looking_for_some_validation_on_a_startup/,"Hey Everybody,

We have a startup in the works and are looking to get feedback on whether or not this is a service that people would use. If you don't mind providing us with some feedback, it would be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR We are a service that will allow ""employees"" or ""interns"" to gain experience by working 3 jobs over the course of a year with 3 different companies that are looking to hire interns or co-ops.

The full explanation....

We are creating a site to help people who are looking to gain experience in a real world environment.  We realized that there is a market of people who either just graduated or have used online tools for education such as codeacademy, codeschool, or even online schooling and are having trouble finding jobs due to the lack of experience.  We want to help people gain experience in different companies so they can see different work cultures, understand work life, and help get their foot in the door.

As a student or intern, you get to work for a full year with these different companies.  They will provide projects/tasks over the course of 4 months.  If a company liked you, once the program is complete they can reach out and hire you.  Once you complete a job, there is a survey on the company to help other students get a feeling about the company.  The company will also grade you and you can see where they think you can use improvement.

As a company, you can get fresh blood into a position and give them projects that you may have dreamed about or just need to get done.  In this respect I can speak from experience, at my current job there is so much work that we need to get done, but its more ""nice to have"" rather than ""need to have"".  With our site, we will be able to match you with staff to help complete these projects.  They will bring fresh and new ideas and can help get these tasks done.  At the end of the program, you rate your employee and help them grow where you see they need help.  You then have access to a database of employees at your disposal to help find new hires that are strong in areas you are looking for.

This is the basic idea we want to implement.  There are more features such as mentoring and resume help, etc...  Why would you not want to be involved, what might tip you over the edge to join, have you had any experiences finding interns or internships?  Thanks for taking the time to read and if you have any questions or feedback, please let me know!"

21z90j,13,2014-04-01,Career Path for Electrical Engineers?,wrathptrd12,AskEngineers,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/21z90j/career_path_for_electrical_engineers/,"Hi. I am 3rd year electrical engineering student and want to ask electrical engineers about career paths for EE majors who are actually in the fields out of school. As I only have a year and a quarter to graduate with a degree in EE, I have been thinking a lot about how EE career will be like after I graduate. 

When I was a senior in high school, I was good at math and physics so I decided I want to be an engineer. Then, I looked up types of engineering and, at that moment, I had absolutely no idea what each fields were about and which one would be best for it. I ended up choosing EE because I thought it would be most essential field in engineering career. I read so much about being an electrical engineer in US online which sounded very promising and hopeful. I'm from a family with a single mother who supports entire family, so could not go to 4-year university that I wanted to go when I was admitted after high school graduation. Instead, I went to community college for 2 years, did prerequisite requirements for transfer admission for same university and got in. After this spring, I will have one more year remaining. 

From my experience so far, I love/enjoy EE. It is really fun studying, designing, testing circuits and also learning about other cool things we can do with electricity such as signal processing, nano-technology, and so on. I am doing power concentration because I want to work with efficient energy technology. In particular, my dream job is to work on hybrid vehicle technology such as Tesla motors. 

One problem is that I keep hearing people talking about how tough it is for EE graduates to build career after they graduate. Unlike what I've heard before, everyone I talk to tells me that EE is no longer a field that can grow any further and I should change my career path if I can. I also talk to a lot of senior students in laboratory who tell me of their struggle to get a job or even an internship when they are about to graduate. If that's not enough, people tell me power concentration sucks compared to other EE concentrations. I really don't want to change my concentration because I am really interested in this particular area. All this really put me down and make me feel worried about my future. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I want to ask anyone with EE degree out there for opinions. Is EE really a bad career field that no longer expands? Is it true that it is extremely difficult to find EE jobs these days? Should I consider changing my concentration area to something other than power, or is power concentration really worth it? 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




**
I don't know if this is important, but I had nearly perfect GPA(3.97) for first two years before I transferred, and about ~3.7 GPA, currently at UW in Seattle. I'm doing three electrical power/energy concentrations(descriptions copied from department website below) at the same time, as well as a minor in mathematics. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Power Electronics and Electric Drives: 
Power electronics is among those areas of electrical engineering whose importance is expected to grow dramatically over the next years and decades. Whether one considers hybrid car technology, power supply solutions for data storage centers and high-performance computing, energy efficient technologies, or renewable energy - state-of-the-art power electronics is central to all designs. Electric drives provide important solutions to electromechanical energy conversion and control in broad areas such as transportation or robotics, but also in applications as diverse as hard disks or wind energy conversion.


Sustainable Electric Energy: 
The scarcity of fossil resources, high fuel cost, and environmental awareness are important drivers behind the strong interest in renewable energy. In the USA the capacity of installed wind power converters has increased by 50 % in only one year. Solar energy conversion and fuel cell technology also receive a lot of attention. This track is centered on the key contributions of electrical engineering to the area of sustainable energy.


Large Scale Power Systems: 
This area prepares students for careers in the electric energy industry with utilities, manufacturers, consulting firms and government agencies, and for graduate work in power systems research. Large scale power systems are the largest capital investment industry in the United States. The power system itself has been described as the largest man-made system in the world. Large scale power systems are fundamental foundational infrastructure for the high technology society in which we live. While the problem of efficient generation and delivery of electric energy is as old as the light bulb, the power industry is an avid early adopter of advanced technology to better solve the continuing problem.

First a little about me, I guess. I'm a junior in college, have a part-time gig on work-study and have a little over a 3.5 GPA as of now. I'm introverted, mainly keep to myself and have a tremendous knack for bottling my emotions and leaving myself exhausted from thinking and worrying. The past couple years (i.e. since I've started college) I've struggled with my self-esteem and have been in and out of counseling. I have contemplated suicide on more than one occasion. I am slightly-to-moderately overweight and really consider myself unattractive. I've had a couple relationships but nothing serious at all. I drink more than I should, don't really exercise and don't eat right. I know that these actions lead to me feeling so shitty in the long-run, but the short-run dopamine release is what keeps me coming back to it. Anything to calm me down.


I've had the toughest time in college and with life overall as of late. I shouldn't complain, I truly have a great life and some great people in it. I'm just extremely scared of the future is all. I'm in a major which I'm not sure I want to be in, but it's too late to change it my junior year is over in 2 months. I'm 21 years old, I don't know where the hell I'm going, and it scares the ever-loving shit out of me. I'm afraid of more advanced classes because they typically involve group-work and hefty papers, both of which I struggle with. I've always had friends, but always preferred to be alone. I also suck at writing. School takes up a majority of my stress because, my mother in particular, always instilled the necessity for academic success. This is both a blessing and a curse because if I don't do well in EVERYTHING school-related, I immediately feel inadequate and inferior, yet I've done great thus far (knock on wood). However, I'm unsure if my particular course of study is what I like, but I'm too far in and need about 4 classes over the next two semesters to graduate. My adviser seems disinterested in me, and I haven't spoken with him since my late freshman/early sophomore year.


I'm living with my father, and things were great initially, but now his fiancee moved into our little apartment and I cannot stand it. She's from another town and does not drive, so she just louses around our apartment all day. She takes walks to smoke cigarettes, but tries to be all secret about it, as if I give a fuck. My parents divorced when I was 19 and now my dad is already engaged, and I bitterly despise it deep down. I can't say it though because I feel like he'd say I'm ""being selfish"" or how he ""does everything"" just like I've been hearing for years now. I would love to move out but I only have $1000 to my name. I wish I could stop feeling bitter, but I just wish my home could have my own personal space, just like how it was when I was growing up. They went to Washington to get her stuff to bring back and I noticed they brought real estate books, so I feel like they're ready to move and I'm holding them back.


My mom lives on the other side of the state and I don't talk to her as much as I probably should. She often tells me to not worry so much, as well as how she's so proud of me for how I've turned out. I'm an only child so I know that talking to me means a lot to her. I was given the option of living with either my mother or father when they split up in 2012, and, in hindsight, I wish I would have moved in with my mother. It seems her and my soul are tied together, as corny as it sounds. We are so much alike and I regret that I didn't appreciate her as much before she moved.


What I want is just some security. To know I'm doing the right thing. I've always been in control, but I feel like I'm just going through the motions even though it's something I'm not entirely sure of in uncharted territory. I've heard so much about how I'm still young and it'll all work out but I'm not sure how much to trust it. All of my friends are doing study abroad, or taking vacations, or doing internships. Then there's me, stuck in idle. A dull hum. I just have heard about the glory days of college; but these years have drained me, and still continue to do so. I'm just scared about what's next.

Thanks for listening."

As much of an introverted, self-centered asshole I am, I love you little guy.

You're ten months old and you can't help it. But I can't be your part time parent anymore.

You see, I'm 19 and I'm my third year of college. I am hardly on campus because I have to take care of you while mom and dad work. 

I was against you being conceived in the first place. I told mom and dad not to do it. That we couldn't afford you. And truth be told, we have even less money now because of you. 

I never knew how much you would affect my life until now. I never knew...now I have a taste of how hard some young parents have it. 

I love you but the fact that we're poor has made me desperately selfish. 

I have to graduate from college. I have to do internships and join clubs and get experience. I have to get a career and rise above this lower-middle-class bullshit. 

I can't do it when I'm playing daddy for you. I can't do it when I have you for most of the day. I can't do it when you want me to hold you while I have to look for jobs and internship positions.

And yet, you're so sweet. You're so tender and innocent. Your smiles and your giggles are beautiful. Your clumsiness and the way your quickly crawl away when I'm about to catch you is utterly cute. 

I love the moments when I have you all to myself when I get all my work done. I love it when you fall asleep on my chest while I rock you on the hammock. 

And I feel guilty for sometimes wishing you were never born. I feel guilty when your endless, piercing cries drill into my skull and make me want to strangle you. 

I still can't get over how irresponsible mom and dad were when they had you. Their own financial problems are now their own fault and their children have to suffer for it. You, like both your brothers, were an accident. We were all accidents. 

Maybe it was youthful ignorance? Maybe it was unhindered, curious passion? Maybe it was desperation? Maybe it was foolish love? Our parents made the mistake of having me when they were just starting their lives. They threw away their chances of getting an education and moving up.

Then they had your older brother. What could have motivated them? What made them think another child would made things any easier? 

Then they had you. And you know what?? What they did to themselves 19 years ago, they're doing to their own son. They're holding me back.

Yes, baby brother, this is selfishness. 

I don't want to be like my parents, I don't want this middle-class helplessness. I envy the rich. I envy those who have the means to control their lives and *by god* I will have it. 

Anyway, I love you. But I'm leaving next fall. I'm leaving you so I can take advantage of being young. Of the privilege of living in a dorm and having first world problems and having roommates and being independent. 

Good-bye. Sleep well. "

After over 30 applications I have yet to land an interview or even hear back from anyone with the exception of a MathWorks recruiter who seemingly disappeared off the face of the earth after claiming they wanted to contact me for a phone interview (yes, I followed through). I have taken my resume to 3 different ""career services"" and ""engineering advisors"" for critiquing, compared it to my peers' resumes (who have landed internships) and I don't know what the problem is.

Obviously I do not have any related work experience, so I listed projects that I've worked on in my classes and outside of my classes (1 game in Java and 1 algebraic expression evaluator in C++).

My major GPA is 3.92 and my cumulative is 3.08 (I am working to bring this up). I only list my major GPA on the resume which was recommended to me by several people including recruiters themselves. I have gotten an A in every single CS course up to data structures and algorithms, have aced every single programming assignment, and done fine in all of my math courses (Bs and A- mostly in Calc 1-3 and Discrete).

There are students in my class who have a GPA &lt; 3.0, no work experience, and struggle with their assignments, yet they land software engineering internships @ $25/h over the Summer. How?

I was told by my father who is an engineer in the oil industry that there is a small chance that I seem too qualified/arrogant/academic for internship opportunities and they are chucking my resume because they want students who can actually gain something. That seems like BS, but what do I know?

Any advice is greatly appreciated because I am not looking forward to being jobless upon graduation.

I'm an introvert. When I was in high school, I rarely stepped outside my comfort zone and I did not value how much getting involved with groups, clubs, and activities would affect my future. 

Sure, people say extracurriculars and things like that are important but what has pissed me off about my experience is how much they didn't emphasize its *sheer fucking importance*. The adults in my life weren't as frantic about it as say ""don't drink and drive!"", ""don't do drugs!"", ""have safe sex!"". 

And even when they did talk about it, their voice tones and pretty much the way they talked about getting involved wasn't really all that concerned. Hence, I didn't take it seriously, not as seriously as high GPA's and SAT's. 

What's happening I me now is that whenever I look at my resume I have to bullshit some parts so so that it looks like I have some experience in...whatever the hell I'm applying for. 

It pains me to bullshit my way through scholarship applications, leaving blanks for ""leadership"" positions. And although I have some volunteering experience under my belt, seriously, what I've done has nothing to do with job experience and having helped out at a book-fair once or twice doesn't count as customer service. 

I underestimated how much extracurricular and leadership positions were important not just in college admissions offices and scholarship committees but also in internship applications and on-campus jobs.

Hence, the mistake I did was this: I did the bare minimum. I got excellent grades overall but 0 extracurriculars. Why? I liked my free time. Plus it would have required that I step out of my comfort zone a little.

If you fill out a college or scholarship application and you leave a blank where it says ""leadership or extracurricular activities"", you're doing yourself a HUGE FUCKING DISFAVOR.

If you're still in high school and you're not doing anything besides school-get out of the house. NOW.

Do something at school besides class. Student gov, key club, reading club, doesn't matter get involved. 

Volunteer and shit, that shows altruism and that you care (or at least appear that you care) about your ""community"". That impresses people. 

Just do more than what's required of you and your resume, your applications for college, and pretty much everything else about you that ought to impress people will look all the more better.

I know it's easier said than done but *get out* or you're gonna regret your lack of any experience in anything. "

1) Is $15/hr, 40 hours a week enough money to sustain yourself in a place like San Diego? Will I be able to put money away to live off of while I'm at school?

I'm not happy and I'm scared of everything so all this pain I'm going through, there won't really be any pay out. I will always hurt because I am a failure at everything and because I can't progress. Pretty shitty future. And I woke up feeling practically the same way.

Okay, so I don't know how to kill myself quite yet. I just want to do some research before I do it on the off chance that it doesn't work and to make sure that my cat is taken care of after I'm gone. But instead of killing myself, I opened up the site of the college that I can attend practically for free because of my father's military benefits and started glancing through majors.

But what I don't think anyone in my life gets is that I'm not lazy when it comes to schooling. I'm just terrified, of every little thing and every detail. I have trouble motivating myself because I don't see any worth in the future when I know I'm not cut out for anything, I'm worthless at everything, I meaning nothing to everyone.

How do I choose a major when I hate everything about myself? I love to learn, sure. But then I get into the specifics and panic when I see I have to apply for other programs, do internships, figure out a living situation. It is so much at once... how do I do it all? And on my own! Because I'm twenty and, having parents who do not 'believe' in depression, I should be able to do anything and everything.

It's not true and I feel like such a failure because of it. I just keep feeling like I'm not supposed to be here because... what can I do? I can't even choose a major because I can't concentrate my thoughts enough to know what I'm interested in and I think I am fucking terrible at everything!

Ugh just... why am I here?"

So im kinda stuck right now, and im not sure what to do.

See to explain the situation a little better, I currently have an internship with a company, i am working on designing a arduino shield that will be controlling a water pump basically. Im doing everything with it, Software and hardware with the assistance of some hardware and software people, but im essentially doing it on my own.

We want to make it into a shield so when they go into production they're easy to assemble (only talking about 100 unites or so) This company is only more recently gotten into the electronics side of things and therefore does not use a lot of the ""professional"" tools available. By that i mean, what they normally use for schematics and PCB design is expressPCB. I personally know eagle quite well and i have been given the ok to use it. IF i can get boards manufactured.

Here is were i am stuck. I have never had a board manufactured from an eagle .brd, ive done some of my own but mainly those were breakout boards. What i am afraid of is that, if i say use eagle, then send the board out for prototyping, how do i know i am making the traces the right size, the holes, the vias, spacing, general alignment  etc all the right size? I assume there is even other things involved with getting your boards made too. 

What i am worried about is that i am not going to be able to actually send my boards out for printing, or when i do i will make a major mistake in something. With their PCBexpress software i dont have to worry about that because well it does it for you..i think. But i dont really know how to use that software and from what i have used of it, its a big big downgrade from eagle.

So i guess im just looking for some advice, Should i go with eagle? Or do you think i am risking it to much? Maybe some tutorials or something i could follow to learn more and become more confident? What do you guys things?

It is exponentially harder for those with little to no background in economics, accounting, personal finance to question the advice given which can be filled with holes and sometimes, even outright wrong.


Take the following article for example - [How Warren Buffett blew it with Exxon Mobil by Barry Ritholtz](http://business.financialpost.com/2013/11/20/how-warren-buffet-blew-it-with-exxon-mobil/?__lsa=ea0b-cad9)


In the article, the author's thesis is that Buffett had sold his holdings of Exxon too early (in the 80's), and he would have made a better investment decision had he held onto it (this article was spurred by the news that Buffett had recently took a position in Exxon). He notes that, 


&gt; Buffett had previously owned Exxon, back in 1984. And he blew that trade in the same way many rookie traders ruin a good investment — by taking profits too early.


By his own calculations, he figures that,


&gt; In 1985, Buffett sold Exxon at $6.75 — it was a fast 44 percent gain in less than two years. Seems pretty hard to argue with that.


and that,


&gt; ...original ~$173 million dollar purchase would be worth about $3 billion today. That’s a back of the envelope return of 1,946 percent. And while a 44 percent return is good, a 1,946 percent is better.


Hopefully you can see the flaw in the last statement. The 44% return and the 1,946% return is not an apples-to-apples comparison. The 44% return was for 2 years (beginning of 1983 to end of 1984) and the 1,946% return is for 31 years (beginning of 1983 to end of 2013).


An apples-to-apples comparison would require you to annualize the returns giving you 20%, the annualized return during the 2 years that Buffett held Exxon, and 9.4% for the hypothetical holding period of 29 years (from when he sold Exxon, beginning of 1985 to the end of 2013). In other words, that 9.4% needs to satisfy x in the following equation.


(1.20)^2 * (1+x)^29 = 19.46


But now the question remains, did Buffett sell too early?


Near the end of the article, the author notes that,


&gt; There is, of course, one last caveat to consider: Opportunity cost...He certainly did better with the reinvested dollars than most of us would have done.


After selling Exxon, was Buffett able to invest in something else that yielded an annualized return higher than 9.4%? Clearly this contradicts the author's original thesis that Buffett sold Exxon too early. Buffett was able to use the proceeds from the sale of Exxon and invested for a return higher than 9.4% per year.


A good reporter would have used the annualized number to arrive at the correct conclusion. A better reporter would have taken it a step further and identified other possible investments Buffett could have made at the time and showing us the range of possible returns (and risk-adjusted returns) had he bought those stocks instead (although I concede that may be going overboard for a simple article). Another potential question would be what the returns would look like had he held on for an additional year or two.


[Barry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Ritholtz) apparently has quite the resume:


&gt; Prior to founding Ritholtz Wealth Management, Ritholtz was CEO of Fusion IQ, prior to that chief market strategist at Maxim Group in New York, an investment bank with about $5 billion under management


I would hope that a chief market strategist at a hedge fund knew how to annualize returns and the concept of opportunity cost.


This is an example of poor financial journalism. It almost feels as if it was written by a first year financial journalism intern paid to write the article for Barry in order to get the later more coverage in the press.


If you are investing based on articles you read online, you really should question the merits of the thesis and learn to research (or at the very least fact check) for yourself. Always assume that nobody is out to help you earn money for free. Articles can be click-bait, self-serving, pump-and-dumps, [politically driven](http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/02/the-will-to-believe/), fails to adequately cover risks, poorly researched, and even completely wrong."
221taz,9,2014-04-02,"F[25], multiple ""dates"" w/ M[36]. I think. What is going on? Also...potential long distance?",[deleted],dating_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/221taz/f25_multiple_dates_w_m36_i_think_what_is_going_on/,"First off, I have around ZERO romantic experience! 

The down-low is, despite the slight age gap (not bothersome), he and I get along great. We have a lot in common, are both non-traditional undergrads here at this university, he is a good human being and I genuinely enjoy his company, I believe he enjoys mine, etc.. The general chemistry is there. We've known each other for a little over a year, but have only really started interacting as much as we do presently within the past couple of months...the last few weeks especially. I do know he recently came out of another relationship. Unsure how long he has been single, though.

We've been on a couple of outings together, alone. Drinks/food, for which he has always demanded on paying all or most of my portion (I want to mention I do aid with tipping and insisted on splitting the bill once). The first time, he told me he was paying me back for doing some photography for him, and mentioned he is aware of my financial issues -- which, as he explained, was why he was so willing to do this for me. But, what about the other times following this one? It always comes in the form of us being together somehow, and him randomly asking me what I am doing and ""would you like to get a bite somewhere?"" I say yes, because...well, I like spending time with the guy. Sounds like we've been dating, right? Are these dates? We also have spent a lot of time together in non-pub/restaurant settings, just hanging, sometimes with mutual friends. It's all been very agreeable. I reciprocate by baking him things, buying him coffee when I can, that sort of stuff.

We've hugged, twice...one time he initiated it while slightly drunk, and the second time I basically ambushed him in congrats after his recital. Both were of the warm, enveloping, full-body kind. No other physical contact between us is had except for when he's had a little to drink, and might try to touch me on my shoulder. I'm aware this is all considered flirty behaviour. During sober times, however, he seems hesitant to touch me, and I am an awkward person as well, so I become hesitant and second guess everything...and...yeah. We'll sit close to one another, at least.

Do you think he's in to me? Sounds like it, right? Time spent with one another has really escalated in the past three or four weeks, but not once has the word ""date"" or the uttering of ""boyfriend/girlfriend"" ever emerged, though my friends say it is a little obvious. Honestly, I would say yes in a heartbeat if he ever asked me to be his girlfriend, even on a casual basis, but I think he may be afraid of rejection, or of our age gap (his ex was closer to his age), or...something?

Reddit, how do I proceed? I believe it should be my turn to ask him ""out"", maybe like a hike or something. Do you think he is in to me, or simply being friendly? Should I just outright ask if we are dating? I want to let things flow naturally, but at the same time, I feel like there is *something* holding him back from *something*, unless I am not reading him correctly...and at the same time, my own inexperience is certainly not helping.

Also, though I think I may be developing feelings for him, I wonder if anything of this sort would even be a good idea at all. I will be quite gone for a summer internship in a few short months, and then abroad for half a year following that...so, does that mean we shouldn't try to be ""in a relationship"" even if he really IS in to me? Because of the whole distance thing? He is aware I'll be gone, and seemed introspective about the fact...and yet, still the ambiguous dating(?) continues. I just have no idea what the appropriate next step should be, if there is one to be had at all.

I have a three credit class (elective) to take this summer, which could be an internship if I could line one up. But there is a problem.

I have no experience working in my field, just a few part time retail jobs here and there. I have some out of school knowledge about computers, but I'm not even close to being confident in my tech skills. I need a learning opportunity. My GPA is nothing to brag about. I'll probably graduate with a GPA between 2.5 and 2.7. 

I am a quick learner, especially when I'm interested in the subject at hand, but without the opportunity to gain experience, I feel stuck. I know I'm not alone in that, but I was wondering if anyone had any advice to make my resume more appealing or even a better way to get an internship or some sort of job experience. Should I seek certificates?

If this is not the best place to post, my apologies.

* **Bridal Shower** - It's your special day, you're in your dream gown, you've given your vows, cut the cake, had the first dance, and then you left your new husband behind for a bit. You said you just needed to take care of something, but now you're in the dressing room getting hot and sweaty with -- who? The best man? Your ex? The groom's father? Your own father? Any/all of the above plus more? You decide.

* **I've got what you need** - Maybe I can decide who gets that promotion, that new position with the corner office, that internship, tickets to the show, maybe I can help your son/daughter make the team, or make sure your husband gets hired, maybe I've got a quick way for you to make a month's worth of rent plus extra... Whatever it is, you may not like it, but you're just desperate enough to try.

* **No sex in the Champagne Room!** - You've got a reputation, deserved or otherwise, for going the extra mile for clients who can afford your time. You're a goddess and you know it, with no end of potential clients who want to take you upstairs. You pick me out of the crowd, maybe 'cuz I'm just like every cocky ass-hole you dated in high school, maybe because I actually act like a gentleman. Either way, we go upstairs and decide to see how deep my pocketbook is.

I'm open to plenty of other ideas or suggestions, so if you've got a craving let me know. Worst case scenario I'll say no, but I'll probably at least try and work something out with you.

And as always I'm also up for just chatting in general. Of course, if I had my way I would want to hear about every time you decided to stop being faithful and get yourself a real man for the night, or maybe that time you decided your asshole boyfriend/husband deserved a little payback. Or maybe those times when they just weren't around and you needed a good fuck. Wild spring break stories are also awesome. Let me hear it all, even if you would rather chat about something else."
2222b0,50,2014-04-02,"Failed my internship, trying to pick up the pieces and keep going. Looking for advice.",Zerbo,ems,https://www.reddit.com/r/ems/comments/2222b0/failed_my_internship_trying_to_pick_up_the_pieces/,"Wall of text incoming, title says it all. Started medic school in January '13, finished didactic with a 96%, breezed through graded simulations and the oral board final. Had a blast in clinicals, got very good reviews from the nurses and MDs. Then I got assigned to a preceptor who has a reputation for having never passed an intern. It was okay in the beginning... I have never worked in the 911 system, my only experience being two years at an IFT company and around 250 hours of ALS ride-alongs. So I knew I was going into my internship with an experience deficit, and tried my best to overcome. Preceptor was of the mindset that the field internship isn't a time to learn, it's a time to show that I know exactly what I'm doing in every situation. Needless to say, I did not. I went on many calls I had never encountered before, so I felt consistently behind the curve. On a personal level, my preceptor and I were about as polar opposites as could be. He was very much the alpha type personality, wants everyone to know that he's in charge and his way of doing things is the only way he finds acceptable. I, on the other hand, have been an introvert most my life but will step up when I need to. My scene presence wasn't to his liking, and I never received feedback other than ""quit fucking up.""

 At station he would have me eat standing up in the app bay because I ""hadn't earned the right to sit down"" yet. He would refer to me as ""intern fuckhead"" in front of the fire crew, ER staff, and even patients. While I didn't take these types of things personally, it wore on me to the point where I dreaded each shift and hated being there. My preceptor was also disposed to saying things like, ""Are you sure you're not Jewish? Because you run calls like a fucking Jew."" I'm not Jewish so I wasn't necessarily offended, but I had no idea how to even take that. He would call out for entire shift cycles at a time, but not telling me until I had already shown up to each shift and called him to see if he was coming in. On the whole our interaction was just bizarrely and exclusively negative. I assumed these things were a normal part of the internship and tried my best to suck it up, and it wasn't until I talked with some of my classmates about their internships that I realized my experience was far from normal. Everything got under my skin and I began frequently making mistakes. No med errors or anything critical, just not calling for equipment quickly enough or verbalizing every step of my thought process. My preceptor began telling me on shift 10 of 22 that he was deciding to fail me or keep me going on a call-to-call basis. With that hanging over my head, I made even more mistakes. Finally on shift 20, he failed me. I was the eighth intern that he had failed... out of eight.

I accept responsibility for my failure, since it was my fault that I let my preceptor get under my skin and it affected my ability to adequately care for my patients. But he failed me the day before my class graduation. I attended to support my classmates and sat in the back, and it was the hardest experience of my life. I was the only one in my class to fail internship.

My school's policy is that I cannot repeat my internship (with a different preceptor, it goes without saying) until the next class has begun their field internships. In nine months. I'll also have to repeat graded simulations and oral board examinations. Until then I'm going to go back to my old, crooked IFT company (who was recently raided by the FBI for Medicare fraud) because I know they'll work around my schedule of ride-alongs and bring me back at my old pay. In the meantime, I've been in a heavy depression. I don't leave the house unless I need to go get food or something else vital. I lost my girlfriend of four years and nearly all of my friends during the didactic portion of class since I had no time for anything else, and I'm almost entirely alone. I'm trying hard to keep it all in perspective, but it's been rough.

I still want to be a paramedic more than anything else, but trying to summon up the drive to go through this long haul again is proving difficult. 15 months and my life savings culminated in being failed after 20 shifts.

So with the backstory aside, any advice from those who have failed or repeated internships? How did you manage it? Did it get easier the second time around? Is there a stigma against those who have to repeat their internships to pass? Any advice or encouragement would really be appreciated."

I swear to fucking whatever deity may exist, that I will never forgive you lot for marking me with the fucking stench curse of FPS experiences. Oh, I want to have a nice life without being bothered between drinks? TOO FUCKING MUCH, OF COURSE!

*breaths deeply*

Ok, so it's 10.20am on the East coast of Australia as I begin to write this. Thanks to time differences and a lack of sleep, I've managed to somehow keep myself drunk, yet awake and lucid enough to type this beauty out for you story munchers. 

Now, my husband and I, in our newly minted marriage, unfortunately don't get to spend a lot of time with one another anymore. Either I'm travelling from site to site to fix fuck ups usually caused by someone tripping voer cords and ripping them out, and my one true drinking partner is travelling all over the world as an engineer, usually for fortnightly stints. So when we have the opportunity to be with one another, we make a nice day/night/2am out of it, with some nice food, drink, and romping. 

Now, my husband was/is (I don't fucking know anymroe) in Melbourne. To my delight, yesterday (I actually don't know now. Days are over rated) I had to fly down there due to a ""catastrophic"" IT server failure (whoever managed to call me down there is now getting a stern talking to). So yay! 2 nights in Melbourne with my husband, and a good scotch. Scotchy scotch stochh...

I fly down, fix the ""complete and utter"" failure of a few unplugged ethernet cords, and skip happily over to my husbands temporary apartment for and early dinner. We meet, do the do, and wash off our shame as we prepare to go to some swanky place with expensive fish n' shit to eat on our company's dollar (gotta love that daily food allowance).

And how lovely we felt and looked! We had not been able to eat dinner with each other for a full month, only being able to scrape a half day together every now and then. We were prepared for a nice, peaceful dinner and drinks.

But no.

Fuck this. Fuck everything. Fuck.

I can not believe how angry I'm getting over what is probably a mild FPS. Sorry folks. I mean, I'm tired, hungry, and sans husband. Warpath is my name, and currently my interns will be in my way today. Sorry to any of you if you're reading.

We elegantly float down to the restaurant in the city, and are taken to our seats by a beautiful spanish woman whose hair I wish I could scalp off and wear.

Seated and with wine on the way out, we examine our menus, making a bit of small talk, enjoying each others company, when lo and fucking behold, my husbands client hobbles into the restaurant entrance.

I only noticed this, because my husband managed to get a glance at him at the front, and immediately hid behind his menu. 

Now, this man... he was fat. Oh yes. Not your normal ""An extra few pounds from workin in an office"" fat... this was ""My keyboard wont work because my fupa is on it"" fat.

From our table, we hear the fairly one sided conversation go as so...

&gt; Well, I want a damn table then! I see plenty are free!

&gt; Of course I don't have to make a reservation, do you know who I am?!

&gt; I need some food, I want to give your restaurant money! Why won't you let me in?

I catch a glance of him poking his head into the main eating area, trying to find someone he knew. And lo and fucking behold...

&gt; See! I'm with those two! Hey [husbands name]! I knew you had a table waiting for me!

Oh christ oh fuck oh arrrrghhhHHHH.

The spanish lady, clearly just wanting to pass him off to someone else and get more people seated, brings him over, gives me an apologetic look, and speedily rushes away, leaving our waiter to deal with this fucking monstrosity of a man.

&gt; [Husband], so glad to see you here! I really needed something to eat, and these stingy fuckers don't seem to understand that my money is as good as the people who decided to make a reservation.

&gt; Yes... sure... well, this dinner was only really between myself and my wife...

&gt; Don't be silly! I'll just get an extra chair and we can all enjoy some food!

Now, I try to be civil. I mean, sure, this was meant to only be for us, and I had one more night in Melbourne. If this dude is a client for my husband, I'm willing to put up with him to ensure contracts are kept, and peace is held. Doesn't mean that I don't get to be stern as fuck though.

&gt; Haw haw, well, may as well get to ordering then! Lets see...

He proceeds to call over our server, and ask detailed questions about all the the food, from where the steak was from (ITS WRITTEN ON THE FUCKING MENU), to the freshness of ingredients, and various other inappropriate questions for such an establishment. This was the kind of place we indulged in because we KNEW it was fresh and good.

&gt; Well, I do like [most expensive menu item]...

He looks over at us expectingly. My husband just looks straight at the waiter and says:

&gt; We'll be splitting cheques, if thats ok.

And with a nod and a quick scribble of his pen, the server/waiter/whatever took down this fat fucks oder, which kind of just happened to be one of the cheapest items on the menu.

My husband and I then proceed to make our order, a couple of the more medium priced items on the menu, as the abomination accross from us gave us a slightly evil eye.

&gt; You know, if we had pooled our money, we could have all gotten something nice...

I just looked at him. Unblinking. My paitience for this dude was waring from ""put up with him because he is a clietn"" to ""I'm two sentences away from curb stomping you"".

So we try and make small talk together, and while it was akward, it sort of worked. Sort of. I didn't talk much, and apparently this confused the ham.

&gt; Why are you so quiet? Are you frigid or something? Haha, I bet your work doesn't like you chatting too much in the oiffce!

wat

wat

wat

&gt; Excuse me?!

&gt; No need to get all offended! I just thought all women enjoyed some gossip.

&gt; Well no, I don't. Silence is golden.

And with that, I downed every last bit of that $40 a glass wine I had sitting on my table, and proceeded to ask for another one. And another. Anything to stop me from having to talk.

And that's where it began to really go down hill.

&gt; Haw haw, how do you deal with this untamed one [husband]? I bet she must be a menace at home!

&gt; Look, can you please stop making such remarks so loudly? 

&gt; Come on, we're paying enough for this place, we can do waht we want!

&gt; It doesn't really work like that, *mate*

As the last vowel passed over my husbands lips, the waiter/server/fuckyou brang over our meals, smelling incredibly tasty. As it's getting into the ""colder"" months (holy shit, it's getting down to 10C! Fuckin freexing!), the Autum/winter menus had been released, and we silently ate our roast meat, soups, and myself, a rissoto, because fuck the system. I eat summer food in the winter, like a rebel.

At least he was a quiet eater.

Figuring that the food may have clamed down the beetus monster, I pipe up, asking my husband how his soup was.

&gt; Oh yes, quite lovely. I haven't had pumpkin in ages, and this is probably the best soup I've ever had

&gt; HA. Why don't you eat something with some more protein? You need to make sure you don't get used to your wife's rabbit food cooking and deciding to order it as swanky resturants

I just looked at him

Unblinking

Unthil he shut the fuck up. 

As we finish, the server/waiter/slave came and brought us our desert menues. Deciding to switch to a desert wine as well, I order the incredibly rich and delicious chocolate death cake, and my husband orders two fruit/custard tart thingies that looked fucking amazing. And they were.

&gt; Ugh, why would you order a desert with FRUIT? I mean, it's desert... be like your wife, and order something *naughty*

His words came out like a fucking creeper, and then he slyly winked in my direction... as sly as a man who needed to wiggle his entire face to blink could.

Ignoring him, my husband and I go full bogan, and begin to look at our phones at the table. We usually have a rule against this together, but fucking hell, we needed to break the rule to make sure we didn't talk to this guy anymore. Ending up texting each other, and deciding to bale out ASAP to the nearest bottle-o.

&gt; You guys are so rude...

More ignoring.

So, as desert came out, ham/monster/wittyname decided to actually ask us some reasonable questions.

&gt; So [me], what are you doing down here in Melbourne?

&gt; Fixing up IT fuck ups by people who didn't pass the ""Round block, square hole"" test

&gt; So when are you leaving?

And here is where drunk me decided to fail sober me, in telling him that I was staying one more day for R&amp;R at a local spa, before flying back to Brisbane the morning after.

&gt; Why do that? Here, I've got a ticket back to brisbane for tomorrow morning. I would love to swap.

&gt; No, I would rather stay in Melbourne for now

&gt; I insist

&gt; I refuse

&gt; Please! I really need to stay for one more night!

&gt; NO!

I was loud enough to turn a few heads. But it's not like they hadn't noticed this fucker beforehand.

I calm myself, looking at my husband, ready to pay and leave before our deserts came. But we stayed. For the cake.

&gt; I know where you work... look I'll call your boss now, and tell him you're coming back tomrrow morning! It will be fine!

&gt; No! Do not call my work. This is an invasion of my privacy.

(Husband at this point is apologizing profusely for telling people about my job. Usually, it doesn't result in this sort of cluster fuck)

He had already rung, and as it was 5pm in Melbourne, it was 4pm in QLD, so my boss was there. As we were in a swanky restaurant, and I was fairly inebriated, I had no capacity to stop this guy.


He manged to call my boss, get him to be happy I was coming back the next day (today, this morning), and due to this, I had to pass over details so we could swap tickets. Oh ever so luckily, we are both QANTAS members, so it made the process *that* much easier! Yay!

Third year CS student here. I have been practicing my iOS development skills for over 2 years, and would say I am at the intermediate level (skills include Core Data, GCD, Core Graphics, APNS). I really like iOS development, and I have a few apps on the App Store. I've read several books, and been just learning and learning all aspects of the platform. I have never used any of the Microsoft related technologies listed below, though I have extensive experience in Java and MySQL. 

I have been offered two internships for the summer--one 30 minutes away (by commute), doing C#, .NET, Oracle DB etc at $30/hr. The other is 1,000 miles away, doing iOS development at $18/hr. I would need to pay for my housing as well.

My predicament is that I would really like to know if iOS development is something I would want to do as a day job, or just as a hobby. I figured that a summer internship would be a perfect taste of what it would be like, though now I just got the second offer that is 30 minutes away at nearly double the pay. 

Which would you choose, and why? Money? Or a shot at something you're passionate about as a hobby (iOS development)?

Thank you"

I don't really know anything about web dev as my CS program doesn't cover web technologies at all (there might be some server/network stuff higher up), but I was glad to have the opportunity. 

Basically, I'm trying to learn how web applications work to implement social authentication using python. I don't have much time outside the internship as I am taking 5 classes and I do another unpaid internship a couple days a week. There isn't anyone around to teach me how to use the framework being used (Flask). The only person who could works from another country and doesn't speak my language too well. I feel like I am spinning my wheels a lot, not learning much, and not delivering anything. 

While I need the money, should I quit and spend my time learning the basics on my own?

222ry3,3,2014-04-03,CU-Boulder vs. RIT for undergrad CS/SE,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/222ry3/cuboulder_vs_rit_for_undergrad_csse/,"I'm an outgoing highschool senior. My first experience programming was using an illegal copy of Visual Basic to write a linear equation solver in middle school so I didn't need to do any homework for 2 years. Later, I joined my local FIRST Robotics Competition team in HS (the most complicated it got was doing some multithreaded C++ stuff on hour long, high pressure deadlines) and then went on to work in an internship for one of our sponsors the summer before my senior year to work on custom software solutions (that mostly included working with large portions of the .NET Framework and integrating them -- MVC4 to Entity Framework/MSSQL and beyond).
   
Now, I want to work on self-organizing cellular automata (among other things, although that's the most tangible part), applying this to cheap replaceable robots that can go out and mine asteroids. This, besides the obvious EE and CS requirements, also needs a unique blend of building the connections needed to accomplish this for a business later in life, meaning that I want to be steeped in enterprise before I turn 25.   

Honestly, I don't know which of the two to go to. Money currently isn't an issue, as both universities have given me large sums of needs and merit based grants. I'm in Colorado, so staying instate would be nice since I could keep my HS girlfriend and generally keep my surroundings stable. However, going out of state presents a unique opportunity to start from scratch and get away from the inertia that I've currently worked myself into, plus some crazier aspects of my family and not going to Uni with a majority of the people I went to HS with. Additionally though, I have gotten into CU-Boulder's Arts and Sciences Honors Program (Pre-Engineering), which would allow me to pursue a CompSci major and immediately begin working on research, if I understood the letter correctly. Currently, Boulder is a hotspot for startups as well. Yet, RIT has a co-op work study requirement that also aligns with my goals.   

Based on what I have here, does anybody have suggestions for where I would want to go? Which has a stronger CS or SE program? I'm at a loss here."
222t3x,0,2014-04-03,I don't know what to do with my excessive downtime at my new job. I don't even know if I want my new job.,Samiizdat,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/222t3x/i_dont_know_what_to_do_with_my_excessive_downtime/,"Hey r/jobs,

I am a 23 year old college graduate with experience working at non-profits, broadcasting, and the film industry. I gained much of this experience while I was in school through both internships and paid positions. I also maintained a high enough GPA at a well-respected university to graduate in three years and Cum Laude. I (naively) believed that if I worked my ass off while I was in school, I would not find myself un- or underemployed upon graduation. I wanted this because I read The Atlantic a lot and understand how pervasive this issue is to Millennials, in addition to our woes within this ""Hook-Up Culture"" journalists are so keen on these days.

I majored in Film Studies and English so, needless to say, I was not gainfully employed immediately upon graduating. I waited tables to pay my rent during school and continued to work in the service industry well after I finished school. I worked my way up the ladder within the local restaurant-world fairly quickly and became a bartender about 8 months ago. Not the beer/wine/mixed-drinks only sort of bartender, but the sort where one of my co-workers donned an anachronistic mustache and suspenders. I enjoyed this job. It was creative to a degree, I enjoyed reading and learning about booze and cocktails and I generally like being active at work, rather than sitting on a fucking computer looking at tiered wedding cupcake-cakes on Pinterest.

Which brings me, finally, to my point. Being a bartender, however much ""mixology"" you practice on the job, is not a widely respected career. I was depressed and began to abhor the people I had to wait on. I felt petty. I would hold grudges and find myself thinking about problem customers days after the fact. I had dreams of opening my own bar, but the capital necessary to start it would take me about a decade to acquired. I felt like I wasn't reaching my potential and that I was ""wasting"" my intellect. Which is really pretentious and I'm so sorry.

I accepted a position in the film industry as a production accounting clerk two weeks ago and left the service industry. And I declare every day on this job to be the most boring day of my entire life, as it is somehow, successively more and more boring. I only have about 4 hours of work a day. The rest of the time I spend asking my supervisors if they have anything for me to do and they say, ""no, enjoy it!"" Oh, thanks. I'm gonna have the time of my goddamn life rolling around in this windowless office on my big pink stability ball, listening to every episode of This American Life ever produced in this dimension. My boyfriend tells me I should write my much talked about and imminent novel, which critics are already calling ""barely started whatsoever"" but I can't write in this environment. I feel weird about reading a book or watching a film because I assume that I should maintain the illusion of doing something work-related despite the fact that I don't have fuck-all to do. I don't get a lunch break because lunch is catered to the office every day, so isn't that the worst. However! This job is only for a finite period of time. It will hopefully serve as a ladder to something more interesting within the industry (i.e., the Art Department? I guess?) and pays fairly well. These are its saving graces. Everything else is shit.

I am not really looking for someone to tell me to follow my heart and return to bartending. I don't necessarily want to do that for the rest of my life. Are there any bartenders or folks of a similar profession with a creative bent who successfully made their way in the 9-5 world? How do people with restless minds cope with downtime at work? Am I supposed to pretend I am doing something or just watch Trailer Park Boys with my office door open? Should I get a tattoo that says ""I have no idea what I am doing with my life"" or is it already that obvious?

TL;DR: Former bartender entering dulldulldull office world; dunno what I should do with my ridiculous amounts of spare time there; also, should probably invest in a seasonal affective disorder lamp"

222v5p,0,2014-04-03,Is GaTech right for me?,[deleted],gatech,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatech/comments/222v5p/is_gatech_right_for_me/,"Hey guys!

I know there's already an accepted student advice thread, but I wanted something a little more personal for me. 

I'm going to be a CS major and am currently trying to decide between UT and Georgia Tech. I visited Georgia Tech a few weeks ago and absolutely loved the campus but have read a lot of forums about how shitty campus life was and how everybody seems to be ready to jump out into I-85 (as well as other forum posts just saying those people are lazy pricks who don't plan their time out and etc). I'm not really sure where I fit in all of this, so I thought I'd give a little bio of me to all you Georgia Tech Redditors and have you guys tell me what kind of adjustments I'd need to make and such.

Academics:
I've never been a good planner. I tend to go with the flow and react to things as they happen. From what I've read, that mindset will kill you in Georgia Tech. I also don't put in the most effort for school, but I'm not just putting that downtime into video games!(though a lot of it admittedly is lol) I am the captain of my school's programming team and we just won our district competition and qualified for regionals, something that our last team could not do. I am also an intern at Cisco and am required to put in at least 10 hours a week for my internship. In addition, I have a girlfriend who wants me to spend time with her (crazy, I know). Though putting all excuses aside, the main reason I don't put as much effort in to my school work as I could is because I just plain don't care. The only subjects I really care about are my math and science classes, and that's something that's very attractive to me at tech. The emphasis on engineering classes and less of those icky humanities classes. It's not that I have anything against humanities, I just don't enjoy most of them as classes.

Social:
I'll be honest, I'm kind of a timid person. I'm getting better about it, but I still get really nervous around people I don't know/aren't familiar with. It's not that I can't talk to other people, I feel I can make decent conversation. I'm just kind of passive. My hobbies are kind of typical nerd stuff (anime, movies, vidya games, esports) but with my best friends I'm willing to do anything with them (tubing, shuffle phone, parkour, jamming out to gangnam style...in a mall...and then getting kicked out..........hwat).

Personal:
I'm a very indepent-minded person. I always prefer to try to seek out answers on my own before going to others for help (though I do get help when I need it) and I believe it is an individuals are responsible for how they feel. I'm also not too big on the whole authority thing. Not really the authority thing, but just someone abusing his/her authority so that he/she will look tough. I guess you could say I'm kind of stubborn too. Basically, I like to do things my way, but I don't blame other people when it doesn't work out the way I want it to.

Wow that was longer than I expected. But if you've read this far, might as well comment right? right? Anyways though, thanks for reading and I look forward to your responses :)

EDIT: How's the math program at GA Tech? I'm considering doing a minor/double major in math."

All you average Joes. If you are disproportionately alpha compared to your average 18-22 year old **or** look like [this](http://fitfatboys.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/six-pack-abs1.jpg), skip over this.   
___  
  
Let's jump right into it!  
___  
So you made it through the terrors of high school. [Congrats](http://spikeeskin.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/great-job.jpg). Now you're ready to be [the pussy slayer](http://images.askmen.com/entertainment/special_feature_3800/3814_stubble-5-things-men-should-know-1045618-flash-1045618-flash.jpg) on campus, right? Well, I hate to burst your bubble, but that isn't going to happen.  
  
As the fresh meat on campus, and as a guy, you are literally the lowest form of life on campus. As an average Joe, you're probably undecided major, taking gen eds, and probably can't even [grow a full beard](https://static.squarespace.com/static/51b3dc8ee4b051b96ceb10de/51ce6099e4b0d911b4489b79/51ce61f5e4b0d911b44a7916/1320252194767/1000w/paimai.jpeg) yet. There are many reasons you are constantly looked down upon. You are probably scrawnier than upper classmen, you stick out like a white tourist in Mexico, and there's a [30% chance you won't even make it through your first year](http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/rankings/regional-colleges-west/freshmen-least-most-likely-return): you are unproven. Now you know what kind of hole you're in, so here's the shit you'll have to do to get out of it.  
  
1) Stay in school. By lasting even until sophomore year, you've proven yourself to be a better person than 30% of other fresh meat hopefuls.  
  
2) Lift weights. The TRP mantra. I don't know about you, average Joe, but when I got into college I was a scrawny [foot fairy fuck](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KjIvI-JRAZY/TgjKqfZs0zI/AAAAAAAAABM/2BelsC6oFxw/s1600/petercrouchskinny.jpeg).  
  
3) [fix your posture](http://www.computer-posture.co.uk/images/PC-posture.jpg). If you're an average Joe, you're around 5 foot 9 inches. That means you'll be competing in the dating marketplace with people taller than you, older than you, bigger than you, and taller than you. One of the telltale signs of an insecure beta who is out of his depth is the hunched shoulders, always leaning forward, looking like they want to crawl into a corner and disappear. As a short, average looking person, use every inch you have to your full advantage.  
___  
That's a good starting worklist for your average Joe freshman. Now here's where things will get interesting for you, average Joe. Let's assume you've made it this far, survived your first two years of college, started working out. Not quite where you want to be yet, but you're [getting there](http://imgur.com/RUH4wrM).  
  
Here's what you'll need to do next.  
  
Start looking at interning. Make a resume. Do community service, run some marathons, save some cats. just **do something** to make yourself stick out from the rest of the average Joes.  
  
Landing an internship will [basically coat your resume in gold](http://business.time.com/2013/11/10/the-real-reason-new-college-grads-cant-get-hired/).  
  
&gt;One thing that does appear to make a difference is internships, according to a Harris Interactive survey of more than 2,000 college students and 1,000 hiring managers on behalf of textbook company Chegg: more than 80% of employers want new grads they hire to have completed a formal internship, but only 8% of students say interning in a field related to their major is something they spend a lot of time doing.  
  
Get a fucking internship. It will put you above 90% of people in your field.  
  
Keep your grades up. If you've made it through your first two years, you've already found your discipline and self motivation, so this advice should be a given.  
  
Develop other skills outside your major. Become experienced with [Microsoft Office](https://www.microsoft.com/learning/en-us/mos-expert-certification.aspx).  
___  
You've finished/are finishing your internship now, you're now a senior. Grades are still okay, could be better, could be worse. Start sending out your gilded resume to everywhere and everyone. I would do this going into the final semester of your senior year. You will want to line up a job that will be a warm and ready seat reserved for you the moment you graduate. Don't dick around completely your final semester. I know a few too many people who just floundered around for 2, 3, 4 months after they graduated, ""Weee, I made it!"" Now what? Now you hop into the workforce.  
  
Congratulations, average Joe. If you made it this far, following the bread crumbs to success, give yourself a pat on the back. Now go take your new car and your new wardrobe, funded by that great new job you got, and go drive on down to your bar and grab a drink. You deserve it.  
  
___  
  
##B-but you said there'd be women? Where are the womens?!?  
___  
All in good time, young grasshopper. Women come last, your success is more important than getting your dick wet.  
___  
[This is how the SMP plays out for college guys and girls.](http://imgur.com/6NuHgfp) This is a bit exaggerated, but you get the point. Senior guys are able to pull from a 22-18 age pool, senior girls do not have that luxury. Girls in general are going to start off much above your average Joe as a freshman. The reasons for this are that average freshman girl at 18 is going to have a very low partner count (maybe even still a virgin.) This is attractive to guys of all ages. Low partner count, less chance of cheating, less chance of STDs, fresh meat. [Girls on average grow 2-3 years sooner than guys do.](http://www.tusculum.edu/faculty/home/tharlow/Gateway%20Development/images/0608.jpg) This is why it is 'normal' in society for guys to date down, not up.  
Unrelated to growth, but college girls love getting free drinks. If you're capable of acquiring alcohol, your 5 on the SMV just went up to a 7.  
  
But how does this all tie together? While you were busy setting up your future, your average Jane was busy getting shitfaced 4 nights a week while 'working' towards her Theater major, with a minor in Women's studies. Congratulations to her on her good grades, but then reality is going to hit her harder than the wall will hit in 5-10 years. This chick is going to look to get a job, and there will be nothing. Absolutely nothing. The hamster is in free fall. At this point, her ego is going to automatically deflate a few points. She's going to be looking to latch on to somebody. You can be a beta and keep this parasite forever, or spin it around your dick for a few weeks before you get bored, and then get rid of it, and let her free fall continue. The girls are going to marry up. That's life. Their sex becomes less of a trade in to your commitment. It becomes your market.  
  
___  
In closing... Build your status to be successful. Your status and success will attract the women. Spin the women around, stick it in, kick them out.  
As a college student, get an internship.  
Lift weights.  
At 18, your SMV will only go up. For girls at 18, it will only go down."

**Intro::** 

So I'm a student in the UK who until recently was a casual console gamer. About 4 months ago I sold my 360 as I hadn't played it in a couple months (left it at my parents house whilst I was at University) and still had an old refurbished macbook pro I'd inherited from my older brother for my casual gaming (v. causal=i had to play civ5 in strategic view). Unfortunately a month later my old shitty macbook kicked the bucket, leaving me with just my little Chromebook (bought because my old macbook had the noisest fans and the worst battery; no way i could really take it into University library. etc. etc).


Sooo...

**Usage::**

I'm looking to make the gaming change from console to computer, and am kind of looking to go as overboard on the graphics/gaming capabilities as I can (kind of a reward for all the pc games i never got to play). I've also done a little coding and programming, and have attempted a few mods, consequently I'm going to be playing around with a lot of skyrim mods, and no doubt be watching films on a monitor whilst also messing around with other programs. I enjoy fliming and have done a few events for the university, and work for a production company (summer intern) so it looks like I'm going to be a doing a fair bit of video editing for a while, so will need a fair bit of processing power and hard drive space.

**Model I'm looking at:**

2246n8,2,2014-04-03,how to search for a job/ an internship without vitamin b?,pinkerelefant,blogs,https://www.reddit.com/r/blogs/comments/2246n8/how_to_search_for_a_job_an_internship_without/,"Hey guys,

I guess, it's not just me, but I find it so difficult to get a nice internship!
I am a German citizen with Vietnamese roots, and through my whole time at school I used to be glad, that corruption isn't a big deal in such a developed country as Germany. How little did I know !
I study electrical engineering, and I have sent some applications, but yet never got closer to an internship or a job in my field of study. My fellow students also discusse the job market a lot, and it seems like vitamin b is more important than I suggested. I don't know, how to make these connections, my parents aren't able to simply introduce me someone; and I am a little to shy to build connections not based on affection but something else.
I don't know, maybe, it's just me growing up, or me with my lack of luck, or me with my little tiny hopelessness. 
I am really passionate about my studies, from the very beginning, though I did struggle sometimes.
But what is it with this vitamin b ?
Do you guys ever experienced that feeling, as if all doors close because you are to timid? I really wish I'd be tougher....

224lb6,23,2014-04-03,26. SDE II. Thinking of taking some time off. Thoughts?,SnowProblem,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/224lb6/26_sde_ii_thinking_of_taking_some_time_off/,"Hi All,

I need some advice. I'm 26, graduated 3 years ago in CS, and currently an SDE II at one of the big 4. My work is interesting. Friends are good. School loans paid off. Healthy savings. On paper life is good.

But I've had a goal for a while to do some long-term travel (6mo+) and I have this gnawing feeling that life is robotically passing by. I regret not doing a study abroad during college and during the summers I always had internships. When I look forward, I see potentially a mortgage and family which will make it more difficult. I'm also extremely interested in Oculus Rift, bitcoin, mobile, and a Javascript library I work on --- all of which could potentially be future careers --- but I barely have enough time for these side projects as it is and it takes a toll on friendships and past/potential relationships.

Has anyone taken some extended time off before? Was it easy to return to work again in the same position? Were there any unexpected upsides or downsides? I appreciate all advice, but especially from managers, recruiters, and people who have considered doing this before. Thanks!"
224orr,2,2014-04-03,"Not sure who I am, not who I want to be or how to get there",[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/224orr/not_sure_who_i_am_not_who_i_want_to_be_or_how_to/,"I live in Ontario and went back to school to get a diploma in the legal field two years ago. Almost immediately after finishing, I did my co-op internship, found another internship to start immediately afterwards to hold me over until I found a paying job which I did. I managed to get a temporary contract position within a month of graduation and spent the majority of the next few months there. But it was hell. The work was good, the learning experiences from the research I had to delve into and the content of the project were fascinating. It taught me a lot about people and how cold, cruel, and uncaring they could be. 

Myself and the other new hires spent 9 hour days sifting through information that would stick with us forever. Stories of rapes, murders, deaths and worse situations, all of which occurred without penalty. We all felt morally disturbed by it, and though I was warned when I started, I didn't realize how difficult it would be. But it was still a good learning experience that left me with a new understanding of what some people have to go through in their lives and despite what I'm about to say, I've had a much better life than that and I'm thankful. However, the working environment was like working in a sweatshop and my stress levels sky rocketed as did everyone else's. Even with a healthy diet I (and everyone else) managed to gain at least 10 pounds each. I got up at 6am, made the two hour commute to work, sometimes worked at my internship and didn't get home until 10 at night. I became unable to stay awake for even a few hours in the day. I'd routinely have to hold my eyes open at work just to keep myself up. I started losing my memory enough to the point where I had trouble just having basic conversations. It became a struggle to get my point across during a conversation - I'd forget the word 'book' or 'pen' or anything else. My brain just stopped functioning. I'd thought about quitting often but didn't for the money and the experience. When the job was finally over, I pretty much crashed and haven't been the same since. 

My memory has come back, I still have trouble with my speech sometimes but it isn't nearly as bad. Since last summer I've been searching for a new job and I've found nothing. I've been offered the chance to start a partnership business with a colleague and the only reason I might even consider it (if they'll actually be willing to think I'm serious this time) is because I can't seem to find anything else. 
Within a few months of being unemployed, due to my general dissatisfaction with life, I've often contemplated just ending it all. I can't remember the last time I was happy. I'm 29 now...I think the last genuinely happy moment may have been in high school. 

Part of it is my appearance...maybe that's shallow. I'm athletic and always have been, but I'm lucky enough to be one of those girls that can't ever lose a pound. So since I have no job to go to, barely get any interviews, I've been sinking my time into working out. In the course of four months of cycling, jogging, and boxing, I've lost a whopping grand total of five pounds though I'm aware I likely put on more muscle.
Another part of it is I'm realizing I just don't know who I am anymore. I thought my life would be different by now. I have high aspirations and I want to achieve them but I have no way of getting there. At this point the only reason I haven't actually killed myself is simply because I'm used to living. I do it out of habit, not because I want to. If I didn't have parents that would suffer from it, it would be much easier. But right now I pretty much feel like I'm stuck living and I don't want to be. 

I do have a few close friends but none that I can really talk to like this. I tend to be that typical INTJ that bottles it all up and seems all happy on the outside but really I'm just a mess. When I do try and talk to friends somehow it just feels like whatever I say isn't that big of a deal. 

So at the end of the day, I can't get a job in my field, I feel like a failure, I've been trying like hell to at least work on getting into shape so I can say I've accomplished something...but frankly, there's just nothing. I've never posted here before so I apologize if I just wrote this all wrong."

:--|:--
[Did you live?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/224f5n/i_was_almost_murdered_by_someone_with_a_machete/cgj8jr6?context=5)|I don't know, I could still be in a coma.
[That is very interesting.  Do you think that he meant to kill you with the hit or just cut you?  The area of the cut leads me to believe he wanted to kill you but if so why would he only strike once?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/224f5n/i_was_almost_murdered_by_someone_with_a_machete/cgj8b7s?context=5)|You know, I have no idea. I was told that he couldn't be charged with ""attempted murder"" because he didn't say anything along the lines of ""I want to kill you"".  But I figure, if you come at someone with that large of a weapon, you have nothing in mind other than taking that persons life. But like I said, I have no clue. 
[Did you have to cover all of the medical bills yourself? Also how was the recovery process after you woke up? Any nerve or muscle damage?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/224f5n/i_was_almost_murdered_by_someone_with_a_machete/cgj8gte?context=5)|The state paid for about 15k on a 200k medical bill. I think I will be in debt my whole life. I tried to see about suing him, but he had nothing, like I said, it was all in a bad neighborhood. 
[Have you thought about changing countries? Maybe Canada? Fuck that debt.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/224f5n/i_was_almost_murdered_by_someone_with_a_machete/cgje60b?context=5)|I want to move to Norway.
[Have you thought about one of the online fund campaigns such as gofundme.com? I am sure that the reddit community would offer some support even if it is only a portion of the bills for a short time. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/224f5n/i_was_almost_murdered_by_someone_with_a_machete/cgj8xil?context=5)|I wouldn't mind something like that, but I don't think I could ask for money for something that is not someone else's fault. It's not their problem. 
[Sorry, I don't mean to derail your thread or get all political but if someone TRIES TO MURDER YOU in the US, there's no way you can cover the damages if that person happens to be poor? That seems mental.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/224f5n/i_was_almost_murdered_by_someone_with_a_machete/cgjigua?context=5)|In my case, it is sad but true.
[Picture of the dog... Please? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/224f5n/i_was_almost_murdered_by_someone_with_a_machete/cgj8e7l?context=5)|[Jo Jo](http://i.imgur.com/03qbn2s.jpg)
[Do you still think Jo Jo makes a good guard dog, or has he lost that privilege?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/224f5n/i_was_almost_murdered_by_someone_with_a_machete/cgja8vu?context=5)|He died about 5 months ago. I have a new pup. [Yoshi](http://i.imgur.com/oCITj7t.png)
[Did Jo Jo ever have a bizarre adventure?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/224f5n/i_was_almost_murdered_by_someone_with_a_machete/cgjhgh5?context=5)|Once we left out of town, and him, my other dog, and our cat tried tracking us down across the country. There was a mountain lion, a mean animal clinic, and a lot of montages.  
[I enjoy your choice of dog names. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/224f5n/i_was_almost_murdered_by_someone_with_a_machete/cgjyml4?context=5)|Thank you. Jo Jo was originally Cujo from the book and movie. And Yoshi (AKA Yo Yo) was chose because I wanted a Chinese name for a Chinese dog. I love Mario, so it was decided. 
[Did you get him from a shelter?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/224f5n/i_was_almost_murdered_by_someone_with_a_machete/cgjc0ia?context=5)|No, just someone had a liter that they couldn't keep. So they were about to probably hit a shelter. So, sort of. 
[So what you are saying they were bound for home?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/224f5n/i_was_almost_murdered_by_someone_with_a_machete/cgjnnn7?context=5)|Somewhat of an incredible journey.
[But seriously, what happened after the first strike you just blacked out?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/224f5n/i_was_almost_murdered_by_someone_with_a_machete/cgj8dqc?context=5)|4.I have PSTD, but only little things are different like dreams are more lucid.

[Ps. I'm glad you are alive.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/224f5n/i_was_almost_murdered_by_someone_with_a_machete/cgj8dqc?context=5)|I am glad it didn't.
[How did it not chop through your jugular? It looks like it went straight through. How close was it to cutting your jugular? Did it hit it and not cut it but just pull on it? Sorry about all the questions, I'm just incredibly surprised it didn't cut clean through it.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/224f5n/i_was_almost_murdered_by_someone_with_a_machete/cgjkaok?context=5)|I was told it was centimeters. The ""lucky to be alive"" and ""It was a miracle"" were phrases thrown around. I make light of it, but I know how lucky I am.
[Was this the first time you have been cut with a machete in the neck?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/224f5n/i_was_almost_murdered_by_someone_with_a_machete/cgja825?context=5)|Yes, but not the first time almost being decapitated. I almost did it when I was about 20, riding a dirt bike and hit a barb wire fence.
[Have you considered not doing things? Doing things seems to not be working out in your favor.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/224f5n/i_was_almost_murdered_by_someone_with_a_machete/cgjc8qz?context=5)|When I do things, other things happen. I'm not a fan.
[Given your history I would avoid fans.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/224f5n/i_was_almost_murdered_by_someone_with_a_machete/cgjpttw?context=5)|I am not a fan of fans.
[What happened to him? Legally I mean? He better have been arrested. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/224f5n/i_was_almost_murdered_by_someone_with_a_machete/cgj87ne?context=5)|He was arrested, I think that same night, or in the early morning. He was charged with 2 counts of agg assault with a deadly weapon. He's serving a 15 do 10 and banished from the county. 
[Banished? Wow. Well I hope you are okay. Any lingering effects besides the scar?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/224f5n/i_was_almost_murdered_by_someone_with_a_machete/cgj8iyc?context=5)|I can scratch behind my ear, and feel it in my lower back, and visa versa.
[Imagine if when you scratched your ear it felt like you were masterbating. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/224f5n/i_was_almost_murdered_by_someone_with_a_machete/cgjpaye?context=5)|I instantly thought of a dog scratching their ears. It'd be heaven. 
[Who found you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/224f5n/i_was_almost_murdered_by_someone_with_a_machete/cgj9cr8?context=5)|A neighbor. It happened right  behind where I was living. They were having a BBQ and hear the shouting. When I was walking away, they called me over (At the same time they called the cops) and told me to lay down it was bad. I didn't think so because it didn't hurt. Then I saw all the blood and decided to listen to them. Within the next 30 mins I was at Grady Hospital in Atlanta. Great medical team by the way.
[Where near ATL was this? I'd just like to know so I don't end up moving there. Thanks OP. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/224f5n/i_was_almost_murdered_by_someone_with_a_machete/cgjo3vj?context=5)|It is near a place called Douglas county. Don't ever go into metro Atlanta, because YOU WILL GET MURDERED! Everyone here knows it, it is the ""out of towners"" that need to be educated. STAY AWAY! (I'm not kidding)
[God dammit this would happen in atlanta](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/224f5n/i_was_almost_murdered_by_someone_with_a_machete/cgjx41c?context=5)|How I feel exactly.

[Glad you pulled through btw.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/224f5n/i_was_almost_murdered_by_someone_with_a_machete/cgj99lz?context=5)|3.I don't know, I haven't paid that much attention, and if the are, I don't mind.
[*I know this is not that interesting, but I am bored. So AMA.*  It *is* interesting, don't sell yourself short. I'm glad you survived.  A week in ICU? Damn. I know this might seem like an overreaction, but don't be afraid to meet with a counselor to diagnose PTSD. There's no shame in it and you don't have to wait until the symptoms show up, in fact it's best not to.  Also what game were you playing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/224f5n/i_was_almost_murdered_by_someone_with_a_machete/cgj8riv?context=5)|Spades.

[Probably no one will see this, according to Wikipedia, Spades is a trick-taking card game devised in the United States in the 1930s. It can be played as either a partnership or solo/""cutthroat"" game.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/224f5n/i_was_almost_murdered_by_someone_with_a_machete/cgjnpby?context=5)|Nice.

Did this guy underbid?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/224f5n/i_was_almost_murdered_by_someone_with_a_machete/cgjwng1?context=5)|We were playing 300 and he was constantly sandbagging his hands. We weren't playing ""you bid 6 but get 5 you get 1 point"", it was if you bid 6 and got 5 you are down 6. 
[Ah, that seems more cut-throat (sorry\) than the version we played.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/224f5n/i_was_almost_murdered_by_someone_with_a_machete/cgjxb6g?context=5)|[Nice](http://i.imgur.com/o4RjPLB.gif)

As part of my Commerce degree, I interned at a company (Company A) and was offered a full-time job by them upon graduation. I decided to turn it down and look elsewhere because I was looking to relocate to a bigger city.

I then interviewed at a number of firms in bigger cities but did not receive any offers. During that time, Company A offered me a new job at their head office (which is in a larger city), a more senior position and significantly higher pay. They are a very small company and had lost several key employees in the previous few months, thus they really needed to hold onto their existing employees as hiring and training is a long and relatively strenuous process for this particular job.

I accepted Company A's offer this past Friday and was looking forward to my new role there. However, on Monday, one of the firms (Company B) that I had talked to previously unexpectedly offered me a position.

Company B is much larger than Company A, is in a different industry, and has offered better compensation, benefits, etc. Working for Company B would be a great way to start a completely new career path in a major city, but i would be one of only 50,000 employees, whereas at Company A I would work as part of a smaller team playing a more integral role in the organization as a whole.

My main reservation about reneging is that Company A has bent over backwards for me during this period and seem relieved to have me back on board. Also, by accepting they have stopped looking for other candidates and me reneging their offer would leave them short-handed. More importantly, it would be disrespectful to people that have supported me and expressed a sincere interested in keeping me.

Would it be awful of me to renege Company A's offer? I could probably move to Company B's city at some point in the future, but at the same time I think I would kick myself for not accepting Company B's offer.

I'd be interested to hear others' thoughts on this. 

**TL:DR: Am considering reneging a job offer from a very small company where I previously did internships, which would leave them short handed and likely result in burned bridges. My alternative is to work for a much larger company in an unrelated industry that I am eager to gain experience in. Should I risk the downside of reneging to work for the other company?**"

I'm 22. Took some time to travel after high school and have just now gotten into continuing my education. I am going for an AA Database Analyst degree at the moment at my community college. I have some background with MySQL, not much. Back in high school I ran my own WoW private server using MySQL, the core files were provided so I didn't create much but I did learn how to use queries and the jist of databases. I loved it and so I decided to study it. I have some experience with linux as I ran a cli operated web server for a bit just to get the hang of the OS. 

Now for the questions.
 
* What is the average day of the db analyst like?
* Do you enjoy what you do?
* Does the salary match the workload?
* What can I do to look good as an intern and an employee? (Obviously be knowledgeable, but any specific aspects?)
* I have a choice between programming electives: Visual Basic for Business Applications, Java Programming, HTML &amp; CSS, Development Fundamentals, Javascript Programming. Which of these would be most useful for me? 
* Do you guys work in Unix or Windows?

I thought I had more questions but it seems they've slipped my mind. I'll post more when I remember, if that's ok with you guys.

I'm very anxious to see what this community has to say as you're the only people I can turn to for questions in my current position.

Thank you very much.

I don't have any financial background, nor a degree (but 2 years of college), so I'm not their ideal candidate. I was hired to provide some additional support for them during the tax season. So far I've gotten nothing but compliments and absolutely crushing it (it's not the hardest job.) I love the firm. The people are great, they treat their employees right, they're growing fast, and I can definitely see myself there in the future.

It's getting towards the deadline/the end of my official role (get them in) and everything is hectic, and stressful. However, a senior partner said I was doing a great job, asked me about my future plans, and hinted at sticking around after the tax season is over. I mentioned that I'm heading back to school to finish up my degree, and he mentioned looking into an internship. They have several different areas that I would love to be involved in, especially their wealth management/investment division. I want to get a sit down and talk things out, but it's so busy, that there really isn't any time.

I never really intended on getting a career in the financial world; I was actually headed back for chemical engineering with a minor in finance. I mention this to the guy, and he said that it wasn't the strongest of cases, and that they were looking for people who would want to establish a career there. I definitely would like to do that, and would even be willing to pursue a degree in finance, economics, etc.

What would be the best way to approach the situation? I still have some pondering and figuring out to do, but not much time left before my time is up. "

225zq8,2,2014-04-04,[19M] I'm tired of the people I work with. None of them work hard and bully me because I work harder.,Pissed_too_far_off,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/225zq8/19m_im_tired_of_the_people_i_work_with_none_of/,"I'm just fucking done with it. Go ahead, call me a whiny little bitch, I don't give a fuck at this point. I have worked hard in everything my whole life, work, albeit a part time job I hate, is no exception. Every shift I go to work knowing what will happen, I will start off just dandy, then by the third hour or so I'll get pissed off at some fucker and it will keep me pissed off (internally, I don't show my displeasure with others) the whole night.

Example 1: Every closing shift these guys will whine and complain if they stay a minute past the time we are scheduled, but they text, snapchat and generally do fuck all the whole night. I don't get it, you complain that you get out late after you do *nothing* the whole shift.

Example 2: 2 fuckers walked around for an hour to kill time before they left and I got the shaft and had to play catchup the whole night and ended up leaving late. 

Example 3 (this is the best): When we close on thursdays we have the truck for the next day. Last thursday the people I had to work with decided they would sit for an hour, on the clock, in the office and do nothing. The best part is that the closing manager (of a different department) was with them the whole time and didn't tell them to get to work. Instead, I picked up the slack. One of those shits even left early and consequently we got out late. They give me shit for breaking down the truck (doing my job) and call me and over achiever and a piece of shit. Yea, I'm just doing my job, fuck me right?

The closing manager totally plays favorites and asks me to do more shit while the three fuck-a-teers do nothing. 

I've told management (of my department) about all of this and they just don't give a fuck. I'm tired of this. I'm a highly trained emergency responder and nationally certified professional firefighter who turned down jobs to go to school and continue working with my current employer. I have sacrificed so much and worked so hard only to be ridiculed by my co'workers' (because lets face it, this one asshole decided to take a half hour on the clock because he was 'tired' and kept on his phone the whole time). 

Management tells me they appreciate my hard work but all I feel is used. Used because I have the skill and work ethic to get the job done right and quickly. 

Every fucking shift it's the same thing. I tried the psychological approach to anger through high school and it worked up until last semester. I'm seeing a Psychiatrist next week and hopefully I can get something to help me because as it stands, I am on the verge of quitting every fucking shift. None of these people have any ambition or work ethic and I don't think they will ever advance in life, yet I work my fucking hardest and get shit about it. 

I've got less than two months left before I move to DC for the summer for school and an internship and then to the school I'm transferring to.

I'm just at a total loss with these people, they're older than me and nothing more than a common fucking bully. I've been bullied since middle school and I can't fucking stand it. I'd be surprised if these shits aren't on welfare in 5 years and in crippling debt. Some of these assholes  don't even pay rent, their parents do! My professors and parents have told me that all of the sacrifice and anguish will be worth it in a few years when I have the degree, no debt, and a job. But I don't believe them.

I've got friends who have graduated and gotten jobs and they say it's the same shitty people with different names. It seems as if people don't grow up but rather grow older. I don't know what to do, what to feel, or what I can do. I can suck it up for two months and risk losing my shit and just yelling at these assholes only to transfer to a new location in the fall and what, deal with more of the same type of assholes? 

I just want to stop being pissed off at these fucks and letting them ruin my mood but I just can't because every day it's the same shit. 

TL;DR: I'm fucking pissed off with my co'workers' who do fucking nothing but ridicule me for working hard. I have doubts about the grass being greener on the other side. I'm going to see a psychiatrist. Read the post, please. I'm literally losing myself to this shit."

Or maybe you just want to post a weird challenge like /u/tomtomglove did when he asked redditors to [""Go to the bank, try to deposit 100 hot dogs.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/GoForGold/comments/1k5nks/go_to_a_bank_try_to_deposit_100_hot_dogs/) ...And /u/Ice-Z actually did it, and [videotapped himself for your pleasure.](http://www.reddit.com/r/GoForGold/comments/1k5nks/go_to_a_bank_try_to_deposit_100_hot_dogs/cbr2k8h)

I mean really, this sub has everything! If drawing or depositing hot dogs isn't your thing, then why not help /u/Garm_Bel_Iblis and his wife [choose which carpet to put in their new house](http://www.reddit.com/r/GoForGold/comments/21kdch/carpet_my_living_room_virtually/), or sing a song [Shatner style and post it to youtube for two months of gold?](http://www.reddit.com/r/GoForGold/comments/21sq31/sing_a_song_of_your_choice_shatner_style_2_months/) The possibilities are certainly endless, and so if you're waiting to get [your golden ticket](http://i.imgflip.com/r8l0.gif) then this sub is definitely one you should check out. Now, let's hear more about the sub from the mods themselves. 


&gt;##1. Tell us about yourselves! (interests, hopes and dreams, the kind of person you are, anything!)

&gt;&gt;**19thconservatory:** I'm an American female communications student at a Texas university. I'm not sure what I want to do, but I'm pretty sure that professional beer drinker is not going to happen.

&gt;&gt;**reduced-fat-milk:**  I am a 19 year old American (NJ) male computer science enthusiast. I don't plan on doing college - but consulting and attempting to start companies is going well so far as I live right next to an amazing budding startup community. I also like photography and taro coconut bubble tea. :3 If you, for some weird reason, want more info - I have an internet majig [here.](http://nick.sahler.co/)

&gt;&gt;**Silver_Star:** I'm currently a student who is working hard to learn and gain experience with 3DCG. I aspire to eventually get a job working with 3d Art, preferably within video games.

&gt;##2. How did you get involved with /r/goforgold?

&gt;&gt;**19thconservatory:** /r/GoForGold originated from a thread on /r/CrazyIdeas which is another sub that I frequent. The thread took off and /u/reduced-fat-milk launched it and began asking about mods. So I asked if he needed help and that was that.

&gt;&gt;**reduced-fat-milk:**  Like /u/19thconservatory said - the idea originated in a thread on /r/CrazyIdeas. I liked the idea so much that I decided to start the sub and see where it went. I modded a few people who asked, and we started going. I'm extremely happy that the mods I picked ended up being pretty smart, reasonable and awesome :D

&gt;&gt;**Silver_Star:** When /u/reduced-fat-milk made it , I sent a mod mail to him offering to help him as a mod on the subreddit, and he sent me a mod invite.

&gt;##3. What has been your favourite challenge so far? Your favourite reply to a challenge?

&gt;&gt;**19thconservatory:** I don't know why, but I like the challenges that are ""eat/chug this [food] in [timeframe]."" The videos are pretty amusing.

&gt;&gt;**reduced-fat-milk:** My favourite is either the [hotdog banker](http://www.reddit.com/r/GoForGold/comments/1k5nks/go_to_a_bank_try_to_deposit_100_hot_dogs/) challenge or the [morning wood](http://www.reddit.com/r/GoForGold/comments/20v6zi/challenge_gold_for_the_first_to_complete_the/) challenge. I also like the [""buy a hobo breakfast""](http://www.reddit.com/r/GoForGold/comments/1k68bl/invite_a_homeless_person_for_breakfast/) challenge, because there's nothing like the smell of philanthropy in the morning.

&gt;&gt;**Silver_Star:** [This](http://www.reddit.com/r/GoForGold/comments/1ydodj/gold_for_sharing_a_porno_to_your_facebook_wall/) is probably my favorite challenge so far. The top response is also obviously my favorite reply.

&gt;##4. Has modding for /r/goforgold for the past 7 months changed your own mindset in anyway?

&gt;&gt;**19thconservatory:** I now read all of the rules in sidebars before posting to unfamiliar subreddits. (""Flair your posts!"" reminders happened way too often in the beginning.)

&gt;&gt;**reduced-fat-milk:** I don't think so. My mindset has changed from other things which changed how I moderate and look at/r/goforgold, but I don't think /r/goforgold has changed it itself.

&gt;&gt;**Silver_Star:** Not really no. The way I moderate hasn't really changed and the way I use reddit has been unaffected by it.

&gt;##5. Is there anything else you want to add about /r/goforgold or the community there?

&gt;&gt;**19thconservatory:** Our subreddit relies on the honor system for rewarding users with gold, and I'm really pleased with how much our subscribers come through with sending gold.

&gt;&gt;**reduced-fat-milk:** One is that I like the silly, ""challengy"" challenges more than the ""do me a favor/job"" challenges. They are more fun and creative and warrant more reward. If you make challenges like that, I'll try to gold you and/or give you special custom flair. Also what I said before - Fantastic mods :D



Thank you to the /r/goforgold mods for answering these questions! As one of the new /r/SubredditoftheDay interns, this has been the first subreddit that I have ever featured, so let me know what you think, and if you have any suggestions for the future.

I'm not gonna lie, I made some dumb mistakes in the past and as a result, my gpa isn't the best.  I'm in an intro comp sci class right now and I really like it, I like it enough to consider adding comp sci as a second major.  If I did, I would graduate with both my math and CS degree in May 2016.  More than likely, my major GPA as a comp sci major would be higher than my overall gpa.  

Is the addition of a CS degree to my resume worth spending another year in school?  I have the luxury of having parents whom are willing to pay for my entire schooling, it's just that missing out on an entire year of salary seems like it would take a long time to make up.  What is y'alls opinion?

Despite my low gpa, I did manage to earn an internship for this summer that is paying $18/hr and that puts me in high hopes of getting a job with a math degree by this time next year.

ALSO, if I did not add the second major, I still would be able to earn a minor in comp sci (I actually plan on doing this)."

Context: Will graduate this spring from a top 25 US university with a degree in Applied Math (has a top 10 grad program). Had poor performance/indecision earlier on studying other (non-math related) subjects, switched to math. Expected cumulative GPA ~3.4 and major GPA of ~3.7/3.8. Pretty much have received A/A-'s in all upper division coursework (real/complex analysis, numerical analysis, probability, ODEs, linear algebra, etc. NO abstract algebra) . No research experience, though I do have experience working with an academic in a quantitative field as an internship. Will be working in a quantitatively heavy field next year full-time at a great company.

Questions:

1. Given my background (no ""honors"" coursework, no research) are ""top 30"" (as  subjective as this may be) within reach? I feel that I've just scratched the ""tip of the iceberg"" in learning math and hope to continue.

2. If so, how much ""value-added"" do employers find an M.S. in Applied Math (versus just a Bachelor's) to be for someone interested in working in any of the following: data science, information theory related fields, quantum computing (realize this needs compsci), or quant finance?

226fuo,27,2014-04-04,I wrote some stuff about Americans going to UK universities that you might find interesting,Paiev,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/226fuo/i_wrote_some_stuff_about_americans_going_to_uk/,"I wrote a comment [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/225tpm/i_dont_know_if_this_is_the_right_place_but_what/cgjse4p) on a small thread on /r/PersonalFinance, responding to somebody who was asking about doing his undergrad in the UK. It's a pretty long comment and I thought it might be interesting to some people here, so I'm cross-posting. Hopefully you find my advice and experiences to be at least somewhat interesting. 

Here's the comment text:

&gt;I'm actually an American doing my undergrad in the UK. It's a route that I probably would not recommend to very many people, actually. Some things to think about:

&gt; * As everyone has said, finances are the biggest question mark. It ain't cheap. I pay in the 40-45k USD range per year for tuition + housing, and I'm grandfathered in to the rate from before the tuition increases a few years ago-- if you started now at my university you'd be paying a bit north of 50k USD a year. This is in the same ballpark as private American universities, which are generally around 50-60k+, but of course the latter have financial aid.

&gt; * Financial aid consists of loans. The university won't give you any money, and getting external scholarships or grants will be very difficult, so you're pretty much stuck with loans. You can take out Stafford loans for around 5k USD a year, and your parents can take PLUS loans up to a variable amount depending on their credit, income, etc. These two + some college savings are sufficient to cover my costs, so I'm not sure what the options are beyond that; I imagine you'd have to head to private lenders. 

&gt; * On the flip side, degrees in the UK [edit: in England, anyway; Scotland is typically 4 years] are in general a year shorter than those in the USA. Degree length is variable depending on what you want to study. Typically arts subjects are 3 years, while science subjects are 3 or 4 or either. The setup is generally 3 years for a bachelors or a fourth year for a masters. You'd have to look it up for your specific subject.

&gt; * Speaking of which, in the UK you apply for a particular course of study and then study exclusively those subjects (this is also why degrees are shorter: no distribution courses / core curriculum / gen ed). Changing courses is difficult; you can sometimes change to a related course after your first year (e.g. I have a friend who went Maths &amp; Computer Science =&gt; Maths only), but in general changing courses requires reapplying and restarting. This is a huge, huge difference from the USA; while British students have been focusing in on a few subjects for the last couple years of their secondary education, many Americans don't really know what they want to study in college, or they think they do but change their mind once they actually take a few courses in it or in something else that they like better. [edit: in Scotland there's a bit of room for studying things outside your course of study, so this applies especially to England (and I think Wales too, but don't quote me on that... no idea about Northern Ireland). Changing courses in Scotland will still be nontrivial, though.]

&gt; * The current UK government is pretty hostile to foreigners (the understatement of the century). I mean, look at [this](http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02628/tory-van-620_2628143b.jpg). It's an ad the Home Office put on some vans recently. They've been increasing immigration restrictions and you just generally will not feel very welcome from the government. This will only be a factor when applying for a student visa and when figuring out what to do after graduation, but the latter one is pretty important, and it's something to keep in mind.

&gt; * UK universities cater towards UK students. Obvious, right? But that means that if you're looking to return to the USA, you may well find them much less helpful than you'd like. Campus recruiting events will be filled with UK-based employers and not very many US-based ones, so you're mostly on your own looking for a job in the US. And there will be little guidance or preparation for heading to an American grad school. This is a really important bullet point that I really did not appreciate before coming here.

&gt; The financial reasons combined with the rigidity of course of study and the poor US connections are why I would not recommend UK undergrad to most people. The simple fact of the matter is that a comparable-quality US school would probably serve you better.

&gt; In my case, I still think heading to the UK was probably my best option. But the UK-school scale has a lot of factors tipping in its favor for me that the general student won't have:

&gt; * I'm studying a joint course with two subjects (math &amp; computer science) that I had gained significant exposure to in high school. I had a pretty good idea of what college-level study in these subjects was like, and I was confident that they were what I wanted to do. Most people are not this fortunate. Studying two subjects also allows my interests between the two to fluctuate a bit more, and I go in phases of being more focused on math and more on CS. Studying a single subject gives a bit less flexibility here.

&gt; * I'm at a top UK university. This is a pretty big factor. In the USA, almost everywhere in the UK will be largely unknown, and I think the brand value of your degree will drop off very rapidly past the absolute best unis. This won't affect the quality of education, but it will affect all the things that your university's name is relevant for (prestige and its social and employment consequences). American employers are much less likely to think a degree from Durham is worth any more than a degree from Plymouth even though the former is a far better university (this should maybe be in the warnings section above...). Anyway, the upshot is that I'm fortunate that being where I am mitigates a lot of this.

&gt; * I was able to get into a significantly better school in the UK than I would've been able to in the USA. Not super proud of this one and it's not something I like advertising, but I never did my homework in high school and had a crappy GPA. However, I had high SAT, SAT II, and AP scores, and it turns out that test scores are all most UK universities really care about (particularly AP scores), due to it being much easier to compare them to their A-levels (or Highers; don't want to leave out my Scottish friends) system. I never even submitted my GPA or high school transcript, and nobody ever asked. Crazy, right? I really lucked out and totally gamed the system. Happily, I got my shit together a lot more once I got out of my house and was on my own. Maturity and all that. I'm now on track for a high first class degree result (UK has degree classifications instead of GPAs), and was in the top 10% of the year last year. So I've turned it around quite a bit since high school.

&gt; * I knew I could get a good, high-paying CS job after graduation, so I was fairly unconcerned about my own student loans. I'm not graduating for another year, but I'm confident that this was a good judgment given my experience searching for internships so far. I'm extremely lucky that I happen to be good at something which is also in high demand.

&gt;Anyway this got a bit rambly, but hopefully you (or anybody!) finds it interesting or helpful. I don't usually use tl;drs, but this is long enough to make an exception:

&gt;**tl;dr**: Doing your undergrad in the UK is in most cases imprudent, and I would recommend it to very few people due to finances, rigidity of course of study, and poor industry connections. I only think it's a good choice if you're in a similar position to what I was: attending a top university, have good post-graduation prospects, and have good reasons to believe you know what you want to study.

&gt;Best of luck, and you or anyone else should feel free to reply or PM with questions. "

I've been sorta half-heartedly looking for internships (applied to google and fb and some others with a ""deferral"" from google until fall and no response from fb/others) that haven't really come through, and I've been feeling some pressure to find something to do so that I don't spend around three months doing nothing.

To top it off, my telebears is coming up in the next week, and the classes that make sense to take next, cs70, cs61c, and ee20, seem like they would be a tough combination to handle..

I've thought about taking cs70 over the summer and taking cs170 or something in the fall, and that would give me something to do, but that doesn't quite solve my doubts about taking 3 tough classes at the same time.  Plus, I'm not sure if I want to keep on grinding through without much of a break between classes.

Anyways, that's my situation.  If anyone here has been in a similar situation or could give me some advice as to what to do regarding classes for next semester and summer plans, I would appreciate it greatly :D"

2274sy,10,2014-04-04,I hate my job and the people I work with ridicule me for working hard.,Pissed_too_far_off,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2274sy/i_hate_my_job_and_the_people_i_work_with_ridicule/,"I'm just fucking done with it. Go ahead, call me a whiny baby, I don't give a fuck at this point. I have worked hard in everything my whole life, work, albeit a part time job I hate, is no exception. Every shift I go to work knowing what will happen, I will start off just dandy, then by the third hour or so I'll get pissed off at some fucker and it will keep me pissed off (internally, I don't show my displeasure with others) the whole night.

Example 1: Every closing shift these guys will whine and complain if they stay a minute past the time we are scheduled, but they text, snapchat and generally do fuck all the whole night. I don't get it, you complain that you get out late after you do nothing the whole shift.

Example 2: 2 fuckers walked around for an hour to kill time before they left and I got the shaft and had to play catchup the whole night and ended up leaving late.

Example 3 (this is the best): When we close on thursdays we have the truck for the next day. Last thursday the people I had to work with decided they would sit for an hour, on the clock, in the office and do nothing. The best part is that the closing manager (of a different department) was with them the whole time and didn't tell them to get to work. Instead, I picked up the slack. One of those shits even left early and consequently we got out late. They give me shit for breaking down the truck (doing my job) and call me and over achiever and a piece of shit. Yea, I'm just doing my job, fuck me right? The closing manager totally plays favorites and asks me to do more shit while the three fuck-a-teers do nothing.

I've told management (of my department) about all of this and they just don't give a fuck. I'm tired of this. I'm a highly trained emergency responder and nationally certified professional firefighter who turned down jobs to go to school and continue working with my current employer. I have sacrificed so much and worked so hard only to be ridiculed by my co'workers' (because lets face it, this one asshole decided to take a half hour on the clock because he was 'tired' and kept on his phone the whole time).

Management tells me they appreciate my hard work but all I feel is used. Used because I have the skill and work ethic to get the job done right and quickly. One of my professors told me that they will always work a good horse to death.

Every fucking shift it's the same thing. I tried the psychological approach to anger through high school and it worked up until last semester. I'm seeing a Psychiatrist next week and hopefully I can get something to help me because as it stands, I am on the verge of quitting every fucking shift. None of these people have any ambition or work ethic and I don't think they will ever advance in life, yet I work my fucking hardest and get shit about it. I've got less than two months left before I move to DC for the summer for school and an internship and then to the school I'm transferring to.

I'm just at a total loss with these people, they're older than me and nothing more than a common fucking bully. I've been bullied since middle school and I can't fucking stand it. I'd be surprised if these shits aren't on welfare in 5 years and in crippling debt. Some of these assholes don't even pay rent, their parents do! My professors and parents have told me that all of the sacrifice and anguish will be worth it in a few years when I have the degree, no debt, and a job.

But I don't believe them.

I've got friends who have graduated and gotten jobs and they say it's the same shitty people with different names. It seems as if people don't grow up but rather grow older. I don't know what to do, what to feel, or what I can do. I can suck it up for two months and risk losing my shit and just yelling at these assholes only to transfer to a new location in the fall and what, deal with more of the same type of assholes?

I just want to stop being pissed off at these fucks and letting them ruin my mood but I just can't because every day it's the same shit.

TL;DR: I'm fucking pissed off with my co'workers' who do nothing but ridicule me for working hard. I have doubts about the grass being greener on the other side. I'm going to see a psychiatrist. Everyone I work with is an ass and management has done nothing."
2276t0,2,2014-04-04,Telling me what you did does not make it ok,Gidiggly,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/2276t0/telling_me_what_you_did_does_not_make_it_ok/,"After graduating with my business degree, I was plunged into the sobering world of job hunting.  After over a year of searching, the best I had been able to do was finding part-time work and volunteering the rest of my time at unpaid internships to try and make sure I was still gaining relevant experience.

After searching for a long time, I finally found a job position that I would be perfect for and would be perfect for me.  I interviewed twice over the course of two weeks and have been waiting all week to hear back from them.  Every day that passes, my heart gets a little more sad.

So, today when I came in, my co-worker that I (was) friendly with sent me this via email:

*""So, I need to tell ya something, I wanna be honest abut it and hope there won't be any hard feelings. But, when you told me about [the job] I went and applied also. I have an interview with them next week also. I just thought I should tell you so it wouldn't look like something under-handed or anything sneaky since we were talking about among one another.""*

...

Don't fucking do something underhanded and then tell me about it as if that somehow makes everything ""above board.""  It *doesn't* and I'm really fucking pissed off. 

More than that, I'm really fucking sad.  I know it was my fault for telling her about it in the first place, but the whole things just makes me really depressed.  Also, and I'm not just saying this, she is the **WORST** employee I have ever encountered.  They really want to fire her here, but they keep her around because her mother also works here and she actually does a good job.  And that's the only reason she's still here.

I'm feeling a lot like shit at the moment and I have no one to talk to about it.  My boyfriend is out of town for work and I can't really bother him at the moment.  I also know telling him about it would just put more stress on him because he can't really do anything to comfort him (so it would just be frustration for him that he doesn't need)."

Unsure how to go about it.",boudica88,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2277lo/getting_noticed_at_work_and_earned_some_favors/,"So I've been working as a receptionist for a salon branch of a fairly small corporation in a major city that handles a couple of enterprises. Over the last eight months, I've solidified myself as one of the best receptionists in my salon, but also proven I have a number of other talents (I was a publicity intern before I came to this company, I wrote a number of press releases for that group, and my communications skills are ridiculous). I've volunteered time on the side to help with some licensing issues for employees, run errands for practically everyone in the company, and pretty much everything I've heard directly or behind my back has been glowingly positive. My boss has actually said that he prefers my style of customer service to his own because he can tell I actually care.

Anyhow, the company is opening a new branch for several of its enterprises this summer, and I've heard that they're planning on expanding into several other major cities in the next five years. Right now, the corporate team seems pretty small; other than the individual owners of the branches, I only know of four or five people who actually work strictly for corporate to keep everything in order (president, VP, operations, marketing, one person per major role). 

Everyone in the company seems to have known everyone else for years and years, goes to the same parties, etc., and a few people where I've worked have promised to put in a good word for me so I can hopefully someday move beyond being a phone jockey. I've also heard the president of the company has expressed some curiosity in meeting me after people at my branch talked me up. I also just learned we're alumni of the same university. 

So I've found out who coordinates the marketing and publicity materials (flyers, newsletters, social media, all that jazz) for our company, and it's all done by one person. It seems to me if the company's really growing this quickly, that's likely going to change.

My question is, how should I go about approaching the marketing/PR guy for our company? The company itself is extremely casual (it's style and wellness-focused, so it's pretty much entirely composed of gay men in expensive jeans with impeccable hair), and one of the stylists at my branch who owes me a favor said he could text the guy for me or mention me over drinks. So I'm wondering, should I just send out an email to him introducing myself? I was thinking I could volunteer my services as an apprentice or intern of sorts and express an interest in how he composes our materials and manages the social media that we have. I've got experience with InDesign, I've run a blog or two, and I'm pretty sure if I phrase it right he'd be thrilled to have a little back-up for all the work that's coming our way.

Alternately, should I just wait until I have a chance to organically have a conversation with either him or the president? I've already met the VP a few times, the president visits our branch frequently, but I've never seen my marketing guy anywhere (though I understand he's extremely friendly and approachable).

2278fr,4,2014-04-04,Should a burgeoning data scientist continue with actuarial-specific classes or just applied statistics,[deleted],actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/2278fr/should_a_burgeoning_data_scientist_continue_with/,"Hello /r/actuary,

As a freshman undergrad, I am looking for some advice on whether I should continue to take actuarial classes.
 
My primary major is computer science, and I absolutely love programming. I sometimes spend eight hours being entirely immersed in it, I really enjoy it, and I have a fantastic internship lined up for this summer in software development for a prominent Fortune 500 software company. I want to write software/manage software creation, and actuarial knowledge is something that I would like to have in my mathematical/financial toolbox.

I also really love probability theory, discrete math, number theory, and stochastic processes. I have taken and passed the P exam, after studying the material for three weeks during the summer before university, and I really enjoyed the material.

My problem is that I am currently taking a class that is supposed to prepare me for the FM exam, and while I do have high marks in class and understand the material, sometimes the material feels painfully repetitive, and it irritates me to do problems. I do not want to continue to take classes if the rest of what I learn will be like the FM material.

My question is whether I should expect the material to improve in terms of theoretical rigor and variation of content. Specifically, I am asking about the material for the MLC, MFE, and C exams.

Thank you much"
227bse,7,2014-04-04,[Pics]My Ketogains journey begins. Am I doing this right?,Bainge,ketogains,https://www.reddit.com/r/ketogains/comments/227bse/picsmy_ketogains_journey_begins_am_i_doing_this/,"So I just spent the last three months at an internship in a desk job where I sat on excel for approximately 13-14 hours a day, had two big takeout meals a day and was right next to the snack corner. After never really having to worry about my weight before I suddenly found myself fatter than I had ever been in my life, most noticeable that my 32"" waist pants no longer fit, bleh.

So I researched just what kind of diet and exercise I wanted to do when I returned home and settled on a ketogenic diet, because it seemed like the most intriguing to me. I wanted a simple gym routine that I could do after not going for 3 months and continue during the school year, so I settled on a modified starting strength routine. I finally had the excess funds to make a purchase I've been eying for a while, and bought a brand new Specialized Allez Race road bike and love it. http://i.imgur.com/5iY4yJF.jpg Here is the beauty.

Anyway, this is me at my starting place on Monday: 
http://i.imgur.com/B9tiP9b.jpg 
5'""10, 183 pounds and what I would estimate at 15%ish body fat. My goal is to get down to 11 or 12% BF so I can have abs for the first time in my life. 

I followed the FAQ, got up Monday and ate nothing than did my exercise routine. The next day I ate breakfast and rode my bike a little and then peed on the Keto test stick and it was purple, so I'm in right? 

Here is my current routine, any insight or advice would be super appreciated:

M, W, F:
Modified Starting strength that adds dips or pullups depending on the day and weighted incline situps as well as hyperextensions.

T, Th:
Take that fresh new bike out for a spin, anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour and a half. Probably average about 10 miles.

Sat, Sun
Rest from my labors

Now, I have been keeping my carbs at or below 28 grams since Monday, but I have only been consuming about 1500-1800 calories when all the calculators I do seem to suggest consuming about 2100. But I want accelerated results and its really hard to eat that much without carbs, so am I making the right decision by undercutting that amount and staying around 1500? I won't care if there is a little bit of muscle loss, because the second I get my bodyfat down I will start eating carbs again and start lifting more, careful to keep my abs in check.

Any suggestions? Is my plan viable and can I see measurable results in a month? Thanks for your help, I am very new to dieting as you can see.

The problem is right now i am am leaning 90-10 towards industry + with my GPA i'm not sure if i can get to grad school, and I have 0 job/research experience so with graduating next year i'm worried my resume will remain bare. I applied to both REU and internships for the summer so that i can say i prefer one to the other. The program needs me to get back to them in a couple of days to see if i will accept or decline, but truth be told i would prefer to do an internship b/c it would look better for industry. I am not sure though if i would get another opportunity to do work over the summer b/c i have not heard from the other multiple REU's and internships that i applied to. Do you think i should accept the REU offer or pass on it and hope with my low gpa an internship contacts me. First option gives me an opportunity do test out research, see if i like it and guarantees something i can add to my resume while the other option is a bigger risk with a better reward(looks better on my resume) if i decide to into industry.

227fss,13,2014-04-04,How many of the ex-Muslims here or anyone here have contact with users right now that are stuck in a situation that they want to be freed from?,helpx3,exmuslim,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/227fss/how_many_of_the_exmuslims_here_or_anyone_here/,"So, I was thinking recently...


I just started talking to a young girl living in another state, in the mid-upper side of the U.S.A. She is living with her family, who is very religious, forceful, abusive in almost every way, and she is stuck. She obviously does not have the same beliefs and the life-style of her family, but she is forced to follow their orders. She is depressed and sees no hope in life. There is way more to the story, but I hope you get the idea.


Now, no one deserves to live a life in force, abuse, and torment. Everyone deserves to live a happy life and everyone should have the right to live with their beliefs. 


So, how many of you have been contacting via online or in any way with some individuals like this? Maybe from a different state or a country? 


After talking to this one girl recently, I was thinking to myself. Is there any way we can support these individuals? I mean it's not easy for all of us to take in all these individuals and provide them housing, etc. I know the ex-Muslim community is trying to find legal ways to help some of these people, since I saw a post about it on reddit. But, my idea is more like **how can we help these people help themselves?** 


Let's say, there is a person in--maybe Connecticut, who is in a situation and is struggling. Is there a way we can find other ex-Muslims in Connecticut who have found their freedom or anyone else who is willing to help talk to them? And I mean **in person.** Can they meet up with these people somehow and just inspire them, motivate them--kind of give them a push, and make them believe in themselves. Because, some of these individuals I talk to, CAN help themselves. Some are in college, all we have to do is push them to maybe get a dorm, even if it is expensive because **nothing is more expensive than YOUR LIFE.** Some are way too scared to stand up for themselves in front of their families and that is why we need individuals to give them a push to do so. Some, do not even know how the world works. For example, there was this one young teenager in high school, her parents expect her to get married after high school and not go to further education. I got contact with that girl **in the mosque** and I helped her fill out college applications. I told her about SAT's/ACT's that she had no idea about. We did this only in the mosque because that is the only place her family would take her and I would act like a ""Muslim,"" so her family would let her talk to me. There are just simple things that some individuals do not know because they are from very sheltered families, that if we just told them, they can use it to help themselves. We have to seek out to help them, even if it means that we have to act like a ""Muslim"" at the mosque to help them out. We have to find more and many different ways of  to help them. Even if it means, we pick one girl from our meet-up or one guy from our meet-up to go to a mosque or anywhere to a Muslim family's house and act like their daughter/sons friend.

See, I personally was in a very abusive home in every way. I was very close to suicide and giving up on life. But, one day this person just gave me a push and told me I can do it myself, mostly via online. I was stuck in this horrible living situation for my whole life, and my inner spirit was dying. But since I came to college, I became proactive and looked for help because the person I was talking to enlightened me about all the resources out there that I can use to help myself. I told my counselors in school my family problems, even the police started keeping an eye on our home without any one of us knowing because the counselors told them my situation. Then one day my senior year of college (which I wished was earlier, but I am staying another year in college, so it’s okay), my counselor made room in our college apartments to give me free housing and I fled for sure. Since then my life has changed IMMENSELY, and I realized how much more growing I have to do. It was easier to work in school and get good grades, now I have been getting about 5 offers for internships and yet so much still to come. This all happened in a span of less than a year. 


So, my point is, if someone can meet up with these ""stuck"" people in person and just be there friend, motivate them, show them they have so much potential--maybe one day, they will have the will power and strength to stand up for themselves. Some of these individuals have no idea about how the world functions out there because some of them are made to believe that the world is a horrible place and no one will help you, that is what they have been hearing their whole life as a child, so they think they have no hope. But, if someone can just show them that they have good support, so many resources, and there are good people out there, maybe they would be more motivated in trying hard to help themselves. I was given the push via online, but sometimes some people need a real person in front of them rather than just words online. Sometimes, that's all a person needs, someone to talk to and give them a little push, and from there they can help themselves. I really believe this can happen because some of the young girls I talk to have SO much potential, their only problem is that they care too much about hurting their parent’s feelings and they are way too scared of almost everything. That's it. They just need someone to make them realize and show them another perspective of life. Show them that they matter. I know that's how it worked for me. I used to care too much, but once I realized **I** matter, I fled, I helped myself and my situation.


At the end of the day if you realize, most of us are not stuck in 3rd world countries, which gives us a HUGE HUGE HUGE advantage and we should take advantage of that big time, and take advantage of the resources around us. It might be a struggle at first, but trust me at the end you will be happy.


As its said, *""The mind is a powerful force. It can enslave us or empower us. It can plunge us into the depths of misery or take us to the heights of ecstasy. Learn to use the power wisely.""* 


So, only if we can motivate these ""stuck"" individuals and enlighten them on how they are way stronger than they know.


For the meet ups, I was thinking rather than all the ex-Muslims just chilling, maybe each one of us should find an individual online who is stuck and bring them to the table at the meet-up. We do not have to tell any personal information without their permission, but we can simply tell them where that person might live and if someone from the ex-Muslim community or anyone who is also in that area can maybe meet up with them somewhere, even if it's in their school or the library or **even the mosque** and just let them know, they are not alone and they have hope, give them advise, enlighten them with another perspective to life, just be a friend. Maybe that will give them a push to help themselves because some of us were there in their position and we know how they feel, this will help them relate to us and motivate them. Sometimes these people in such situations do not come out themselves or are too depressed to talk to anyone, so people like us have to seek for them to help them before it is too late for them. 


All we simply have to do is help them *realize* how strong they are and how they can help themselves. "

227j72,10,2014-04-04,"Me [25 M] with my GF [23 F] of 3.5 years, she is coming home from internship (3 months) on monday - problem arising",motivationalthrowawa,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/227j72/me_25_m_with_my_gf_23_f_of_35_years_she_is_coming/,"So me and my girlfriend has been doing the LDR thing for 3 months now (before that we've lived together for 2.5 years, and pretty much been with each other for every day). She's been on an internship in an other country. This has been a hell for me - especially now under the last part since she have been flaky with communications. Sure, she is writing her exam work at the same time but it could go _5_ days without her calling. Just a few messages on facebook.

Safe to say that I haven't felt that I was being loved.

So she is finally coming home on monday evening! She asked me 1 month ago if I could pick her up (we live rather far from the airport).

That would be so romantic - standing there with a rose and everything. Seeing each other for the first time since 2 months (I visited her for a weekend).

So her cousin(and friend) messaged me on facebook - asking if she could tag along picking her up. My initial reaction was ""uh no? thats a moment for me and my girlfriend"". But I told the cousin that ""oh that's not really what I expected but sure!"".

After an hour had passed I realized that I'm not actually 100% okay with that. Her being away is not only about her, it's about us - and about our first moment together for a very long time. At the same time her sister messages me and asks if she can tag along as well. I messaged the cousin and told her that ""I'm not sure if it's a good idea, I think me and my girlfriend should have some time for ourselves before we hang out with other people"". She answers ""Yeah I understand. It's just that both her sisters would want to give her a warm welcome.""

Now the situation changed from me and my GF -&gt; +cousin -&gt; +her two sisters.

So I called my GF up on skype, explained the situation. That I would like some alone time with her - you know describing the romantic feeling on the airport with the rose and everything.

She completely blew up. Her shouting/screaming: ""You have no exclusivity right of me!"" ""I want them coming as well!"" ""Don't you understand that it makes me happy that they are coming??"" ""Why don't you understand me!?!?"" ""Do you have a control issue over me?""

Turns out she and her cousin had talked about this and she said to the cousin ""ask OP!"". Turns out my opinion only mattered when I had it right. Plus, why wouldnt my GF ask me instead of the cousin?

I hinted that if her moment with them are so special, why wouldn't she ask them to pick her up instead of me from the beginning?

The fight ended up with her saying something in the lines of ""I want them to come, you can come only if you want, they can pick me up instead"". Basically she said ""you are optional"".

Then the conversation ended because she ""had to get ready for a resturant dinner with her collegues, we'll talk about this later..."" I asked her when 'later' means. She basically said ""when we're face to face, because I don't wanna talk about this over skype"". Which is rather weird cause this issue is about her coming home.

Am I being wrong? I don't know what to think. This is so confusing. Im shaking and I'm so sad.

---   
**tl;dr**: GF away on internship for 3 months. Picking up the gf from the airport on monday and it completely blew up. Her sisters and cousin want to join. I want that moment to be for us. Verbal fight started.

Edit: I just wanna explain that my comments are for trying to understand - not to argue and prove my point against you all.

Edit 2: Sent her a text, waiting for answer. Text is saying that: 

""I just wanted the first moment to be for us, and thought that would be romantic after two months apart. It was not my intention that it would be like this, and Im sorry/apologizing for that. Im sad that you interpreted my attempt at being romantic as a controlling gesture. I guess I was just  swept by surprise by the request from cousin and that just more and more people we added.

I want you to be happy, so I'm notifiyng the others that I will pick them up on monday.

Maybe this is just an issue of lack of communications, and that I have a feeling of lonliness.

Love you.""

What should I know/consider?,pennakyp,sex,https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/227kk2/had_sex_with_a_roommate_last_night_what_should_i/,"I just moved into a new place.  There's a woman living here (she's 27, I'm 28) and we're both new to the place.  She's just doing an internship and will be here for 7 weeks.

I could tell there was some attraction on both sides but I was always one to think ""That's a roommate and therefor off limits.  No matter how cute"".

We went to a party and danced a little bit with each other here and there but nothing too serious.  I saw other guys hitting on her and was curious if she'd go home with one of them.  I was flirting with many other girls at the party.

Finally, time came to leave the party.  Walked the short walk back home.  Were chilling in the kitchen.  Both pretty drunk.  Just chilling for a while, having water.  Then she comes up quickly to make out with me.  Didn't really expect it but I happily obliged.  It was excellent.

After much making out, we go to her room.  I'm not going to pretend it was all her leading.  I was definitely trying to get to that bedroom.

Finally, after much excellent fooling around, she's basically like ""go get that condom in your room"".  

We proceed to have excellent sex.  Some of the best I've had in a while.  She's Mexican and I'm American (this is in Mexico) and it was a sexy mix of Spanish and English spoken.  It's awesome to hear ""estas increíble"".  I've been in a pretty long dry spell and it was so so nice to have great sex.

Finally, both exhausted, I go back to my room.  She texts me in the morning.  It's all good.  We're both beat.  I make us a nice breakfast.  We chat about whether people heard or not.  We didn't touch or kiss or anything more.

But, whatever.  It was a great night.  Seems like there's no drama or expectations between us.  Perhaps it was just a one night thing or perhaps it'll be one of many (hope so).

So, curious to get others' perspectives.  Anything to look out for or manage?  Any advice with a situation like this?

I'm guessing it's the ol ""open communication + no expectations"" but I'm just curious if anyone else had other points/thoughts."
227n4w,28,2014-04-04,My better storyline for the end of Season 3 and Season 4 (S03E15 Spoilers).,Psyc3,suits,https://www.reddit.com/r/suits/comments/227n4w/my_better_storyline_for_the_end_of_season_3_and/,"Given how suits is becoming rather repetitive with Mike getting caught but never actually getting caught at the last minute and Harvey not being able to tell anyone about Mikes shit I thought I would write a better solution to how the end of S03E15 and further on should have gone (maybe it should have actually be the last in the season in my storyline). Fuck this whole Mike and Harvey are going to get jailed BS episode, spoiler alert, they aren't, Harvey can't be the go to advert for Tom Ford suits if he has to wear a boiler suit in prison, well unless they are bring out a new range, that really would be quite the twist. 

My storyline goes something like this:

Mike leaves and joins the Investment Bank (a la the end of S03E15 doesn't happen), Harvey is sad, however considering Harvey is supposed to be a closer of situations, Mike working at an Investment Bank means he is brought in as an outside consultant to work with Mike and their company, Harvey as a closer, and Louis as a Financial law expert, rather than his current role as a whining baby (no offence to Rick Hoffman he does a great job acting, just his character acts like a little bitch half the time). However, he still gets to be his whiney self because he doesn't want to work with Mike as he believes him to be unworthy and disloyal for leaving the Law and Pearson Specter, but Jessica makes him because of the money for the firm. Several episodes involve cases working with the investment bank fleshing out characters there and the such in the classic suits style, with banter between the Investment Bankers and the Lawyers who while they have mutual respect for each other they both believe theirs is the better profession all while Louis gives Mike shit for leaving at any chance he gets. 

Louis then finds out the investment banking company is embezzling money from its clients (or some other dodgy dealings such as working with drug barons, people trafficking, blood diamonds, purposing crashing pension funds etc.) over the course of season 4 and thinks Mike is in on it with the rest of the investment bankers (due to him no longer trusting his loyalty and not respecting him), he at some point confronts Mike (maybe he finds out at the mid-season finale and confronts Mike the first episode of the second half), at first he doesn't believe he isn't in on it but then he comes around when Mike, due to his inside connections, finds they have made Pearson Specter complicit in the crimes and agrees to help take them down, which would link in to one of the story line from the start of season 4.

Harvey (with his experience in the Justice department), Louis (as a financial law expert) and Mike (as the inside man) then take down the Investment Banking company due to their dodgy deals and trying to make Pearson Specter complicit in the crimes, this leads Mike to go back to the law with Harvey at the end of season 4 and to get his name hacked into the Bar Database which is how the season ends with Mike placing his bar certificate on Harveys desk and walking out of his office all cool and collected, with a cheeky little smile on Harveys face.

Added extra include shitty temp interns Harvey can't stand throughout the season, or maybe taking some of the better known associates and having them work with him for an episode, each of whom aren't up to his standards, this leads to him making a trade with Louis for Katrina for a couple of episodes like Harvey did with Mike. Rachel is either at University or just helping out in the background on cases as well as being Mikes girl friend, this could include having to work for Louis as a summer associate while Katrina works with Harvey leading to tension between Rachel and Mike due to her working with Louis, all while some attractive associate at the Investment bank tries to steal Mike away. Donna and Scotty just stand around looking good like always but Harvey still can't tell Scotty his secret or why Mike really left which bugs him. Jessica is also just around doing what she does, running the place and getting pissed when people fuck with her company. 

This of course would include having a more protracted storyline than 2 episodes in a row and they couldn't write the ""Mike is about to get caught"" storyline in every other episode as there is nothing for Mike to get caught for, other than being complicit in the Investment Banking crimes (Hooray! Mike can still get caught but never actually get caught!). All the people are present and accounted for and it would actually make for something interesting to watch as Mike would have left Pearson Specter and it wouldn't be obvious he was coming back till the second half of the season as they might just be taking the show into another area of the city ""suits"" culture. Though it might be hard to make Mike seem like the bad guy or at least enough to make anyone believe he is in on it with the Investment Bankers, but adding his distancing from Rachel and friendliness to ""Investment Banker Girl"" might help this, also it isn't necessarily a problem as that is the purpose of making Louis so obviously bias against Mike for leaving Pearson Specter.

&gt;Me:""Hi, I'm Captain and that's my server.""

&gt;Intern:""Hey I'm Intern, yeah Boss said I could take a computer from downstairs.  I took this one because it seemed to be the newest one down there.  I know it's a server but 
I figured I could dual-boot it and use Windows for my work and leave Linux on it so it can still act as a server.  I know how to do that kinda stuff. Do you need it?""

I wasn't even mad at this point.  The server had a monthly image backup.  I could restore it, but anything after the 1st of this 6th month was pretty much gone.

At this point I just felt physical pain from the stupidity and arrogance being projected towards me in the form of an unpaid intern that took a figurative shit on my excellent server while 
trying to explain that it was ok because he knows what he's doing.  

&gt;Me:""Yes.""

I didn't even let him save anything. I shut it down, disassembled it and brought it back to my office to fix.

Intercom buzzes:

&gt;Boss:""Captain, how long is it going to take to fix the office server?""

&gt;Me:""I have an image backup of the server, I can restore it, but we may lose a couple of weeks worth of work...""

I wanted to tell him he's an asshat for letting the kid take my server. I wanted to tell him the intern is an anally regurgitated seminal fluid bubble.

But i didn't.

&gt;Me:""...depending on how much damage he did could be a day, maybe more.""

&gt;Boss:""Well that's not good.  Ok, see what you can do, but in the meantime could you get Intern a computer from the basement that he *can* use?""

Oh yes....yes I can.

&gt;Me:""Sure thing.""

I went to the basement. 

The Boss doesn't like to buy anything new no matter how bad we need it, and he never throws anything out.

The row of dead or outdated comps were labeled as such.  

""Dead"" or ""Old"" were the labels on the top.

The oldest, slowest one I could find was going to be his, but which one?

Then I saw it.  

A PowerMac G4 Desktop....and the ridiculously 90's cool spacey-looking monitor that it came with.

This. This will become his.

The look on his face when I brought it upstairs was priceless.

&gt;Me:""Here's your new computer, only one we got that still works I'm afraid.""

&gt;Intern:""Really?""

Big smile on my face.  Dat Monitor.

&gt;Me:""Yup!""

You don't mess with a man's server, you just don't.

I am 21 year old guy in college &amp; I've been out for around 3 years now. 
My parents are super Christian &amp; when I came out, they said 'it was one of the worst things a parent could hear'. They found out I was gay when they saw me kissing my boyfriend at the time &amp; then they wouldn't let me spend any time with him, wouldn't let me ride in the same car with him, &amp; decided to set up counseling to 'fix the problem'. We eventually broke up because he couldn't deal with my parents any longer after we had tried to hide our relationship.

Fast forward to today -
I'm in college &amp; I've been with my boyfriend for a year or so. We met when I lost my iPod &amp; he returned it. He's the greatest thing that's happened to me &amp; he just makes life good. I plan on getting married to this kid someday &amp; we've even talked about it once or twice. He graduated college this year &amp; is currently looking for work in my home city. In the summers, I usually go back home to work internships &amp; this year I landed another fairly decent internship. I was planning on getting an apartment with him for the summer &amp; living together. After a long time, I found an apartment that would work, so I called home to see if this would work. Then they told me if he was to move in with me for the summer, they would take away my car &amp; sell it, therefore eliminating transportation to the job. They said to either live on your own &amp; keep the car or come back &amp; live with them for the summer. I don't know what to do. I don't think I could live with them for summer knowing that they don't support us &amp; are basically trying to split us apart. And living on my own can get quite expensive, as well as being away from my other half. If you have any ideas or suggestions please let me know, because I'm simply all out of ideas.

While this can be a good thing in that it motivates me to do better in school, it's also very stressful at the same time. For example, whenever I see one of my classmates studying for a quiz or an exam I have coming up, I will start studying myself to make sure that nobody does better than I do. Another example would be me trying to one-up my roommate by trying to get a summer internship before he does.

I hate this. I hate this because I always want to be the best, and when I'm not, I feel like shit. I wish I were able to feel happy for those that achieve something good in their lives; instead I just feel jealously and dissapointed that I didn't do better. I don't consider myself a jerk, because I do ""congratulate"" people on their accomplishments but deep down inside I feel terrible.

I would say I'm at advanced level, but I don't think I'll find Python related work here in Eastern Europe easily so I'm not getting my hopes high.  
 
However I did a bit of research and Python freelancing seems to be a thing, I don't really expect it to pay the bills at the beginning, but it seems like it would be a good place to develop skills and get some money on the side.

So far I haven't dabbled in scientific Python, which is apparently what all of the fuss is about. Though during the past few years on my spare time I did play around with:  
**Qt**(via PySide), which I do enjoy despite people saying it's not the best thing for gui development .  
**Django**, which is a bit complicated but I can see the use for it and it does look like a really awesome tool, but I've never bothered invest time in html/css so my results were bare-bones to say the least.  
**Regex** - I was always avoiding it because it looks scary, but recently I gave it a go and it was surprisingly fun. Still can't form complicated expressions but I try to incorporate them whenever I can.  
**Scrapping** - my newest activity, which I do enjoy quite a bit and was thinking to buy ""[Getting started with Beautiful Soup](http://www.packtpub.com/getting-started-with-beautiful-soup/book)"" though the price seems to be rather steep for an e-book(12gbp), so I'm on the edge.

Now I have a lot of free time, so I would like to develop my Python further. I know that the best way to learn would be actually making something and I do, but some guidance definitely makes things go smother and faster. So I am looking some books or other resources that would help me develop Python skills that would help me get out there into the real world. Finding an **unpaid** IT/programming internship is extremely hard, finding python related internship is completely impossible.

I've been lurking this subreddit for quite a while now and it looks like we have a lot of skilled and smart people here so any suggestions, comments and feedback would be highly appreciated!

I recently got my PhD in CS (Data Mining, Data Visualization, Image Processing and some Big Data).
I was offered a Postdoc position at a research institute in Brazil, but I've been wanting to immigrate to Canada for the last 6 years or so.

The only reason I still have not applied is I lack the ""work experience"".
I have 6 years of full-time experience (R&amp;D, programming, data mining), but it was a internship sponsored by a scholarship program, and it seems to not be ""valid"" work experience for immigration purposes.
I have ""working"" experience in English, and an intermediate level in French (just a little bellow Quebec's requirements).
I was interested in living in Manitoba, but the local process requires me to know someone from there, which I don't.
I have no fear of living up in the north if there is a faster/safer way to move to Canada.

Soon I'll have my Italian citizenship (I believe less than a year), and I'll be able to move to Europe, but I'm not sure where I would be able to get a STEM work there (I've read they don't hire easily if you have no local work experience). I would probably live in GB, Portugal or France, as I can speak their languages, but I would love to learn any other language if it would help me to get a job.

Lastly, there is the US.
Frankly speaking, the US seems like an awesome country to live once you have a decent job and is debt-free, but I just can't find a way to move there.
They seem to be hiring STEMs, but only those with an american PhD, so I'm not sure how to apply or become hire-able for the US market without being in the US.

So, I probably failed in trying to be brief.
Sorry about that.
I would like the hear your suggestions, there are some of you who know quite a lot about immigration possibilities for those countries, and I would really like to learn about it :)"

Is there any place I should be looking into in particular? The best option I have seen so far is the Value Place weekly hotel at $229 a week.

It's hard to find an apartment that will give a three month rental, but I don't know if I'm overlooking some of the better locations.

Any help you could provide would be very much appreciated. I have never been to Huntsville, but I'm very excited to meet some of you and check out Alabama.

**EDIT**: Thanks so much everyone! I've appreciated the replies and offers to rent a room. I have found a place. Thanks for being so hospitable, r/HuntsvilleAlabama. I'm sure there are going to be many interns like me still looking for places, so maybe they could post in this thread looking for offers? 

Thanks again, everyone!"
2282sj,162,2014-04-04,Please fix my biological hazard,paperhurts,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/2282sj/please_fix_my_biological_hazard/,"Right now I'm working more as a PMP and DB admin than actual, strict tech support, but this is a story from back in the day working as an intern at a local computer repair shop while getting my undergraduate CS degree.

The shop was small, run by an owner whose computer experience wasn't enough to realize that he should never, EVER touch a computer. I could write about his derps for days, oh the things we had to fix that he broke...anyway, we were located in a small strip mall in the western part of the state, right down the road from a buffalo farm (oh the smells). This was around 2000-2002 for reference. We had three employees counting me - a computer/printer guy (think classic *nix dude, beard, tall, suspenders, kinda anti-social, who describes his apartment as ""lampless, because my computer is the only light I need"" - guy was scary brilliant and hilarious and I learned more from him in one summer than I did in a year at my private college, but I digress...), a network guy (my roommate at the time, and we had recently started a home networking/itty bitty local ISP out of our house), and me - their gal friday, who did a little bit of everything (except printers - nope nope nope) but mostly web design and networking stuff.

Our typical clientelle involved a lot of students and professors from the area (quite a few colleges were local), some local small businesses, and mostly involved a lot of ""remove pornography/virus, rescue files"" and trying to convince people to upgrade from windows 3. Oh, deltree, how I miss thee.

Anyway, one day a woman brings in a computer, and *nix guy is being really fiddly with some laptop, and CluelessOwner was busy doing ""accounting"" (aka, corrupting the lovely quickbooks I set up for him) so I go out to explain our pricing to her. It was tiered, depending on multiple factors. You paid more if you had ME on your machine (the 1 hour diagnostic for ME cost more than paying us to put a fresh win2000 on it). You paid more if it was a Compaq laptop. That sort of thing. People never blinked at how seemingly arbitrary it was, but who knows.

So I ask her what seems to be the problem and she tells me her computer just won't start - push the power button, and nada. I ask her if it makes any noise, and she claims no. OK, maybe a bad connection, who knows, I'll figure it out once I open it up. She informs me that it's heavy, so can I please get it from the car for her because she almost dropped it loading it in to bring to us. So I head out to the car to get it and she opens her trunk and inside is...a square-shaped black trash bag. OK...so she wrapped her computer in a trash bag. I carry it in through to the back (almost dropping it myself it's so damn slippery) and set it down on one of the tables. I pull the bag off just enough to see it's a relatively new looking dell, and go out to take her diagnostic fee (standard, $75).

She leaves, and I head back to hook it up and see what's going on. I pull the bag off and notice...something is off. Something is just...not right. And then it starts. The sneezing. I can't stop myself, and the next thing I know my asthma is acting up, and then the smell hits me and I'm wondering WTFITY is going on here. Everyone else starts coughing and sneezing and we're all WTFing at each other.  I turn the machine around and see...black fuzz coming out of every hole in the rear of the machine.

The entire computer. MOLD. Just...it was full of MOLD. Horrible, terrible, possibly deadly mold - we had to quickly carry the thing outside and open all the doors and put fans on in the hopes of getting the stink out of the office.

As soon as we've put it outside I call her and leave a message informing her that her computer is a biological hazard, and she has 24 hours to pick it up before we take it to the dump.

She called back (after hours) and left a message saying that's fine, go ahead, and asking if we had any ""sales"" going on since she really needed a computer for work. Uh...not for you, you almost killed us all.

**TL;DR - nice lady brought in computer for repair, it was full of BLACK DEATH and almost killed us all.**

2287qd,2,2014-04-04,Trying to figure out if I have a hope of getting a mortgage or not,UberNils,RealEstate,https://www.reddit.com/r/RealEstate/comments/2287qd/trying_to_figure_out_if_i_have_a_hope_of_getting/,"My wife and I are trying to buy our first home. We're renting an apartment right now, but are hoping to transition to ownership. The chief problem we're running into right now is dealing with mortgage underwriters and figuring out whether or not we can realistically get approved. Let me run down some of the details in a nutshell:

-
-my wife works full-time and is salaried
-I currently work one part time job paid hourly (averaging about 16 hours a week) and one full-time salaried internship
-my internship is ending at the end of July. I am seeking full-time employment after the internship period is over.
-I have a certified offer of full-time employment from my current part-time employer, effective as of the end date of my internship.

We've gotten different responses from a couple different mortgage companies and we're really struggling to figure out how we can make this work. The chief obstacle is our debt-to-income ratio. I have student loans that are going to kick in in November, which is adding significantly to our monthly debt load. However, by the time the student debt kicks in, I will be working full-time. Either I will find a position related to my study field, or I will work full-time at my current job. This would approximately double my current monthly income. 

One underwriter has said that the full-time employment offer is good for approval provided we close no more than 60 days before the start date. Another has said that it's not good until I am actually working the job. On top of that, I keep getting different opinions on whether my internship income can even count as part of our income or not.

I'm kinda frustrated because my student debt counts against us, but the fact that my income will  be higher by the time the student debt kicks in doesn't matter. They're combining future debts with present income, despite the fact that our situation will be significantly different once I am able to work full-time. 

Do we have a hope of getting approved anywhere, or is this just a pipe dream? Can anyone recommend a lender who might be more able/willing to take our situation into account? Our current lease runs out in July, and we were hoping to be able to close in June so we could move without having to go month-to-month, which would cost us an extra $600 a month or so. Any perspective or advice would be greatly appreciated!"

Over the past several years, I've suffered through periods of moderate to severe depression while attending college.  The past year has been the most painful and debilitating stretch of depression I've experienced.  I checked out halfway through my final semester (Spring 2013) when I became overwhelmed by suicidal thoughts.  Up to that point, no one in any of my classes had any idea of what shape I was in.  I met with a doctor off campus to seek help.  I had become so used to feeling hopeless that I thought it was normal.

After skipping classes for two weeks and seeing a doctor, I met with the dean of students to request a medical leave of absence.  With the help of my instructors, I put together a schedule by which to complete my coursework (and receive my diploma).  By the end of the Summer 2013 session, I finished all of my remaining coursework and earned my degree.  The Summer wasn't easy and there were several instances where I gave serious consideration to killing myself.

Fast forward to today and I'm sitting here in my old bedroom at my parents' house.  It's been nearly three weeks since I spoke with my now-ex-girlfriend who I'd been with for 6 years.  She has suffered through depression as well.

Looking at my life as objectively as possible, I have very little to feel down about.  I graduated with honors, I had several internships with prestigious companies in my field, I received recognition and awards for the work I did while in college but I feel overwhelmingly worthless most days.  I know that being employed would help to curb this feeling but I have had a hard time interviewing when I feel so undeserving of any of my past accomplishments.  Confidence is important but I worry that if I can't be confident in what I've done, what could possibly help?

Have any of you had similar experiences?  Have you found ways to build yourself up enough to grab the next rung?"

Started game development to have fun and pursuit a non-ending desire to create things. Found my passion while developing games in RPG Maker XP and Game Maker since age of 14. At that time, I used free content and scripts from forums and tried to make the best I could with no programming knowledge, only using the software's own event system.

Nowadays, I'm a programmer for 3 years, currently working as internship in web development.
I created a blog as a way to show my ideas and mostly, my developed games.
You can see them here: http://viniciusdevelops.azurewebsites.net/vinicius-develops-games

Some of those games were developed at Ludum Dare (Noir Game &amp; Slices of Life), Gamedev.net contest (Dinorace) and GameJolt competition as well. Also discovered that contests are a great motivation factor for starting and finishing your projects.

Currently I'm interested in C# and Unity development, gathering as much framework specific and agnostic knowledge on game development. So right know, what probably lacks me more is time and discipline.

So cheers to everyone and I hope that we can grow together in this learning path! :)"

* Me: 24M
* Her: 24F
* Let me start at the beginning. March 5 2008. I start dating a wonderful girl in high school. The most popular one. I was the loser. Stereotypical high school romance, we kissed, we hung out a lot, we talked about sex but said we wanted to save it for when we were ready. We were happy. We loved each other.
* September 2008, we start university. Things are fine and dandy until the end of December when my parents start saying they don't approve of my girlfriend. I leave. I move in with a friend for a few months. I get a great job and blow it because I don't get up in the morning, and I feel depressed. Because of this I also fail my first year, putting me on probation.
* September 2009. Things are great, I'm finally taking classes I want (computer science). My relationship with my girlfriend is great, we're talking all the time, chatting, etc.
* November 2009. I join the naval reserve. My parents hate it, and the stress it puts on us forces me to move out. Again. I move to a bachelor suite apartment. Life is crap.
* January 2010. I start becoming violent towards my girlfriend. Things are shaky, and then, one day, after a fight we had, I walk out to go and calm down. She starts to head home. It's 10 at night. She has to walk a couple blocks downtown. She gets to the bus station and pulled to the parking lot and gets raped.
* I can't believe it. I feel like it was all my fault. Like I should have been better to her, should have been there for her. I don't know what to do. I talk to her and she tells me about it, and I help her heal.
* April 2010. I move my things back to my parents' house because I'm leaving for Basic Training. I let my girlfriend use my laptop while I'm gone because hers is crap. First week, she finds some pictures I had on there that I didn't want her to find (I know, shouldn't have been looking at them in the first place. I learned). I give her a call when I can, and she lights me up. Just furious.
* She says I have until the end of basic to show that I've changed. Until then, she thinks it's okay to hang out with and go to dinner with random guys she meets that ask her out. She never goes home with them, just gets free suppers from them.
* August 2010. I come home for three days. We stay in a hotel in my home town since it's the first time we've seen each other for two months. I get a tattoo with her name in it (in Vietnamese characters (like Chinese). Her idea). I go away again for a month.
* September 2010. I'm away for more military training. She's home. She tells me she cheated on me in February with one of our ""friends"". I don't even know how to feel. I take a few moments and feel that I deserved it and tell her I'll take her back. She's surprised and says she'll show me that she'll never do that again.
* So things seem great at this point. Sure a bit shaky since the whole cheating thing, but yeah.
* 2011 to 2013 are pretty much a blur. She moved away because she failed University and her parents wouldn't understand, so she tells them she's in an internship program. I'm thinking ""Okay, we've been doing the long distance thing for a while since I've been away on ships, this'll be fine.""
* November 2013. She has some male friends over to her apartment that she's showing the city to. I don't really worry about it, don't care. I come there in early December to be with her, and she's distant as hell. I can't figure out what's wrong. Turns out one of her friends had fingered her while she was asleep, so she felt numb to any affection. 
* During my time there (until early January) we try and have sex a few times (initiated by her), but it always ends in her tears because it hurts her too much. I'm worried as hell about her, but she says she'll be ok.
* March 21 2014. She leaves to go to Disneyland with a few of her friends she made on League of Legends. I think ""Great. A nice vacation for her.""
* March 30 2014. She returns. Every time I landed from my plane trips, I'd call her. I'd let her know I landed. Her? No. I text ""Hey make sure to call me when you land!""
* Her: ""Oh I'm in customs, I'll call you on my way home""
* Me: ""Ok.""
* 3 hours later
* Me: ""Hey I hope you're okay...""
* Her: ""Yeah I'm just playing league.""
* Me: ""...oh. Well I just feel kind of pushed aside right now.""
* And I explain my feelings. She says she wants to take a break from our relationship so she can have some time to think. At this point I'm thinking ""Oh no did something happen."" so I ask one of her friends that went with her to Disneyland if I should be worried about my relationship with her. He says ""I hate to bear bad news, but maybe.""
* March 31 2014. I confront her about it. She says she doesn't have any romantic feelings for me anymore. That she has started to have feelings for one of the guys that she went to Disneyland with. I'm crushed. I basically say ""If you loved me there wouldn't be a second.""
* We break up.
* It's April 1 2014. 
* It's not an April Fool's joke. However much I wish to God it was.
* I've been trying to get over her since but it's so hard. I see her friends uploading pictures of their trip and I can't help but feel this painful pit in my stomach whenever I see her. Knowing she'll never look at me with love in her eyes again.
* She was my life.
* And now she's gone.
* I don't know what to do, what to think. I've tried breaking contact with her but every time I do I just get sucked back into the feelings I have for her.

228kqj,42,2014-04-04,Work attire for a casual tech company?,ringabell,femalefashionadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/228kqj/work_attire_for_a_casual_tech_company/,"Hi everyone! I'm a freshman computer science undergrad and I recently accepted an offer to intern at a top Silicon Valley company (pretty big, has a couple thousand employees in this particular office) this summer. I've talked to my recruiter about what type of attire would be appropriate and she said that casual attire like jeans and a t-shirt would be fine and if anything encouraged. Which seems easy enough, but ""casual"" is pretty vague.

Some information about my body type: I'm 5'6 and 135 lbs, bust-waist-hips is 36-27-37.

For reference, here's what my male CS peers typically wear: jeans (ranging from holey to nice dark denim), an American Apparel tee branded with a tech company (like Dropbox or MongoDB) they got for free, a free shirt branded with some hackathon (like MHacks or PennApps), a flannel/plaid shirt, ""nicer"" athletic shoes, casual sneakers like vans/converse. It wouldn't be too hard to mirror what my male peers wear--so long as the temperature is under 70ish degrees. I have plenty of jeans and non-boob tees.

I'm mostly concerned about what to wear when it gets warmer. Are shorts appropriate? Obviously not denim cutoffs, but what about [athletic shorts](http://media.volleyballcentral.net/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/a/d/adi.9835.049.jpg)? Or [athletic leggings](http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/img-thing?.out=jpg&amp;size=l&amp;tid=74029764)? Also, are [sleeveless shirts](http://i00.i.aliimg.com/wsphoto/v0/600685118/2012-summer-popular-women-s-slim-all-match-pleated-sleeveless-shirt-women-s-fashion-ladies-Blouses.jpg) appropriate? What about [tank tops](http://listdose.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Tank-Top1.jpg)? What about [spaghetti strap tops](http://ep.yimg.com/ay/yhst-22562677185084/women-s-spaghetti-strap-tank-top-1.jpg)? What about dresses/skirts?

I've also gotten some (ostensibly sarcastic) flak from my CS classmates for ""dressing up too much"" when wearing dresses and jewelry. And one time I wore a casual  dress like [this](http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/img-thing?.out=jpg&amp;size=l&amp;tid=78499240) (attire was ""casual"") to a career event and when I approached the recruiter he told me that they're only hiring computer science majors. Is it ridiculous that I'm paranoid about dressing too nice/feminine in fear that people won't take me seriously? Given my age I'm already going to be one of the most inexperienced interns on the company's site."

I realise this is rarely done (if at all), but I currently do not see another way to get into the role other than getting a help desk job and hoping someone notices my effort and interest in the role.
I'm after a career, not a bunch of X month contracts.

Currently doing an unpaid internship as a desktop support monkey in an enterprise environment.

To give some examples, I want to:

- Be a TA for three different classes
- Work in the admissions office due to an interest in being an admissions officer
- Compete in competitions held at my college
- Get A's in my classes and graduate with honors (a GPA of 3.75 or more)
- Find an internship for the summer (a very difficult and time-consuming process)
- Join clubs at my college related to my major
- Join clubs at my college not related to my major
- Join my college's intramural tennis league
- Read some books I haven't had time for
- Play some video games I haven't had time for
- Hang out with my friends
- Date

Sorry to post here with my problems, but I'm just having a hard time and I'm looking for advice from those who have been through this process. 

Basically... I was rejected from all (still waiting on one, but I assume it'll be reject at this point) of the schools I applied to for a master's degree in computer science. I thought I was a decent applicant with 2 software internships and a summer research position in the field I want to study, in with reference letters from two pretty well known researchers currently working in the field. The field is a bit specialized, but I figured people applying for master's will probably not be experts at this point, which I thought wouldn't put me out of the contest. My grades aren't great, I have an overall GPA of around 3.2 but in my last two and a half years I've always been around 3.7. 

I'm wondering if I should even bother trying to improve my application to try again next year. I know I have a job lined up if I don't go to grad school but I really love science and I can't see myself working a 9-5 in software for the rest of my life. My plan is to graduate this summer, but go back to school to take a couple graduate courses and possibly get a research spot, but this will delay me at least a year. I'll also write the GRE and apply to a few more schools.

So my question is, how did you motivate yourself to try again and what did you do to improve your application with the time off? 

Thanks for the help.

(This a throw-away account because I sister knows my real one)
(Forgive any grammatical errors, I wrote this on my phone.)

My now ex-boyfriend and I have one of those friendships were you just kind of fall into a relationship. It was inevitable for us to be together eventually, I remember clearly 4 years ago after his sister’s wedding reception when he was completely wasted he told me he was going to marry me, and I accepted that statement as fact; because at the time IT WAS LIKE FREAKING PROPHECY, written in stone and shit. After knowing someone and loving someone as long as we loved each other...I figured it was inevitable. 

We lasted for almost 2 whole years and it was amazing, I loved that man; I still love that man and I know you all are wondering where the raptor action is, but it’s here and it’s coming but I need you guys to see the entire story first. 

My ex took over his mom’s company about a year into our relationship and had to start traveling a lot, it wasn’t that bad because we were never the clingy type. We were always friends first, even after we became official it seemed to stay that way. About two month into his traveling I started an internship with small clothing line and that is where I met her. She was the owner’s little sister who helped out. She is amazing, and we hit it off immediately. After a month we were practically inseparable, we texted non-stop, fell asleep with each other on the phone, we went everywhere together, even grocery shopping. Overtime this tension started to built between us and it just kept building. It was confusing at first cause I’m bi and in a awesome relationship with an awesome guy and SHE IS STRAIGHT! So I just figured it was one sided, I was just sexually frustrated, and she’s a pretty girl. But after a while she wasn’t just pretty to me she became the most gorgeous thing I have ever laid my eyes on. Overtime I began getting jealous when she went on dates. I started catch her staring at me. After a while I realized all we did was flirt. Basically I was falling for a straight girl and I panicked. because I’m totally in love my freaking boyfriend right? And also ABORT THE FUCKING MISSION SHE IS YOUR STRAIGHT BEST FRIEND…..not again. 

So I put some space between us for a while, and started making my boyfriend spend more time at home, but I got really sad and my sweet, caring, attentive boyfriend realized how sad I was and because I basically talk about this girl non-stop and he knows what a great “friend” she is, he invited her over for dinner two days ago. It was hella awkward, there just so much tension between the three of us. Despite the awkwardness, the chemistry I have with her overcame the tension and despite me blowing her off for a while I lit up light the freaking sun around her. My ex became the third wheel over dinner and after she left everything just kind of shifted between my ex and I.

Yesterday he sat me down and broke up with me, not because he’s not in love with me, but because I’m not in love with him. He said watching me and her interact was like watching his sister and her husband interact( the perfect relationship). He said I was basically glowing around her. He asked me if I noticed the way she looks at me, he said her eyes “do the things that people describe in romance novels”. He said that she makes me happy in a way that he doesn't anymore, and as much as it hurts him he rather see me happy with someone else than be miserable with him, and then he left to go away to work and we haven’t spoken since.

I feel like complete shit because I do love that man; he is my soulmate but I’m not in love with him. I’m helplessly in love with her. How do I even pursue something with her? Should i even pursue something with her? I don’t even know for sure how she feels……

I just really need to talk to people who won’t judge me because everyone in my life thinks my ex and I are perfect together….but that’s all shit now.

What do I do?

229e2y,7,2014-04-05,Don't know what to do about negative EC experiences,doubtingitall,ECEProfessionals,https://www.reddit.com/r/ECEProfessionals/comments/229e2y/dont_know_what_to_do_about_negative_ec_experiences/,"Hey there, ECEC.

I am 24  years old, and I'm a university educated teacher, Primary school and EC. I have a bit of an conundrum. I only ask that you read my story with an open mind and try not to be too judgmental. I'm pretty thin skinned, and I already feel atrocious. Please try to talk to me as you would a friend or a colleague, not as someone who you can safely condescend and belittle in anonymity. I know that this sub isn't like that, but a lot of reddit is, sadly ... once bitten, twice shy.

During my internship I had a few experiences that were pretty confusing and confronting. One of the places I went to was an extremely hostile workplace - among the things that happened there, I was told: not to ever listen to one staff member who I was often rostered on with (and the third person would sometimes be a casual), to ALWAYS ask what I should do about any situation (and then criticized and when I interrupted a staff member's lunch break to ask if I should put a baby to sleep in another room since the first cot room was occupied by a screaming child); told to leave a 2 yr old girl to scream because she did not want to sleep, found the same girl wrapped so tightly in sheets she could not free her arms, covered in tears and snot, extremely red in the face; asked the group leader in my room if I was doing well on my internship, and got told ""What do you mean?"" - offered no feedback at all and the group leader acted as if I was an idiot for asking; got taken into a meeting with the district head of the preschool and told ""not to make any messes, because we will not be cleaning them up"", got a bit distressed and asked what I had done wrong, and the reply was ""Well you'd have to ask the director about that"" (so, intimidated for no reason, she didn't even know if I'd done anything wrong or not).

I don't think I did anything wrong on that internship, as six months later, I was given very good reviews at a better center.

I was pretty willing to write that experience off, as I later learned they had just had their director quit on them with no notice (and that director had been the one who had accepted an intern). I had a pretty good internship six months later and graduated.

I recently was working 3 days a week as a group leader, my first ever job. However, conditions at my job were really awkward. Although I was told the job was for 3 days, it was really only for 2 in the room I was assigned, and 1 day in another room. The other group leader very aggressively told me that I was mistaken about my contracted hours and should only work 2 days a week. She also seemed threatened by me being there at all and was very rude to me.

I was never given an induction, never told how things worked, I had to work it out on my own. The director never showed me anything, the only person who helped me was the 2IC of the room, and it wasn't her job, so I don't think she understood I got NO other support in learning how the center operated. The ""rules"" were never clear - the old group leader who I was replacing told me (she continued to work for 2 weeks during the ""transition"") that it was okay to let the 4-5 yr olds through to their room alone, but I considered that a supervision risk. So I would keep the door to the connecting bathroom closed while we were outdoors (imagine, room where I worked, connected to a bathroom, connected to the preschool room) - and I would walk the children through the room where I worked, to the bathroom, open the door for them, to check they were not walking through.

However, one day, the Other group leader told me this was not allowed since we were limiting access to the toilets. Fair enough. She did this in a very aggressive way, however. But when I told her about children walking through (which I had seen happen, they would tell the staff they were going to the toilet and then walk through to their rooms), she became very upset and walked outside to yell at the kids. 

As you can see, the ""rules"" were not consistent between staff (no one knew what the ""right"" thing to do was) and after this the situation was just left as-is, children going through to the other room unescorted. My idea of putting a latch on the preschool side was ignored.

My main problem, however, is much more than that. I could dismiss everything above as bad management - even when I sent an email to my director with my concerns and was basically ignored.

However, it seemed to me I have some more basic problems with ECEC than that. 

We had 3 people in a room of 16-20 three and four year olds. We were supposed to run indoor-outdoor play - however the outdoor space was huge. Google Earth says 40 x 28, cut into half as a triangle, which somehow comes out as 560 square meters, which seems large? We shared it with 2 other rooms, but one of those rooms went inside during the middle of the day, 9-3, and of the other room, often one person was outside. Similarly, often in the room I worked in, because of 10 min and lunch breaks, cleaning up, etc. there was only one person from our room outside. So, often, two or three people were supervising ~30 2-3 yr olds (the children in my room were turning 4 this year, but this was January). I found the supervision to be lacking (there was always a water tray, which technically takes one person to supervise per regulations - also climbing frames and a cubby house). Multiple times, I was serving lunch alone to half of the room while the other half could be 40m away on climbing frames, while the other person was inside cleaning. I eventually decided to suspend indoor/outdoor against the directors wishes, and I still wasn't secure with 1 person doing lunch while the other person supervised the entire playground with the other half or two thirds of the children. Really, that meant that the person doing lunch was occupied, and the other person was occupied dealing with ""spotfires"" (children who were fighting/needed to be directed to stop throwing blocks/tipping sand out of the sandpit/whatever), and no one was really engaging with any children.

Another thing I felt was that in the midst of sunscreen every two hours, morning tea/afternoon tea/lunch, vacuuming/mopping/bathroom cleaning/taking the food into the kitchen and putting it through the dishwasher, I didn't feel like I had any time to observe play, relationship build or help scaffold conflicts. One day I counted half an hour of actual working with children (sitting down to having sustained shared thinking, or social problem solving), rather than ""spotfire management"" or cleaning or routines *in my entire shift*. 

Often, there would be two crying children and only one of me. That was the state things were in. And even then, I was missing things, like a child hiding behind the cubby and crying, or not being able to hand out notes to parents (which the director slammed us pretty hard for).

I think a lot of this was because of the indoor/outdoor thing, too big a space available for only 3 people to manage, esp. since we didn't get any floaters for 10 min breaks or 1/2 hr lunch breaks. My last week there, I was literally unable to get free of crying children and necessary supervision to vacuum/clean the room as must be done on Tuesdays. (The main reason being that the nursery was the ""combine after 4.30pm"" space, but told us not to come over there. And myself and the other person on lates were both needed to supervise the very energetic children in the combined 3-5 group.)

But even when I ditched indoor/outdoor, I was still finding that it was an absolute mess, with no time to do what I consider the ""real work"" of an ECEC professional - scaffolding social success (teaching children how to enter play successfully, how to solve when a child won't move off the climbing frame, teaching how to take turns, talking about why saying ""You're not my best friend"" can hurt feelings and what we can do about the feelings they are having, etc.); scaffolding dramatic play; making plans for children who need more help with language or emotional regulation and enacting those plans (during internships I did instrumental language programs; I once helped a child who would have a meltdown any time she could not immediately access a toy she wanted, to be able to tolerate that situation; these are the things I find rewarding and important in ECEC); exploring the world in depth with children and having meaningful conversations about what they're thinking and feeling and doing. 

Was the place I was working just an awfully managed nightmare with too much space for too little staff? Or is this how it is in the ""real world""? How much of your day to you spend doing ""meaningful teaching"" (I mean this in a way that includes understanding free play is absolutely paramount for ECEC) rather than routines (seriously think I spent 1/2 my shift on food and sunscreen)/managing spotfire problems/running from crying child to crying child?

PS. Another reason this might have been an overwhelming situation - we had a very high needs child who had no aide or other support, so even when there was a third person in the room, they were often occupied with this particular child. "
229h5e,0,2014-04-05,She doesn't feel what she used to feel about me anymore.,GottaDoBanana,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/229h5e/she_doesnt_feel_what_she_used_to_feel_about_me/,"**Background**: 400km away. We've known each other online since August 2013. Each weekend we'd watch movies/anime/ together. I met her in real-life in October 2013 as friends. In January 2014 I said I'm developing feelings for her. I told her this just exactly a week before her trip to China for a one month internship. 

During the week before her trip, we talked so much about how we like each other, flirted a lot, about how she wanted to kiss and hug me and how I wanted to hold her close to me... etc. 

In the month, she was of course too busy and not to mention, she had crappy internet. So rarely did we ever talk and when we did, its all kisses and happy stuff.

She came back. She joined a program and that made her busy. Not once has she told me that she missed me. All my attempts to flirt or express how I like her would get shut down. I felt I was forcing it. I stopped what I was doing. I told myself perhaps she's way too busy to think of such emotions and I should give her time or let her express herself when she feels like it.

It never happened.

87 days later since she told me that she likes me, she tells me that she doesn't feel it anymore. That she right now appreciates me as her best-friend, her closest friend and that she values me more than her close 2 friends and whenever something happens, its me who she wants to tell first. I just sighed. She knew I hate the 'best friend' bullshit. She said it that she knows but that's how it is for now.

I ended it at 'Okay. Yes. Both of us have our exams coming, and life to lead. A relationship should be the final touches to a one's life, right?'. I was kind of satisfied. Thinking perhaps after she was done with her program, she'd perhaps try like me again.

A week after being like this, I started questioning myself whether she is thinking that after her program finishes, we'd get together again or she really doesn't know if, ever, we'd get together again.

I couldn't bear it. I had to ask her. Lots of silence. I had to be direct. '*Are you taking a break or are we breaking this up?*'. It was the latter. I was heartbroken because I was led to believe it was the former for almost a week, or so what I've tried to convince myself it was that case.

Supposedly, she wanted me badly to come to this festival in her city that runs from 25-26th April. I thought I would be able to hold her hands. I don't think I can this way. I told her that I don't think I can meet her this way in real-life again, and most likely never. It's too hard. 

She's someone that came into my life when I needed someone so badly to fill a gap. I didn't realize what I was doing and so I've filled it with her. Realizing I might lose her makes it extra hard.

Due to that, I thought that I must take a break from her and I need to fill that gap with different things other than her and so I have told her. She said she will respect whatever decision I make. 

My exams will finish in 21st of May. That's about 45 days from now. After my exams, I will speak to her. I don't know what to expect or to do by then. I'm really afraid I will be saying '*I'm sorry. I can't do this anymore*'. It's either that, or messaging her on WhatsApp '*9pm?*' to get online at that time to watch anime or a movie with me and we go back to how it was before I told her my feelings.

I'm torn. I don't want to lose her. I want her to be mine. FUCK. I DONT KNOW WHAT BEING 'FRIENDS' WITH HER IS. I will always have the fucking 'I like you' on the tip of my tongue. 

Should I go to that festival? It's only 400km away and I kind of want to go myself too. By the way, when we met, it was with her other 2 friends. It was really fun time. This festival, her friends will come and her friends REALLY like me and excited to see me and I'm sure it will be fun time for everyone but, deep in my heart, *it will be a living hell*. 

Should I meet her in the summer vacation? I really want to try with her again.

I think I don't mind being her friend if she will acknowledge the fact I will always like her. I told that and she said she does acknowledge it. I guess its fine? But if one day she'd tell me that there is this dude she got into a relationship with.. well, I guess that will just crush me to bits.


**TL;DR**. Met online for 3 months, met in real life for a day with her 2 girl friends (both of us, including her friends had the fun of our year that night), 3 months later or so, I confess having developed feelings for her, she says she's been feeling the same way. She goes on a trip for a month, comes back a total different person. 1 month later, she tells me that she no longer have feelings for me but she values me more than her best friends and would give anyone to have me as her friend. I'm disorientated. I tell her this is really hard on me and I want to take a break because I need to figure out how my life is without her. She says okay. I don't know what to expect nor what to do. **Any of you guys had similar situations? Taking a break? What was the outcome?**"

My sister Jan found her soul mate in Brad. Brad is forty and works a really good job, makes $100,000+ a year. Jan thinks this makes her hot shit. 

She has no formal education, but talks down to people who do. ""Oh, you had to waste years cultivating your mind? Look, I went to Italy."" 

The rest of us have been working our assess of to pay for our education. 

My sister and I used to be close, but we are now almost no contact. This was because Brad admitted that he thought I was prettier than Jan, because I am ten years younger. She has since made comments about my weight, my looks, etc. 

It has gotten to the point where I no longer care and have just responded with, ""But Brad doesn't think so."" Not the best line, but it shuts her up. 

Recently, my grandfather turned 98. Grandpa John is the best man I know. But he is not likely to make it past the next year or so. He has sold his home, given away anything he does not want to keep, and given the money to the ""younglings"" to pay off their debts. 

He paid off my $40,000 college and medical debt. I am now literally free to live my life. I was working long hours and going to school to pay for everything, but now I can focus on school. He also gave me some money to live off of. 

He paid almost $200,000 in debts for my cousins, myself, and my aunt who is very sick. When my sister heard about this, she went into a rage and drove to my grandpa's house. 

I am not sure what was said, but my grandpa told her she is no longer welcome in his presence, she is not to think she will inherit anything, and he wants to live out his last years without her around. Or so my Mother told me, though she was too upset to say more than the jist of it. 

Grandpa John refuses to answer any of her phone calls and has told my mother not to invite Jan to his 98th birthday party. 

When my grandmother was sick, Jan came to see her once. During that time she ""called dibs"" on some of my grandmother's jewelry. She said the words, ""When you die can I have..."" My grandfather asked her to leave. 

My sister has been taking out her attitude on myself and the cousins, because she feels it is unfair we are being helped and she is not. She is not in debt, she had scholarships to pay for her school and our parents helped her out. She has her ""rich and amazing"" husband. But she can't stand that someone might want to help us plebeians out when she needs a new car (her car is brand new, but she wants a better one.) 

Grandpa John has told me he wants to see me happy. Which is great, because Jan (and sometimes my parents) don't seem to give a crap. 

Sierra (my cousin) and I were invited to intern in Japan with a friend of mine. I speak almost fluent Japanese, along with most of my cousins, because we are 3rd generation. Jan is the only one who refused to learn and is furious that we sometimes speak in our native tongue just so we can have some time to ourself because she storms out. She thinks being Japanese is tacky and says she is Chinese, though she speaks only English. 

My grandfather has offered to cover all the costs of the move. I have always wanted to live in Japan for longer than the three months during the summers when I was a child. He has said he will give me my inheritance now and if I can manage to move there, he will help all he can. Sierra also got the same offer. He boyfriend is Japanese, so she wants to move there, work, and then marry him. 

My sister found out, pounded on my door at 7am, and pushed her way inside. She then yelled at me so loudly my neighbors pounded on the wall. I told her to leave. She would not. I got 20 minutes of her calling me a worthless traitor. 

I am so sick of this shit. I have been in tears. She *always* does this. My parents agreed with her and said she is the eldest, she deserves the best. I am just too sensitive. 

I am going, and this is likely going to be my last post onto reddit. I am leaving my life here behind in two weeks, with my cousin. 

I just wanted to share."

1st thing I wanna lay out there, I'd like to bring in more Mods to help delegate tasks. Ideally each of these subsets of ideas could have one or 2 dedicated mods (in the case of daily discussions, each one could have a mod) 

Reddit's message system is not the best, so I went ahead and set up a gmail account - redditjournalists@gmail.com - to help organize contacts. I'll give access to this account for all mods. We can also use this account to request AMAs and generally track any work done outside of reddit. 

I know some of you reached out about becoming mods, if you are still interested, PLEASE EMAIL redditjournalists@gmail.com and put your reddit account name in the body of the email. 

Please realize this is a real commitment. We are all busy as hell I'm sure, but if we all take on small parts of this project it might be a lot easier. 

Ok, here's the notes I got from comments: 


**Update side bar:**
	link to FAQ:
		how to get into journalism
		advice for new journalists
	resources for current journalists ?
	Journalism jobs thread - one thread to post all jobs and rule them all


**Whats trending?** - I’m hesitant to use this idea because i’m guessing it would be a lot of work and we already have a number of tools (twitter, Facebook, etc) which give us this info, but i’m open to debate if someone wants to take it on themselves 

	
**Allowing memes/jokes**
	journalism related, not “news” jokes
	“over heard in the news room” style stories 
	Headline discussions - “I’m really proud of this one” or “Anyone got ideas for…”
 


**Weekly discussions:**
	Student journalists - ""What's Happening On Campus Wednesdays” brofession
	staying organized - tech/lingo
	""Theory Thursdays"" 
	Self-post day for critique 
	favorite story of the week
	Data journalism discussions 


**Self posts/links about the state of journalism** 
Help a Journalist with (HaJ) - source requests 


**Limiting link posts!** 
I got some flack for this, but i think it might be interesting to at least try out for a week - it does stop any of us from gaining karma from posts, which could also nix some of the “this is why journalism sucks!” posts. I’ve seen other subs that don’t allow link posts and you’d be amazed at how much more goes into an individual post because of it. This might seem weird to some people, but I really think giving it a shot wouldn’t be a bad idea  


**AMAs from pros?** - both requests (can anyone get us XYZ?) and suggestions (Would anyone like an AMA from XYZ?)

**Custom theme and shoo** -  
adding flair - Freelance, Copy Editor, Producer, Associate Producer, Anchor, Photographer, Photojournalist, Intern, Magazine, Broadcast, Online Editor.
(This is a no brainer, and will probably be a 2 mod task for the first week and then get cut down to one just for long-term upkeep )


**Tagging posts as print, broadcast, web** - I can check with mods of other subs and see how we can make this a thing, not sure if totally relevant, but it might not be hard to make happen 

———
There are a lot of good ideas here and someone of them could be enforced with a heavy hand. Lets make sure we don’t do that! Lets keep this sub fun (Especially for the mods cause we’ve got other shit to stress us out) 

I’m gonna put all of these ideas in the comments below so up vote what you link and down vote what you don’t. 

I’ll leave this up over the weekend and i’ll check the redditjournalists gmail monday and start sending out mod invites "

22af8i,2,2014-04-05,Computer Science: UF or UIUC. Which should I choose?,iTwicKz,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/22af8i/computer_science_uf_or_uiuc_which_should_i_choose/,"Here is the situation I am currently in.

Out of my admitted schools, I have come down to two realistic options: University of Florida or University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. I am going into computer science, and both schools seem to have respected Computer Science programs. 


University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign:

UIUC seems like the better choice because it is ranked higher than UF (UIUC - 5th; UF - 47th) for its computer science program. It seems like an amazing school, but the only issue is that UIUC is my out-of-state option. Four years at UIUC would leave me graduating with $180,000 in debt. And i know that this a dumb reason, but the idea of going to college out-of-state is much more appealing.

University of Florida:

UF is the safer option. UF is my in-state option, only 72 miles away from my hometown. I will most likely be able to graduate from the university debt-free, as the university is giving me much better financial aid as well as Florida Bright Futures helping with payment. Unlike UIUC, I will be enrolled in the Honors College and taking residency in the Honors College Dorms. 
Both options are very appealing to me in different ways. I know that the $180,000 of debt seems extreme and absolutely insane, but I wanted to see if anyone out there would suggest a reason why this debt may seem worth it.

The factors that are most important to me are the curriculum, the internship opportunities while in school, and the career opportunities right out of college.
I know this post may seem dumb and the answer may seem obvious, but I want to get as much advise as I can before I make this decision. I most likely will only make this decision once, so I hope to make the right one.

Any and all advice is appreciated - thanks for taking the time to read this! 

**The question**: I've already been offered an internship for Summer 2015 at Deloitte doing technology services consulting. The catch is that the deadline to accept the offer is September 2014 (aka before other companies start to recruit). Should I accept the offer, or take my chances and try to intern at another company that is more prestigious / better fitting?

**My background**: I'm currently a freshman at a ""public ivy"" studying Computer Science and Economics with a minor in Applied Mathematics. I'm a good student (3.8 GPA) and will be interning this summer at a 35 person Data Analytics startup doing software Development. I basically got the Deloitte offer through being invited to the Deloitte NextGen Summer Program (4 day conference).

**Long Term Goals**: I'm a techie / coder with a interest in business and entrepreneurship. My dream is to one day run my own tech-startup or have a C-level position at an established tech company. I most likely want a MBA (80% chance), but I might decide in the future instead to get a Masters in Computer Science or Supply Chain Management (20% chance). Either way, I want to find my way into Silicon Valley doing something more than simply just coding.

**Question elaborated**: I don't know whether to take the offer or not. Deloitte is a big name, but I don't know how respected a tech-consulting position would be if I wanted work for big-name tech firm like Google later on. Also, I don't know how hands on it will be and how much soft work the internship would be. Also, I don't know how exciting it would be (compared to a tech internship which are notorious for being really fun, amazing perks, and learning a lot).

If I didn't accept the offer, I would try my best to intern at a large, competitive tech firm (Google,Microsoft,Amazon,Facebook, etc.). However, these internships are tough to get (I estimate a 50% chance of landing one at these top 4 companies) for Summer 2015. Decent chances, but not when compared to my 100% at Deloitte. Plus, I would spend a lot of time interviewing and searching during the school year for the tech internship which could get stressful. If I didn't land it at the big 4 (50% chance), any tech company I intern at won't be significantly better or different from where I am working this summer in terms of diversifying my own experience and resume. Due to my career confusions, my goal in the next 3 summers is to intern at a small company / startup, a large tech company, and a large finance/consulting corporate.

Any advice for my situation? Also, any advice for the long term? "

Got an internship in SW DC this summer, so I feel like now would be the time if ever to do it (especially since this is my last year in maryland :( *i think...*)

But I was looking at the season ticket plans, and I think it was Abe's plan that had a lot of weeknight games that i would really like, 19 games and it was $931 for the LF/RF reserved, which are pretty awesome seats.

Even though I would **love** to go to baseball games alone all the time (my friends heckle me for keeping a scorecard), every now and then its fun to go with friends. If I had one of the partial plans how hard would it be to:

1. Sell my tickets if theres a game I couldn't make it to
1. Switch my ticket for one that I bought with friends so I could sit with them?

Also is it a good deal? Looks like a good deal. Thanks in advance, **GO NATS!**

22aktw,12,2014-04-05,Me [26M] with my GF [27F] of 2 years living continents apart: Her patience is running out and she wants me there NOW which I cannot afford. Help! :(,longfaraway,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/22aktw/me_26m_with_my_gf_27f_of_2_years_living/,"Both of us are of different nationalities and we met when I was in her city for a business trip. I was there for 10 months and we got really close during this time which led to us moving in together within 5 months of meeting each other. 

Apart from the usual arguments on who gets to do the dishes (usually it's my fault), the 5 months flew past us without any major arguments or disturbances. In short, it was a true honeymoon period of 5 months. 

After this I had to return to my home and we had the ever popular long distance routine of skype calls for about 4 months after this. During this period, my debts piled up and I lost my job within a couple of months.

Things started looking good when she landed herself an internship in my hometown along with a work Visa that would allow her to stay in my country for a year. I also managed to nail a decent paying job in a mid-sized organization that would allow me to pay off my debts little by little every month. All was well when she was here but the trouble slowly started when she had to leave last November because she wanted to be closer to her niece who has some weird-ass genetic condition.

I couldn't accompany her as there is no way I could have afforded such a trip at that point of time (I was new to the job and just settling in). It's been 6 months since she left and we miss each other a lot. However, I can sense that she is getting depressed(?) since our skype sessions over the last 3-4 weeks are ending with bitter arguments over the silliest of things. Part of this is also due to the fact that she is finding it hard to land a job there in her country and the environment in her home (she had to move in with her parents) is really negative. I can understand that I have become an outlet for her frustrations and I even had a long 3 hour chat with her which ended in her feeling sorry for being too harsh on me.

She is expecting me to move in with her in her hometown. But I cannot afford the inter-continental trip right now either. She knows it but just can't seem to get this into her head. I'd totally love to move in with her but all I need is a little bit of patience from her side as I had already talked to my bosses about telecommuting from her place. They are pretty cool with it taking into account my performance over the last year. However, it would take atleast 4-5 months more for the legal stuff to be sorted out (Visas and all). Her argument is something along the lines of me loving my job here more than her and she wants me to quit and search for a job there (The job market there is bollocks and I won't be able to pay off my debts). I am finding it really hard to convince her otherwise.

I just am not able to pass the message of 'Just hang in there, girl' no matter how hard I try. She hangs up if I tell her this and just disappears for the next 36 hours. This routine is sapping each others energy and I am noticing that our skype sessions are getting shorter and shorter every day. How do I make her understand?


TL;DR: Long distance relationship where neither of us can afford to see each other for the next 4-5 months. She is frustrated and I want to give her a bear hug and say, ""Hang in there, I am coming"" :(

22any2,0,2014-04-05,Do I have any chance at getting accepted? Should I apply?,[deleted],ufl,https://www.reddit.com/r/ufl/comments/22any2/do_i_have_any_chance_at_getting_accepted_should_i/,"I'm an 11th grader aiming to study biological sciences + pre-med. I really screwed up in my first early in high school and I've been working to improve, I'm scared I might not have done enough. I still have a summer and 12th grade left.

Any help and insight is massively appreciated.

Test scores:
SAT: 2020, retaking in May aiming for at least a 2200.

ACT: Taking this summer. Based off SAT score + general abilities I can get above a 30.

AP exams: All 4's and two 3's. 5 in AP Bio which is what I'd like to study in college. Expecting similar results for future AP exams.

GPA/Grades/Classes: Weighted ~3.1. My performance in school has been continuously improving since the start of my high school career, but has increased the most rapidly and drastically during my 11th grade year. At this rate, I hope to have something AT LEAST in the mid 3s by the time I apply. I am unsure of my unweighted GPA at the moment, it is not great, however it is and has been improving. Some things to consider:

I. Grades have improved since the start of high school.

Unweighted average: Low C(9th) -&gt; Solid B(10th) -&gt; High B(first half of 11th grade)-&gt; All As (currently, 2nd half of 11th grade) -&gt; All As (expected summer and senior year)

II. I've had an extremely rigorous course-load. Every high school class I've ever taken with the exception of art and P.E. have been Honors, Pre-IB Honors, or AP. I will continue to do this for the rest of my high school career, I've mentioned below how I've signed up for 6 APs and 3 Honors classes this upcoming summer + my senior year. Because I am currently making As in similar classes, I expect to do so for the rest of my high school career.

Hopefully my rigorous course-load explains part of my low GPA as well or my drive to challenge myself

III. I've been taking extra classes (Honors and AP) online in addition to my school work-load, these have helped my GPA, I've only made As in my online classes and will continue to do so. Hopefully this reflects my desire to do more than what is necessary to achieve things, and my ability to continuously challenge myself.

IV. I've advanced very quickly. Finished 99% of my graduation requirements before I'm even a high school senior.

APs that I've taken
Biology, World History, Human Geography, Microeconomics, US History, Statistics, European History, Language and Comp, Literature and Comp

APs I'm taking this summer and in my senior year, already signed up:

Psychology, Physics, Calculus, Enviro, Latin, Gov, Maybe Computer Science and Chem if I have time

Honors classes for senior year:

Anatomy, Physiology, Marine Bio

Note: Cleared up required classes so I can take mostly science-related classes as a senior. They align with my personal interest/passion as well as career plans. Also will be a teacher's assistant for a year.

Extra curricular:

**Weaknesses:**

1. Nothing special in terms of clubs. 2yrs ModelUN + JCL, 2 yrs JCL, with no real achievements or recognition.

2. No awards except for 1st place district History Fair

3. Symphonic band and Jazz band in middle school, probably doesn't count since I quit in 8th grade.

4. Would consider being active in clubs next year but I'm going to be pretty busy with schoolwork and nothing at school really suits my interest. Will consider picking a musical instrument back up and sticking to it. Would consider getting a paid job.

**Strengths:**

200+ hours of diverse volunteering in my field of interest as of 11th grade, hoping to hit 300+ hours by the time I graduate, lots of stuff done and lots of stuff learned. Can reflect on these experiences through writing. I've been told by my teachers and guidance counselor that my dedication, hard work, and passion for what I do outside of school is well above what is standard. This might be a testament that I'm not as lazy as my GPA would suggest.

1. Volunteer every summer at a large hospital, did extra hours and was chosen specifically to make a video, Power-Point presentation, and informational packet for all incoming volunteers. From what I've heard this was pretty hard to get accepted into.

2. Volunteered at a small school clinic in a low-income county about 2 hours away, assisting elementary school aged children with health check-ups. Done one summer, 1-2 times a week for the entire day, 6am-4pm. When the clinic was slow, I went to different class rooms to help the teachers teach the kids.

3. Help with Dad's public health research projects. Both in clinical and academic settings. I love public speaking, my upcoming task for this is traveling to different institutions around the state (churches, schools, etc) delivering talks to inform people about breast cancer, why and how they should get checked, etc. Also helped with the filmography and post-production components of advertisements made regarding these topics. Learning how to write grant proposals from my dad who has pulled in millions of $ for research funding.

4. Confirmed that I will shadow a surgeon and observe surgeries as well as a non-invasive physician this summer and intern for hospital executives who run the hospitals.

5. Will be observing and participating in university level medical and health classes (not dual enrolling), to get a feel of how college classes are structured and their atmosphere. Hopefully this will be beneficial to me.

6. I tutor kids with schoolwork and SAT stuff for free.

7. No sports, although I've made great improvements on my personal health and fitness which I could possible reflect on positively as a testament to willpower and hard work and self improvement.

8. Will assist my dad in pro-bono medical help of underprivileged rural inhabitants in a third-world country sometime before the end of this year. He does this on his personal time and I want to help. Beyond the scientific stuff, I feel like this will be a humbling and informative experience on the reality of how people live, which is vastly different to how I live. Hopefully I can feel more worldly and understanding after this. I hope to reflect this in writing.

9. Took a huge responsibility with my younger brother as I've been growing up. Completely by myself, I've taught him how to read and write and do math well ahead of his school pace to put him in an advanced position, I tutor him with homework nightly, and he's now in the Gifted program at school and succeeding academically because of my guidance, parents did not assist with his learning because I did such a good job. Does this count?

I have been told that my essay writing and communication skills are a big asset, this should help in writing my application essay. I've experienced a lot of lessons in self-improvement that I could write about. I have a good background for recommendation letters given the diverse group of people I've worked with throughout my life who praise my hard work and dedication. If there's an interview, I will fare very well.

Here are some miscellaneous things that apply to me, let me know could help me if I elaborate on them. Or if they could hurt my chances. Please be honest:

* Parents are affiliated with FSU for work, although I'm not sure if this has any pull

* Good family educational and professional background, parents have MD, MPH, and PhD degrees

* Diagnosed with ADHD, prescribed Adderall near the end of 11th grade. Am able to function well and work hard without it, but it has helped slightly.

* Will pay tuition in cash. Unsure if I will stay in a dorm or if I will live off-campus.

* Male, South Asian, $250-300/year household income


Thanks, you guys are awesome. What are my strengths, weaknesses, what should I do in the future?

22arut,1,2014-04-05,"After some terrible financial decisions, I'm ready to dig myself out",[deleted],personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/22arut/after_some_terrible_financial_decisions_im_ready/,"Hey PF, long time lurker. Throwaway, for anonymity. I'm looking for some advice on my plan to dig myself out of some earlier poor financial choices. Quick background story might be useful.

After my second year in college, I went on a co-op that quickly turned into a full time job offer. Being young and incredibly foolish, I ended up with one car loan at $13k and a second car loan at $7k. I never missed any payments and had a credit score of 800+, but it seemed like there'd never be an end to the payments. I lived paycheck-to-paycheck for two years, and when I grew tired of it, I realized I had to go back to school to really have a chance of digging myself out of this mess.

I buckled down and saved every possible penny for a year, but the week classes started, I was laid off from my job. I had counted on a continued part time income when saving and budgeting, so the loss hit me hard. I wasn't able to find part-time work at anywhere near the same pay rate; my savings quickly ran dry, and I racked up $6k in credit card debt.

Fortunately, my dad loaned me $10k over the course of two years to cover my rent/school needs. The $13k car was repossessed, the other loan went into default, and the credit card account was eventually closed. I sold/pawned every single thing I owned (EVERY. THING.) to have enough for food. With a summer internship, I was able to save up enough to buy a beat-up old camaro for $1.5k. 

Since I graduated last June, I've held a full-time position making $60k salary, with $5k in bonuses last year. I'm expecting a $15k raise this June, and $10k in bonuses this year. I paid off the credit card debt and the remaining repo debt as of last December, while making minimum payments on everything else. My remaining debts:

* $7k owed to my dad, no interest
* $4k owed to different bank for older car loan (for a car I no longer had) , 0% 
*  ~$47k in 10 federal student loans, ranging from $1.2k to $9k, mostly at 6.8% 
* $4.5k perkins loans
* ~$2k in various collections for hospital bills and such
* $11k for a car that was SUPPOSED to be more reliable, bought last October, 3.5%

I wanted to be further along by now, but a lot of costly emergencies came up (e.g. $4k needed for a new engine for my car when the engine threw a rod the day after the warranty expired). 

As I currently stand, I have $486 in my checking account, and roughly bi-weekly paychecks. My expenses are:

* $550/month rent
* $45/month vet bill (dog gets a lot of ear infections)
* $65/month garage fee at work
* $100/month car insurance.
* $360/month savings
* $8/month netflix
* $150/week ""allowance"" (buy groceries, haircuts, drinks)

My top priority is repaying my dad - I'm committed to paying him $500/month, but want to squeeze in as much more as possible. My minimum payments for my debts come out to $700/month (excluding dad); I'd like to start with a snowball of an extra $1k put towards payments to my dad, and at least another $360/month to savings. After that loan's repaid, I want to quickly drop the balance of my car loan to at least $8k, as this car is incredibly high risk for throwing another rod. I'd like to trade it in for something comparable ASAP. From there, I think I may want to tackle the smallest student loans first - most of them are at 6.8%, including a $10k one.

I currently have no 401k, but want to starting making contributions (even if they're only 1%). I have no real assets, aside from my old camaro (not going to part with it - at 170,000 miles, she's only needed $500 in parts in 2 years and I do the labor).

Does this sound like a feasible/sustainable plan? Between graduation and now, I've been throwing money at things without fully planning it out.

22asgp,18,2014-04-05,Finding a job at a different location seems impossible,ribbit43,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/22asgp/finding_a_job_at_a_different_location_seems/,"I have been applying and looking for a new job in the New York area for about 1.5 years now, desperately trying to get away from the industry I am in now.  I have received a few replies, and even had a few phone interviews, but after that they lead to nothing.

I'm not even sure what my skill level is at this point, and I'm afraid I may never find a job and I'll be stuck doing simple administration forever.  

At my current job I'm officially a Linux Administrator, and I manage around 100 linux systems on two separate networks.  Most of these systems are actually workstations as I directly support developers who use and develop for Linux based applications.  I also administer the NetAPP storage for NFS shares and SMB shares.  

I also help the other Administrators (mostly windows) whenever they need it, so with those systems it's around 2000 or so including the ones not on the network I help manage.

Most of my focus tends to be on security because of the industry I'm in, so I don't get much of a chance to play with anything cloud related.

But... I manage a couple redmine/gitolite systems I set up. I previously had a mongodb/elasticsearch/rsyslog/graylog2 setup for logging purposes which I had setup to communicate over an openfire server and/or an email server I setup.  I setup puppet with the systems I manage to do basic config management and security lockdowns.  I write bash scripts on a normal basis to keep things consistent.  I have written python scripts in the past to do more complex things like scrape websites for needed downloads.  I also commit these scripts to a git repository I set up for the administrators using gitlab.  I use MDwiki to maintain documentation.  Most of this has had to be taken down recently because the security people decided they didn't like it.  

As far as certs, I have Linux+, Security+, and RHCSA (self study).

At home I use Ubuntu, on my web servers I use Debian, and at work I use Red Hat. 




What am I doing wrong?  Do I not have enough experience...  Is everything devops now, and if so, how do I convince people that I can learn fast enough.  

I'm not sure what to do at this point, and considering my boss just left for a job that is below where he was before, things are not looking good at work and I want to get out as soon as possible.  

Sorry this is all ranty, but I am so frustrated I feel like I'm having a panic attack just about every day.

edit: I should mention I've been with this company since Sep. 2009, so 4.5 years, and before this I had several internships in high school and college with 3 different companies."

I'm a female freshman studying computer science at a state university in northeastern USA. I really want to snag an internship this summer, because I think it'll really help me learn more by diving in. I haven't done much programming before college, so I'm a bit behind my peers in terms of experience. The only coding I've done is for class, plus small little side projects for fun. I know MATLAB and am currently learning Java, but I wouldn't say I've completely mastered either language. I do love programming, and I'm more than willing to work hard and learn if someone gives me the chance, but... getting that chance is really difficult.

What should I do to earn an internship this summer if I don't have much experience with coding?

22ass7,7,2014-04-05,"25, trying to get out of debt after some poor financial choices",debtthrow,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/22ass7/25_trying_to_get_out_of_debt_after_some_poor/,"Hey PF, long time lurker. Throwaway, for anonymity. I'm looking for some advice on my plan to dig myself out of some earlier poor financial choices. Quick background story might be useful.

After my second year in college, I went on a co-op that quickly turned into a full time job offer. Being young and incredibly foolish, I ended up with one car loan at $13k and a second car loan at $7k. I never missed any payments and had a credit score of 800+, but it seemed like there'd never be an end to the payments. I lived paycheck-to-paycheck for two years, and when I grew tired of it, I realized I had to go back to school to really have a chance of digging myself out of this mess.

I buckled down and saved every possible penny for a year, but the week classes started, I was laid off from my job. I had counted on a continued part time income when saving and budgeting, so the loss hit me hard. I wasn't able to find part-time work at anywhere near the same pay rate; my savings quickly ran dry, and I racked up $6k in credit card debt.

Fortunately, my dad loaned me $10k over the course of two years to cover my rent/school needs. The $13k car was repossessed, the other loan went into default, and the credit card account was eventually closed. I sold/pawned every single thing I owned (EVERY. THING.) to have enough for food. With a summer internship, I was able to save up enough to buy a beat-up old camaro for $1.5k. 

Since I graduated last June, I've held a full-time position making $60k salary, with $5k in bonuses last year. I'm expecting a $15k raise this June, and $10k in bonuses this year. I paid off the credit card debt and the remaining repo debt as of last December, while making minimum payments on everything else. My remaining debts:

* $7k owed to my dad, no interest
* $4k owed to different bank for older car loan (for a car I no longer had) , 0% 
*  ~$47k in 10 federal student loans, ranging from $1.2k to $9k, mostly at 6.8% 
* $4.5k perkins loans
* ~$2k in various collections for hospital bills and such
* $11k for a car that was SUPPOSED to be more reliable, bought last October, 3.5%

I wanted to be further along by now, but a lot of costly emergencies came up (e.g. $4k needed for a new engine for my car when the engine threw a rod the day after the warranty expired). 

As I currently stand, I have $486 in my checking account, and roughly bi-weekly paychecks. My expenses are:

* $550/month rent
* $45/month vet bill (dog gets a lot of ear infections)
* $65/month garage fee at work
* $100/month car insurance.
* $360/month savings
* $8/month netflix
* $150/week ""allowance"" (buy groceries, haircuts, drinks)

My top priority is repaying my dad - I'm committed to paying him $500/month, but want to squeeze in as much more as possible. My minimum payments for my debts come out to $700/month (excluding dad); I'd like to start with a snowball of an extra $1k put towards payments to my dad, and at least another $360/month to savings. After that loan's repaid, I want to quickly drop the balance of my car loan to at least $8k, as this car is incredibly high risk for throwing another rod and I'd like to trade it in for something comparable ASAP. From there, I think I may want to tackle the smallest student loans first - most of them are at 6.8%, including a $10k one.

I currently have no 401k, but want to starting making contributions (even if they're only 1%). I have no real assets, aside from my old camaro (not going to part with it - at 170,000 miles, she's only needed $500 in parts in 2 years and I do the labor).

Does this sound like a feasible/sustainable plan? Between graduation and now, I've been throwing money at things without fully planning it out. I sometimes go 3, almost 4 weeks without a paycheck (but I always receive two each month), so budgeting is incredibly difficult. I'm finally starting to see money left over at the end of the pay period, and I want to make sure I'm using it wisely.

TL;DR: Car dealership screwed me over. Lots of debt resulted. Hopefully not drowning in it?

22au8h,0,2014-04-05,Comprehensive introduction to networking,[deleted],networking,https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/22au8h/comprehensive_introduction_to_networking/,"I always liked computers, loved video games etc. I like managing software and tweaking all options to suit me. In college I studied IT and I loved programming. My only experiences with networking were when I needed home router configured or connecting notebook to WiFi. I had some classes in college, but honestly I didn't pay to much attention. It didn't interest me then and I was focused on programming. Now I program some small projects but I got day job as a helpdesk-kinda-thing. It's internship and they give me a lot of slack, but most of the work is with configuring routers etc. They don't expect me to do anything with it if I don't want to, but I really would like to know something about everything that is going on there.

So my question is: where can I find some really thorough guide or something that would explain the basics and more advanced stuff. I'm really having problems even with basic stuff like what are bridges and masks (the only thing that I do understand is converting decimal addresses to binary and vice versa, but it's simple mathematics)."
22awtv,1,2014-04-05,Losing motivation in Freshman year.,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/22awtv/losing_motivation_in_freshman_year/,"Hello,

I'm a freshman studying CS in Pennsylvania. This is a throwaway as my identity could be pretty obvious from reading this.

So basically, I'm losing motivation about being in college in general. My first semester was meh. I pulled a 3.0 because I wasn't nearly focused enough on school work and ended up getting involved with too many clubs and such.

 I thought this semester would be better, but its turned out to be hell. I'm taking two comp sci classes, intermediate programming and discrete math, that are going to kill my GPA, i.e., probably get C's in both of them. I don't feel like these grades are representative of my actual knowledge of the subject matter. The same instructor teaches both of these classes as I'm in a combined sort of class that links together a lot of topics from both of the classes. The instructor is generally regarded by the students here to be smart, but a pretentious douche when it comes to grading in that the majority of points he takes off are for formatting issues and white space. As an example, an entire problem of mine was not graded on a discrete math exam because the reasoning for each step did not physically line up on the paper. This was a 12 pt question on a 100 point exam. That's more than an entire letter grade for formatting. The rest of that exam and the second exam endured similar fates. 

I don't agree with the idea of criticizing the physical appearance of my solutions when they are *actually correct*. For some reason, he can't figure out why the failure rate was so high last semester.

I'm beginning to not like the program in general here. We aren't heavily recruited from the top tech companies with the exception being Microsoft. Microsoft tends to hold a fair amount of events throughout the year. Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc. are all absent. Amazon showed up to our career fair in the Fall, the supposedly biggest career fair in the country or something like that, but don't seem to be all that interested otherwise.

I'm becoming worried about my future here. The compsci prof I had last semester for our intro class was also horrid in that he talked in an incredibly monotone voice and read the lecture slides off of a projector, the slides of which were online. By the end of the semester,  I was one of the 5 people that still routinely came to class, mostly because I felt guilty if I didn't go.

I've been programming for a while. College was not my first exposure to programming. I started programming in QuickBASIC or some variant of BASIC when I was in early elementary school and have always had a love for programming and computer science in general. At this point, I'd say I'm decent enough in Python, C, C++, and other random languages that I've played with over time. I don't focus on ""learning"" specific languages anymore insofar as I can pick up the syntax of any given language (besides some FP languages) and become productive enough in a short amount of time. I love tech. I love programming. I love computer science.

I feel like to some degree I'm wasting time. I'm losing motivation rapidly and don't know what to do. Managing to keep my head above the water so that my GPA doesn't suck after this semester has prohibited me from working on fun/interesting side projects. 

I have a few internship offers on the table for this summer and am waiting a bit longer to hear back from some other companies/startups I've been talking to before I make a decision.

I wish I had gone to UMD now. I feel like there CS program is significantly better than ours. I had got accepted into better schools than where I am (i.e. UIUC, UMD), but chose the instate option to avoid crippling debt after school.

Am I being too cynical? Not dedicated enough? I hope I don't come off as attempting to blame the prof I'm dealing with right now as the root of all my issues, but I feel that to a certain extent, it can't be my fault completely... Am I in the wrong?

Another annoying problem is that I'm doing a good deal better in my other classes, such as multivariable calc and some gen eds, so I feel like I've got the ""how to study"" part worked out... 

Let me know if I can provide clarifications or if this rant didn't make any sense at all."

I'm the devoted family man with a hot, loyal wife and 4 gorgeous daughters aged 19 to 13. I've never dreamed of hurting you or the girls. I've done everything in my power to please you, to dote on our bright, vivacious girls But men are weak.

Then that girl, a young college intern, started at my office and I fell victim to her flirtation and my own male urges. One night I lied to you, a first, and said I was staying late to work. Ever my devoted wife, you came to bring me dinner. A full sirloin steak and baked potato. Arriving at the office you catch me redhanded nailing that slut on the conference room table.

She tearfully retreated and I stopped the encounter, realizing I'd made a colossal mistake. You pack me a bag and told me to stay at my brother's house until further instructed. Knowing it's my only chance, I agree.

A week later you send me a message for me to return home where you'll give me one chance to make amends.

(Without giving away the whole plot: this would involve my being shamed by my family of women, then being ""forced"" to have sex with our daughters as you prove that I was a fool for seeking Sex outside of our family)

(Also, I have significant leeway on any of these and am quite flexible as to kinks beyond the usual prohibition against blood, excretory fluids of any kind, bestiality, etc. I can see this as a one-and-done tonight or perhaps even a longer term RP.)"
22b8ie,2,2014-04-05,"About to earn my Graphic Design Certificate in a rural area (with a minor in web design), and unsure how to intelligently pursue work",wellgolly,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/22b8ie/about_to_earn_my_graphic_design_certificate_in_a/,"So here's a more specific rundown of my situation. I apologize for the length of my post! I am just so lost, I feel like I need to mention everything.

The certificate's simply from a community college, although I made the dean's list, got a scholarship, and designed the school calendars. So that's currently what I'm working with.

There's a reason I didn't go for a full degree - but trust me, you don't need to hear it, it'd just be a biography. All that's worth saying is - I can *work* hard, at least. And I can learn from that experience. I'm happy to work from the bottom, pretty much. I mention my age, because I'm a bit concerned being relatively old for such inexperience might be an issue.

Asking this just a month from graduation might sound like I've only thought about this last minute, but the truth is, I've been working on this since last fall. I finished my classes early in February to devote myself full-time on finding work, and...it's not going too well. I'd searched all over my school for any sort of guidance last semester, but all the advisers and the ""success center"" seem to be clueless as well. In fact, many of my classes were independent studies, since those courses were so rarely taken. So I don't really have any peers, either.

It's especially tricky since I live hours away from any city, and there's nobody around here that's looking for this kind of help. Hell, even for free. So I've been scouring places like Craigslist, and well - there are very few possible jobs (including internships) that would even look at someone without years of professional experience and a degree. And absolutely none of them are virtual jobs (understandably).

I'm 100% willing to move, if that's where the action is. I've saved up for years, and actually managed to get $3000 to my name! But at the moment, it's just a blind leap of faith, and that 3k is more than a year's salary to me (minimum wage and all - my scholarship went to supplies), so that's a very precious resource.

Honestly, all the work I've been doing - it feels like I've wasted so much time. I'll spend months going one direction (only this week, I've been using Internships.com), and then hit a dead-end. I'd be absolutely thrilled for anything, really. I don't even know how to divide my time between this and free Udacity courses. Outside of my part-time jobs, it's all my time, and I can't seem to squeeze any more hours out of my life.

And the thing is - I keep feeling like no matter how much I spend focusing on this, I'm stumbling around blindly, because I can't find any guidance on the issue. It's a bit personally important I find something before Summer, and now the clock's running out. Although even a slow lead would be great, as long as I definitely know it goes somewhere.

E: Thank you all for your comments! They've all been helpful :)
For the sake of anyone in a similar situation who may find this through Google, I should update a bit:

I wasn't *specifically* looking to freelance, although I'm certainly not opposed to the idea, and I've set myself out for work.


However, since Andrejia's post, I've dialed it down a little in the last few days.
It was mainly just unrelated work, but I also took some time to step back and re-evaluate my process. I even watched some television! Sounds mundane, but a totally meaningless hour and a half was a big deal.


Internships.com has already sent some responses, so I would recommend that site! And I am interested in taking up that tutoring offer, once I finish one of my courses. It's like all of my desires suddenly popped up the second I stopped for a breather!


So if my situation sounded familiar, it might be worth taking a look at your process. It seems I got so caught up in the stress, that it wound up being detrimental to the search. Just taking it one task at a time isn't going to doom you, and it certainly would help to avoid burn-out.

And as obvious as it may sound: all the things you might plug away at, that never produce any results - eventually you have to take it as a sign to drop that method completely, not just apply more elbow grease. Despite having seen links to it, I never would have tried 99designs on my own, because I was so caught up on what wasn't working."
22bb3z,1,2014-04-05,"My ex [22 F] left me [21 M] after 4 years because she ""wanted to find herself"". Having a hard time getting over her.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/22bb3z/my_ex_22_f_left_me_21_m_after_4_years_because_she/,"Hi. After having a bad dream last night about my ex hooking up with another guy, I've been having a rough time.

We started dating in high school, and everything was fine. But she wanted to go college out of state (she was already accepted). We talked about it and decided we wanted to try and make long distance work out as opposed to ending the relationship there. This was after about two years.

At first, it was hard to trust her because I am a jealous type and the long distance idea was scary. But over time I got used to the idea and trusted her fully. 

I would only see her during major holidays, sometimes not all of them. But I trusted her because I thought all of the waiting, all of the longing would eventually pay off when we could finally be reunited for good.

I figured that since I was working on an engineering degree, eventually I'd be able to follow her with an internship or a job. Up until recently that was a goal that I was striving for. Today I still strive to do well, but I won't go anywhere near that state.

She had just come in for Christmas and our four year anniversary, and we were happy to be together again. Everything seemed normal, there were no signs that she had made a decision in her mind to leave me (and for all I know she didn't yet). I drove her to the airport and she left for what I didn't realize was going to be the last time I'd see her (as my girlfriend).

Then early the next month, she called me and told me she wanted to take a break, and when I asked for clarification, she confirmed that it was a breakup. I asked why, and she said she wanted to find herself. I questioned her further and she said that she wanted to be able to go out and not have to worry about what I would think.

I was devastated. I was thinking about her 24/7 and even called her once simply because I wanted to hear her voice. When I went to my friends and family for counsel, they told me to do the best I could to forget about her, keep busy, and time will heal it eventually.

I got better, but I still think about her every night and when my brain is otherwise idle. I've thought about other girls because that is another option my family mentioned, but every time I imagine trying to be with somebody else, I imagine her with somebody else and I shutter. I imagine that if I date somebody, then it is ""fair game"" for her to date somebody too.

So flash forward three months from the breakup and here I am. I had a bad dream about her being with another guy, which sparked this recent emotional burst. I thought about calling her and asking for clarification about why she left me, but my friends and family advise against it, saying it is pointless to look for that answer because it won't fix anything.

But I really want to know. I want peace of mind. I don't know if asking her will give that to me. What should I do?


---   
**tl;dr**: Girlfriend of 4 years (2 long distance) left me to ""find herself"". Was unclear about why she left. Should I call her for clarification about why 3 months later?

**EDIT**
For better or worse, I've sent her a message trying to get clarification. We'll see how that goes.

**EDIT 2**
She called me immature for contacting her through a facebook message. Honestly I was just trying to give her the option to read what I had to say in a well-thought out form and to give her the option to ignore it, like Lollipop77 suggested. She called me and then she acted more civil. She told me that about 6 months before she left, guys had started to ask her out and she felt trapped. She wanted to date them, but didn't want to hurt me. She said she was lonely. She eventually decided that rather than wait for me, which to be fair was an undefined period of time before I could move out to her, she gave in and wanted to be single and date other men so she didn't have to be lonely anymore.

I feel better now. The truth she revealed is one of many scenarios that I had speculated, but it feels good to finally have heard it from her mouth. I know now that beyond a shadow of a doubt that she really has chosen other men over me. No debate. Truthfully, it did create more questions, just like toshibathetv said it would. But now I don't feel the need to ask those questions because now I can see, and really believe, that they are pointless now. But I think I made the right decision. I can compare it to learning to ride a bike. You have to fall, even though it hurts, before you learn. In this case, I had to hear her say the truth before I could accept it, even though it hurts.

Thanks for all of the help everyone. I'm not healed yet, but I think this whole set of actions ended up helping me a whole lot."

Just a quick tip (and how I defied logic and landed my internship for this summer):

Most of the big companies that use external hiring websites (indeed.com, monster, etc.) at this point probably have their interns / co-op positions filled. Continue applying, but broaden your search. I suggest trying this ***one weird trick that companies don't want you to know about*** or whatever... you get the idea.


So basically, **go to this website and look at past awardees: http://www.sbir.gov/**

These are companies that you want to target at this point. They're small, they have money, and they're often off the radar of other potential interns.


Identify a few (or a lot) of companies that interest you and research them. The company for which I am interning this summer was publishing technical papers on really cool stuff, so I took the time to read the papers and then reached out to the company to ask informed questions about their research. Whatever the company does, ask about their research, products, services, or whatever they do. Make the connection first. Be genuinely interested in what they do, then bring up a possible internship. By demonstrating interest, you have already presented yourself as a great potential intern. Just for some perspective, **a day after I made contact with the company I'm interning with they offered me a job**.

Don't give up!"

I was an idiot &amp; I never scheduled my classes well, so I took 21 credit hours this semester to graduate on time... which is the maximum amount of credits I could take w/o paying extra tuition fees.

**(Before everything got shitty):**

The 1st 3 months into my semester went ok w/ just few academic mishaps (few missing assignments/late attendance/absence). But I still kept my body healthy, and my hobbies (piano) in tune.

**(How everything is shitty now):**

And then starting couple of weeks ago (right around spring break), I've been crashing &amp; burning... I stopped turning things in on time... i became regularly late to my 1st classes of the day... then it got to a point where I just decide to not leave my apartment for some days. 

It's been a month now since I've worked out or played basketball, and piano has been the only thing that I looked forward to... but now i just recently have stopped going into the piano practice room too. 
Only thing I'm doing more is drinking.

**(Some of the shit that happened to me to make me feel so shitty):**

* Family issues

Learned over my spring break that my dad's leaving my mom this summer (worrying how my non-english-speaking Korean mother of mine will have to live by herself for indefinite years??) [*not exactly divorce apparently, but details on another section if you're interested enough to read about it]

* 21 credit-hour semester sucks ass. 

I have no time to relax. But when I do decide to relax, something inevitably doesn't get done on time.

* The post-college life scares the shit out of me. 

Couple of architecture firms are interested in me to work for them, but I still don't know if I'll get a well-paying job after graduation

* This one awesome girl doesn't like me back

Don't want to get into details here- it's just my own selfish relationship bullshit - I'm hurting b/c I desired someone. I've dealt with this before.

* Got a ""F"" in a class

Just read an e-mail from my prof &amp; learned that I failed a fucking class today, b/c I never turned anything on time which is my own damn fault.

* I really fucked myself over b/c I can barely afford to pay another tuition fee for another semester.

B/c of ^ failing that class, I won't be able to get my degree for another few months... i guess if you put it in that perspective, it's not the worst thing in the world... but fuck. I really don't have anymore money for another semester.

**(My current Rx + my history with depression):**

I've been medicated for depression for a few years now, i'm currently on Bupropion HC XL 150mg (taking 1 tablet whenever i wake up). I think I'm going to ask my psychiatrist about this in 2 days from now, so she may prescribe me heavier dosage (or prescribe me with different meds). 

I have resorted to self-harm in the past. But with counseling and sessions with my psychiatrists, I've managed fairly well to avoid doing that for a couple of years now.


______________________________________________________________________



**(Some details about my situation, ranting, &amp; venting - don't really have to read this):**

1. I don't think meds will solve everything, and I think the biggest thing is to break my awful habits (mostly consisting of being online for at least 5 hours/day &amp; lateness), &amp; to change my course of thought and stop berating myself so much... b/c i feel so damn incompetent on a lot of days now.

2. I really don't like myself right now (I can tell from not being confident next to people anymore),  I don't know what my mom will have to go through when my dad leaves her sometime this summer, and I just got an e-mail today that I will not be able to pass one of the courses to get my degree this May (it's my own damn fault; The course is called WPP393 ""Writing Proficiency Course"" - didn't turn anything on time). 

3. I had a crush on my friend and I recently learned this week that the feelings weren't mutual... I guess this event did hurt a lot at the time, but I've managed to cope with it - although... it's just that just seeing her name flattens my mood instantly.

*My dad wants to try his hand at real estate career. I respect my stereotypical, golf-loving-high-expectation-asian dad (I'd be such a better person if I had his mental fortitude, discipline, and toughness), and I know this would be good for him b/c owning &amp; working at a dry cleaning business for 12 hours a day for 6 days a week has been depressing, hot/muggy, dull, and depressing enough for so many years now.

My relationship with my reticent father is now estranged ... I know he loves me - I think - it's been years since I've uttered those sentimental words to him ... idk it'll be awkward as fuck if I say it - I think we're implying that we share a common love shared among a family. But the thing is that ... dammit... i feel as though I disappoint him so much... it got to a point where I don't talk to him anymore, b/c I just feel bad that I have not accomplished anything major in my life yet.

Apparently, the fact that my dad is leaving my mom this summer is not a divorce, but it doesn't sound like an example of a healthy relationship within a family.

One thing that I really hate is that I can't communicate with my mom &amp; dad effectively with any details and eloquence anymore; b/c my native language, Korean, has degraded into a cave-talk version of Korean... ever since I decided to assimilate myself into the American life and completely learn a new language (English, obviously) more than a decade ago.

Oh other thing... I am so ashamed to say this, but it's taken me 6 years so far just to finish my undergrad... I've failed some classes... tried to switch majors in the past... it became a mess in the end as now I am crawling my way out of an undergraduate program within 6 years.

I eventually want to be a licensed architect in U.S.... which means: 

1 // finish this goddamn bachelor's program that I'm fucking up so much. 
2 // get another degree by getting a master's degree in architecture... but i don't even know if i can get into a graduate school with my awful academic history &amp; grades for my undergrad years. 
3 // log in 5000 hours of internship (that will probably take 4 years of internship). 
4 // Pass the Architecture Registration Exam (equivalent to bar exam for lawyers)

Basically, I still have a long way to go before I can finally achieve one of my primary goals in life.

______________________________________________________________________

**TL;DR - Recently doing really shitty in college. I'm showing some obvious signs of depression. Meds will not solve everything, so I just need help to change my perspective on things before I self-destruct any further**

Thank you... just wanted to vent &amp; reflect on my life through some writing. So I honestly won't mind too much if I don't get any responses, but of course... any form support will be greatly appreciated... but you obviously don't have to say anything if you don't feel like it. &amp; I didn't realize it til i finished writing, but sorry for the excessive cursing - kind of ridiculous how many times i used the word ""shit."""

I know some of you are stuck in abusive families that are controlling and basically ruining your life. But, you have to **realize**, if you truly really want to be happy, you have to make it happen for yourself. You **cannot** sit there and just dream about this or that or keep wishing or being jealous of other people's lives. You **cannot** just accept that this is my life and reality, it is just too bad. 


I know it is not that easy as I make it sound, but let me tell you I was in your position. I was tracked on every device I had, I was blackmailed, and I was mentally/physically/verbally abused. I was told that I should be dead every single day. I was locked up in one room and my sister would escort me to class and from class, then home, making sure I do not interact with anyone. My mother even followed me to all my classes one day, just because I came home about 20 minutes late and she just thought I was up to no good flirting with boys, and etc. I was forced to wear the headscarf. The clothes I would buy that my family would not like, my parents would rip them apart in front of my face and I was constantly called a slut, rat, snake, dog, and many other words I cannot repeat. I was forced to pray and fast. I had no self-esteem and confidence. I could not even give anyone eye contact. I was thrown out of my home multiple times in the middle of the night, I was demeaned, and disrespected in every way. There was a time where one of my family members choked me and I was not able breathe for a while. There is so much more that I just cannot simply write everything here. To this day, even though I am living freely and independently, I have bad dreams about it, moments of anxiety and emotional break downs, but it is only a **phase**. The point is, yeah I was in your shoes, I wanted to kill myself, I gave up in life, but I pushed through and so can **YOU**. I promise.


Yes, it is going to suck the first time and yes I felt like shit most of the time. But, **it is all temporary**, remember that. All the emotions you are feeling right now, you have to look at yourself in the mirror and tell yourself, *this is all temporary and I will pass this stage very soon*. Just keep repeating that to yourself. Then you have to find a plan to reach your dreams. For example, if you are in high school, make sure you do good on exams, study for SAT/ACT, apply to colleges, talk to school counselors, take advantage of your resources, you cannot be lazy! If you want to go to technical/vocational schools then go there after college, if it seems like college is not for you. After high school, most college/schools provide housing, so even if it’s on loans, get it for your own life’s sake. There are a lot of scholarships/money that go to waste because people do not even apply and that is free money being thrown away. Find those opportunities and use it! **This is the only 1 life you get, do not waste it.** There is so much others can do for you by helping you, yes use the help, but also **help yourself** as well, respect yourself and respect your life. Keep researching and keep looking for opportunities for yourself, just go looking and searching. That is what I did and found myself many opportunities. **The opportunities don't come to you itself, you have to keep looking and searching, then eventually you will find them--and then take advantage of them.**  


It took me about two years to leave my home, I went through so much crap, but it happened right? So why do some of you want to kill yourself soon? Why do you want to give up on life? Just remind yourself, right now is temporary and I will find a way to get out of this. IF it is important to you, you will find a way, so put everything aside and start developing a plan right now because life is way too short. If you need help with anything, do not hesitate to message me. 


And, yes after I moved out, it sucked, I was alone, I had no family, no friends, and no one I knew. I went through emotional phases, but this is all part of growth. **You cannot simply become into a strong, independent, happy person without going through horrible and rough times.** Also, many people are very scared to be alone, do not be scared, and take that opportunity to reflect, think, read, and learn more about yourself once you are out. I had very hard times, for example, one time, I had to go get groceries in the rain, I had no transportation, and I would sometimes collapse on the ground from walking way too much with a lot of heavy groceries. It sucked, and it was painful. There was NO one there to help me. But you do not get anything in life that easily. I worked hard, very hard, I found jobs, worked 2 jobs on campus and studied too. I applied to scholarships, got help from my counselor to give me free pass for food on campus, and much more. **Take advantage of your resources and opportunities**, I cannot emphasize that enough. So, do not be afraid to be hurt at first, do not be afraid to feel alone, do not be afraid to cry, do not be afraid to collapse if you have to because after all this pain and hard times, trust me you *will* find happiness. **It is a process and let that process happen.** Sooner you realize, the more optimistic you will become. I started to realize this and whenever I had a difficult moment in my life or someone hurt me, I think to myself, this is only temporary and it will only make me better, stronger, wiser. So, I let it go, I experienced it and soon enough it was just a memory. After all this I am now living on my own, independently, working 1 highest student paying job on campus because I got a lot of experience from my ""tough"" times. I am also getting 5 internship offers for the summer, where one of them even provides housing, so I do not have to pay anything for housing. I will be able to chill, make lots of money, and have fun. There is more to come because I will never stop working hard. **If you work hard, I guarantee you, it will pay off, even if it does not seem like it currently.** I used to work like a maniac, and I would feel stupid because I would think to myself, this is going no where, but soon I realized, it went somewhere, and it happened. You have to be **patient**, I would work and study the first time I moved out because I have to support myself, I would miss out on campus activities or fun nights, but I had to work hard right now to enjoy all that soon. I did not get this all easily, I worked my ass off and now I am getting the time to enjoy myself, college life, and my life. So, I promise you, **it will happen to you that is if you let it happen**. You have to **stand up for yourself** first.  


I know it is not that easy, but the point is, just keep fighting, keep pushing through, and find yourself options. You all are way stronger than you guys will ever know. Our bodies, our minds, our inner spirit is amazingly strong, it does anything for survival and adaption, so do not be afraid to take a step in your life that you think you would never be able to. Trust me, you can, I did. I was probably the weakest person, I had a very caring type of personality, I put everyone else first, not myself. I had no idea how the world worked, but I made it happen for me. I packed my bags and I left, my family grabbed me from both of my arms, not letting me go, I was crying like I have never did before, I had mixed feelings, where I knew I loved my family so much, but THIS had to happen for my own good, even their own good. I even had to call the cops. I felt guilty, I felt horrible, I felt disgusting, but remember you only do feel some things that can be false because of the way you were raised and brainwashed. Some things just have to be done, even it seems/sounds so extreme and scary. Also, do not worry, nothing will happen to your parents if you call the cops, some people are way too scared to do that. The cops will only help you, and follow your orders. Also, please **ERASE** the brainwashed culture views that are in your head about reputation, everyone is bad, a girl is not capable of living alone, and etc. After you move out, your parents might realize, open their eyes to why this all had happened, they will realize their mistakes. There are some parents, who end up disowning their children, but that is *their loss*, they are **mistaken**. Trust me, your parents are adults, they can take care of themselves, do not worry so much about them, they will do **ANYTHING TO CONTROL YOU** even if it’s blackmailing through by saying “if you go, I will die, kill myself” etc, etc, trust me they will not do anything. **You do what you have to.** This life is way too short to be wasted. Some say, “Well, they are my parents still,” I know they are, but wait…are they really? I mean they might just be your landlord or something, providing you a home because a real parent gives love, protection, advice, and support to their child. They are there for their child and lets them grow. They see them as an individual with their own mind, desires, beliefs, interests, but some of these parents are broken people themselves and take their frustrations out on their innocent children, and these parents do not deserve to have you as their child. They do anything to control you because they might only care about their own reputation, and life, not **YOU**, **YOU as a person**. You might think, “oh, I do not want to be selfish”…but, hey look, you are not selfish, you are a normal human being with your own mind, beliefs, questions, interests, etc **THEY are selfish**. How come they do not feel bad for their actions and the way they make you feel? Why don't they ever think about you and what you are going through? Why don't they try to understand you? They are the parents, they do not deserve to have you as a child, if they can't even let you live and grow, and have your input in life, and if they can't see you as a human being with your own emotions, interests, and etc. It is wrong. They are wrong, not you. So before, you get so absorbed in this whole parents trap, think thoroughly before you do anything to yourself or think you are the problem because reality might be way different than you think. 


Like, they say *“If you ever want your soul to dance in the clouds, you will at some point have to juggle lightning and taste the thunder”*

So, be patient, but let the process begin, let it happen, and let it pass.

Also, do not forget to **love yourself**"
22c29k,2,2014-04-06,"Doubting between waiting and preparing, or take something worse",OneU,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/22c29k/doubting_between_waiting_and_preparing_or_take/,"Hello,

I’m a final year MSc student in Computer Science. I’m not american, but I want to go there and get a job. I think my CV is fine (2 Google SoCs + 1 internship this summer at a Big Four company), decent GPA but not top university. I will try to get a full-time offer, but of course that’s something not sure at all. The thing is problem solving is not my strong point (I’m not saying I’m bad, but not better than the average), so the idea of getting a full-time offer from one of the Big Four is unlikely. However, my dream is to work at, concretely, Google (but the others would be awesome as well) and I would like to give it a shot.

The thing is, if I don’t get a full-time offer after the internship, I have two options:

· I come back to my country and work for a while at a company I know to get some more real-world experience while I practice problem solving and, in a year, I apply to the Big Four and some others. This is a good option because it would be just 7 hours every day and I would have some spare time. I’m sure that although problem solving is a lot about how smart you are, there is a huge difference between having solved 50/100 problems in TopCoder and just try a few basic ones. The problem about this one is that it is not known in US, so maybe not that good for the CV.

· I perform a massive apply to, let’s say, the 50 most appealing companies where I want to work (this is, west coast). I guess most of them would be startups. It would be awesome for me to work at any cool startup as long as they offer me good conditions; but I think I would regret not having tried Google without preparing hard for it. I know getting an offer from a good startup could be even harder than from Google, but I could try at a lot of different companies here.

I would appreciate any suggestion, thank you!

EDIT: ""worse"" is not the word, but I hope you get my point."

22czkm,19,2014-04-06,"[RANT] Took ayahuasca, converted to Buddhism",[deleted],Psychonaut,https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/22czkm/rant_took_ayahuasca_converted_to_buddhism/,"I figured it would be an unwise idea to either rant about an illegal activity to any of the straight-laced people I know or under any name affiliated with my real identity. However, while it’s unlike me to even go on diatribes, there’s a nagging feeling that explaining yesterday’s events will provide some surrogate for the catharsis I sought out, so bear with me.

Yesterday, at the location where I first took LSD out in the forest, I drank a single dose of ayahuasca alone. I didn’t follow the dieta, but have tripped often enough to be confident about my ability to handle psychedelics without being arrogant and believing I possess total control. This was, in a sense, my drug endgame; I had already tried, over a span of years, most everything that struck my curiosity. My experimentation began early in order to attain a level of understanding about the nature of reality, identical to the reason why I wound up an undergraduate physics and mathematics major; I dove into psychedelics independently and, despite my share of bad trips, find them to be delightful. They offer temporary treatment to the occasionally dysfunctional states of mind affiliated with my schizoid personality: the “anxious Buddha” or self-in-exile personality, a sort of maladaptive, extreme introversion. As bizarre as it sounds, they keep my head on straight until I regress into the old patterns. In addition, despite my agnosticism and disregard for creationism, I consider myself a spiritual person, more so than the fire-and-brimstone folk in my family.

The time was opportune. Late into my senior year, I’ve cut back on my tripping and independently developed a stronger spiritual crisis associated with absolutes in thought: binging/fasting cycles, total avolition, acting out with marijuana use (and a bit of ketamine and amphetamines), and such. Yet I’m still as outwardly functional and unassuming as ever. Of course, I thought the trip would offer a renewed perspective and guide me, but what caught me unawares was the order of magnitude of the spirit molecule. If messing around with booze and Mary Jane is an order of magnitude separated from sobriety, and routine psychedelics are an order of magnitude above that, then ayahuasca is yet another order of magnitude up the scale.

I underwent the usual: nausea, an impression that gravity strengthened, and dehydration. As with all psychedelics, and especially empethogens (ecstasy and 2C-B, both of which I stopped taking after long due to the melancholy of returning to normal), my own body captivated me, which I regard as an unreal monkey-manifestation distant from my existence, depersonalized. I began to feel violently ill, and managed to stagger my way to a bathroom and lie down as my spirit detached itself from my body and mind. The next three hours were an unreal span. At first, I dry heaved for a while and felt all my negative sentiments and unconscious schizoid emotions—anger I never express or consider, a sense of great loss turn over in my viscera, but the purge didn’t pass. I spent most of the time in the fetal position, regressing to a state of infancy from which I only intellectually and physically developed. The true cure for the schizoid condition arrived, at least insofar as its effects last: that old Freudian battle scars are figments of my own emotions. “The conditions to which I had been exposed for my entire childhood—intense abuse at the hands of family who were themselves abused in a continual cycle of suffering, compounded by my sensitive nature-were not my fault. Things are ultimately okay.”

I stared into the wall at the other end of the bathroom, rocked back and forth intermittently, and made mouthing motions for a great length of time as I perceived my spirit witness the majesty of being. The cycle of life and death repeated endlessly, emergence from the womb and decay into the void, ectoplasm frothing about a throbbing ball of my spiritual energy and spreading into fractal representations of open sets and the infinite void beyond. Alternate timelines where I would rant about these visions. The best analogy I can procure is to the Fullmetal Alchemist canon of the door of alchemy, and the truth within the truth; I saw the state before life and after death. It was physically unpleasant but euphoric. The euphoria is a simple one, possibly the simplest one—the innocent joy of observing, of knowing, of understanding, of being one with the universe.

But reality called. I needed to pretend whenever anyone came to access the restroom that I was just finishing up. A child in the distance refused to stop singing “The Star-Spangled Banner,” often repeating stanzas. I remembered an errand to run at my discretion. I managed to walk a couple miles home once I could journey and spent the rest of the day occupied with the straightforward.

I decided without agency about an hour into the trip that a form of Zen Buddhism would suit me best. I don’t believe I can attain enlightenment; my attachment to self-sufficiency is far too great. I’m ultimately never going to change such an engrained pattern of thought and action, and I’m not capable of the compassion required for Tibetan Buddhism. Nevertheless, I can tame the dragon of negativity yet-unpurged and acquire purpose by taking the leap of faith and practicing Buddhism instead of pontificating on the philosophy as usual.

I’m not prepared for another psychedelic experience just yet. After my internship this summer, I’ll need to sublimate my simmering negativity. During the trip, I came up with the idea of maybe caring for a bonsai or potted plant to channel my energy and keep myself in check. Once that lasts for a while, I would love to ingest ayahuasca after a dieta somewhere I can undergo total isolation. Then, I hope to purge and be reborn. Until that moment, I’ll focus on mindfulness and the middle path.

Thank you very much for reading this. I’m happy to answer any questions below.

TL;DR: did ayahuasca in the forest, underwent a powerful spiritual experience, resolved to incorporate mindfulness as much as I can in daily life. Learned again to accept things as they are."

It has been since Sunday the 31st of March since I last ""fapped."" My goal is to finish April without doing it anymore, and I hope to break the habit. The key piece in this for me has been the strength of my resolve not to do it. When I feel my resolve is weak, it kind of scares me. Today, I really, really wanted to just when I woke up from my afternoon nap but I just laid like a stone on my bed and wouldn't budge out of fear of going back to where I was. 

From what I understand, the second and third weeks are a different stage in the process, in terms of the brain's adjustments. Should I anticipate a lot of depression or anxiety? I just want to be ready. For those of you who are past the 14 day mark, what can you tell me about this next week? Should I consider keeping my laptop out of my bedroom or doing my homework in the library?

This is really important to me because I've come at a point in my life where I have to choose if I'm in or out of the future I can have: next year will be my senior year of college and I will be taking out loans for it, and I'm looking into an internship as well. There's a lot riding on the next few months.

I've applied to about 8 jobs and I'm continuing to apply. Mostly administrative type jobs. I had an interview with one which went very well but they weren't willing to keep the position open until May. The other day, I have an impromptu phone interview about a job in my college town. The interviewer pretty much said she'd love to hire me as long as I do well in the ""real"" interview.  

The problem is that I don't want to stay in my college town, I want to move to Boston. 

Any advice on whether I should take that potential job if officially offered, or advice on job seeking, or specifically job seeking in Boston is welcome! "

22dv4e,26,2014-04-06,Does anyone else have a bad relationship with their father?,AmericanGardensBldg,AskMen,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/22dv4e/does_anyone_else_have_a_bad_relationship_with/,"I'm a junior in college right now. My dad has always wanted me to go to Medical School even though I was horrible in and didn't like chemistry and biology (nearly failed my bio class in high school). Whenever I told him that I wasn't going to be happy as a doctor he always shrugged it off and told me that you don't get a job to be happy.

By some luck I ended up getting into Med School this year and planned to graduate a year early. However, I did an internship with a dermatologist this winter break and know for certain that I don't want to go to medicine. In fact, I really like computer science and am minoring in that right now. 

At the end of winter break I told my parents that I'm not going into medicine and plan on becoming a programmer. I renegaded on my Med School offer and got a summer internship in a mid-sized tech company.

My father has never agreed on anything I did be it my friends, the college i went to (top-20 school), or my passions. He thinks anything in engineering is a bad career option and anything in medicine is the holy grail because all of his engineering friends are average joes and all of his doctor friends are rich and successful. I try to tell him that it's not the career you choose that makes you successful, but the person you are. 

We don't talk anymore. When I go home once a month (live 30 mins away) it's complete silence. He also makes passive agressive remarks to my younger brothers and sisters about how I choose not to go to Med School. Is this a normal father-son relationship?

tl;dr

* Dad wants me to become a doctor

* Don't want to become doctor. Like programming and computer science

* Get into med school year early

* Do internship with MD and realize I don't like what they do

* Renegade on med school offer and take summer internship at tech company

* Dad gets mad

* Dad doesn't talk to me anymore

* Dad makes passive aggressive remarks about me to younger brothers and sisters

* wondering if this is normal? "

22dxn2,2,2014-04-06,Question about summer classes and CS class planning,qualiaqq,utdallas,https://www.reddit.com/r/utdallas/comments/22dxn2/question_about_summer_classes_and_cs_class/,"Can I take classes during the summer that will serve as pre-reqs for classes taken in the Fall? In other words, will I be able to register a Fall class despite not currently meeting the pre-reqs? I'm under the impression they allow this type of registration. However, this plan strikes me as risky because if I have to drop one of the classes, then I'm stuck trying to fix my schedule for the fall after most people have already had their pick in registration.

Also would taking 10 hours over the full 11-week session in the summer be considered insane? Espeically if those classes are the following:

    Math 2414 - Integral Calculus
    CS 2305 - Discrete Mathematics I 
    CS 2336 - Computer Science II

I was going to spend the summer working on some software project to gain some experience and hopefully have something to show when looking for an internship in the future. However, after looking over the classes I need to take, I realized I can graduate a semester earlier if I could get these classes out of the way. This plan involves me taking 16-17 hours each regular academic session with next summer off (hopefully internship). 

Conversely, I can just take something like Linear Algebra this summer, which hopefully will leave me with enough free time to do a project. I'll graduate a semester later but each semester would be somewhat less break neck at approximately 14-15 hours. I should also point out that I don't have any of the easier humanity ""core"" classes left to take. Fall classes that I need to take look something like this (assuming the above 10 hours of summer classes are taken): 

    CS 3341, Prob &amp; Statistics in CS
    CS 3345, Algorithm Analysis &amp; Data Struc.
    CS 3340, Computer Architecture
    CS 3305, Discrete Math for Comp II

Any advice?,suffixaufnahme,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/22dznj/i_like_computer_science_but_i_dont_like_software/,"Hello, and thank you for taking the time to read my question. I graduated about a year ago with a bachelor's degree in computer science. I got really good grades and enjoyed learning what I was learning, especially the more math-like stuff such as algorithms, data structures, theory of computation, etc. But during my internships and over the past year of working in software development I've discovered that I really hate this line of work. It's not that I don't like programming per se, and I actually really liked and was good at doing programming assignments for school and on my own. But those were all done individually or in very small groups, and it's a lot harder for me when I'm working on a big project with many other people and a codebase that I can't hope to fully understand myself. I also am a bit socially awkward and have some issues with anxiety so it's tough for me to communicate with other developers/engineers and ask questions.

So I'd appreciate any advice that people with more experience in the field could give me about other career options that would better suit my strengths and weaknesses. I'm also considering going to graduate school, for CS or maybe math, so if anyone could comment on what that is like that be very much appreciated as well. Thanks again :)

I have been fapping since the past 4-5 years. I realized that it was becoming a problem in the past two years. Since then I have tired to quit. My longest streak was of 22 days. That too was a long time ago. Anyway I just relapsed and broke my 16 days streak. Now the good thing about that is attained 16 days after a long-long time. I wasnt able to make it a week before. The bad thing is that the prime reason I relapse is because I am lonely and if get a break from internship the loneliness overwhelms me and I give in. The ugly side of this is no matter how long my streak is I would always be vulnerable. 

Now why am I lonely ?
Well, ironically the reason behind that is fapping as well. Primarily because it induces acne in me.which than kills my confidence and therefore makes me anti-social.

What can be done now ?
Well I haven't slept tonight ever since I relapsed. It's 6 38 am and I dont even feel sleepy. I am waiting for the acne to arrive and preparing myself for it. I have again made a schedule and will try to stick to it.

Do any of you guys get acne after fapping ? If yes, how do you guys tackle it? Any innovate means to counter loneliness ? 

Besides that I wish all of you guys luck, I was thinking of posting here daily from now on , just to gain a little more accountability. 
I hope I make it the 90 days this time :) "

I am currently a junior and on the hunt for a summer internship but haven't had much luck with that yet, but I am no giving up. However, I do want to have a sort of back up plan. My father runs a consulting company that works closely with the government and he always asks if I would be interested working on some of the coding projects. Now my question is, if I don't end up getting an internship, would it be feasible from a hiring/professional stand point to work for him? The reason I am asking this is because if next year when I am pursuing a real job can I even put that down as experience? He runs the business by himself so he would be the only reference available and I know you never want to put family members on a resume for references.

Any input or advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks!"

I'm a high school senior who is interested in becoming an actuary. Usually, I spend my summer with a math related internship, but I didn't feel any sense of accomplishment after my second one. I wanted to try something fulfilling, like passing Exam 1/p. 

My background: I've taken AP Calculus AB and BC in my sophomore and junior year, and have gotten 5s on each. I know that getting a 5 isn't noteworthy, but I do have some level of comprehension when it comes to calculus. The few areas I would need to brush up on are probably just theorems and series. This year, I'm taking AP Statistics and feel on track for another 5. I'm also taking AP Economics (Macro+micro), but I don't think that would help me with Exam P. 

After consulting with one of the math teachers in my school, I was recommended to take Exam P. Based on the classes I have taken or am taking currently, would it be a better idea to study for Exam P or Exam FM? If I dedicate myself to consistently studying for an actuarial exam, is there a decent chance of passing? 

Thanks in advance!"

22ebty,1,2014-04-06,"""Wireless""",[deleted],talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/22ebty/wireless/,"Hey there TFTS,
long time lurker, always wanted to post, all that jazz.

I am good friends with a guy I met at a Best Buy because we were both teaching two different employees how to not read specs off of the tag of the same lap top we were both looking at buying. So ya we kind of clicked.

So my friend works IT at an office here in town, and this is the story of my first day working there after getting a position in the office.

I was there with him because I had applied and asked the guy in charge if I could basically be a non-paid intern until I started just to check out the company and what not. So I am sitting in the office with all the IT techs and they are all busy saying ""turn it off and on again"" so I took up an easy sounding ticket off my friend.

It read as follows...

""Please help. My wireless key board and mouse are not working. Also monitor does not work either.""

Sounded easy enough. I was expecting to have to install two logitech devices and plug in a monitor. **Wrong**

(I now see why /u/airz23 always looks to his faithful coffee in times of distraught)

I get to the user in question. What I saw was like a technological murder scene that haunts my dreams to this day.  This user had heard about wireless keyboards and mice and decided that a set would improve his work performance. Their solution... to buy a wireless mouse and keyboard, but throw out the actual devices and keep the wireless USB hubs that go with the computer itself because he likes the feel of the existing equipment. So he plugged them both in, and then this user realizes that the wires on their mouse and keyboard are now useless and therefore do not need to be there. (see where this is going?)

The user or should I say murderer **cut** the wires off the ends of the mouse and keyboard. After excusing myself to go punch the punching bag that IT had put in their office (now seeing why and getting looks of respect and a few bro-fists after doing so) I returned and spent about 30 minutes explaining the meaning of wireless to the murderer. I then got replacements and tossed the old (almost wanted to play taps on bag pipes to give the abused tech that perished in the line of duty a proper burial) I then had to check out this monitor issue.

My torment had not yet ended. This user had also apparently heard of HDMI cables. So they went out and bought one, plugged it into the computer, and then realized that the existing VGA cable was wired directly into their monitor. Their solution, you ask? To one again **cut** the end off the VGA and one side of the HDMI, then they twisted the wires together and then wrap them in scotch tape. I was baffled. Once again I return to the IT office and head-butted the IT punching bag. Returning to the murder scene once again I took the computer, monitor, new mouse, and new key board. I picked up the first paper pad I saw and handed it to murder. 

*Murderer*: What's this for?

*Me*: What ever you needed this computer for can be done on that.

*Murderer*: But I need a computer t---!

*Me*: To play solitair and write reports?

*Murderer*: *silence*

I then just walked out of this murder scene cubicle.

I brought the tech to the IT office and then explained to the techs what I had been up to for the past hour and a half. They made a toast to me with their coffee and said ""To Professor_Derpsalot! One of us!"" After my friend got the user working tech and told him to not alter it anymore it was quitting time. We all headed to the closest bar and the IT techs bought me a glass of the bar's best whisky to welcome me to the team.

I find myself wondering what brand of coffee /u/airz23 recommends.

**TL;DR** Tech murder scene and a punching bag."

22emvn,2,2014-04-07,Me [28 M] doing a LDR [25 F] who I have only been with for 5 days in person,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/22emvn/me_28_m_doing_a_ldr_25_f_who_i_have_only_been/,"Title is probably confusing or misleading, so let me just explain the story and sorry if its TL;DR

I'm a 28 year old male and I'm fairly experienced in relationships, I've had a couple LTRs (2 year and a 7 year), a lot of short term flings, and a whole lot of promiscuous fooling around. Right now I am in law school so I don't really have a career rolling yet, and my financial situation is crap (living off student loans).

Recently I met a girl off of okcupid who lived a few states away (1200 mile split) - I found her by responding to a reddit posting she made, and I liked what I saw on her profile so we just did some chit chat, I don't think either of us expected anything since we were so far away but we both thought we would have been a great match if we were closer. She is in the same year of law school as me so we had a lot in common.

Well it turned out that she ended up coming to my city on a trip out with some of her friends who were from my city. We decided to meet up and spend a day together, and we ended up getting along really well. Nothing really happened between us since we both knew she would simply be going home, but it was still fun. After she went home we sort of started confessing that we each really had a good time with each other and we wished we could have extended the visit. We sort of got the idea that she might be able to come out for another visit to my city during spring break, and while both of us kind of thought there might be some potential there, we just wanted to wait and see what happened.

Her visit on spring break was barely only one day, but fuck if it wasn't one of the most enjoyable days I've ever had with a girl. Prior to her visit, we had been chatting back and forth the whole time onlibe, mostly talking about our online dating woes, and we just really seemed to naturally click. We ended up hooking up that one night she was there and it was awesome.

I was sad to see her go, and she confessed that the rest of her spring break she couldn't stop thinking about me and she absolutely had to come back to my city to see if there was anything real between us - she said she needed some kind of ""closure"" and she had never felt that way about someone before.

So she ended up booking a real expensive flight only two weekends later for a few days and just like the one day, it was literally the most enjoyable weekend I've ever had with any girl (and I've been with quite a few girls). I can't quite pin why everything felt so right, it just seemed like almost every single thing about this person was what I wanted out of a relationship. And seeing her go at the end was one of the hardest things I've done. And I feel like a total fucking vagina for feeling that way because of how short of a time period that is. There was a lot of talk during the weekend about the possibility of being in an exclusive LDR and how we would do it - and it basically would boil down to another year and few months for us to finish school, and then one of us uprooting and moving whatever career aspirations we had to the others' location.

At the moment, she is much more financially stable than I am (I am doing unpaid criminal law internships while she is doing lucrative patent law which allows her to afford these plane tickets).

This entire idea scares the shit out of me though and I am not quite sure why. I have a good deal of experience with women and have never felt this way before and I am not sure if this means it is the real deal or if it is just a severe case of infatuation. I don't trust my instinct to evaluate relationship potential after only 5 days together. One of my worst fears is also going through the hardship of a LDR and then basically dictating my career choices for a girl - only to have the relationship flounder in the end and be left in a city where I have no networking contacts and no friends or family. I also absolutely hate the idea of relying on technology for communication - I am skeptical of the idea of a relationship developing without that personal contact.

On the flip side, I would hate to throw away something that I have never felt before. I feel like a stupid high school girl saying stuff like that - if I were looking at my situation through the eyes of the third person I would think I am crazy and I would say that real love takes a long time to develop. I would also say that LDRs are generally a bad idea, but perhaps the fact that we are both emotionally mature and we both have significant relationship experience means that we might be actually on to something when we evaluate how we feel about each other.

Our plan for seeing each other in the interim is really up to her ability to fly one of us to the other periodically throughout. Possibility of me landing an internship somewhere close to her for this summer.

So am I just insane for even considering? How does this look from an outsiders perspective?

tl;dr

-Met girl through weird circumstances online

-Girl lives 1200 miles away

-Girl has flown to meet me twice - total of 5 days

-Both of us feel strongly about each other

-Considering pursuing LDR with one of us eventually moving to the other after both of us graduate law school"

I don't know if this is the right subreddit for this, I'm sorry if it's not.

Me (24M) and my fiancée (24F) are thinking about living abroad as soon as we get married, so we don't have to spend with housing. Ireland seems like a good idea since we need to improve our english, we like the culture and we have friends there. Also, international experience is highly valued in our home country - I'm brazilian-portuguese but I lived all my life in Brazil - so if we decide to come back, it will add up a lot for us professionally.

Our main concerns are regarding education and employment. I'm getting my bachelor's in Economic Sciences in the middle of year. I have 1 1/2 years of work experience and almost 2 years of internships. I wonder if getting a job would be too hard. Another option would be to focus on my education - taking short courses or maybe starting a Master's. What do you think? How those things work regarding research sponsoring? Money will be tight (we are taking ~10.000 euros as an emergency fund and money to get us settled there) so we can't let things be.

My fiancée (who will be my wife by then) is still studying for her bachelor's (Computer Science) and would like to finish it in there. Since she's not an EU citizen (Portugal only grants citizenship to spouses after 3 years of marriage), will she have a harder time studying there? She will have a work and temporary residence visa, but I don't know how it works regarding her studies. She has some experience working in international companies like HSBC and AT&amp;T and her english is way better than mine. I also understand that IT workers are employed easier than other areas in Europe- am I right?

We are also amateur/semi-pro musicians (trad jazz, me: tenor guitar, banjo and ukulele she: drums and washboard) and busking and playing in pubs are an option, but we can't rely exclusively on that since our main qualifications are others.

It's a huge decision in our life, but we feel if we don't do it today, we won't do it later. Your opinions and experiencies would be very valuable for us in this moment!

1) I work for the mayor's office. I am responsible for maintenance and support of all machines in my town.

2) Have three employees: FatGamer, DumbCrazy and CrossEyed. The last 2 are interns.

3) THIS HAPPENED 15 MINUTES AGO.

------------------------------------------------------------

Most of the time we just have to reinstall some networked printer who went offline for whatever reasons, or check why there's no internet connection (usually somebody just turned off the modem 'to save power'), but sometimes whe get older machines (all desktops) with users complaining that they are slow. 

Normally we just cleanup the dust, do a virus/malware scan and/or format and reinstall, since we don't use any special software, just office/winrar. Not so often we have some spare parts like a better memory, or a faster HD, and upgrade the machine the best we can.

So this machine came to us. CrossEyed pick the ticket and proceed as usual.

Suddenly...

CrossEyed: - Boss, I think this machine came toasted.

Me: - No, the client said it was ok, just running slow. I know them, they're reliable. Check again.

CE: - Boss, the machine isn't powering on.

Me: - Did you checked if the power cable was plugged in? Because you did this once...

CE: - Yeah Boss, I checked.

Me: - Did you checked if it is 110v or 220v? On their site they have both.

CE: - Yeah.

Me: - Strange. Let me see.


I go check this poor baby, and the first I smell is that sad scent of a deep fried motherboard.

Me: - CrossEyed, come here.

CE: - 'sup?

Me: - Tell me exactly what you did.

CE: - I cleaned it up...

Me: - ...and...

CE: - ...upgraded the RAM from 512MB to 2GB...

Me: - ...and...

CE: - ...switched the power supply. 

Me: - and it was all ok? 

CE: - Well, it was a little hard to fit but I managed it. When I turned it on it smelled burned so I turned it off.


I had to show him. He did those upgrades hundred of times. 

But this time he accomplished 2 things I never saw in my life: He managed to plug a DDR2 on a DDR slot... AND plugged the power supply backwards. When it doesn't fit he does the one logical thing (on his mind) and CUT THE POWER PLUG IN ORDER TO FIT.

**TL; DR: CrossEyed intern could fit an square peg on a round hole.**

EDIT: downgraded the 512 Gb to Mb"
22fhde,334,2014-04-07,"No, I will not be attending your wedding.",[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/22fhde/no_i_will_not_be_attending_your_wedding/,"I sat on the very end of that row of cubicles with no one across from me or next to me for about a year. Yes, it was lonely. When you came in as a new intern that day in the cubicle next to me, sure I was happy at the notion of being able to actually interact with someone near me.

You were nice to me and weren't afraid to be kind to me. That was something very rare for me as a woman in engineering in the defense industry considering I was outnumbered, on average, about 40 to 1 by men. We soon became friends and I was happy to have someone I could eat lunch with or carpool to training with.

I just nodded when you told me that you were joining our boss's church. I was a closet atheist at the time but could appreciate that you were finding something that would make you happy. He became your religious mentor as well as professional mentor. It's not a relationship I would've taken on myself with a boss, but whatever makes you happy.

I gave you the benefit of the doubt when projects you were working on would end up going south. That happens a lot in our industry.

I celebrated with you when our boss gave you a full time offer and you became a salaried employee.

But I remember the walks that we would take to get some fresh air and sunshine during breaks sometimes and what you would say.

I remember the way that you pigeonholed your own mother into a role of weakness and dependence. Maybe she was just that type of woman, I thought.

I remember when you would show me every time you found a cockroach in your cube, despite the fact that you knew I was deathly afraid of them. I remember how stunned you would be when I would get angry at you for it.

I remember the way that you said that slaves in the US were ""treated like family"" and that black people made it seem worse than it was. That one stunned me, but in a way, I was used to that sort of backwards opinion in the south. I just didn't expect it from someone with your level of education. We are engineers after all. We're supposed to be educated.

I remember when you told me you used to shoot people's pet cats for fun if they annoyed you. I found this disturbing and avoided the topic. You knew that I rescued animals as a hobby, so I was puzzled as to why you would bring this up with me.

I remember when I told you about me helping to start a new animal rescue where we try to lower the killing in a shelter that kills anywhere from 50 to 100 animals every day by finding them new homes, and your response was, ""Aren't we just shooting ourselves in the foot if we don't kill them all?""

I remember when you had formal disciplinary action for disrespecting a female coworker and I pretended to support you but deep down I knew that she was probably telling the truth. I had managed to earn your respect but I saw how you treated other women.

I remember when we were at lunch one day and you told me you didn't think gay people should be allowed to get married. I remained calm that day and we agreed to disagree.

I remember when you brought Chick-Fil-A in on the day that the senator asked you to, to support ""traditional marriage"" and then bragging about it. I remember getting so angry with you that another coworker had to interject to tell you to drop the subject. Twice.

I remember when you grew closer to our boss through church and I realized that the only reason you still had that job was because you guys had a personal relationship. Everything you worked on failed, was late, or abandoned.

**This is the memory of you that stands out the most to me though:**

Since we worked in an airport managed by defense, we often had fallen soldiers come home through our airport from war. Their funeral processions started in our parking lot. The company would ask us to optionally take time off to go and pay our respects to them.

Our company had thousands of people yet no more than 100 were out there every time. I was **always** there. These men died for me. I hated those wars, but they deserved better than to be ignored by the industry profiting from their deaths.

After going several times alone, I asked you to join me. We stood out there for 30 minutes and were told they were running late. You did nothing but complain. You said you were going to have to stay late for it, and you wanted to go back inside.

I was the most liberal person in our area but I was always there. You went once and did nothing but complain.

You say you're a conservative that supports the wars but you're a damn hypocrite. You support killing but you don't care when our own men are killed. You can't even be bothered to stand on the side of the road to offer respect to the soldiers' families, soldiers from our own area that went off to fight in your wars and died.

You're a bigot and a hypocrite and when I left that job to escape that industry, I had no intention of being your friend anymore. I was your friend out of necessity and that necessity is now gone. You're exactly the type of person that embodies everything wrong with this country. Every single employee at that company that couldn't be bothered to stand there as the funeral went by was a hypocrite.

Thank you for the invitation to your wedding but I will not be attending."

*Narrative Point-of-View: The perspective from which a story is told.*

The latest chapters provide a great deal of context for ambiguities surrounding the Sage and his sons. The story of the Sage had always been told from the third person perspective by characters with limited levels of insight. With these chapters I think we can scratch off most of the supposed ""retcons"" in the series:

- [Sharigan comes from the Byakugan](http://i.imgur.com/4Lg2Msp.png)

 Kinda true; Kaguya has both, so in a sense one can be said to come from the other. Also, narrative perspective; how the hell would Kakashi know better?

- [Uzumaki are close relatives of the Senju](http://i.imgur.com/DEO3HUn.png)
 
 True-ish; I presume the Sage's brother is the progenitor of the Uzumaki &amp; Hyuuga.

- [Madara and Izuna are first to unlock the Mangekyo Sharigan.](http://i.imgur.com/msbQanK.png) 

 Debunked; the Sage says for generations, Indra's descendants have been adding to the tablet; the things Madara reads on the tablet are already insribed, presumably by someone who attains the Mangekyo before him.

- Power creep from part 1 to part 2
 
 Chilllllllll bro; part 1 focuses on ninja interns; part 2's focuses on high-flying/zombie/pedo-snake/masochistic/Kage fights.
(Just turns out the giant Madara-Hashirama statues are more literal than we initially thought).

**2.The Case for Sasuke's Rinnegan**

|The Madara Method
----
As Hagoromo explains, the Madara method involves combining Indra's and Ashura's chakra in the same vessel to bring out the Sages chakra and awaken the Rinnegan. 

Like Madara before him, Sasuke not only attains the EMS, but he's also receives a plethora of DNA/chakra from others, most notably Naruto, Ashura's current vessel. His recent interaction with Kabuto also resembles Madara's method, so it appears Sasuke is well on his way to achieving this power of the Sage:

 - [Hashirama's chakra](http://i.imgur.com/5mqJAYg.png)
 - [Hashirama's cells](http://i.imgur.com/uBYHsG9.png)
 - [Karin's chakra](http://i.imgur.com/bYkyBew.png)
 - [Karin does something to him](http://i.imgur.com/LtMU80w.jpg)
 - [Jugo's DNA](http://i.imgur.com/xD8MjNs.jpg) (which helps Kabuto gather natural energy)
 - [9tails yang chakra/Naruto's chakra](http://i.imgur.com/2zeNUjj.png)

↑ Those are all the ingredients, but there is no confirmation on the catalyst. (Near-death experience?)

**3.The Case for Naruto's Rinnegan**

|The Sage
----
Black Zetsu claims only the Sage and Madara have been able to [awaken the Rinnegan;](http://i.imgur.com/Vu5fRMh.png) the keyword being “awaken.”  Considering Naruto's close relation to the Sage's blood line, he should also have this potential. 

When Naruto houses 7/9th's of the tailed beast chakra, he’s surrounded by 9 orbs reminiscent of what we see from [Juudara/Juubito/So6P.](http://i.imgur.com/Gsk1kZF.png) Furthermore, as the Juubi senses the tailed beasts in Naruto, the scene is represented by a [Rinnegan aura](http://i.imgur.com/wmGeouA.png) that surrounds Naruto, which the [Juubi reacts to;](http://i.imgur.com/D5owr6d.png)  the strong imagery and Madara's comment suggests that on some level the Juubi is aware of the chakra Naruto possesses, and recognizes it as part of the Sage's power. 

Notice the Sage’s spirit is summoned only after Naruto gets chakra from the Yin-half 9tails, 8tails, and 1tail. The Sage opines this meeting occurs because Naruto is the reincarnation of Ashura, but if that’s the case, then Hashirama should also be able to meet the Sage, but he doesn’t [(as far as we know).](http://i.imgur.com/lOHTLzR.png) The Sage’s statement can also be interpreted as “Naruto can summon the Sage only because he’s Ashura’s reincarnation **and** he’s brought out the Sage’s chakra by combining his own with all the tailed beasts.” (For the sake of this argument, I subscribe to the latter explanation ).

[↑ Hagoromo could be hinting at an off-panel conversation he has with Madara.](http://i.imgur.com/ytEJHnu.png)


|Chakra and the Eyes
----

Like Hagoromo says, it's the combination of Indra/Ashura's chakra that awakens his own in Madara; Tobirama states that a special chakra is released in Uchiha's brains that awakens the Sharigan, but this isn't the only case where special chakra influences the user's eyes.

- [When Naruto uses Sage Mode, his eyes change.](http://i.imgur.com/o8nuuJr.png)

- [When Naruto is under the influence of the 9tails chakra.](http://i.imgur.com/09oQuEl.png) 

- [↑ Slightly using 9tails chakra](http://i.imgur.com/yAFhFc9.gif)

- [Under the influence of both.](http://i.imgur.com/JNVnSP1.png) 

- [When he subjugates the 9tails only his eye color changes.](http://i.imgur.com/bBBJ3qO.jpg) 

It just so happens that everytime Naruto's eyes undergo any change, he's using a type physical/yang energy (SM, KCM) as opposed to a mental/yin energy. It should come as no surprise if a change occurs after Naruto has the 9tails yin/spiritual energy along with chakra from the other tailed beasts.


|Physical + Spiritual Energies
----
For Naruto to awaken the Rinnegan, I believe he'll need a combination of strong physical and spiritual energies; he already has the former, and with the addition of chakra from the 9yin/8/1 tailed beast, he'll soon have the latter. The Madara method requires the user combine Indra's chakra with Ashura's to achieve the Sage's power, but if the root of Hagoromo's spiritual energy is the Juubi, then Naruto can circumvent Indra's chakra and go straight to the original source.

|Correlation Isn't Causation.
----
I'll admit this theory works on the supposition that the Sage isn't born with the Rinnegan, but awakens it after sealing the Juubi. Many believe the Sharigan is a requisite to awaken the Rinnegan, which is a perfectly logical step to infer based on the what we've seen. But the only person shown unlocking the Rinnegan since the Sage is an Uchiha; so everything we know about this phenomenon is biased toward Madara's method. What if it's not the Sharigan itself that's necessary (for Naruto/non-Uchiha), but the strong spiritual energies associated with awakening the EMS? Could the spiritual energy of the tailed beast equate to the Sharigan? Couldn't Obito seal the [Kamui'd Gedo arm](http://i.imgur.com/XM68OaN.jpg) in Naruto to achieve the [Sage’s chakra?]( http://i.imgur.com/3KJvwpw.png)  

----
**Notes &amp; Takeaways**

- I take issue with those that suggest Kishi doesn't know what he's doing and is just bullshitting as he goes along. I joke sometimes about asspulls, but that's all those are, jokes. It's far more likely that this story was complete (at least in broad strokes) before the first chapter was ever released.

- I'll take a wild guess and say Naruto and Sasuke don't have the same answer for the Sage; I'll take it further to say they'll both think they're right and it will lead to a [new conflict.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Naruto/comments/1rjqr6/cause_of_conflict_narutos_plan_vs_sasukes_plan/) You know what they say, 2 Rinnegans don't make a right.

- When the tailed beast die, their chakra's revived years later; Hagoromo and his sons undergo a similar process, in which their chakra transmigrates.

**Religious Undertones**

I'm sure most of you have picked up on some religious undertones/themes throughout the series. For instance the parallels between the 3 natural antagonist as they originally appear (Uchiha, Pain, Juubi), juxtaposed with the 3 major Japanese religions as they appear in Japanese culture (Shinto, Buddhism, and Christianity). 

It's no coincidence that Uchiha powers are named after gods of the Shintoist [creation myth;](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_mythology#Sun.2C_moon_and_sea) and their clan is reminiscent of Shinto relative to its [post-war decline.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinto#Post-war) I'm guessing the irony is intentional when Kishi uses the creation gods as the embodiment's of death and destruction. 

Even the Paths of Pain are named after Buddhism's [6 realms of rebirth.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism#Rebirth) You can also draw parallels to Christianity through the Juubi's origin and the 3 iterations of the 1 person that will save the world; the term ""savior"" and the messianic allegory are introduced in Shippuden around the Pain arc. 

[Here's a translator note that lightly touches on the Buddhist aspects.](http://i.imgur.com/eLC8urU.png)

22fn1s,64,2014-04-07,Just got laid off. Not sure what to do next.,LalienX,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/22fn1s/just_got_laid_off_not_sure_what_to_do_next/,"TL;DR version: 
New intern gets laid off because of inexperience so I need to get into a couple of projects to get some experience. 

So two weeks ago, I posted a thread about me feeling like a fraud at my new internship. And I received a lot of good advice on what to study. And after that, I hit the books like crazy, asked questions at work, went the extra mile with everything I was supposed to do. I tried my best to study the libraries and code. They even gave me some static pages to work on, and the lead graphic designer said that the pages looked good. I was friendly with everybody in the workplace and most of the peopled liked me there.

But then I walked into the office with a Red Bull in hand ready for a week of work and learning and I can't even log into my subversion, ftp account or email. At that point, I knew what was going on, but I had wondered what I did wrong. I gave them every single thing I had to offer so I wondered if I pissed off the wrong person. 

I got pulled into the accountant's office and then my boss said that it's just not going to work out with us. Apparently the company is having money issues and they didn't have the staff to train me. When I took the interview test, they thought that I was much further along. They needed somebody who could handle their complex libraries and maintain their systems. 

So they took my key card, had me empty out my desk and I walked out of the workplace with an armload of supplies and a stupefied look on my face. They tried to assuage my pain by saying that I can use them as a reference but I don't know how I can even milk that reference from only 2 weeks on the job. They also said that they'll be hiring again in the future and they'll keep my resume. But they're not going to call me again, are they? 

What do I do next? Does anybody have any projects that a developer of 8 months can sink his teeth into? I can do basic jQuery, PHP, HTML5, CSS3 and a little bit of MySQL. This is my dream and I cannot sit around feeling sorry for myself. I must get back in the game. "

TL;DR: The game is a shallow as a really pretty toddler pool.

Before I go into my criticism let me mention I have spend about 60 dollars on this game so I feel justified in being able to do this. I do enjoy playing the game for maybe 4-5 hours a week. 


The question I asked myself: 

Why is PS2 not doing as good as it could be doing?

The reasons are I feel are rooted very deeply in the game. 
Most of the comparisons I will draw will be to Planetside 1 pre mech warriors expansion. I think it was a far better in all but one aspect
which is that Planetside 2 is really pretty.

On every other issue you can really tell that the developers of PS 1 spend  a lot more time and effort then the Devs of PS2.
So here is my list of issues please criticize them as you see fit.

----------------------------------------------------------------------



-1. Lore. There are some rough wiki articles and there are supposed to be some posts to the main site. The story is very shallow and looks to me like an intern with a good English grade got told to cobble something together,and he didn't even get a full week to do it because he had to keep the cofee maker going too.
Compare this to  PS1 where lore was a big part, I remember going to the main site for the game and it had a big ""lore"" button witch led you to an official page where you could read for hours and hours and hours.


Why Lore? Lore is important to an MMO. Most don't realize it but there is a core group of players out there who study the Lore and spread it ingame. They join the outfits or guilds or corps and bring massive enthusiasm with them. They talk to their friends in game and out of it. They are walking and talking advertising machines. 
Of course they get yelled at by others that lore doesn't matter and go play Dungeons and Dragons. Or that this is an FPS not a Role Playing game.  

When lore doesn't exist then these people have no incentive to invest they time and money in this game. 

Also I need to point out here that one of the main complaints later in the development of PS1 was that the Lore was not moving on.  This tells you that the lore was very IMPORTANT. To just ignore the lore is very dangerous and makes your game weak. Its like the Immune system is missing that helps the game through tough times.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------

-2. The continents are square all square and look the same.  Of course the problem with the map goes a lot deeper then this but its the biggest symptom of the shallowness in design.

It makes me angry because it really shows that who ever was in charge didn't give a shit and just wanted to put as much stuff as possible into an 8km x 8km grid.  Then they added some fringy bits and were done. 

Lets compare the PS1 map to PS2.   PS1 17 (13 at launch) total  land masses 3 of which are home continents.  VS PS2   with 3 (continents).

For those who didn't play PS1:  In PS1 each faction had its home continent that was connected through  3 warp gates to 3 other continents.  The home continent was important as this is where you logged in and gathered your forces.
All the continents were interconnected in specific order so each faction
would have to start from home and then crawl with its way across the continents (there is one exception to this mechanic which i will get into later).  Factions would have battle lines where they clashed and it was possible to push other factions completely off of every continent but their home.

This gave PS1 a feel where yes you could loose lots of progress but you could achive something that was visible for more then a couple of hours.  Outfits would march and war on battlefronts and their achievements would sometimes be visible for days on the map.  Back then there used to be complains that somewhat tied in with the lore as there is very little tangible progress for the effort expended by individuals and groups. There is even less and arguably no measurable progress the way the game is restricting this now.

This whole side of the game is being ignored massively and a big part of why it can not hold on to customers. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------



-3. Terrible tactical design of bases. Again no depth to it. Bases are designed to be pretty and very few of them make sense.

In PS1 there used to be times where single outfits defended and held bases for hours. One of the more famous battles on my server had a single outfit holding a base for 8 hours of heavy assault. Long defenses were common and outfits prided themselves in their ability to hold territory. This was made even harder then the current system because of how resources used to work back then  where you had to truck in or airlift in trucks that supplied the bases with the energy needed to run them and spawn equipment. Every vehicle and weapon spawn took away from this energy supply.  So if you couldn't resupply your base you would loose it and so sieges became possible.  

The bases were designed so that it was possible for a small number of highly skilled players to hold of a large Zerg. Sheer numbers did not guaranty success.

In PS2 I don't remember one battle that I have participated in where bases lasted longer then one hour. Neither have i read of long battles nor seen any on the map.  I am sure some of you will be able to name a battle or two that lasted 2 hours, maybe even one that went longer.
  


-------------------------------------------------------------------



-4. Weak design in vehicles. OK you don't need me to count them all. IN the end ps2 has less vehicles then ps1.  Not only are there less of them there is less that you can do with them.  I remember there was a recent post on reddit here that complained that the Sunderer took the role of 3 vehicles in the original game. 

These things matter. They give players choice. They give you tactical depth and new ways to play the map. 
Here is just one more examples of corners being cut and the game suffers for it. 



I know that I can't expect this game to be as complicated as World of Tanks in hit registration. WoT calculates where you hit the enemy , how thick that individual armor plate hit is, what angle you hit the plate at. If you do penetrate it calculates how the round travels through the tank that was hit and what is damaged and how much its damaged.

I realize all of that is to much work with the amount of things going on in PS2 but jeez at least an attempt  at different hit zones on all the vehicles.


*******************************************************************
Grrr ok there are more symptoms to this but I think I wrote enough to make my point and illustrate why this game is having the issues it has.    I do love the PS franchise still and will continue to play a few hours here and there.

Honestly I think PS2 is a dying horse that will slowly go away.

All I can hope for is that the franchise is not destroyed and it gets picked up again by someone with the Money , patience and skill to make PS3 what this game had the potential to be and go beyond that.

22fsne,1,2014-04-07,I [22M] have been jealous of one of my best friends [20M] for years... [CAW],[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/22fsne/i_22m_have_been_jealous_of_one_of_my_best_friends/,"I guess it's normal to be jealous of someone every now and then, but I have been very jealous of my friend, who is two years younger, for years. It's not just a passing thing either, I consciously think about it at least once every few days.

Basically, we met in middle school, both did acting, and became best friends within a few years. What really gets me in what I'm about to say is that I can remember back to a time where we truly were ""equal"" in my mind-- that is, we were so alike that I didn't have anything to be jealous of. But this is how things changed over high school and college:

*  I went to a complete joke of a school for theater, which left me with no discipline or drive to ever pursue it. I became quite average and eventually dropped it altogether. He went to the best school in the area, and that school prepared him so well that he is now working professionally in theater and is in one of the best schools in the country for acting. I know it was my choice to drop my pursuit, but still, I can't help but feel jealous.

* We were both average looking as kids. I grew up and am still pretty average in looks. He did an ""ugly duckling"" 180 and is now a really good looking guy who gets lots of girls all the time. I spend a lot of my time and energy focusing on my gym and diet plan, following them meticulously, with only modest results. He naturally grew up to be ripped while only going to the gym every once in a while.

* I constantly think and analyze everything relating to friends and relationships. Everyone is naturally his friend when he puts forward no effort (including with me). People that used to be friends with both of us equally now only stay in contact with him, even though our relationships with said people were the *same*.

* I used to have two hobbies I was better at than he was: music and writing. I helped get him into those fields and he has since gotten waaay better at them than me, without even trying.

* I had an absolutely miserable college experience, while he is having the best time of his life at his school. (I'm not pessimistic, I truly did just have bad luck with my choice of school. It was a school that was completely not for me but I couldn't afford anywhere else.)

* It took me so long to find a post-grad minimum wage job; finally getting hired was a cause for celebration. I didn't even want to tell him about it knowing that he has been working professionally throughout college for more money. My smallest of career victories pale in comparison to what he achieves all the time. He is also very modest about it and I have to often find out through others just how well he is doing.

* My biggest claim to fame career-wise would be getting an unpaid internship that actually costs me money to travel to. He shared with me how a particular theater wants him back so much that he can demand higher pay and other perks from them and get it.

* I've tried to stay friends with him, asking about his life, recalling past inside jokes, inviting him over when he's back in town, etc, but he is just so busy and ""in demand"" that he is never available, and going through all this effort makes me feel pathetic and desperate. When he does visit, his life is just so full of stories and opportunities that sharing the highlights of my very uneventful days makes me depressed. 

* I have to live with my parents for who knows how much longer while he will most definitely be a working actor traveling the country after graduation. He has already started on it while still in school and undoubtedly will continue.

Basically, we started off on similar paths, but my friend has just seemingly gotten better than me at everything imaginable. For those who think it might be just a ""facade"" hiding an actually not-so-great life, I'm afraid that's not true in this case. He has told me about his ""struggles"" in the past and they are quite few and far between.

And yes, I've heard it all before: **be yourself,** **don't compare your life to others,** **the grass is always greener,** but nothing helps. I can't help but feel jealous of my friend, all the time. I truly don't know what to do.


**TLDR: I have been jealous of my friend for years. He is doing better than I am at seemingly everything. I don't know how to get over it.**

They asked me to bring my computer so I assume there will be some technical questions they will ask me to solve.  I should mention that the second phone interview was a technical interview, so I think the interviewer got a fair understanding of my programming skills through the call.

Any advice?  Thanks."

22gapd,9,2014-04-07,Boss offered to increase responsibilities. Too little too late?,it_fool_,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/22gapd/boss_offered_to_increase_responsibilities_too/,"I know we get asked a lot these types of questions, but the answers always seem to help the op. So here goes mine. Throwaway Acc.

I left Neurophsyio after 3 yrs of school with no degree. I have worked at Big Blue Box Geeks for 3 years, Apple for 2 and then moved. I got hired by a small IT firm that required no resume, no documentation, and a slew of lies. E.g. work from home, yearly raises, chance to work on server configs, advancement.

As it is, I maintain my own clients. I obtained my CCNA, which was frowned upon, since we're an MSSP. I have not been offered any training, my paychecks do not reflect my timesheets for commission on hours charged, my benefits are pretty bad (Humana), no standards in practice, and apart from a 250k 10Gb fibre network and server, I haven't implemented another. Some pet peeves are thoughtless configurations and lack of apprenticeship , ie. certs, security management, shortcuts in our work,my new co-workers are a pizza delivery boy and a guy from the guard that neither have any experience nor knew how to install office. 

I've been here two years and was ready to leave, but my boss approached me and offered to get me work with servers. Is this just another carrot? I feel like bc I have neither a degree nor hands on with Cisco, that I wouldn't be worth much elsewhere. 

I also love my customers. I have been told that its because of my work that they continue to hire us for work, and it makes me feel appreciated for my hard work. I charge $105/hr for my services. I am *supposed* to receive $5 commission, and I make $40k after taxes in the Houston area including gas reimbursement. 

I am thinking about going to WGU online for IT security, but am worried about starting a new job and school simultaneously. I am working my way through ""hacking the art of exploitation"" and I am really liking it-fwiw. 

*Edit*: Thank you all for the posts. I really feel like it has encouraged me to put myself out there. I have applied to the city Metro, but they wanted experience. I have been lurking /r/houstonjobs, craigslist, dice, indeed, and calling business cards looking for opportunities. Most are looking for a degree or substantial experience with hands on. It's a hard sell to make them believe that I am a living sponge.

 I want to learn anything and everything about this industry. I signed up for the Linux foundation class and paid the $250 for *official* class badge/cert/whatever that call it. 

Everything I have has been from self motivation to better myself, because that's what I want. Sometimes, I just feel like I need a hand up, other times I feel like I am too down on myself. That's why I came to Reddit, for another POV.

WGU has been something I've been researching for about 4 months now, and it certainly is much different than the Devry's and ITT. The way I rationalized it is like this:

I am competing with college grads atm for jobs (people with degrees with no experience). I now have nearly 10 years of techy experience ( I worked in electronic dept at ODepot and freelance work on yachts w/ fiance's dad before).

WGU will give me the certs, the two letters for HR, and some confidence. I have many connections from networking and being able to impress people with my work, but there always seems to be a hang up from them taking a risk and hiring me. I'd love to apprentice or be in an environment that would encourage my learning, but those jobs tend to require what I don't have yet.

What do you think about taking an intern position with a security firm? I've been lurking on a company ""white hat"" in the area, that provides substantial blogs via linkedin and their website says that are hiring. I'd love to be able to career somewhere."

&lt;b&gt;Backstory:&lt;/b&gt;

I'm an Intern at a not for profit. There is a Network Admin and a Sysadmin (just mentioning that for scale). I am here learning from both and it has been an amazing learning experience. I have two more co-ops left and I want them to be here because I get my hands on some pretty awesome systems and a wide variety at that. Perfect for resume/experience building.

&lt;b&gt;The Problem:&lt;/b&gt;

We need to retire a server and migrate it. the server hosts two websites that former interns created. There is no documentation and what seems like 100s of files,some innate that need to be prunned.

I have 2 weeks left, my job is to go through and prune everything, create an administrative map of the website and some documentation.

I have taken a class on IIS and I have tweaked some perl scripts, this website and a couple others in apache... but this.... this is daunting... and I'm going to fucking do it!

&lt;b&gt;Inquiry&lt;/b&gt;

wat do....

aside from going through every file manually (which is what I'll end up doing anyway) is there a script, tool or built in method that can map out every class, method and/or object on a website that is using php through and through? 

Any advice on how to proceed will be welcomed!



EDIT: I should also point out that the sysadmin and the network admin have never touched these websites, its a job that is left to the interns..."
22gflc,1,2014-04-07,"I'm not sure who I am or who I'll ever be, so what's the point?",[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/22gflc/im_not_sure_who_i_am_or_who_ill_ever_be_so_whats/,"I posted this a few days ago in r/depression but figured it should have been here instead. I also added a few things.
Please bare with me, I literally feel like every aspect of my life is a problem and therefore I see a lot of things in my life and in myself (including my tendency to see things negatively now) that I need and want to change. I'm aware that none of it happens without work though, but that doesn't change how I feel. To balance off some of the negative crap I feel, I'll say that I KNOW I'm intelligent, funny, my self esteem is horrible but I'm confident in my abilities. I don't believe I'm all bad...but sometimes the bad outweighs it. 

I live in Ontario and went back to school to get a diploma in the legal field two years ago although I already have a BA. Almost immediately after finishing, I found a few internships to hold me over until I found a paying job, which I did. But the place I worked at was hell. The work was good, the learning experiences from the research I had to delve into and the content of the project were fascinating. It taught me a lot about people and how cold, cruel, and uncaring they could be.

Myself and the other new hires spent 9 hour days sifting through information that would stick with us forever. Stories of rapes, murders, deaths and worse situations, all of which occurred without penalty. We all felt morally disturbed by it, and though I was warned when I started, I didn't realize how difficult it would be. But it was still a good learning experience that left me with a new understanding of what some people have to go through in their lives and despite what I say here, I've had a much better life than that and I'm thankful. However, the working environment was like working in a sweatshop and my stress levels sky rocketed as did everyone else's. Even with a healthy diet I managed to gain at least 10 pounds which exacerbated my existing chronic health issue. I got up at 6am, made the two hour commute to work, sometimes worked at my internship and didn't get home until 10 at night. I became unable to stay awake for even a few hours in the day. I'd routinely have to hold my eyes open at work just to keep myself up. I started losing my memory enough to the point where I had trouble just having basic conversations. It became a struggle to get my point across during a conversation - I'd forget the word 'book' or 'pen' or anything else. My brain just stopped functioning. I'd thought about quitting often but didn't for the money and the experience. When the job was finally over, I pretty much crashed and haven't been the same since.

My memory has come back, I still have trouble with my speech sometimes but it isn't nearly as bad. Since last summer I've been searching for a new job and I've found nothing. I've been offered the chance to start a partnership business with a colleague and the only reason I might even consider it (if they'll actually be willing to think I'm serious this time) is because I can't seem to find anything else. Within a few months of being unemployed, due to my general dissatisfaction with life, I've often contemplated just ending it all. I can't remember the last time I was happy. I'm 29 now...I think the last genuinely happy moment may have been in high school.

Part of it is my appearance...maybe that's shallow. I'm athletic and always have been, but I'm lucky enough to be one of those girls that can't ever lose a pound. So since I have no job to go to, barely get any interviews, I've been sinking my time into working out. In the course of four months of cycling, jogging, and boxing, I've lost a whopping grand total of five pounds. 

I'm realizing I just don't know who I am anymore. I thought my life would be different by now. I have high aspirations and I want to achieve them but I have no way of getting there. At this point the only reason I haven't actually killed myself is simply because I'm used to living. I do it out of habit, not because I want to. If I didn't have parents that would suffer from it, it would be much easier. But right now I pretty much feel like I'm stuck living and I don't want to be. I actually find myself wishing I'd grown up without a family just so I could have given up years ago.

I do have a few close friends but none that I can really talk to like this. I tend to be that typical INTJ that bottles it all up and seems all happy on the outside but really I'm just a mess. When I do try and talk to friends somehow it just feels like whatever I say isn't that big of a deal to them. No one seems to get how serious I am, even though I'm that person that always has a smile on their face and always goes with the flow, it seems to give them the impression that nothing can touch me. Right. I tried to open up about it to a friend a few weeks ago, but couldn't bring myself to bring my friend down by emphasizing just how desperate I am. They ended up writing me a lengthy email telling me how much they appreciate me and just generally trying to cheer me up a bit. It helped a bit and I appreciate it, but it wasn't enough to stop this.

My last relationship was three years ago. Whether the drama from that screwed my head up even more, I don't know, I'm over it and we're good friends so I don't see it as much of a factor. But I've started to realize that not once have I attracted anybody before. I've been out on dates, I've had relationships, but only if I've approached anyone. I've never been asked out in my life and this just makes me wonder what the hell is wrong with me even more. I know people like me, and I pretty much make friends with everyone I meet within minutes. 

So at the end of the day, I can't get a job in my field, I feel like a failure, even at times when I have all the confidence and positivity in the world I'm apparently never going to attract anyone, I've been trying like hell to at least work on getting into shape so I can say I've accomplished something and I come up zip on all fronts. I've been dealing with a lot of this for years (especially the serious health issues) and usually you can only tell I'm unhappy if I outright tell you. I don't go out and throw out negative energy everywhere to automatically repel people. So someone tell me, what's the point of all this? Why bother continuing with such a pathetic life when every chance to change the problems in my life just fails utterly? 

I'm tired of trying so hard for nothing. Thanks for taking the time to read this."

22ghpl,0,2014-04-07,Vote in the Rutgers University Student Assembly Elections,hgcai3456,rutgers,https://www.reddit.com/r/rutgers/comments/22ghpl/vote_in_the_rutgers_university_student_assembly/,"We need 10% of the student body to vote for the referenda questions. 
http://ruassembly.com/spring-2014-referendum-questions
We also need you to vote for people to be on next year's assembly. I am running for Livingston Campus Representative Class of 2017 on an academic based platform. My priority is open source textbooks which will pave the way for cheaper and more affordable textbooks. I will be Working with other organizations such as Rutgers Libraries, Rutgers Legal team, and the University administration to implement open source textbooks. 
What makes me want to run for election to the Rutgers University Student Assembly as the Livingston Campus Representative? Maybe it is my desire to continue to assist the undergraduate student population at Rutgers New Brunswick through small actions every day. It might also be my commitment to finish the projects that I have already started since I first began serving as the Livingston Campus Representative in October. A more likely reason is that I am willing to give my time to working for the undergraduate student body because I am deeply passionate and enthusiastic about this University. I am even more enthusiastic and passionate about the student body, especially my graduating class.
About six months ago, I ran for this position because I wanted to be a bridge between the Rutgers University student body and the University. After six months of hard work, I have navigated through the University’s many departments, talked to many administrators, and worked with the senior student body leaders to get a better picture about how this University works. More importantly, I have experimented with certain projects and have become more aware of how the Student Assembly works as well. I believe I have met many people in RUSA and become close friends with a couple of them. These close relationships allow me to function more effectively in RUSA. I have been constantly building relationships. Now I have a clearer picture on how to finish and follow through on all my current and future projects because I have successfully built relationships with many different leaders and organizations. One of my favorite organizations is the NJPIRG. Not only do I see them as a powerful ally to help me work to bring cheaper textbooks to the student body, but I also see them as my friends.
First, let me introduce myself for those who joined Rutgers recently for the Spring 2014 semester. Born in a city near the Yangtze, I was brought to America as a wide eyed five year old boy who saw America as a shining city on a hill. After being raised in this country, I have seen this shining city tarnish a bit. I want to help make this city on a hill shine again. One of the things that I have been doing to make this “city” shine is through volunteering for my local community organizations. From being trained as a Counselor in Training to being a volunteer at the West Windsor Library, and at the Crisis Ministry, I have helped many people.
Now at Rutgers University, I want to work to eliminate mistrust and miscommunication between people. Some things that I have done to increase communication includes helping to write and pass the Preferred Name Bill through the student assembly. Now Trans* students and international students can add their preferred names to their class rosters. Trans* students can finally be recognized by their professors with names that reflect their gender. International students can feel more comfortable and communicate more easily with American born or raised students by using American names in class. Their American names will be added to the class roster, SAKAI, Blackboard, and e-College. I am currently perfecting a bill that will be presented to the assembly soon. It will build a stronger relationship between Rutgers professors and students.
Additionally, I voted to pass resolutions that support shared governance and smoke free campus.
I will continue to be a bridge that connects the student body with the University not only through my work on RUSA, but also through the use of social media. I connect with my fellow peers and friends using WeChat, Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Google, Yahoo, iMessage, Pinger, LinkedIn, blogger and Instagram, and WhatsApp. I have worked with my fellow Writing Center Interns to build an Instagram page that promotes the Livingston Campus Writing Center and its services. As a Writing Center Intern, I have personally connected with even more International students and try to understand their feelings and needs. As a business school student, I am actively maintaining my LinkedIn page with my latest activities, which you can all read online.
Lastly, I have used my time in RUSA to meet new people. I am looking forward to meeting even more people and listening to their opinions and ideas to make the University a more harmonious place for all students. After accumulating valuable experience from serving as the current Livingston Campus Representative, I have become more mature, wise, and smart about how to accomplish my goals.
I am interested in running for this position on the Rutgers University Student Assembly again because I believe in creating a stronger university student body that has fun and stays within the rules and laws of the university and the nation. 
Please vote for Henggao Cai for Livingston Campus Representative.

22gmv2,5,2014-04-07,What should my salary be?,mcfailure,webdev,https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/22gmv2/what_should_my_salary_be/,"Hi Reddit.

Me and my experience are having our two year anniversary in a few months. I've been working as a junior front-end developer with a company that makes social networks. I started there right after high school as an intern making wordpress sites. I got better at PHP and MySQL so after half a year they let me work on their social network projects. Right now I'm making $32,000 a year, after taxes a little more than $21,000 a year.

I'd like to make some more money, as of right now I'm living without health insurance so I can pay my the bills, and in Massachusetts that results in a tax penalty. Just sayin'.

How much should I be making as a junior front end developer? Should I ask for a review?
This is what I usually list as my skills:

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* jQuery
* PHP
* MySQL
* Wordpress
* Linux and DOS commands
* Apache

22gvz7,2,2014-04-07,I'm scared to death of interviewing. My stomach turns and I start to shake when simply filling out job applications online because I know they could lead to an interview. Help!,Sohcahtoa82,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/22gvz7/im_scared_to_death_of_interviewing_my_stomach/,"I just recently finished my BS in Computer Science, and I'm now applying for jobs in the hopes of being a software engineer.  I love to code, and was doing it at home off and on for years before I even started going to college.

I worked a software testing internship for 16 months at Intel, which of course meant interviewing there, but for some reason, I felt more confident at that one.  Going into it, I knew it wasn't a coding position, and I had a friend that had also applied for the same job and was able to give me a heads up on what they were asked.

But when it comes to coding, even though I've written plenty of things here and there, I still feel like I have no idea what I'm doing (I've heard what I'm feeling is [Imposter Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome)), and it'll show when I get an interview.

I recently had a couple 20-minute phone interviews for a position, and when asked to describe the MVC design pattern, I was so nervous that I stuttered like crazy and was probably highly incoherent.

Then of course is the issue of my mouth becoming absurdly dry due to the stress.

How can I get over the interview jitters?"

So we talked it out on saturday, both said that we love each other and no hard feelings were left.

I pick up her sisters and her cousin. We drive to the airport. I got roses. Champagne, roses, and two shrimpcocktails at home.

We pick her up. Kisses, hugs, etc.

We drive home... She tells me she got a job offer there. She got no feelings left for me - and she is 100% sure that feelings wont grow back even though we had 3 months apart. She has flirted with some guy there (says she haven't done anything with him).

I did not really see this fucking bomb coming. I'm broken, completely fucking broken.

I threw her out in the middle of the night. Couldn't fucking stand her. Her sister picked her up. I told her ""you ain't staying another hour here""

She is coming by tomorrow so that we can start pack all the stuff up. Im fucking devastated.

Im gonna be so lonely. :(

How do I go on with my life? I need to find my soulmate, which I thought was her. How do people even find anyone new? I guess most people will say: throw friends. Sad thing is I have only a few close friends. Especially now since most are disappearing with / in combination with her. 

Edit: I just want to say that I'm not looking for a new soulmate right away. I don't think I'm looking for anyone. It's just that my life got turned upside down so my first thoughts are ""what am I gonna do? How am I ever gonna find a woman again? Even for a few weeks??"" I don't hang around places were women usually are - and I thought I was way over the dating.

How do I find myself? How do people 'do' being single? Dear god this is so fucking confusing.

---   
**tl;dr**: She dumped me, said she had no feelings left. Had flirted with other guys. Got a job offer at her internship. I'm lonely, crying."

[How much do you charge to program a website? Nothing fancy, just some basic images and text. I want it to look good, but not over the top. I' sent you an email with all the images i want on the webpage. Thanks.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgmlg61?context=5)|As a consultant, I get billed out at $115/hr to clients. I was making $90k/year at the job I got laid off from before doing this.
 |I'm not a designer, and I don't make websites for people. I am sorry but you should find someone younger and less experienced to do your bidding.
[So you can get this done in less than 1 hour? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgmt2yf?context=5)|I'm in the process of writing software to allow people who want this sort of thing to do it themselves in an hour, so that there is no need for me or anyone else to do it; only to hire a designer to lay it out.
[How would you easily explain to someone who doesn't know much about technology (ELI5\) how hacking works?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgmlgu6?context=5)|About 10 years ago, hacking is just another way to say you are really good at making computers do whatever you want, even if the computer was not meant to be able to do those things.
 |In the modern sense, hacking is the digital equivalent of breaking and entering typically. That is not how I use the word, but it is what I will explain, since I think that is what you are asking. Eg: How do you break into computers.
 |Investigate the computer hardware and software being run by your target.
 |Find ""problems"" with that hardware or software ( things that don't work correctly ), or ways to force that hardware or software to do things it wasn't meant to.
 |Take advantage of the problems, by studying them carefully, in order to gain more than the normal level of access the systems are intended to provide.
 |Continue to use increasing levels of access to get more and more information from the intended target.
 |Note that there are a lot more steps you need to take to do these things, that is just the general idea of how hacking is done.
[Do you even lift?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgmmfo8?context=5)|I'm a computer programmer. I'm a total weakling. On a related side note, the FBI agent actually was involved in Tough Mudder and won one of them as a team with a bunch of his buddies. He probably lifts.
[I'm a programmer and I lift. You have no excuses.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgnj7sq?context=5)|Well I hike and bike, and I like sprinting. I also go up and down stairs 3 at a time. I may not be able to lift but I can run. I'm not a donut eating potato sack.
[How were you caught?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgmljzn?context=5)|I am not quite sure exactly. The things that led me to be a suspect in this case were grey hat hacking. I wasn't selling information or breaking anything, so I wouldn't quite say I was 'caught'. No charges have been pressed against me thus far, either by the university, the state, the secret service, or any other group.
 |To answer your question more directly, I'm not exactly sure how I got caught. I know friends of mine were questioned before I was. My parents got calls from the FBI asking for my online only alias 3 weeks before. There were signs something was going down.
 |What the FBI did have was a print out of a Stream chatlog. Apparently they got it from Steam themselves and/or got it from someone else I was talking to about the hacking I was involved in. The Steam chatlog is the only evidence I know of that they had that I was doing anything that would classify as 'hacking'. I was stupid. I told my friends what I was doing, and I used Steam to tell them.
[Is there currently a case against you? If so, does this post act as admission of guilt? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgmn114?context=5)|I believe I am a suspect in the current ongoing case that was in the news about someone stealing 300k+ identities.
 |I did have more access than whoever that was, but I didn't do anything ""bad"" with that information or access imo.
 |I have not been pressed with any charges, so to my knowledge there is no case against me thus far.
 |Most everything I've stated here I've stated freely to the FBI ( I have continued cooperating with them after the RAID ).
 |During the RAID I provided my 20+ character system encryption password, my Keepass password, the location of my keyfiles, and a full description of everything. I basically ""confessed"" everything to the FBI already.
 |My stance is that I did nothing ""morally wrong"". My attempt the entire time has been to help the university improve their security.
 |As far as being ""guilty"", I assuredly did have more access into their systems then I should have been able to have, but some of this they were fine with and I told them about freely before the RAID.
 |Whether or not I broke any laws, I am uncertain of. I have and will repeatedly apologize for any wrongdoing I may have done, and I will simply continue to reiterate that I was only trying to help.
 |There is sufficient evidence to demonstrate I mean well.
[Thanks for the answer. I read recently that the vast majority of hackers who are caught are discovered not via the actual hacking, or some kind of trace, but by telling other people/bragging in forums and whatnot. Interesting to hear that may have been your situation too.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgmmm5o?context=5)|I don't think the FBI or Secret Service knew what I was doing during the 1.5 week period I was testing the security. They claim they knew, but they are full of shit, because they did nothing to stop me from doing so until my house suddenly got raided.
 |It was far too obvious that I was the only one with knowledge of the systems and a hacking background, and I told too many people.
 |That and I actually communicated some of what my pentesting activities found on their systems, through my company, using my real name. They already knew I was testing their systems, they just were unaware of how much access I had gained.
 |Eg: I did white hat hacking officially through my job. I did further grey hat hacking that went too far after that, and that is what got me into trouble. I wasn't very careful to hide my activities, and intentionally there is a lot of evidence as to exactly what I did, for my own protection. I never had any evil intentions in any of the process.
[Did you think that you weren't on anyone's radar or just that you were too good to leave footprints?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgmmocn?context=5)|I used VPN access through Sweden, Switzerland, and Hong Kong to do the testing. I did mess up and do 1 or 2 things that could be traced back, but the majority of anything that would get me in any trouble there was little to no evidence of.
 |The only thing that alerted anyone was myself. I told the university that I hacked their systems ( specifically I sent an email to all 20 members of the task force for UMD in charge of security ) In the email I listed out all the names and internal employee numbers of all of the people on the task force. That is what triggered the FBI and Secret Service to start digging and eventually arrive at my door.
 |I did good things through my actual job.
 |I did more good things, to try and help security, outside of my job ( albeit things that I could very well got in a lot of trouble for now )
 |I communicated exactly what I did in detailed steps to the university ( to help them patch their holes ) - albeit ""anonymously""
 |University involved FBI and Secret Service.
 |Authorities questioned other people at my work, as well as clients.
 |Authorities then realized it was me, due to me having told other people at work what I was doing.
 |Was then raided.
 |Told my job I was raided.
 |My job laid me off, despite me cooperating with authorities and not having got in any legal trouble thus far. ( may yet )
[*My parents got calls from the FBI asking for my online only alias 3 weeks before.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgn5b92?context=5)|Yes it seems amateur; I am not quite sure why they did that.
[Doesn't that seem, I don't know, really *amateur* to anyone else?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgn5b92?context=5)|The same has happened to me in the past when I was in college, shortly after I applied for an internship with the NSA. I assume it is normal procedure for government agencies to attempt to verify any and all ""pen-names"" used by people being investigated.
[Hackers use steam. I feel like Im getting near being a hacker. LOL. For the sake of learning, can you guide me on where I should start when learning hacking? Any good site you can recommend? I am a network engineer by the way thats why im interested.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgn0lo8?context=5)|The best way to learn about hacking is to do it. You should setup two computers, with a cheap router connecting them, and then setup something like a LAMP or WAMP webstack on one, and then try to ""hack into it"" from the other computer.
 |Note that this is a bit much to start out with though, I would just advise googling how to guides on learning to hack and then reading every single google result that comes up ( google searches are limited to 100 results )
 |As far as sites I would recommend, probably a good idea to read hacker news ( news.ycombinator.com ) Also good to read r/technology and r/programming.
 |Since you are into networking, you should learn how to use Wireshark and understand what is going back and forth across the network when you do certain things.
 |If you don't know any coding languages, you should learn some, such as C or Perl.
[If charged, the court cannot compel decryption unless it is a foregone conclusion that there is incriminating evidence on the encrypted volume. If you were smart, you had deniable encryption and can always give them the second partition.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgn8row?context=5)|Yes I agree I was manipulated, and I agree it was retarded of me to give up my encryption keys.
[You honestly believe any of this is about morals on their end? Sorry, but I've got a bridge in Brooklyn to sell you if you think this is like 1994 when doing the right thing prevents you from getting charged.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgn8row?context=5)|She was forced to sit still in my living room and not move and hold our dog during the entire time I was questioned.
 |Why? Because I care about my wife. If I was alone and single I would have told the FBI to go stick their heads in the sand and ran to pull the main breaker for the house to shut down my PC. What are they going to do; shoot me?
[Why do you keep writing ""raid"" in caps lock?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgmron7?context=5)|Because I'm a clueless turd who doesn't have a RAID in my system. j/k.
 |I dunno, just because I can?
 |My current system actually has a RAID5 array with 4 drives, all 2tb drives. Split into 1tb encrypted containers. ( 6 of them )
[When you are interviewed by the FBI are you speaking to someone who is able to understand all the technical details of what you did?  Do they know the right questions to ask?  Or do you find that they only understand the bigger picture?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgmuhp8?context=5)|The agent I spoke with seemed to understand what I was explaining. Looking back at it and at what he has asked me since, he isn't as skilled at coding as myself. He also is not a software engineer. He seemed to be trained to interrogate me more than to comprehend what exactly he extracted from me. It is about what you would expect.
 |That said, he probably will read this thread, and I don't want to insult him or his expertise in any way. I don't really know the guy. I don't have his resume. I haven't been allowed to interview him, so I can't really ascertain his technical skill level. Supposedly he is working to analyze my system, so he must know something to even be able to operate the crazy setup I had going.
 |They asked a ton of questions. They asked a bunch of stupid things, like ""what video games do you play?"", ""what was the last video game you played?"". Apparently it was hugely interesting to them that I play 'Rust'. I can't imagine why. I guess hackers typically play video games with their hacker buddies??
 |They also repeated the same questions lots of times, to see if I would pause and react in any different way and leak more information to them. It really is best to not talk to authorities AT ALL, until you are forced to do so, after they press charges. I cooperated, but I believe I made a mistake in doing so.
 |There was a more technical person futzing with my computer before I gave them the passwords. She looks extremely geeky ( like the sort of person who would have no bf ). She had trouble with my Japanese keyboard ( the keys are laid out in a different way than a normal keyboard, and the way I have it setup the labels don't even match what it does ) That is to be expected though; how many US people know how to type on keyboards from other countries?
 |She was clueless when I explained how to read my bash history file, so I am doubting she had much experience with Linux.
 |Basically, I didn't see anyone who was a real pro with computers in the group of people who served the warrant. They were just doing their job; grabbing my stuff and then analyze it later. The fact that the FBI agent who questioned me knew anything technical is probably good, since I was able to cooperate and them not to just take everything in the whole house.
 |All in all, I can't really complain about the search warrant. They were actually pretty cooperative and only harassed me to a degree that I think is reasonable.
 |I still think it is dumb they busted the door though; that is my one complaint.
[Very interesting, thanks for sharing. I hope it all works out. Just make sure you're not sharing anything here which could harm your defence, a lawyer would be best to tell you whether it was. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgmnkbn?context=5)|Lawyer said don't say anything about it to anyone. So much for that.
[To back up what I replied to you higher up in the thread... that right there is violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse act and if they want to charge you you're fucked.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgnbidd?context=5)|I already stated this same information to the FBI, so they already know. Repeating it doesn't change anything.
[Tl;dr white hat accidentally the CFAA through ignorance, V&amp;](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgn9hmu?context=5)|Correction: tldr: White hat stupidly migrates to gray hat for a short period and CFAA stupidly thinking I won't get in trouble.
[*I used VPN access through Sweden, Switzerland, and Hong Kong to do the testing. I did mess up and do 1 or 2 things that could be traced back, but the majority of anything that would get me in any trouble there was little to no evidence of.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgn8yu2?context=5)|The VPNs were setup within Fedora. The passwords are visible in the Keepass I gave them access to. I told them this already in person. They already know. They have full proof of everything I did. Stating it at this point makes little to no difference, because they already have all the evidence.  It isn't illegal to test things. It also isn't illegal to use VPNs to do so. Suspicious sure, but not illegal.  Also, the ""anything that would get me in trouble"" things I mention are things the FBI has full proof of. Those things are trouble in the sense that they were not approved by the university, but they are not trouble in the sense that I was ""stealing"" things. My only aim the entire time was to demonstrate and explain how their security was lacking so that the university themselves could improve it.
[I think you're fundamentally assuming you're anything more than a case file for a few FBI agents, a docket entry for a federal judge or a conviction statistic for a US attorney.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgnvwqn?context=5)|Yes I didn't go about thing in the way I should have. Did it happen? Yes. Can I change it? No. What harm was caused? Well my door is busted in... I don't think the university will press charges against me; I think they know I was trying to do the right thing. I could be wrong about this; only time will tell. I don't think the FBI agent who wrote the affidavit is going to try and screw me over, I believe he really is appreciative that I am doing my best to cooperate. The US attorney overseeing the case is the only real question mark. The involved agents says he will state that I am cooperating completely, and that should help. Eg: It sounds to me like whether I get in trouble is just a decision by the US attorney of whether or not to press charges against me. Considering the university has thanked me, and I have and will continue to cooperate and am apologetic about any harm I may have inadvertently caused, I think it would take a malicious sort of person to press charges against me just because. Perhaps the US attorney is just a dick and will go ""hahahaha gonna screw over this punk; he deserves it."" I don't know, all I can do is be honest, cooperative, apologetic for any wrong I have done, and hope for the best.
[You're assuming the criminal ""justice"" system is about truth and protecting the public; it's about public relations, security theater and profit.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgnvwqn?context=5)| 
[**The person who cares the most about you is the stuffed suit who can wave the headline ""IT Consultant pleads guilty to stealing 310k SSNs from UMD"" in front of a congressman for more funding next fiscal year.**](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgnvwqn?context=5)| 
[Why do you only have 6x1TB containers if you have 4x2TB HDD's in RAID5?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgn6v34?context=5)|The way RAID5 works is that you essentially have a parity drive. Lookup parity on Wikipedia for a basic explanation of what parity is in general and how it is computed.
 |What that means in this case is that only 3 of those 4 2TB drives can actually be used to store data. The fourth drive exists so that if any one of the drives fail, I still do not lose any data. So 3*2TB = 6TB. Hence 6x1TB containers.
[I'm surprised their supposed ""computer expert"" was clueless about Linux. That's a pretty big red flag. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgn8xg7?context=5)|As stated elsewhere here, I don't think they expected to encounter the elaborate setup I had. They expected some average Joe programmer who did some stuff he shouldn't have. IMO they were shocked at what they saw in my house and in my computer when they got here.
[You can't detect the existence of a hidden partition, that's why the two-key-two-container method works so well.  Also, don't overestimate the capabilities of SS and FBI. They are not wizards.  I understand that they ""succeeded"" in their work solely because of intimidation which made you confess to them, which I don't really understand. Why would you not be prepared for the worst, even if you allegedly weren't doing implying to do anything criminal with these exact data that you got from the uni?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgn92jo?context=5)|I fully expected to be questioned by the FBI.

I did the initial consultation for 2 lawyers, and one of them told me that. I think it is sound advice. The reason I am speaking out is because I think what happened should be publicly known, and I have not been told that I am not allowed to tell anyone.
 |I specifically requested of the FBI if I could share that I was served a search warrant and he said yes, hence this post.
 |Information I already shared directly with the FBI.
 |Information that could be found about me publicly online once my identity is known.
 |General knowledge that is free speech and, imo, doesn't incriminate me in any way.
 |Personal anecdotes that I believe would help, not harm me if they were brought up in a court case.
 |Stupid things that will screw me over later ( j/k ) Seriously though I agree not talking would be smarter.

[I decided recently that I wanted to learn how to code and after some research decided that python was the easiest language to start with and learn the logic of coding from.  I have since realized that few applications use python.  Am I wasting my time?  Or will it be really easy to pick up java or c or another language after developing an understanding of python?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgmuc1o?context=5)|I view python the same way I view ruby; it is something in the recent trendsetters group. It has been around for a while, but is recently gaining more attention due to coming into vogue as it were.
 |It is easy to learn and use to some extent, but it does not have, imo, the depth and breadth of connected libraries that exist in languages such as C and Java.
 |There is a large demand currently for Python programmers imo, because it is popular right now.
 |The more languages you learn, the easier it will be to pick up others.
 |If you have a decent grasp of Python, I would suggest advancing it till you have a firm grasp on it before you switch to another language, or you will forget what you have learned.
 |Learning coding in general is a skill that transfers to other languages, but each language has specifics that are quite different.
 |Python is a scripting language. You will find it easier to switch to another scripting language, such as Ruby, Javascript, or Perl, then you will to switch to something such as C ( compiled ) or Java ( Bytecode ).
 |Commonly colleges these days teach Java, since it drives the software for most of the enterprise level. Java can also be very complicated and bloated to write.
[I'm gonna be that guy - you actually described a RAID4.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgnd79v?context=5)|Yes I know. I described it that way for simplification. I actually considering pointing out that in most systems parity is actually distributed across the disks rather than it being on a dedicated parity disk; but it is easier to think of it that way for the newbs.
 |I am using RAID5 if there is any confusion.
[They didn't actually give a shit, they were trying to establish credibility as part of the Reid Technique. Law Enforcement 101 there.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgn9cyf?context=5)|I did said I plead the fifth during the interview in regard to certain aspects, but when back on it later believing it is in my best interest. I guarantee if I had not cooperated, I would have already had charges pressed against me and would have already spend some time in a jail cell. I really don't want to be charged or to go to jail, so I still think I am doing the right thing by cooperating. Just because the government tend to be dicks and fuck over good people doesn't mean they need to be hated or that they will always act in that way. I like to be hopeful and believe in positive resolutions to things.
[You should have plead the fifth, or if you wanted to be a dick and ensure they bothered filing charges then, said things like ""Tittysprinkles"" all day long.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgn9cyf?context=5)|

I do think they are just doing their job as best as they are able.
 |I just don't like government in general. The people are just cogs / messengers. Don't hate on them too much.
[Just my opinion and uninformed as it may be, but I did notice that the warrant was served in Maryland. The feds were involved, and Ft. Mead is just a hop, skip, and a jump away.  I could see them cutting a deal to use your knowledge to the benefit of uncle sam real quick.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgnha65?context=5)|Sounds good to me. As stated elsewhere I already have a limited clearance and do work for the federal government. ( also involving the FBI in a way )
 |Additionally, I interviewed for a position with the D.O.D. and was offered the job, but I turned it down because it was equal pay to what I was making and a much farther drive. ( plus the position sounded kind of boring )
 |The fact that I still have my current limited clearance makes me think I may be okay in the long run; I don't really know though.
[Umm... you're an idiot.  It doesn't matter whether you did anything wrong or not, you're essentially throwing yourself on the mercy of the FBI and prosecutor.  The law does not care whether it was ""morally wrong"" because the law doesn't deal in morals.  Nothing you say can help you, only hurt.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgnbchg?context=5)|Whether or not they press charges against me is more political than anything at this point. I agree they could press some sort of charges and likely be able to convict as well, but I have been very cooperative, and at no point in the process have I had bad intentions. Eg: at every step of the way I tried to do my best to help the university improve their security. I believe multiple people both inside and outside the university are willing to agree with me on this and state is publicly. Just because the government can crucify random people doesn't mean they have to.
[They may not charge you, but just based on your posts in this thread and the vague wording of the Computer Fraud and Abuse act, it wouldn't be hard to convict you.  Federal prosecutors aren't known for their lenient nature.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgnbchg?context=5)| 
[The big problem is that it sounds as if you've already admitted guilt to the FBI, not that you are talking about the search warrant online.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgn9knt?context=5)|I don't disagree with you. I clearly have other motivations for speaking out.
[If you had an AMAA and only discussed the fact you were raided and anything that has been published about the case, that would be unlikely to jeopardize anything as long as you didn't pull a weev and insult the court (which was cited for his increased sentence\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgn9knt?context=5)|Raise awareness of the truth.

I already told them too much, but I did so intentionally to essentially beg for mercy. I know I did things that are considered wrong, all I ask for is leniency due to my intentions. 
[It's still unclear to me what activities you were alleged to be participating in. Care to elaborate?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgmmmpi?context=5)|It was suspected that I was the person responsible for this: [Link to www.diamondbackonline.com](http://www.diamondbackonline.com/news/article_b8236dea-99b6-11e3-92eb-0017a43b2370.html)
 |I believe I am still an active suspect in that case. There is more than enough evidence to demonstrate my innocence of being involved in that particular ""data breach"" involving the university though.
 |I was working on a UMD website through my company, and I downloaded a portion of the site to work on it. My computer virus scanner picked up a virus ( a shellscript ) on their site. I reported it to my coworkers and my boss ( VP of the company ). The VP did nothing and didn't tell the university.
 |I later, after the 300k incident was in the news, checked if the shellscript was still there. It was. I freaked out and told my coworkers. They immediately told the VP and CEO of my company. Several days later I was in a conference call with people from UMD. Basically nothing was done about the shellscript besides removing it.
 |I waited 2 weeks and then continued, outside of work, investigating to see how bad UMD security was. ( eg: pentesting ) Their security was and is horrendous. I detailed what I found and communicated it to the university...
[Wait, so what exactly did you do that caused them to believe you stole 300k+ SSNs? It sounds like you just alerted your bosses to the presence of the shell script before the 300k incident and afterwards... And THEN poked around. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgn8vpg?context=5)|I am obviously leaving out stuff. The stuff I am leaving out is so as to not state anything that would interfere with any ongoing investigation into the 300k incident. Eg: in my testing / poking / hacking / whatever you want to call it I saw things that are not public knowledge, and communicating that information to anyone could be detrimental to the university and/or their security. I do think UMD security was/is bad, but I do believe they are doing their best efforts to fix it now and made up for their failings.
 |To answer more simply, I actually had access officially through my job and that access was able to access the SSN information without me doing anything I would actually consider hacking.
 |The testing and poking I did later was to demonstrate and point out that a malicious individual could gain the same level of access I had officially.
 |Basically, I unintentionally had access to the 300k SSN information that everyone is upset about, and I pointed it out to the university as soon as I realized I did.
 |The reason I got in trouble was because I poked around afterwards. They didn't realize that me ( the person who reported I had access to the info ) was also me ( the person who was poking ).
[Gee can't imagine why I'm upset that you could see who I am and all the perminant information to ruin me can ya???](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgnu1mf?context=5)|I had to be the bearer of bad news, but security across major corporations and entities across the globe is terrible. I am just one person. There are assuredly a thousand more ever bit as capable as myself, if not more so, and just as assuredly some portion of those are malicious hackers and not people who actually care.
 |Believe it or not, I care about privacy and security greatly.
 |My point here is that for every breach you hear about, there are hundreds if not thousands more than are not noticed and/or not reported. This was stated by Dr. Loh during his statement before the senate hearing recently. I agree with him on this notion.
 |Anyone who is upset at what I've done is rather near-sighted and missing the big picture. Security in computers should be improved across the board. Respect should be given to experts such as myself, and we should be utilized to make the internet and storage of sensitive information more possible. Treating people like me like criminals is counterproductive.
[Then you should have used your **official capacity as an expert** to bring it to the universities attention not grey hat your way to proving a point. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgnuhq3?context=5)|I did bring it to the university's attention. Then they did little to nothing about it. They didn't tell the FBI, or anyone on the taskforce. They basically tried to shuffle the things I pointed out under the rug. I got a round of thank you's over the phone from UMD personnel, and then I was ignored. I asked to talk in person to them afterwards, and I was refused.
[Thanks for the reply! One more corollary question, so is it much easier to detect (and then find\) a hacker than it is to do the actual hacking?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgmrdc3?context=5)|It depends on the type of hacking. If you are discussing people hacking into random websites, typically you cannot easily gain root access to the system serving up the webpages.
 |Until you gain root access, there is a trail of evidence as to what you have done in the logs. How long those logs get retained for, or if they are regularly checked for hacking, depends on the admin. Typically they are not checked at all.
 |Usually, evidence of hacking is only looked for after the hack is obvious. Eg: most hacking goes undetected because it does no real harm, and is simply not noticed.
 |There are a ton of easy hacks against a ton of websites all over the internet. Most of them never get hacked, because no hacker even cares to do the easy hacks.
 |The only hacks that get attention is when people go after specific information, or actually damage system software or delete data etc. Those type of hacks are obvious crimes, and everything is done typically to go after the people who do them.
 |It is difficult to not leave a direct trail back to oneself when doing any hacking, and most amateurs aren't even aware of all the clues they leave.
 |Basically in summary; it is easy to hack, it is harder to do it and not get caught, it is stupid to think you've thought of everything, and in general if you are attempting to hack to steal or damage something, there are people with money and resources interested in catching/finding you.
[Thank you dearly for your most fastidious responses! May your days be favorable and free from the vices that ever so often bring trouble upon men.  And I hope all that legal shit goes away.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22gl14/iama_hacker_who_was_raided_by_the_fbi_and_secret/cgms4jn?context=5)|You are welcome. I've always thought to myself that if I ever do one of these things that I would at least put due effort into it to respond to every question people have with some attempt at an answer. Enjoy.

I had two dips left in my can of Copenhagen, half of a hydrocodone, a waded up bag with a few pieces of good cannabis inside, an almost empty eight ball, and a few sips of whiskey left in a bottle of Donny Donell. I had really over indulged this time. I was trying so hard to numb the pain of my lost loved one. I needed to cope with the sudden overwhelming change, and of course it didn’t help. No matter how many illicit substances I consumed, the pain was still there, slowly consuming me whole like a python does with its prey. Just goes to show the useless role drugs have in my life. Is there even a real way to deal with death? 
Last Friday I got a text message from my aunt telling me I needed to come home for there was a family emergency. Upon my arrival home, I was greeted with a driveway and lawn packed full of cars, I knew something was wrong. Once I parked I put my hands together and prayed, “God please don’t give me the news that I have lost someone else, you have taken so many people away from me, please don’t do this to me again!” I got out of my car nonchalantly trying to keep my nerves calm. I saw Darrel (a close family friend) walking around the yard talking on the phone. I threw my hand up and waved along with my typical greeting to friends. “Hey man!” I yelled. He gave me a quick look then his eyes went back to the ground as he continued talking on his cell phone. I couldn’t help but overhear his conversation. “I don’t know momma I reckon it was someone on dope or they were drunk or something, yeah I know, yeah.” After hearing this I faded away into my own thoughts. “Yeah someone has died.” I thought to myself. I took a deep breath and prepared myself for the worst. I was thinking maybe my father was coming back from one of his little “parties” and one of his friends was most likely over intoxicated as usual, thus causing a car crash in which my father was the fatality.
As soon as I put my hand on the door knob it opened. There stood my dad; face blood red, tears pouring from his eyes like a waterfall, an almost solid white snot drooping down from his nose. He grabbed me and pulled me towards him and held me there. I was almost in shock. Never in my life has my father shown this kind of physical affection towards me. “Your mother died in a car accident this morning son,” he said in an almost nonexistent quivering voice. My whole body went limp, my mind went completely blank. I couldn’t comprehend and process the devastating news he had just gave me. I don’t know how long I was there in front of the door with my dad, but eventually I came to the realization I had to get up. I forced myself up to my feet and then the reality train hit me harder than it ever has before. I jerked my glasses off and burst into tears as I tried to make my way for the comforting sanctuary that is my home.

 The living room was overflowing with people, they were packed in like sardines. All of them were staring at me with faces full of sorrow and pity. I felt so humiliated, I can’t stand it when people see me cry. I tried to maneuver my around obstacles to get  to my room, stepping over people’s feet, tripping over the rug, squeezing past chairs in the dead silence.it was the most awkward situation I had ever been in. Full of rage along with a hateful attitude I locked myself in my room. At the moment I didn’t want to see another person’s face nor deal with any of their bullshit hollow apologizes or their unfaithful promises to help.

A loud knock along with a familiar (and very unsettling) high pitched voice rattled my door. “Hey buddy its Caleb, I just wanted to see if you were ok.” Caleb is the undertaker/mortician at the Green Valley Funeral Home. This ridiculous looking man stands around 5’5, about 170 pounds, long blood red hair that’s usually kept in a ponytail, followed by freckles head to toe, and he has the most insidious laugh a person ever could have. On the outside Caleb seems like a friendly charming guy, but ever since I’ve been working under his supervision, something’s been telling me there is a dark and evil presence lurking around inside him. It may be just a crazy thought from my judgmental human nature, but it’s a thought I can’t seem to shake. Unfortunately Caleb Hatmaker is also my boss. I have an internship at the funeral home as a mortician’s assistant. I unlocked my door and welcomed him in. “I’m so sorry for your loss Jason, this was so unexpected I just couldn’t believe it when I was told. “Listen if there is anything you need just let me know,” he claimed. That’s exactly what I didn’t want to hear. It was the reason why I locked myself in my room, to escape from that untruthful statement. Damn if I had a dollar for every time someone told me that over the past few weeks. “Ok thank you Mr. Hatmaker, I appreciate it.” I said looking down at him, he is a very short man compared to me. “What did I tell you about calling Mr. Hatmaker?” “It’s Caleb to you, ok?” he said with that disgusting grin emerging on his face. “Sorry sir I keep forgetting.” We discussed work for a moment and he told me to take a week off, I thanked him and showed him out. I walked back to my bed to lay down and continue sobbing and wallowing in my own pain.

No one seemed to understand the severity of my situation. I had just lost my wonderful mother. The woman that was looked at by many as a saint, is now gone forever. I felt so hopeless, my whole world had been turned upside down within a 24 hour period. There were two exhausting thoughts that constantly looped through my mind on my week off from work. “I miss my mother so much” was the worst one. It was just a constant reminder that she is now dead. The woman I love more than anyone else in the world will soon merely be another forgotten corpse rotting in the ground. The other nagging thought that will also most likely aid in my downfall to a path of depression and alcoholism was assisting the other in pestering me. “What am I going to do now?” My mother was the person that took care of us all. While dad was at work I would be at school and going to work right after, and there she was at home. She was always working towards making the best damn home anyone could ever come to. All of our clothes were washed, never a trace of dirt could be found inside, and that cooking, my God! You could never ask to come home to a better meal then what came from my mother’s kitchen. There is no doubt in my mind that I lived in every man’s idea of utopia. I never took my mother’s troubles for granted, I always gave her the gratitude she deserved unlike my father who didn’t. I just couldn’t stop thinking how could I ever match up with my mom’s outstanding performance? How can I possible keep up with the cooking and cleaning? Especially being in school and working every day.
 By day two on my week of recovery allowed by Caleb, I knew I couldn’t bear the rest of the week without some type of crutch. I called up my father’s friend Mac, he’s a well-known drug dealer in our town. He answered after just a few rings. As soon as I told him who I was he automatically knew what I was perusing. “What all do you need and how much do you need?” He asked in a professional tone of voice. “15 of those blue speckles, bring me 3 grams of the snow that came from the snow storm a few days ago, a small bag of that special herb from your garden (I was aware of his garden because I have heard my father compliment him on his growing skills), and a bottle of the highest proof whiskey available.” I tried to talk in code the best I could. Usually when he hung out with my dad I would frequently hear his paranoid ramblings of the police tapping his phone. “Ok buddy I’ll be there as fast as I can.” This was the first time I actually detected some real promise in someone’s voice since my mother’s passing. Not even an hour later he was knocking on the door. Opening the door he immediately greeted me with a comforting hug. Mac is probably the most caring drug dealer I have ever encountered. He Knew I didn’t invite him for small talk. I could tell he was trying to get to the point as fast as possible. He handed me a shopping bag containing my supplies with a friendly smile on his face saying, “don’t worry I won’t tell your dad about this I remember what it was like when I lost my mother.” “Mac you have no idea how much I appreciate you doing this man, how much do I owe you?” “Nothing at all, you and your whole family have helped me more times than I can count on my fingers and toes combined, don’t sweat it kid.” I insisted he took my money, but there was no point in trying anymore with the stubborn old man. “Well the least you could do is sit down with me and do a few lines of this blow.” I said smiling while pulling out the white gold. “Well it looks like you got me there, how could I pass that up?” He sat down next to me as I cut out 6 lines, I knew this was going to cheer me up. After a while he announced he had to get home to his old lady before she started calling. We said our goodbyes and he wished me plenty of good luck and then he was out the door before I knew it. My over indulging had started. This is when the drugs started to take hold of my mind, rendering my ability to rationalize. 

It was probably the drugs causing my brain to produce and entertain the insane thought but I was determined to go for it. I wanted to prepare my mother’s body for the funeral. Most of you are probably thinking what the hell is wrong with you? I really don’t know, but now that I look back at it with a sober mind I realize it was fucked up, but please understand it was the best decision I’ve ever made. If I hadn’t wanted this, I would have never been able to stop the sickening and depraved acts that were occurring in the Green Valley Funeral Home. 

I lost count of how many shots of whiskey I had. The onset of the stuff was fast, I could compare its strength to Everclear. I sat and practiced what I was going to say to Caleb for about 10 minutes. I then frantically searched for my phone. I’m sure my mother would have been ashamed to see me stumbling around the house in that manner. Once I found my phone I did a small victory dance to celebrate my accomplishment, afterword’s I called Caleb immediately. I felt like I was stuck listening to his Fur Elise ring back tone for an eternity. Eventually he answered. His scraggly high pitched voice lunged into my ears from the other line. “Hello?” Hearing his voice triggered my gag reflex and caused me to drop my phone and vomit all over the floor. I could hear his voice carrying throughout my room as if he was standing there next to me. “Jason is that you?” “Hey are you alright?” I scooped up my phone from what looked like pure concentrated bile on the floor.  “What the heel took ye so damn long Calerrb?” I screamed slurring every word without any attempt to hide my intoxication. “Is everything ok Jason?” “Do you need help with something?” More screaming and slurring from my end, “Listen dude, listen, I want to prepare my mommas body for the funeral, I’ll be up there tomorrow to do it, kee?” “Umm Jason I don’t think that would be appropriate and I think what you are asking of me will not contribute to your healing process in a positive way.” “Ahhhhh fuck yooooouuu Calerb!” I exclaimed. “Ok well you’re obviously drunk. Jason I understand your frustration, just sleep it off and we will talk tomorrow.” I threw my phone down in a rage without even hanging up. I then proceeded to scream hateful things about him, which I do not know if he herd or not, but I honestly I don’t care and it wouldn’t matter anymore if I did.
The next morning was miserable. To my awakening I found myself lying on the floor accompanied by that well-known “trainwreck” hang over. I’ve had a few hangovers in my days but never like this. I sat myself up against my bed while trying to recall everything that happened in the previous night. I remembered getting shit faced but nothing more, so I decided a relaxing shower would help it come back to me. Standing there it hit me. “That’s right I had called Caleb! Oh shit what all did I say?” I quickly finished up so I could check my cell phone to confirm the thought. I found it behind my bed covered in dried up vomit, “great” I thought. I managed to clean the remaining discharge but I am positive the smell is forever embedded into the inside component’s, just my luck huh? There it was in my call history, a 20 minute ongoing call with the psycho (that’s his contact name). 1 unread message from “the psycho” displayed up in my notification bar. It read, “Jason call me when you get this we need to talk, love Caleb.” I was puzzled. Why the fuck did I call him last night? It’s as if I had blacked out the whole phone conversation. “I guess I need to call and figure all of this out.”

I’m a huge fan of classical music such as; orchestra, aria/opera, famous compositions from Beethoven, Franz Wohlfahrt, etcetera, but son of a bitch do I hate Caleb’s ring back tone of Fur Elise. I used to adore this beautiful masterpiece, but somehow he made me despise every fucking note. After 1 minute and 30 agonizing seconds he answered. “Jason?” Why would he waste my time questioning me with his disgusting voice if he already knew it was me, does he ever check his caller id? “Yes, you wanted to speak with me sir?” I questioned back. “Yeah umm I just wanted to talk about last night. You were a bit intoxicated and forgive me if I upset you. You requested to prepare your mother’s body for her funeral.” “Yeah I’m so sorry I don’t remember that I was very drunk, I apologize for that Mr. Hatmaker.” “Oh its ok we’ve all had those nights before. I’m happy to see you realized it just wasn’t an appropriate thing.” It all came back to me, I remembered parts of the conversation and my demented wish. Then I thought, “the fucking nerve this guy has.” He tells me he’s glad I realized the error of my ways, well fuck him. “What do you mean I realized it was inappropriate” I snapped back at him. “I beg your pardon?” Ugh, his annoying questions, they make me want to barf. “I still want this, I know I may seem like a lunatic to you but to me this is important.” I was improvising at this point. “Jason as your friend and your boss (he put a lot of emphasis on the word boss) I forbid you to do any such thing.” The tone of his voice sounded defensive thus giving me the impression there is some sort of secret involved. Now I’m curious, time to put all the years of reading detective comics to good use. I assumed it would be a good idea to agree and throw him off guard, I guess it’s time to use what I learned in drama club from high school. I burst into tears spontaneously, “God Mr. Hatmaker your right, this is over the line and I can’t do this, what was I thinking? I’m so sorry I put you in this spot and caused an uncomfortable situation for you. I’m such a fool.” I sobbed without shame. “Jason you are not stupid. You are the most brilliant young man I’ve had the pleasure to meet and work with. This kind of thing happens to everyone, God knows I have went through this. Now don’t let me ever catch you talking down about yourself again.” “Sorry sir it won’t happen again, I promise.” I said trying to sound promising. “That’s what I like to hear! Jason just please get some rest and go easy on the booze, it’s not good for you. I will see you at the funeral Saturday.” I kept picturing him saying this with a smile on his face. “Ok Mr. Hatmaker, have a good day.” I was almost ashamed of myself for kissing his ass, but it was necessary. “Oh and Jason its Caleb to you.” “Yes sir, sorry, goodbye.” It was a great success. Now that I threw him off guard he will not be expecting me. This is my chance to get to the bottom of all of my suspicions, I knew for sure I was going to find something out. I knew I would expose him for whatever evil mischief things he was hiding. 

I was like a Special Forces navy seal preparing for his mission. I gathered my trusty 9mm handgun with my shoulder holster, my old timer pocket knife that my dad gave me when I was ten years old, and finally my steel toed boots, just in case I needed to give a powerful kick to something. I was ready to go to the Green Valley Funeral Home, I was ready to uncover the truth, but before I left I needed to request some special help. I got down on my knees for what could possibly be the last time, and prayed. “God I know I’m not the best person in the world but I think I’m doing something good here, please guide me and keep me safe from whatever I might face at the funeral home, and if I do fail and maybe even die, please don’t send me to hell, sincerely with love, Jason.” I now felt more confident than Rambo. 

It didn’t take long to arrive, 10 minutes at the max. Which is unusual. Typically it takes about 20 minutes from my house, I guess I was too busy thinking about what might be in store for me so it must have made the duration of the trip seem quicker. There I was in the parking lot, panicking. I didn’t have much confidence at the time most likely from my anxiety disorders. Staring at the entrance with hundreds of thoughts rushing through my head, all kinds of different scenarios were agitating my nerves and making it worse. I gave myself a quick pep talk and said fuck it, let’s do this!

Palms sweating and shaking I reached for the doorknob of the entrance, trying to make as little sound as possible to avoid alerting Caleb. There are no type of alarms to let him know I was here, also we are the only two people who run the place, besides the janitor that comes after hours. So I knew staying silent was the main goal of my mission. The funeral home was dead silent as usual so it made being stealthy quite difficult, especially with the occasional squeaky floor board. I finally made my way to the entrance of the morgue, the door was already slightly open. “He must be working on someone” I thought.  

I peaked my head into the door and what I saw before me was the beginning of a homicide. My mother’s body was on the table lying in a pool of blood. She had been mangled and dismembered. Her stomach had been torn open in a sloppy savage way, her small intestines along with many other vital organs were lying next to her. On top of her was Caleb, completely nude and thrusting into my mother. My heart skipped a beat. I had expected to find many things but never this. I couldn’t even imagine such a horrible thing. My whole body shook I could feel my face burning my fist squeezing so tight they felt like they were going to bleed, my raw animal instinct was coming. I pushed myself towards him trying to stay quiet I wanted to take him by surprise. I grabbed his red ponytail and jerked back with all my strength sending us both crazing down to the floor. I quickly got myself up and grabbed his hair once again. I spotted a nearby scalpel and put it to his throat. He laughed, the stupid fuck started laughing hissing even. “You want an explanation I’m guessing? I told you not to come down here Jason.” “im going to fucking kill you, you fucking sick son of a bitch.” I screamed and strained so hard my whole head was shaking my face was on fire, I knew my screams could be heard throughout the funeral home. I even startled myself a little, I felt like a monster, I had never raised my voice in such a way before. I didn’t even know I was capable of this. “You don’t have it in you,” he said laughing. This fueled my anger even more, I’m glad he said this it sure helped. I’m punched him in the face and he went straight the ground with a broken and bloody nose. I mounted him and used the scalpel to slash away at his face but controlling myself to not kill him, I wanted keep him alive for a long time, I wanted to play. With each slash more and more blood squirted onto my face, I kept my eyes closed to keep it out of my eyes. This was the first time I enjoyed Caleb’s voice, his screams of pain sounded like music to my ears. “Please stop I’ve had enough, please!” I stopped because I didn’t want to accidently hit any major veins in his neck. I turned him around and slashed both of his Achilles tendons just so he couldn’t run away from me. He was constantly screaming “Jason please stop! I’m sorry!” I ignored every word I had turned into a killing machine. I cut away at both is legs leaving them a mangled mess of meat and bone. I then moved to his dorsal cavity and made small incisions so he would lose more blood to make him weaker, but I didn’t want him to bleed out, not yet. I moved down to his penis and cut it off along with his testicles. Louder high pitch screams came from him. I knew now he would bleed out soon so I should work on torturing him a little more. I cut at all of the sensitive nerve points I knew on his body just to inflict more pain. I propped his head up on my knee and put a hand on his lower jaw and upper. I pulled the opposite way on each hand trying to break his lower jaw, I could feel him resisting, his lower jaw was too strong. I threw his head onto the ground and raised my boot into a kicking position. With full force I kicked his lower jaw and broke it completely free, it has now lost all function. I picked his head up and shoved my fist as hard as I possibly could into his mouth, I could feel my arm making its way down his esophagus. He was chocking and coughing trying to plead for me to stop. I kept going full force. My arm had completely blocked his airway so his chocking ceased. It didn’t take him long to suffocate which disappointed me.

Looking down at his mangled body gave me a great feeling of justice. I looked around the morgue and saw things I didn’t see earlier. There were more bodies. All dismembered and covered in semen and blood. There was a small portable gas stove on the ground with a piece of human flesh sitting in the skillet. How much worse can this get? I thought.  I thought it would be a good idea to leave a note for the police to let them know who he was. So I went to office to fetch a pen and some paper. Searching through his doors I found a key to his safe. I opened and found numerous locks of hair and teeth, it’s like he was keeping them as trophies. I found what looked like a photo album that I believe may be bound in human flesh. Inside were hundreds of pictures of Caleb posing with dead bodies and violating them, but none of them seemed to be in the gory mangled state my mother was in, he went all out on her. Why did he have to worse things to her? Many of the cadavers in the photos were people I knew and worked on a little myself. I couldn’t take anymore. I needed to finish up as soon as possible. I sat down at his desk to write a note for the police letting them know I was a vigilante getting rid of the scum of the earth. I avoided writing my hand writing just in case this was linked back to me.

 I carried the safe and note back to the morgue and lied them beside his body. I then retraced my all my steps with a rag to wipe all my finger prints towards the murder but none in the places I work so it won’t look like I was involved, after all I just work here right? After I cleaned as much blood as I possibly could from myself I left and went straight home. I spend the next three days in bed. I was disgusted with myself for doing all of those horrible things. I kept thinking, “am I a just as much of a monster as Caleb Hatmaker?” I couldn’t be, what I did was a good thing. I just kept telling myself this, I tried to assure myself that this feeling would pass soon.

The incident was all over the news. Later that day sheriff Kacey was knocking on my door as I expected. I opened the door and greeted him. “Hi there, can I help you with something sheriff?” I was trying so hard not to panic, I couldn’t stop my limbs from shaking, it was very obvious. The little voice in my head kept telling me, “oh you’ve done it now Jason he’s going to catch you.” “Your Jason Bozinsky right?” He asked in a stern voice. “Yes sir that is correct, come on in sir and make yourself at home. Now is something wrong?” I could even detect to fear in my own voice, I’m sure he could too. He stepped inside and I closed the door behind him. “Mr. Bozinsky are you aware that your boss Caleb Hatmaker was murdered a few days ago?” My heart started to pound. I tried to sound surprised and frightened. “What? When did this happen? Who did this? Can you give me some details?” “Well we don’t know who did it yet but it turns out that your boss Caleb was a pretty sick person. He has eaten and had sex with hundreds of corpses and we believe he may have been a serial killer also.” I tried to play along and look clueless. I sat down on my couch and put my head into my hands. “I just can’t believe any of this sheriff, I just saw him not long ago, he gave me some time off work because my mother died.” “Yeah I thought so, that’s one thing I wanted to talk to you about, your mother.” He began to tell me about the things he did to my mother, I burst out into tears but they weren’t fake, it just brought back all the pain all over again. Kacey sat down beside me. “Jason we checked Caleb’s phone records and you were the last person to speak with him, we also have a witness saying they saw your car leaving the scene at the time of his death.” His voice wasn’t stern anymore, it was compassionate. “I don’t know what you’re talking about, are you trying to say I did this?” “Jason I know you were the one who killed him, but I want you to know I don’t blame you one damn bit. There is more evidence that points towards you that will eventually lead to your arrest. “Your right I’m not going to hide it, I’m not ashamed of what I did, I did this town a favor and everyone is going to be on my side.” I said defending myself.” Kacey smiled and said, “Jason don’t worry I have an interview with the press at 5:00 and I’m letting them know I’m closing the case, there is no evidence for us to go on and the killer has most likely fled the state, therefore it is out of my hands.” “Are you serious? How can I ever repay you for this?” It was such a generous thing he was doing for me, I wanted to repay him somehow. “You’re joking right? You don’t need to repay me in anyway Jason Bozinsky, you have done more for this town than I have or any other sheriff has. You truly are a hero.” I just couldn’t believe what he was saying to me. I was getting off the hook and now I’m looked at as a hero. Kacey stood up and walked to the door but before leaving he turned around and said, “Now get some rest you’re going to need it to run the funeral home once it gets cleaned up and reopened.” I was a little confused. “What do you mean sheriff?” I’m going to make arrangements with mayor to make sure you gain ownership of the funeral home, you deserve it and plus you’re the only person in this town that can run it.” I smiled at him and thanked him, “thank you sheriff, I really appreciate what you’re doing for me.” “No problem,” he said smiling, he tipped his cowboy hat as a wave goodbye and left. 

The sheriff and I both feel that I have restored this town, I fixed a major flaw. Although the sheriff and myself are the only two people in the whole world that know the secret victory, I’m sure the rest of the town would be proud of me for what I have done. Overall this has been one big cluster fuck of madness. I’ve lost my mom, the most important person in my life, but then again I look at it like she was sacrificed so I could do something great for my life and the other resident’s lives here as well. Caroline Bozinsky died so I could fix this now near perfect town. My mother’s sacrifice gave me the opportunity of a stable job that is now the basic building blocks of starting a family. My mother is still doing things for me from the grave.

22h9li,1,2014-04-07,I need advice on my college decision. I'm sutck between 2 schools...,[deleted],college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/22h9li/i_need_advice_on_my_college_decision_im_sutck/,"Hullo. I am a high-school senior. I live in the suburbs of a relatively large city in the United States. I come from an upper-middle class background. My family has 4 members, including me.

I am currently in a dilemma, that is very discouraging to me. I have currently been in the long process of deciding what University I wish to attend in the coming fall. I have narrowed my options down to two colleges, yet I feel that I am at a grid-lock point in my decision. I'm sure my case is one that many can relate to. I'm not looking for any definitive decision, just some more perspectives.
This is my situation:

I have a weighted GPA of 4.3. I got a 31 on my ACT. I have been involved in my high schools music program, and my church's mission work. I am also an Eagle Scout. I am taking 3 AP classes this year, and have taken 2 in previous years (receiving a 5 on both)

In college I hope to study History, and perhaps double-major or minor in International Studies or Political Science. Graduate School is probable for me as well.

(Note: I am not really interested in partying, nor am i considering that a factor in my decision)

As I mentioned, I am currently stuck between two schools. The first college is a large state university, I'll refer to it as StateU. The other is a small Liberal Arts school, which will henceforth be called LA-U.

StateU is a very large, very popular university in my state. The school is know nation-wide, largely for its sports programs.
 I have grown up with much exposure to the school. My feelings towards the school have always been rather negative. The sports fans for this school are rather obnoxious. I am also bothered by the fact that many students from my high school will be attending this college also. For me I have seen StateU as a very cliche option for higher education.
 During my visits to this school, I learned more about what StateU offers academically. I was impressed. StateU has a good History program, and has much flexibility to double-major. Their career guidance programs also seem good, with some connections to international work as well, an area I am very interested in.
The cost of attendance (tuition+other fees)  at StateU would be about $20,000 per year. However I received a full-tuition scholarship from StateU, and would only pay about $10,000 per year to attend.

LA-U is a tiny liberal arts school, that is about the same distance from my home as StateU is. I had never heard of LA-U until my college search. My mother stumbled upon LA-U while searching for some smaller schools online.
 I visited LA-U without knowing what to expect. I was blown away.  LA-U has a nice History program, but is more focused on the broad skills developed by a liberal arts degree rather than knowing/memorizing specific History facts. I really saw this same Liberal Arts concept/mission everywhere in LA-U, and I loved it. One student specifically said that a college degree isn't meant to train you for a specific job, but to develop the tools so you can do any job. 
Speaking of jobs, I was completely astounded with the Career development program the LA-U used. They have strong connections with alumni to offer many internships, and work with the student from day one on looking forward to the career the want to seek. They have mock interviews and individual counselor to help develop your interviewing and career-exploration.
LA-U appears to be an academically rigorous university (a good thing in my opinion), more so than StateU.
I enjoyed the small campus environment of LA-U, but I would not say that campus size is a major factor in my opinion.
I perhaps feel as though my liberal-arts major of History would be well suited in a Liberal Arts college like LA-U.

The biggest conflict is in price. LA-U's cost of attendance would be about $60,000 per year. I did receive scholarship money worth about $20,000 per year. I would be hit with a price tag of about $40,000. I did not receive any need-based aid.

My family does not have the kind of money for LA-U saved, and I would have to take out student loans to attend LA-U, while I would not have to for StateU.

If you couldn't tell, LA-U is the college would really like to attend, and that I could be excited about. While I am appalled with the idea of attending StateU, (the college I've grown up dreading) they are a nice college academically. At the same time, I just feel as though StateU isn't very ""me"". I find it hard to picture myself attending StateU. But the ability to get out of college without major debts and loans seems like a major advantage for life after college. With the distinct possibility of grad school, this is also a major plus.

I know I should not judge StateU based off the notions I've held about it in the past, and more on my experience with it, but I have a difficult time dispelling these negative feelings towards it. I imagine myself being very embarrassed to tell my peers that I am attending StateU, and would likely avoid discussing my decision with most people because I this same embarrassment.

Maybe this is a conflict between the head (logic) and the heart(feelings).  My strong desire is LA-U, but StateU seems more realistic.

If you have advice/a new idea/a new outlook/encouragement/anything really, that would be greatly appreciated. I am currently loosing much sleep over this decision, and need some more outlooks.

If you have any questions for me, plead feel free to ask!
 Thank you!"

How to become an Oil and gas Accountant and work in Southeast Asian countries such as Bangkok Thailand, KL Malaysia, Singapore, Jakarta Indonesia and many more.

Westhill Consulting Career and Employment gives you the following tips to become a successful accountant in Southeast Asia.

**http://www.westhillconsulting-career.com/blog/2014/04/08/become-oil-gas-accountant/**

**Oil and Gas Accountant Career and Education Requirements**
Accountants review financial records, analyze spending habits and suggests ways to increase revenue. Information from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) showed that there are several different types of accountants, including management accountants and certified public accountants (CPAs). Businesses hire management accountants to deal with internal financial decisions and budgeting concerns. Organizations hire CPAs to prepare taxes or other financial documents that must be reported to government agencies.

Oil and gas industries have to submit a lot of paperwork to government authorities, so they may hire management accountants who are also licensed CPAs. Basic career requirements for becoming a CPA include completing a four-year degree program, gaining accounting experience and passing the CPA exam. The following table displays a more detailed list of requirements for becoming an oil and gas CPA:
 
**Step 1: Earn a Dual Degree**
Although the BLS shows that accountants only need a bachelor's degree to find employment, the majority of states have changed their educational requirements for certified public accountants (CPAs). The BLS records from 2012 indicated that most states require CPA applicants to meet the minimum educational requirements of 150 units of postsecondary coursework, whereas a traditional bachelor's degree is only 120 units. Thirty additional post-baccalaureate units are equivalent to a master's degree.


Warning! Dual degree programs allow students to complete bachelor's and master's degree programs in five years instead of six. Before starting graduate level classes, some schools may require students to complete prerequisite courses or pass exams. Course topics in these dual degree programs may include micro and macroeconomics, cost accounting, financial management, auditing, operations management, accounting information systems, marketing, taxation rules and business law.

Success Tip:
Take oil and gas accounting courses. Not every degree program offers courses directly related to the oil and gas industries. Some universities offer elective courses in these fields, and a few colleges even offer related certificate programs. Most oil and gas courses and certificate programs discuss the energy market, global issues, financial management strategies, petroleum accounting and domestic natural gas accounting.

**Step 2: Build Industry Experience**
The BLS recommends that college students complete as many accounting internships as possible to gain the experience needed for CPA licensing requirements. Furthermore, job postings listed in August 2012 onCareerBuilder.com for oil and gas accountants showed that employers preferred applicants with at least 3-5 years of experience in the industry.

Not all colleges require students to complete internships, but many colleges help students find accounting internship opportunities. Universities that have coursework or certificate programs related to oil and gas accounting may have direct contact with industry leaders.


**Success Tip:**
Attend industry lectures. Representatives from some of the largest oil and gas companies are often asked to be guest lecturers in business and accounting classes. During these lectures, students have the opportunity to ask questions about individual companies and industry accounting practices. Many representatives also offer internship opportunities that may lead to full employment.

**Step 3: Become a CPA**
Individuals become licensed CPAs in their state of employment, and each state has slightly different licensing requirements. In most states, license applicants have to meet education and experience requirements to be eligible to take exams. Experience requirements vary, but most states require applicants to have 1-2 years of approved accounting experience.

The BLS stated that, after meeting eligibility requirements, individuals must pass the uniform CPA examination, offered by the American Institute of CPAs (AICPA). Information from the AICPA website indicated that the exam consists of four parts: financial accounting and reporting (FAR); auditing and attestation (AUD); regulations (REG); and business environment and concepts (BEC).
 

**Step 4: Find Employment as an Oil &amp; Gas Accountant**
CPAs who have enough related experience and training can start applying for oil and gas accountant positions. Complaints can be made to the relevant governing bodies in each country. Predictions from the BLS showed that up through 2020, open positions for accountants and auditors will increase by 16%. Competition for accounting positions is expected to remain high. Accountants who are licensed CPAs will most likely have better job opportunities, per BLS reports.


**Step 5: Maintain CPA License**
Information from the BLS stated that accountants who are CPAs must maintain their licenses by meeting renewal requirements, which often include paying fees and completing approved continued-education courses. Each state has different requirements for what counts as approved coursework. Some states may require CPAs to attend formal classes or conferences, whereas other states may allow individuals to learn from interactive web-based seminars or individual study programs.

22hh4y,31,2014-04-07,No Internship. Difficult to get a job?,ohThisUsername,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/22hh4y/no_internship_difficult_to_get_a_job/,"I recently found this subreddit and I have *tons* of questions but I'll start with my most basic one today.

I'm currently just finishing up my 3rd year of a Computer Science degree with a concentration in Software Engineering, and also a business-related Minor to pad my resume. While probably 95% of all people in my year are heading off to do internships next year, I am not. Since my first year I have been determined to finish school as quickly as possible so I can get a job sooner even if that means skipping a year of doing an internship. I was once talking with a graduated Engineer who said she got a job without an internship while all her classmates did internships, so I kinda felt relaxed. 

It's only really dawned on me in the last couple months that it was probably a bad idea to skip the internship. Based on my experience at school, I seem to have more applicable programming knowledge than most of my classmates (I've been programming since about 14 years old), however I don't have any professional experience, or personal projects to prove to employers I know what I am doing. I'll be competing with these other people who have done an internship.

My current GPA is also pretty low at 2.7, but I should be able to get it past 3.0 by the time I graduate.

TLDR; Didn't do an internship, will it be hard to find a job?

Anyone here have experience with getting a job without an internship? Was it difficult?

It's not my dream job but it's a start. I've enjoyed the internship for the most part, and I feel I've learned a lot from it. This has been my only professional experience in programming. The initial internship period of 3 months ends soon, but they've offered to keep me on part time (up to 30 hours a week) for another 3 months, after which they would bring me on as a full time employee.

This would all sound great to me, except for the fact that I was expecting a higher salary then what they are offering for the full time position. I am currently making $12/hr for the internship, which I am happy with considering it's an internship. When I inquired about the starting salary if I accepted the full time position in three months, at first I was told it would be the same. When I raised my concerns with this amount, they said they could offer as high as $13/hr.

So my question is, is this a typical starting salary for someone with just an Associates Degree? From what I've read, the general consensus is that an Associates in this field is pretty useless. Should I be happy I can even find a job without a Bachelor's degree? I'm probably going to stay with them for the extra three months part time so I can finish school, but I'd like to scope out my options upon graduation. Am I wasting my time applying for other jobs without a Bachelor's degree or more experience?"

22hmq6,2,2014-04-07,Summer internship prospects and CS / coding in general,sfake,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/22hmq6/summer_internship_prospects_and_cs_coding_in/,"I'm a college freshman who's been programming since ~8th grade, but rather sporadically, because I prioritized academics to the extreme. I'm at an excellent school with great STEM and CS programs, I've worked two coding internships during previous summers, and I'm currently working a web development job for a professor on campus. I'm looking for work for this coming summer, but I have a few problems:

* I shot myself in the foot by not taking any CS courses this year, putting me at a disadvantage relative to my peers.
* I'm only a freshman. Based on my experience, employers who say they're looking for ""undergraduates"" really mean they're looking for juniors and seniors.
* I'm still (perhaps irrationally) really focused on academics, and (perhaps more rationally) on spending time with friends, so much so that I have little (read: no) time to code or work on side projects. For that matter, I sometimes think I don't even enjoy side-projects. I know that I have loved coding in the past, and there are aspects of it that still really appeal to me, but there's a lot of drudgery involved, and it's hard to get myself to put in the 2-3 hours per day to actually get stuff done (15 minutes / day does nothing at all). My ""lack of time"" is also making me unable to fulfill the additional ""requirements"" of blogging, tweeting, posting to github, and generally being active in Internet communities -- all things I would like to do more of, though. I want to go into CS and software engineering as a career, but hell, I don't want to code in my free-time that much atm -- or, if I decide to, I'm going to somehow need to manage my class work and coding, which I have absolutely no idea how to do.

22hmu6,2,2014-04-08,Would it be feasible to migrate our site from NationBuilder to Wordpress? Asking for advice and help in this thread.,BrianBoyko,WordpressPlugins,https://www.reddit.com/r/WordpressPlugins/comments/22hmu6/would_it_be_feasible_to_migrate_our_site_from/,"I work for a non-partisan political activist organization dedicated to reforming money in politics.  (And for the record, I'm a Democrat, my supervisor is a moderate Republican.) 

First off, feel free to contact me directly at brian.boyko@gmail.com if you think you can help.  Volunteers would be nice, we're reform activists, which means that the guys with deep pockets aren't the guys who want us to succeed. 

Before I came on, the organization built a website using NationBuilder; which allowed us to get up and running very quickly.  However, we're finding that while the CRM (Customer Relationship manager) tools are good, the CMS is rather lousy, and has caused me, personally, no end of headaches.

It has been suggested that we move to WordPress.  Using WordPress's CMS with NationBuilder's CRM would be an ideal option, but NationBuilder does not offer APIs or integration.  We're trying to find other options. 

*While this post has been crossposted to /r/WordPress and /r/Webdev, I thought I'd post here for recommendations specifically on what plugins to use that would meet these goals.  I've heard about CiviCRM and BuddyPress - would these be the right ones, or would it be better to use other ones?* 

Here's what we need.

* We need to be able to allow people to sign up with the site.
* We need to be able to allow people to sign a petition within the site.
* We need people to be able to donate money
* Because one of our tools is an annual walk, we need to be able to pledge donations per-mile.
* We need people to set up their own donation pages.  
* We need to be able to search our supporter database by criteria such as address, area code, etc. 
    * In fact, we specifically need to be able to create filters based on those searches such as ""within 30 miles of City, State"" or ""with 30 miles of ZIP"" for event invitations. 
* We need to be able to send (non-spam) bulk e-mails to our list of supporters (sometimes based on the above filters) 
* We need to be able to send texts to our supports who sign up for text messages, and to receive texts from supporters asking them to sign up.  
* We are also working on a mobile app that would allow supporters to upload videos automatically.  We'd like to be able to post them to a section of the site for an intern to go through and confirm, with date, time, and if possible, geolocation data. 

Here are some nice-to-haves:

* We'd like tracking codes for e-mail links especially to donation pages. 
* We'd like to process payments using credit cards, paypal, bitcoin and dogecoin. 
* We would like to be able to offer our walkers specific personal blogs where they can embed videos and photos from services such as YouTube, Facebook, and Flickr while they are on the walk. 

We have thought about using CiviCRM, but I don't yet have experience with it.  I'm looking for advice on how to approach this problem from more experienced hands. I'd also know what you think of BuddyPress and whether that would be overkill for our needs.  

How would you approach this problem? Any and all advice would be appreciated.

22hne9,5,2014-04-08,"Cannibalism, Necrophilia, and Possibly Murder in the Rue Morgue.",tustus28,DarkTales,https://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTales/comments/22hne9/cannibalism_necrophilia_and_possibly_murder_in/,"The whole entire week felt like one big blur. I had two dips left in my can of Copenhagen, half of a hydrocodone, a waded up bag with a few pieces of good cannabis inside, an almost empty eight ball, and a few sips of whiskey left in a bottle of Donny Donell. I had really over indulged this time. I was trying so hard to numb the pain of my lost loved one. I needed to cope with the sudden overwhelming change, and of course it didn’t help. No matter how many illicit substances I consumed, the pain was still there, slowly consuming me whole like a python does with its prey. Just goes to show the useless role drugs have in my life. Is there even a real way to deal with death? 
Last Friday I got a text message from my aunt telling me I needed to come home for there was a family emergency. Upon my arrival home, I was greeted with a driveway and lawn packed full of cars, I knew something was wrong. Once I parked I put my hands together and prayed, “God please don’t give me the news that I have lost someone else, you have taken so many people away from me, please don’t do this to me again!” I got out of my car nonchalantly trying to keep my nerves calm. I saw Darrel (a close family friend) walking around the yard talking on the phone. I threw my hand up and waved along with my typical greeting to friends. “Hey man!” I yelled. He gave me a quick look then his eyes went back to the ground as he continued talking on his cell phone. I couldn’t help but overhear his conversation. “I don’t know momma I reckon it was someone on dope or they were drunk or something, yeah I know, yeah.” After hearing this I faded away into my own thoughts. “Yeah someone has died.” I thought to myself. I took a deep breath and prepared myself for the worst. I was thinking maybe my father was coming back from one of his little “parities” and one of his friends was most likely over intoxicated as usual, thus causing a car crash in which my father was the fatality.
As soon as I put my hand on the door knob it opened. There stood my dad; face blood red, tears pouring from his eyes like a waterfall, an almost solid white snot drooping down from his nose. He grabbed me and pulled me towards him and held me there. I was almost in shock. Never in my life has my father shown this kind of physical affection towards me. “Your mother died in a car accident this morning son,” he said in an almost nonexistent quivering voice. My whole body went limp, my mind went completely blank. I couldn’t comprehend and process the devastating news he had just gave me. I don’t know how long I was there in front of the door with my dad, but eventually I came to the realization I had to get up. I forced myself up to my feet and then the reality train hit me harder than it ever has before. I jerked my glasses off and burst into tears as I tried to make my way for the comforting sanctuary that is my home.

 The living room was overflowing with people, they were packed in like sardines. All of them were staring at me with faces full of sorrow and pity. I felt so humiliated, I can’t stand it when people see me cry. I tried to maneuver my around obstacles to get  to my room, stepping over people’s feet, tripping over the rug, squeezing past chairs in the dead silence.it was the most awkward situation I had ever been in. Full of rage along with a hateful attitude I locked myself in my room. At the moment I didn’t want to see another person’s face nor deal with any of their bullshit hollow apologizes or their unfaithful promises to help.

A loud knock along with a familiar (and very unsettling) high pitched voice rattled my door. “Hey buddy its Caleb, I just wanted to see if you were ok.” Caleb is the undertaker/mortician at the Green Valley Funeral Home. This ridiculous looking man stands around 5’5, about 170 pounds, long blood red hair that’s usually kept in a ponytail, followed by freckles head to toe, and he has the most insidious laugh a person ever could have. On the outside Caleb seems like a friendly charming guy, but ever since I’ve been working under his supervision, something’s been telling me there is a dark and evil presence lurking around inside him. It may be just a crazy thought from my judgmental human nature, but it’s a thought I can’t seem to shake. Unfortunately Caleb Hatmaker is also my boss. I have an internship at the funeral home as a mortician’s assistant. I unlocked my door and welcomed him in. “I’m so sorry for your loss Jason, this was so unexpected I just couldn’t believe it when I was told. “Listen if there is anything you need just let me know,” he claimed. That’s exactly what I didn’t want to hear. It was the reason why I locked myself in my room, to escape from that untruthful statement. Damn if I had a dollar for every time someone told me that over the past few weeks. “Ok thank you Mr. Hatmaker, I appreciate it.” I said looking down at him, he is a very short man compared to me. “What did I tell you about calling Mr. Hatmaker?” “It’s Caleb to you, ok?” he said with that disgusting grin emerging on his face. “Sorry sir I keep forgetting.” We discussed work for a moment and he told me to take a week off, I thanked him and showed him out. I walked back to my bed to lay down and continue sobbing and wallowing in my own pain.

No one seemed to understand the severity of my situation. I had just lost my wonderful mother. The woman that was looked at by many as a saint, is now gone forever. I felt so hopeless, my whole world had been turned upside down within a 24 hour period. There were two exhausting thoughts that constantly looped through my mind on my week off from work. “I miss my mother so much” was the worst one. It was just a constant reminder that she is now dead. The woman I love more than anyone else in the world will soon merely be another forgotten corpse rotting in the ground. The other nagging thought that will also most likely aid in my downfall to a path of depression and alcoholism was assisting the other in pestering me. “What am I going to do now?” My mother was the person that took care of us all. While dad was at work I would be at school and going to work right after, and there she was at home. She was always working towards making the best damn home anyone could ever come to. All of our clothes were washed, never a trace of dirt could be found inside, and that cooking, my God! You could never ask to come home to a better meal then what came from my mother’s kitchen. There is no doubt in my mind that I lived in every man’s idea of utopia. I never took my mother’s troubles for granted, I always gave her the gratitude she deserved unlike my father who didn’t. I just couldn’t stop thinking how could I ever match up with my mom’s outstanding performance? How can I possible keep up with the cooking and cleaning? Especially being in school and working every day.
 By day two on my week of recovery allowed by Caleb, I knew I couldn’t bear the rest of the week without some type of crutch. I called up my father’s friend Mac, he’s a well-known drug dealer in our town. He answered after just a few rings. As soon as I told him who I was he automatically knew what I was perusing. “What all do you need and how much do you need?” He asked in a professional tone of voice. “15 of those blue speckles, bring me 3 grams of the snow that came from the snow storm a few days ago, a small bag of that special herb from your garden (I was aware of his garden because I have heard my father compliment him on his growing skills), and a bottle of the highest proof whiskey available.” I tried to talk in code the best I could. Usually when he hung out with my dad I would frequently hear his paranoid ramblings of the police tapping his phone. “Ok buddy I’ll be there as fast as I can.” This was the first time I actually detected some real promise in someone’s voice since my mother’s passing. Not even an hour later he was knocking on the door. Opening the door he immediately greeted me with a comforting hug. Mac is probably the most caring drug dealer I have ever encountered. He Knew I didn’t invite him for small talk. I could tell he was trying to get to the point as fast as possible. He handed me a shopping bag containing my supplies with a friendly smile on his face saying, “don’t worry I won’t tell your dad about this I remember what it was like when I lost my mother.” “Mac you have no idea how much I appreciate you doing this man, how much do I owe you?” “Nothing at all, you and your whole family have helped me more times than I can count on my fingers and toes combined, don’t sweat it kid.” I insisted he took my money, but there was no point in trying anymore with the stubborn old man. “Well the least you could do is sit down with me and do a few lines of this blow.” I said smiling while pulling out the white gold. “Well it looks like you got me there, how could I pass that up?” He sat down next to me as I cut out 6 lines, I knew this was going to cheer me up. After a while he announced he had to get home to his old lady before she started calling. We said our goodbyes and he wished me plenty of good luck and then he was out the door before I knew it. My over indulging had started. This is when the drugs started to take hold of my mind, rendering my ability to rationalize. 

It was probably the drugs causing my brain to produce and entertain the insane thought but I was determined to go for it. I wanted to prepare my mother’s body for the funeral. Most of you are probably thinking what the hell is wrong with you? I really don’t know, but now that I look back at it with a sober mind I realize it was fucked up, but please understand it was the best decision I’ve ever made. If I hadn’t wanted this, I would have never been able to stop the sickening and depraved acts that were occurring in the Green Valley Funeral Home. 

I lost count of how many shots of whiskey I had. The onset of the stuff was fast, I could compare its strength to Everclear. I sat and practiced what I was going to say to Caleb for about 10 minutes. I then frantically searched for my phone. I’m sure my mother would have been ashamed to see me stumbling around the house in that manner. Once I found my phone I did a small victory dance to celebrate my accomplishment, afterword’s I called Caleb immediately. I felt like I was stuck listening to his Fur Elise ring back tone for an eternity. Eventually he answered. His scraggly high pitched voice lunged into my ears from the other line. “Hello?” Hearing his voice triggered my gag reflex and caused me to drop my phone and vomit all over the floor. I could hear his voice carrying throughout my room as if he was standing there next to me. “Jason is that you?” “Hey are you alright?” I scooped up my phone from what looked like pure concentrated bile on the floor.  “What the heel took ye so damn long Calerrb?” I screamed slurring every word without any attempt to hide my intoxication. “Is everything ok Jason?” “Do you need help with something?” More screaming and slurring from my end, “Listen dude, listen, I want to prepare my mommas body for the funeral, I’ll be up there tomorrow to do it, kee?” “Umm Jason I don’t think that would be appropriate and I think what you are asking of me will not contribute to your healing process in a positive way.” “Ahhhhh fuck yooooouuu Calerb!” I exclaimed. “Ok well you’re obviously drunk. Jason I understand your frustration, just sleep it off and we will talk tomorrow.” I threw my phone down in a rage without even hanging up. I then proceeded to scream hateful things about him, which I do not know if he herd or not, but I honestly I don’t care and it wouldn’t matter anymore if I did.
The next morning was miserable. To my awakening I found myself lying on the floor accompanied by that well-known “trainwreck” hang over. I’ve had a few hangovers in my days but never like this. I sat myself up against my bed while trying to recall everything that happened in the previous night. I remembered getting shit faced but nothing more, so I decided a relaxing shower would help it come back to me. Standing there it hit me. “That’s right I had called Caleb! Oh shit what all did I say?” I quickly finished up so I could check my cell phone to confirm the thought. I found it behind my bed covered in dried up vomit, “great” I thought. I managed to clean the remaining discharge but I am positive the smell is forever embedded into the inside component’s, just my luck huh? There it was in my call history, a 20 minute ongoing call with the psycho (that’s his contact name). 1 unread message from “the psycho” displayed up in my notification bar. It read, “Jason call me when you get this we need to talk, love Caleb.” I was puzzled. Why the fuck did I call him last night? It’s as if I had blacked out the whole phone conversation. “I guess I need to call and figure all of this out.”

I’m a huge fan of classical music such as; orchestra, aria/opera, famous compositions from Beethoven, Franz Wohlfahrt, etcetera, but son of a bitch do I hate Caleb’s ring back tone of Fur Elise. I used to adore this beautiful masterpiece, but somehow he made me despise every fucking note. After 1 minute and 30 agonizing seconds he answered. “Jason?” Why would he waste my time questioning me with his disgusting voice if he already knew it was me, does he ever check his caller id? “Yes, you wanted to speak with me sir?” I questioned back. “Yeah umm I just wanted to talk about last night. You were a bit intoxicated and forgive me if I upset you. You requested to prepare your mother’s body for her funeral.” “Yeah I’m so sorry I don’t remember that I was very drunk, I apologize for that Mr. Hatmaker.” “Oh its ok we’ve all had those nights before. I’m happy to see you realized it just wasn’t an appropriate thing.” It all came back to me, I remembered parts of the conversation and my demented wish. Then I thought, “the fucking nerve this guy has.” He tells me he’s glad I realized the error of my ways, well fuck him. “What do you mean I realized it was inappropriate” I snapped back at him. “I beg your pardon?” Ugh, his annoying questions, they make me want to barf. “I still want this, I know I may seem like a lunatic to you but to me this is important.” I was improvising at this point. “Jason as your friend and your boss (he put a lot of emphasis on the word boss) I forbid you to do any such thing.” The tone of his voice sounded defensive thus giving me the impression there is some sort of secret involved. Now I’m curious, time to put all the years of reading detective comics to good use. I assumed it would be a good idea to agree and throw him off guard, I guess it’s time to use what I learned in drama club from high school. I burst into tears spontaneously, “God Mr. Hatmaker your right, this is over the line and I can’t do this, what was I thinking? I’m so sorry I put you in this spot and caused an uncomfortable situation for you. I’m such a fool.” I sobbed without shame. “Jason you are not stupid. You are the most brilliant young man I’ve had the pleasure to meet and work with. This kind of thing happens to everyone, God knows I have went through this. Now don’t let me ever catch you talking down about yourself again.” “Sorry sir it won’t happen again, I promise.” I said trying to sound promising. “That’s what I like to hear! Jason just please get some rest and go easy on the booze, it’s not good for you. I will see you at the funeral Saturday.” I kept picturing him saying this with a smile on his face. “Ok Mr. Hatmaker, have a good day.” I was almost ashamed of myself for kissing his ass, but it was necessary. “Oh and Jason its Caleb to you.” “Yes sir, sorry, goodbye.” It was a great success. Now that I threw him off guard he will not be expecting me. This is my chance to get to the bottom of all of my suspicions, I knew for sure I was going to find something out. I knew I would expose him for whatever evil mischief things he was hiding. 

I was like a Special Forces navy seal preparing for his mission. I gathered my trusty 9mm handgun with my shoulder holster, my old timer pocket knife that my dad gave me when I was ten years old, and finally my steel toed boots, just in case I needed to give a powerful kick to something. I was ready to go to the Green Valley Funeral Home, I was ready to uncover the truth, but before I left I needed to request some special help. I got down on my knees for what could possibly be the last time, and prayed. “God I know I’m not the best person in the world but I think I’m doing something good here, please guide me and keep me safe from whatever I might face at the funeral home, and if I do fail and maybe even die, please don’t send me to hell, sincerely with love, Jason.” I now felt more confident than Rambo. 

It didn’t take long to arrive, 10 minutes at the max. Which is unusual. Typically it takes about 20 minutes from my house, I guess I was too busy thinking about what might be in store for me so it must have made the duration of the trip seem quicker. There I was in the parking lot, panicking. I didn’t have much confidence at the time most likely from my anxiety disorders. Staring at the entrance with hundreds of thoughts rushing through my head, all kinds of different scenarios were agitating my nerves and making it worse. I gave myself a quick pep talk and said fuck it, let’s do this!

Palms sweating and shaking I reached for the doorknob of the entrance, trying to make as little sound as possible to avoid alerting Caleb. There are no type of alarms to let him know I was here, also we are the only two people who run the place, besides the janitor that comes after hours. So I knew staying silent was the main goal of my mission. The funeral home was dead silent as usual so it made being stealthy quite difficult, especially with the occasional squeaky floor board. I finally made my way to the entrance of the morgue, the door was already slightly open. “He must be working on someone” I thought.  

I peaked my head into the door and what I saw before me was the beginning of a homicide. My mother’s body was on the table lying in a pool of blood. She had been mangled and dismembered. Her stomach had been torn open in a sloppy savage way, her small intestines along with many other vital organs were lying next to her. On top of her was Caleb, completely nude and thrusting into my mother. My heart skipped a beat. I had expected to find many things but never this. I couldn’t even imagine such a horrible thing. My whole body shook I could feel my face burning my fist squeezing so tight they felt like they were going to bleed, my raw animal instinct was coming. I pushed myself towards him trying to stay quiet I wanted to take him by surprise. I grabbed his red ponytail and jerked back with all my strength sending us both crazing down to the floor. I quickly got myself up and grabbed his hair once again. I spotted a nearby scalpel and put it to his throat. He laughed, the stupid fuck started laughing hissing even. “You want an explanation I’m guessing? I told you not to come down here Jason.” “im going to fucking kill you, you fucking sick son of a bitch.” I screamed and strained so hard my whole head was shaking my face was on fire, I knew my screams could be heard throughout the funeral home. I even startled myself a little, I felt like a monster, I had never raised my voice in such a way before. I didn’t even know I was capable of this. “You don’t have it in you,” he said laughing. This fueled my anger even more, I’m glad he said this it sure helped. I’m punched him in the face and he went straight the ground with a broken and bloody nose. I mounted him and used the scalpel to slash away at his face but controlling myself to not kill him, I wanted keep him alive for a long time, I wanted to play. With each slash more and more blood squirted onto my face, I kept my eyes closed to keep it out of my eyes. This was the first time I enjoyed Caleb’s voice, his screams of pain sounded like music to my ears. “Please stop I’ve had enough, please!” I stopped because I didn’t want to accidently hit any major veins in his neck. I turned him around and slashed both of his Achilles tendons just so he couldn’t run away from me. He was constantly screaming “Jason please stop! I’m sorry!” I ignored every word I had turned into a killing machine. I cut away at both is legs leaving them a mangled mess of meat and bone. I then moved to his dorsal cavity and made small incisions so he would lose more blood to make him weaker, but I didn’t want him to bleed out, not yet. I moved down to his penis and cut it off along with his testicles. Louder high pitch screams came from him. I knew now he would bleed out soon so I should work on torturing him a little more. I cut at all of the sensitive nerve points I knew on his body just to inflict more pain. I propped his head up on my knee and put a hand on his lower jaw and upper. I pulled the opposite way on each hand trying to break his lower jaw, I could feel him resisting, his lower jaw was too strong. I threw his head onto the ground and raised my boot into a kicking position. With full force I kicked his lower jaw and broke it completely free, it has now lost all function. I picked his head up and shoved my fist as hard as I possibly could into his mouth, I could feel my arm making its way down his esophagus. He was chocking and coughing trying to plead for me to stop. I kept going full force. My arm had completely blocked his airway so his chocking ceased. It didn’t take him long to suffocate which disappointed me.

Looking down at his mangled body gave me a great feeling of justice. I looked around the morgue and saw things I didn’t see earlier. There were more bodies. All dismembered and covered in semen and blood. There was a small portable gas stove on the ground with a piece of human flesh sitting in the skillet. How much worse can this get? I thought.  I thought it would be a good idea to leave a note for the police to let them know who he was. So I went to office to fetch a pen and some paper. Searching through his doors I found a key to his safe. I opened and found numerous locks of hair and teeth, it’s like he was keeping them as trophies. I found what looked like a photo album that I believe may be bound in human flesh. Inside were hundreds of pictures of Caleb posing with dead bodies and violating them, but none of them seemed to be in the gory mangled state my mother was in, he went all out on her. Why did he have to worse things to her? Many of the cadavers in the photos were people I knew and worked on a little myself. I couldn’t take anymore. I needed to finish up as soon as possible. I sat down at his desk to write a note for the police letting them know I was a vigilante getting rid of the scum of the earth. I avoided writing my hand writing just in case this was linked back to me.

 I carried to safe and note back to the morgue and lied them beside his body. I then retraced my all my steps with a rag to wipe all my finger prints towards the murder but none in the places I work so it won’t look like I was involved, after all I just work here right? After I cleaned as much blood as I possibly could from myself I left and went straight home. I spend the next three days in bed. I was disgusted with myself for doing all of those horrible things. I kept thinking, “am I a just as much of a monster as Caleb Hatmaker?” I couldn’t be, what I did was a good thing. I just kept telling myself this, I tried to assure myself that this feeling would pass soon.

The incident was all over the news. Later that day sheriff Kacey was knocking on my door as I expected. I opened the door and greeted him. “Hi there, can I help you with something sheriff?” I was trying so hard not to panic, I couldn’t stop my limbs from shaking, it was very obvious. The little voice in my head kept telling me, “oh you’ve done it now Jason he’s going to catch you.” “Your Jason Bozinsky right?” He asked in a stern voice. “Yes sir that is correct, come on in sir and make yourself at home. Now is something wrong?” I could even detect to fear in my own voice, I’m sure he could too. He stepped inside and I closed the door behind him. “Mr. Bozinsky are you aware that your boss Caleb Hatmaker was murdered a few days ago?” My heart started to pound. I tried to sound surprised and frightened. “What? When did this happen? Who did this? Can you give me some details?” “Well we don’t know who did it yet but it turns out that your boss Caleb was a pretty sick person. He has eaten and had sex with hundreds of corpses and we believe he may have been a serial killer also.” I tried to play along and look clueless. I sat down on my couch and put my head into my hands. “I just can’t believe any of this sheriff, I just saw him not long ago, he gave me some time off work because my mother died.” “Yeah I thought so, that’s one thing I wanted to talk to you about, your mother.” He began to tell me about the things he did to my mother, I burst out into tears but they weren’t fake, it just brought back all the pain all over again. Kacey sat down beside me. “Jason we checked Caleb’s phone records and you were the last person to speak with him, we also have a witness saying they saw your car leaving the scene at the time of his death.” His voice wasn’t stern anymore, it was compassionate. “I don’t know what you’re talking about, are you trying to say I did this?” “Jason I know you were the one who killed him, but I want you to know I don’t blame you one damn bit. There is more evidence that points towards you that will eventually lead to your arrest. “Your right I’m not going to hide it, I’m not ashamed of what I did, I did this town a favor and everyone is going to be on my side.” I said defending myself.” Kacey smiled and said, “Jason don’t worry I have an interview with the press at 5:00 and I’m letting them know I’m closing the case, there is no evidence for us to go on and the killer has most likely fled the state, therefore it is out of my hands.” “Are you serious? How can I ever repay you for this?” It was such a generous thing he was doing for me, I wanted to repay him somehow. “You’re joking right? You don’t need to repay me in anyway Jason Bozinsky, you have done more for this town than I have or any other sheriff has. You truly are a hero.” I just couldn’t believe what he was saying to me. I was getting off the hook and now I’m looked at as a hero. Kacey stood up and walked to the door but before leaving he turned around and said, “Now get some rest you’re going to need it to run the funeral home once it gets cleaned up and reopened.” I was a little confused. “What do you mean sheriff?” I’m going to make arrangements with mayor to make sure you gain ownership of the funeral home, you deserve it and plus you’re the only person in this town that can run it.” I smiled at him and thanked him, “thank you sheriff, I really appreciate what you’re doing for me.” “No problem,” he said smiling, he tipped his cowboy hat as a wave goodbye and left. 

The sheriff and I both feel that I have restored this town, I fixed a major flaw. Although the sheriff and myself are the only two people in the whole world that know the secret victory, I’m sure the rest of the town would be proud of me for what I have done. Overall this has been one big cluster fuck of madness. I’ve lost my mom, the most important person in my life, but then again I look at it like she was sacrificed so I could do something great for my life and the other resident’s lives here as well. Caroline Bozinsky died so I could fix this now near perfect town. My mother’s sacrifice gave me the opportunity of a stable job that is now the basic building blocks of starting a family. My mother is still doing things for me from the grave.

[previous](http://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/22ed9z/wireless/)

So today was my first official day on the job after being essentially a non-paid intern for 4 days.

It started off as any day at a normal office. Arrived at the office nice and early with my coffee and bagel in hand. Walked inside, sign in, went to the office to my brand new shiny desk. Sat down and just took it all in as I gently sipped my coffee of the gods and said hello to the only other IT ""tech"" there already. 

Of course I am referring to my new friend, the IT punching bag. Turns out that punching bag has a name... ""USER"" as in Ultra Stress/Stupidity Elevation Reliever. 

The day was pretty low key.I said the words ""off"", ""and"", and ""on"" about 5 dozen times, imaged a network drive for myself, and took a gander at the server room. Although I am skilled in hardware, high level software, java, javascript, html5, and C++ I know nothing when it comes to server software. I know what each physical part does, but the actual managing of servers is not my forte so that is why I am glad it is not in my job description. 

ANYWAYS... So about an hour after lunch I get a ticket from the security guys. It read as follows...

""One of our cameras is out, picture not moving""

I grabbed my trusty screwdrivers (I always take a philip's head and flat head when I take any kind of ticket what so ever because you never know) and went down to the security department. Now there are certain areas under constant PTZ camera surveillance. This case is the motor pool because it is a razor wired area in which we park our propane trucks. (I just realized that I forgot to mention that the place I work at distributes propane to many states) So I get down there and take a look. The fat guard (FG) shows me the issue.

**FG**: See I press the button to pan the camera right, left, up, and down and nothing happens. But when I press zoom it zooms. *he proceeds to show me and sure enough he is correct, however, I notice that something doesn't look right when he zooms in*

**Me**: Here let me take a look. *I fiddle with the controls and check the logs. Sure enough the commands are sent without error.* hmmm odd. Did you try (the slogan of every IT tech in the world) turning it off and back on again?

**FG**: Yes.

**Me**: *Holy shit, wasn't expecting that answer*

I go outside and take a look and what I expected was the issue was indeed. Someone had pulled a prank and taped a picture of the lot over the lens. I radioed **FG** to pan the camera just to check that it was indeed working and thank god it was. I call out **FG** to show him the prank. He has a good laugh. (the motor pool in question is usually empty because it is used to park the broken down trucks, but our mechanics are so efficient that there is hardly ever anything in the lot) As I reach up to yank off the photo this humorous ticket turned idiot faster than a DDR3 RAM swap.

**FG**: I can't let you do that. You don't have security clearance to physically alter the cameras.

**Me**: *scoff* ya and you don't have the clearance to fit in a desk chair with arms. You guys are hilarious *reaches for the photo again*

**FG**: Halt, I am serious you do not have clearance to physically alter cameras Professor_Derpsalot! You can only fix software issues.

**Me**: I am not even going to touch the camera, just the paper scotch taped onto it.

**FG**: I can't let you.

**Me**: Well then who in Eternia has the clearance? *A-thank you*

**FG**: I'm gonna go call the company listed electrician to do this.

**Me**: Umm okay, you do that I am going to be right back.

I then went and had a nice ""chat"" with my good friend USER and returned. By the time I had returned the electrician had already arrived and it took him an entire 10 minutes of checking in, taking a look, writing a summary of what is wrong and what he will do, turning it into the security department head, yanking off the piece of paper, and checking out. And of course he probably charged for an hour of work time.

I am glad this job is easy, but for the love of all that is 0 and 1 what is with ""non-techies""?

**TL;DR** Apparently paper and tape is a high level security risk. We better go arrest some kindergarteners."

For I job I never cared for and showed up late to. I got warned, I thought they somewhat valued me. It was answering phones and drained me completely, and I was unfulfilled, hated every moment of it. Somewhat glad about it. 

My girlfriend was furious. We've been rocky for the past 3 months, she is super stressed with school and an internship. The internship might turn into a job and that's all she seems to care about. We fought a lot about my job performance. 

She is upset that I won't ever change or get it together. She is holding out hope that I get it together. I'm currently in a paralegal program which finishes in 2 months. That is what I was holding my time for at the bullshit job. 

She hasn't broken up with me yet, but texted me today sounding like she wanted to. ""Your habits won't ever change."" I said really over text, at least in person, she responded fine. Then I asked what that meant, she said I'll do it in person. Just got that response now.

I had plans to move in with her, and we had talked about some kind o grand life together. 

I just struggled with depression the past year while getting set to graduate college, suicidal thoughts during a final. and was mostly fine since that episode. 

I want to hate everything and make a fuss but what's the point. She gave me a chance to give a combination that would change her mind which is a losing cause. She might have ended it permanently. Almost 3 years of a relationship. She moved closer to me when transferring for school, spent a year long distance. 

Seems my promise that last year was the worst year wasn't accurate. 

Every year is just getting exponentially worse. What's the point if it will only get worse. I have to change, but whatever changes I make aren't noticed. She is done with me and I am done with myself. "

Quick background - I'm a 2L who accepted an internship with an out-of-state telecomm provider about a month ago.

Accordingly, I don't think that I will be able to afford the initial expenses involved with moving out-of-state (first months rent, the trek to the new city, auto repair, etc.) and I think I may have to back out. I just have 4 questions that I was hoping I could get some help with.

1. Is it appropriate to send and email of my intent to withdraw my acceptance to the hiring manager, or would it be better to call or send a hand-written letter?
2. Could anyone provide any advice as to what content and language should go in either medium? I'm not sure if I should be specific and talk about the issues of why I can't go, or if I should be more vague and say that I can no longer come due to personal issues.
3. Is there anyway to spin this so that I don't create bad blood? I don't think that I'll want to go and work with the provider someday, but the industry isn't too large and I'm sure they know people. I don't want to get blackballed or something.
4. Has anyone had to go through a similar experience as this? How did you handle it? What was the aftereffect?

My GPA for the first semester last year was 3.15, and my GPA for the second semester last year was 3.76, but my overall GPA is still an absolutely awful 2.68.

What's worse, aside from my classes I have absolutely nothing to put on my resume for an eventual job. I have no extracurricular activities or projects that would benefit me, and I have no time to pursue them currently, already having a full course load this semester.

The only real hope I have for finding a job at this point is getting an internship, but none of the internships I've applied to have responded to me at all. The closest I've gotten is an online interview from Discovery Communications, but after two months they haven't responded at all, even after calling and leaving a message for the hiring manager.

I'm getting the distinct feeling now that I'll never be able to find a job at all at this point. Is there anything I'll be able to do? Will studying for a degree turn out to just be a huge waste of time, effort, and money on my part?

Do your breed research before buying or adopting, even on mixed breeds.",octaffle,dogs,https://www.reddit.com/r/dogs/comments/22iq8t/making_an_informed_decision_could_save_a_life_do/,"In 2011, I lived with an ACD/Aussie mix (a ""texas heeler"") named Echo.  [She's a cutie](http://api.ning.com/files/TwzIpTmSrrNJmJp9amc6WAIxLIRDlHEAn--1M-St1ftwzFbipJD8*tJ5j28xF09Q/PA310245.JPG?width=737&amp;height=552) and was about Waffle's age, maybe up to a year older.  When I first rolled up with Waffle to live in our new apartment with Echo and her owner, Echo postured and attacked Waffle.  Immediately, I knew she needed training.  The first three days in the apartment were a nightmare.  This dog had been with her owner for over a year and she acted like she had been recently adopted.  I couldn't deal.  I didn't get my dog and meticulously spend two months training him so he wouldn't be a nuisance to my roommates only to have Echo stomp all over everything.

My roommate had mild CP and could walk with a shambling gait (she rode horses and worked at a barn, so it isn't like she was totally crippled.)  It was immediately apparent that, even when the dog did go for a walk, the walk was woefully insufficient.  This dog needed to RUN or burn energy somehow.  I walked her sometimes and took her out to play.  I trained her a bit, but training is very time consuming and I was an engineering student with my own new dog to deal with, so I couldn't do it too often.  She was extremely smart and very trainable.  She was so eager to learn.  She wasn't getting what she needed and she was a nuisance at home.  She barked incessantly if dogs were outside and had bad habits in general.  The third day I lived there, I wrote her owner a letter stating my concerns about Echo and how I felt that would affect Waffle (we were both too emotional to discuss it in person).  I mentioned that Echo was a herding dog and she had needs that weren't going fulfilled.  The letter I received back was basically a list of excuses and promises to improve.  We discussed it more since then, including a long talk about rehoming Echo--a topic she brought up.  I explained that she needed to do what's best for the dog and a more active home would probably be best.  There was some more talk and discussion but, ultimately, nothing changed.

It didn't improve.  This dog wasn't getting any meaningful attention.  Echo was living a life of benign neglect.  She had food, water, shelter, and was getting a small walk every day, but she was obviously suffering.  By the end of the semester, tensions were very high and I was just generally pissed.  The dog had bitten my mother and my friend (not a ""dog attack"" bite, more like an uncontrolled nip), to add to my list of grievances.  My landlord ended up speaking to me about my supposed hostility toward the owner and eventually agreed that if Echo were to continue staying in our apartment, she would need to see a professional trainer and keep a log of training and exercise.  The dog went home for Thanksgiving and did not return for the rest of the semester.  The owner ended up doing an internship during spring semester and I did not have to deal with the problem again.

We moved to another apartment in the same complex and saw Echo out and about sometimes.  Her new roommate had nothing but bad things to say about the owner and Echo's behavior.  

Now, 4 years later, Echo is being euthanized due to ""sudden human aggression"".  She went to the vet two weeks ago and received a clean bill of health.  There is no attempt being made to contact a professional about mitigating or reducing the aggressive behavior.  The owner has diagnosed it as a ""neurological problem"" due to its apparently sudden onset.  It's not.  Echo is being killed because of her owner's obstinate ignorance and general laziness toward caring for her dog's mental health.

Let that sink in for a moment.

This dog is being killed because of the benign neglect it suffered for four years.  

Please, when you bring an animal home, know what to expect of the dog and what the dog will expect of you.  The repercussions can be immense.

Edit:  I was just informed that Echo is gone.  Thank you for suggesting to look for a rescue or a foster. My contact with Echo's owner just got back with me and said it was too late."

I'm trying to get some feedback on my situation and any skills I should try and pick up so that I'm a more appealing candidate.

I'm not sure if this is the appropriate sub for this question, so if it isn't someone should kindly redirect me to the correct sub and I'll delete/repost!

*In undergrad I had two internships:*

-Regional utility working in planning and running power systems analysis

-On the business-engineering side of things at a Fortune 500 semiconductor corporation

*In grad, I've taken courses in a completely different field than what I did in undergrad:*

-Pattern Classification

-Stochastic Processes

-Image Processing

-Radar Signal Processing

 Thus, I'm sort of on the machine learning-type track. 

*Next year, I'll probably take courses like:*

-Computational Intelligence

-Unsupervised Learning

*My research deals with:*

-Landmine detection (lump of image processing and pattern classification)


*My concern is:*

I'm afraid that I'll be, rightly so, lumped together with a plethora of computer science and computer engineering candidates. Unfortunately, I feel this is bad because I don't have the same background as them. For example, my entire research deals with MATLAB and I don't truly know C, C++, etc. I have small experience in Python, but the only language I feel like I could confidently say I utilize and understand fully is MATLAB, which may not be the hottest ticket in the job market. 

I feel like I should be teaching myself some more programming languages, but I'm just not sure. I wanted to hear what other engineering students had to say. Of course, I'll ask my advisers as well.

22izmh,1,2014-04-08,Is there ever a reason to get a MA in Econ?,econ_grad_student,AskAcademia,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAcademia/comments/22izmh/is_there_ever_a_reason_to_get_a_ma_in_econ/,"I've applied and have been accepted to some MA programs in Econ - programs that advertise PhD prep as a benefit and are ranked in the #20 - #35 range. I know there's a lot of distaste for these programs, but it seems like the best option for me right now. I'm wondering if I'm wrong, and looking for some constructive feedback or reassurance.

I couldn't apply to PhD programs this year, plus I doubt I could have gotten into a top program, and I'm not sure I have the qualifications to get a good research position for a gap year to improve my resume significantly. 

Right now, I *think* next year I either want to go for an econ phd &amp; law program or earn another masters in urban planning. I'm not 100% sure though. I have a great liberal arts resume - double major (one was econ, other was comm), 3.7 GPA, some internship experience, slightly less than desirable quant GRE score (161) (though I'll be retaking later this year), I'm completing multivariate &amp; linear algebra by the end of the summer, and I did an undergrad econ thesis, so I've got just a little research experience.

I'm looking for some feedback on my reasoning for going to one of these MA programs.

Reasons to go:

* Chance to learn from / make connections with *really* great faculty ( huge majority with PhDs from top 10s) - maybe do some research with them too

* Focus more on school rather than extra-curriculars and earn that 4.0

* Sort out my interests in Econ - decide if the urban planning or behavioral law and econ route is right, or if I should do something else

* No undergrad debt at all, so picking up a little graduate debt wouldn't be the end of the world

* Prepare me for a PhD more than my undergrad institution / help me make sure I want to commit to a PhD

* Possibility of transfer credit to PhD program...maybe? Anyone know how common this is?

* Live in a cool city


Reasons not to go:

* 50K total cost and lost wages

* If I go to a PhD program, I'd get a masters anyway... so this will end up as a second (extra useless?) masters

* Losing a possible year of work experience (again, don't know if I'd be qualified for the kind of job that could help me get into a top program).


So, am I totally wrong to be leaning towards going to this program now? If I decided I was done after this MA, would it buy me anything at all? "
22j1d8,1,2014-04-08,If anyone could offer insight into the statement of intent I would appreciate it,[deleted],gradadmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/gradadmissions/comments/22j1d8/if_anyone_could_offer_insight_into_the_statement/,"*I am in the process of applying to a MS program for Business Analytics. I feel that my intangibles are pretty strong, but my grades and test scores are just a bit below average. I am hoping to make my case in the statement of intent, but I've never written anything like this before and I'm finding it more difficult then I thought it would be. This is my rough draft, so far:*

It is appropriate that two of my most memorable and life shaping experiences happened in my last year of undergraduate studies. Appropriate, because 2013 was the year I started to take my education seriously. In high school and my first years at college, I lacked the guidance and wisdom to define a clear, strategic vision my future. Fortunately, since then, I have turned a corner. I am confident that my future lies in Business Analytics, and that the best way to achieve this is the MS program at *****************.

The first of these life-altering events was when I was hired to be a tutor for MSIS 212, Managerial Decision Making. A mid-level, required management course, 212 focuses on finding real world solutions to business problems by using Excel to build linear programming models, tree charts, and simulations. This was my first exposure to mathematical modeling, and I was enthralled. I enjoyed the class immensely, and when I was recommended by the professor to be a tutor I jumped at the chance. However, it quickly became apparent that the problems I found logical and intuitive were anything but for some other students. So, over the course of the year, I got to grapple with these problems I had breezed through in a much different way. By explaining (and re-explaining), the concepts I was able to begin to appreciate the complexities of the subject matter, and start to truly understand the magnitude of the possibilities that could result from these methods. 

Secondly, I was blessed with the chance to attend the INFORMS Analytics and Operations Research Conference in Boston. This was an incredible, eye-opening experience. I was stunned by the depth and complexity of demonstrations, and by the enormous potential for actionable insights drawn from the conclusions. By the end of the three days I was exhausted, mentally and physically, but more intrigued then I had ever been. 

An advanced degree in Business or Predictive Analytics is the next logical step for me. I have completed my studies in Supply Chain and minored in Sustainability. I relish the qualitative aspects of my education so far, but I am hungry for more substantial quantitative methods. INFORMS was just a taste of what I view as the incredible pool of possibilities. I see education as a lifelong pursuit, and while I intend to continue to broaden and deepen my knowledge of both SCM and the clean tech and sustainability sphere, it is analytics that will give me the tools to make a lasting impact in those areas. 

A main reason I am able to form this perspective is the education I’ve received outside the classroom. Working part time jobs, mainly in the food service industry, since age 16 has immersed me in an industry that values long hours and hard work. I have worked 30 – 40 hour work weeks for years, sometimes while attending to a full schedule of classes, but it was never a negative. I relished the work, because there was always a clear objective, and the harder I worked the bigger and brighter that objective became. Whether it was tips in a serving job, or a promotion at a catering company, I’ve consistently found that hard work mixed with the right opportunity will bring me success. This clear vision of the goal is a big piece of what was lacking my first couple years of college, and an even bigger piece of what I have gained since then. 

In three years, I see myself working in an analytical operations capacity at a cutting edge clean tech company. In five years, I will be working at the crossroads of supply chain and sustainability, using predictive modeling to provide actionable insights into methods that can help companies drive profits by becoming more efficient while lowering and mitigating their environmental footprint. There is no doubt in my mind that I will need substantial training in these areas to reach my goals, and similarly, no doubt that ************** is the place to attain that training. 

There are many aspects of the MS Business Analytics program and ** itself which lead me to believe this. From the impressive corporate sponsors of the internship program to the logical balance of the classes between mathematical business intelligence and the interpretation and gathering of insights from data, it is clearly a complete package. Additionally, I firmly identify with the campus wide commitment to sustainability and “****************”, a phrase I take to heart in every facet of my life. I would be honored to be a principle graduate of the MSBA program, and proud to carry on a rich *************** tradition of hard work and spectacular achievement.

*What do you think? Any obvious improvements to be made? Any big shortcomings? I think the beginning is a bit weak, but I am trying to explain why my grades were not as good as they should/could have been in my first couple of years.* 

*Thanks for taking the time to read it, even if you don't comment.*

22j5e1,18,2014-04-08,"I think I'm stuck in life, despite wanting and trying to move forward...",djammin87,OneY,https://www.reddit.com/r/OneY/comments/22j5e1/i_think_im_stuck_in_life_despite_wanting_and/,"I'm 26 and I've been through a lot the last couple of years.  I graduated college with a B.S. in Computer Information Systems.  Since then, I've left my 2 year internship position because they didn't have an open position for me other than helpdesk.  They actually filled one a couple of months prior after interviewing me and another guy and selecting him.  I went to another helpdesk position that paid a bit more but the management was horrendous.  Being talked at and even yelled at was common and I was hardly given anything to do, despite requesting work.  They really just wanted me to handle the phones, which rarely rang.  I did more self-imposed janitorial work there than computer related things simply because I was bored.  

I quit that one and started at a programming position that paid quite a bit more than the helpdesk one, I thought I had hit gold!  They fired me after a month however.  They only reasons they gave me was that I was not a good fit for the position and my communication was lacking.  I don't understand what that meant because by the time I left I was sending my supervisor 1 email a day with what I did, what I need to do, and what I learned that day.  Also an email a week with the same stuff, except for the week (so 2 on Friday).  Then my supervisor mandated that we talk about each email the following morning.  I still managed to learn a completely new-to-me, completely text based program and complete a project using it, and start learning .NET and SQL programming.  I really don't know what was expected of me at that point.  Coming out I'm glad I'm not there because 3 of us had to share an L shaped ~9 x 6 cubicle and my supervisor had to have her paper piles everywhere.  Additionally I was developing endocrine system problems that went away a few weeks after not being there.  But being fired and that walk of shame sucked.  I never thought I'd have to go through that since I always give my best at work.

Since then I've not had another full time job (about a year now).  I've done some work through a computer support business I'd started, dabbled in starting a restaurant that catered to people with allergies to gluten, corn, soy, etc. because I am affected by them and get frustrated when I eat out.  Nether thing has taken off either because of lack of money (restaurants are expensive to start) or I guess marketing skills on my part.  Maybe there are just too many IT shops in my area and people like going to big box stores for computer help even though they never seem to have a good comment when its brought up.  The few customers I have had always say good things about my service and some are repeats.  I can't seem to take off with it though.  

I've been dishwashing part time to supplement my wife's pretty average income.  I have been able to create a budget that allows us to live in mild comfort off of just her income.  What I earn goes towards extra payments on our student loans.  We were even able to afford a house and renovate it a bit.  That pretty much stretched it out to the max as all extra expenses have been removed and income is all going towards necessities.

She has been great about the entire situation and I feel bad about all that's happened.  She's getting to the point where she wants to have a baby, and would like a vacation as well.  The only way to get the funds for those things is for me to increase my income.  

I'm a very independent person and like to do things on my own, my way.  I put a lot of thought into everything I do and research the crap out of stuff before I do it because I want to make sure it'll work.  So I have a lot of confidence in myself, until I need to work with others, then I lose it all and ""forget"" what I learned.  I really hate the idea of going to work for someone else again because I end up feeling like I have no control over my time, especially when it comes to the unpredictable hours that IT can demand.  It's not so bad when I am earning my rate on jobs I do using ideas I came up with, but when I work for someone else, I can't help but feel taken advantage of.

I love working with people and having a direct impact on the quality of their life, currently through technology.  I love finding ways to use technology to increase the quality of ones life as well.  This is how I believe I am different than a lot of people in IT because pure money and always having/providing the latest tech is not my main motivation.  Do people not want that or do they not know they want that?  I'm not sure.

Back to the main point.  I am at my wits end with my life and have no idea what to do or where to go next.  I have a great mind for problem solving and can learn anything if I have a good enough reason to.  I would think this leaves me with a  world of opportunities, but I can't seem to move forward with anything I try.  As soon as I think, ""This is it"", things completely change or some ""un-overcomeable"" roadblock stops me in my tracks.  This really makes me feel like a failure and hurts to see my wife smile and try to support me when I know she's disappointed too.

TL;DR: Am stuck in life because of who I am and things that have happened.  Don't know where to go next."
22j6c9,1183,2014-04-08,Exodus,CaPtAiN_KiDd,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/22j6c9/exodus/,"We are now towards the end of Month 7 going into my 8th. 

In total we had about 10 full-time employees. 

Boss, being cheap, had recently increased the amount of part-time interns working for us to try and handle the extra work. 

Boss, being dumb, didn't seem to realize that somebody had to train these interns as we were not in The Matrix and couldn't just upload skills to their brains when they came in.

We were falling behind on work while trying to train people, who worked for free, to do our jobs.  

Intercom rings, it's Boss:

&gt;Boss:""Hey Captain, how are the new interns holding up?""

&gt;Me:""They're, uh, getting there.""

&gt;Boss:""Good, good. Listen, could you come up here and help me with this payroll and accounts software?  It's not working for me.""

&gt;Me:""Sure, but i'm not familiar with those programs so...""

&gt;Boss:""Ok well just give it a shot, I gotta go out for a few minutes so i'll be outta your way.""

That meant more than a few minutes, possibly he's just going home and not coming back, that was welcomed.

I went up the Trail of Tears to the office of Boss as he was leaving, exchanged pleasantries and sat down at his desk.

Whenever I'm working with sensitive or personal data of a user I choose to ignore the content and just fix the problem. Admin-User Confidentiality. In this case the content was part of the problem so I had no option 
other than to look at it.  

I have no idea what i'm doing LOL.

Another employee worked in that office, it was Boss' Assisstant (BA) who was actually really cool and took more shit from Boss than I would ever deal with.  She did Accounting (part-time) for almost a year now at the office 
and said she would help me navigate the phrases and terms so I can figure this software out.

We started trying to figure out everything when I let her take the reins to re-enter some books data.  She didn't understand why she wasn't asked to do it since she knew more than me about 
this stuff and even helped do the books for the place.  Until...

&gt;BA:""Wait, that's not right...""

&gt;Me:""Um, huh?""

&gt;BA:""Uh nothing, hold on.""

She looked concerned and angry while clicking through the various tabs on the software.  So I took a step back.

&gt;BA:""He so *does* have the money.""

&gt;Me:""Wait what money?  Is it fixed?""

BA was all of a sudden livid.  She then went on a rant that ultimately came down to the fact there were two sets of books.  Not the ""illegal"" kind, but rather accounts that Boss handled and then 
added BA's books to that.  So he was claiming everything like the law says, but BA didn't have an idea of the ""big money"" accounting that kept her in the dark about how much of a profit he was actually turning.  

Guess who did accounting for *those* accounts.  Yup, Boss.

According to her, even if we took on double the staff we currently have and gave them all $40K a year to start, it would take upto 3 years to go out of business even if we didn't turn a profit.  Actually, even if we just let the company bleed money and did nothing?  2 years. 

She showed me Numbers + Math = Lots of zeros.  

Boss, as a business owner, is well within his rights to pocket profits.  Nobody debated that.

What *was* up for debate now was what the workers think. The fact BA was denied full-time status many times on the basis of ""we don't have the money"" and that that phrase was continually used to deny everyone around the office everything 
from a raise, to extra help that was desperately needed for a specific dept (:::cough:::,Web Development,:::cough:::), or even a new computer....hell, even just a computer of their own!...was rage inducing.

BA dug even deeper and saw what everyone was being paid.  It made her rage.

&gt;BA:""Do you know what he's announcing tomorrow?""

I am beyond confused at this point.

&gt;Me:""Um no.""

&gt;BA:""Oh he's just dropping our company health care because it's 'too expensive' despite the fact we pay into it.  He's forcing everyone to sign-up for the new federal health care that's available. No adjustment in our salaries to compensate either.""
   
I took the option for more money rather than health insurance.  Doesn't effect me, but damn that's shitty.

After those revelations, the news spread around the office fast with BA telling our senior AE that was also the new VP, but had no love for Boss.  

The program was fixed by BA and I returned downstairs.

The fuse was lit, this place was about to blow.  

I had no idea, I mean I had an idea, but didn't know how far it would go.

Boss didn't return until the next day.  

In the morning I heard a yell from upstairs:

&gt;Boss:""WHAT THE FUCK?!""

That was the sound of a man so confused and so screwed.

His BA, Senior AE/VP, and a Graphic Designer quit.  

No 2 weeks, no warning, just flat-out quit via *email*.  I had no clue yet.

Intercom beeps:

&gt;Boss:""Why did you let BA use my computer?!""

&gt;Me:""She said she knew how to fix the problem with the software and she did.""

&gt;Boss:""No! She was not to use my computer!""

&gt;Me:""Ok, i'm sorry but it was fixed.""

&gt;Boss:""I DON'T CARE THAT IT WAS FIXED!""

He hung up.

ZD had come in late that day.  She came into the office, sat down, and a few minutes later was brought up to speed by the gossip committee via text.

&gt;ZD:""HOLY SHIT!  BA, AE/VP, and a GD quit?!""

&gt;Me:""WHAT?!""

&gt;ZD:""Uh yeah, they quit, no 2 weeks, just quit through email.""

Boss had apparently made our Senior AE the VP by giving her a shit raise (despite his insistence that the money ""just isn't there right now"") and dumping basically every client on her as her 
new responsibility. That was 2 days before all of this.  So now, all the clients that were told to direct their business to her had nobody to talk to...except Boss.  While Senior AE/VP might have 
sucked at her job she was at least responsive with a vague idea of what the client wanted and knew who they were.  

BA handled Boss' clients well, but now was gone.  

Boss didn't know who was who or what was what as the calls poured in.

Despite being profitable year after year he had tried to run a skeleton crew on little to no office equipment, stuffed the place with unpaid interns to do some of the work and placate clients, and get away with paying the full-time staff as little as possible by crying poverty all the while pocketing huge profits instead of expanding his business to accommodate the influx of new clients, becoming less dependent on so few key people that he thought he couldn't lose because of a shitty job market, and re-investing back into the company in any capacity.

He didn't expect 3 core people, 2 that he depended on so much, to just leave like that. He didn't count on them finding out about the fact he had plenty of money to pay them more like he had promised some of them for years. ""Once we start making money"" was a constant excuse.

He had taken money up-front from the new clients, was gonna let Senior AE/VP calm them down when the work wasn't done, but was now hounded by old and new clients as to the status of their particular projects.

His only hope laid with the 6 new interns (that we had until June) and 2 developers to pick up the slack and save him from being forced to give refunds, lose clients on retainer, or even sued.

This is the beginning of the end for me.

**So, a little backstory first:**
I am a 20 Year old guy who have moved to another country, for a one year Internship, the city im living in is a big City in Europe and we are around 55 Interns from my country just in this city. We are, however, spread out in different Companies all around the city but from time to time we all meet and go out together. 

**The night i saw HER[20F]:**
So, i have now been here in this city for 8 months, which means i got 4 months left on my internship. In the past 8 months i have been out celebrating many times with the other interns. However, Last saturday we were going to a big Party, the way this kind of party works is that you sit around a LONG table all night and drink beer, dance on the chairs, tables and so on, so you dont really leave your Seet other than to go to the bathroom. 

So, at the table, i saw this girl, i had not seen her before, but all the others seemed to know her, from a party i did'nt go to. Anyway, this girl, was sitting at the end of the table while i was sitting 4 chairs further down towards the middle on the other side of the table. I instantly noticed her, as she and her 3 girl-friends came 15 min late, and i just could not take my eye of, of her, she was beautiful, long blonde hair, blueish eyes and the sweetest smile -also an intern like me. 

As the night went on, i noticed her looking at me also, and i think she noticed me doing the same, however, for some reason in our Beerdrinking-Dancing-on-the-chairs-partying i dident go over and talk to her. Now the funny thing is that normally i dont have any problem going over to new ppl and speak with them, not girls either, im spontanious when i get drunk.

It got late and everyone got more and more drunk but i could still notice her looking over at me from time to time. 
At the end, the place where we were at, shut down around 1 (we started at 18:00 with eating and there had been live musik all night), and in a split second she was gone, so i went over to two of my palls to find out what she was called, i got her name and then, of cource, i Drunk-friendrequested her of Facebook, however 10 min later, i cancelled the Friendrequest, because, well, i dident want to seem wierd and i was Drunk.

**The next morning:**
The next morning i woke up, really early, like half past 6 and i could'nt sleep, i looked at Facebook and there was nothing. So i watched a movie and around 8'O clock i looked at Facebook again and there was a friend request... Gues who it was?, it was her. 

**Question:**
So now im confused of what to do, was this Friendrequest at 8'O clock in the morning 2 Days ago, a sign of affection from her?, or is it just me who wants it to be?

**tl;dr**: Saw a Beautiful girl, who looked back at me, dident talk all night, got Friendrequest from her in the early morning. What should i do?"

Hey guys, I recently joined a startup as a front end intern.

I work with the CTO who is the only other developer in a team of 5.

I was expecting to deal with JS, HTML, CSS and be responsible for the complete design and user experience of the site.

Instead I got handed a PSD layout designed by someone else, my own creative input is being ignored and suppressed, this worries me. 

The site was built with Ruby on Rails, and the lead developer has asked me to learn Ruby. I understand that front end and back end are intricately linked and that knowledge of both would be necessary in some capacity. But I don't want to learn Ruby, I mean I quit Computer Science degree, because it was too broad, information overkill. I don't want to learn every programming language. I want to specialise in one thing.

Our lead developer is pushing (at least thats what it feels like rather than encouraging) me towards full stack development but I have no interest in backend whatsoever.

I don't want to leave as I lack experience and would have a difficult time landing a job. I am starting to realise perhaps a startup is not the ideal place for junior developers, because there are no defined roles and in my case an extremely inexperienced manager, plus the fast paced environment, there is no planning!

So should I stick it out with this internship and gain the experience, or is this ultimately leading to nowhere."

I've been looking at the success of most TS students. It seems like they all get internships at top companies (like Microsoft, Facebook, Google, etc.) and go to the best grad schools (like MIT, Carnegie Mellon, Berkeley, Stanford, etc.). I'm only a first-year student, but it feels like I won't be able to go to grad schools and get internships like those.

I kind of feel inferior and it feels like I have a limited future success because I am not a TS student. I spoke to the director of the TS program and he basically said my stats are too low to get in. He said I could still apply, but being a pragmatist, I don't think I'll try to fight the numbers.

How much more difficult is it for non-Turing students to get into top graduate schools? (It's pretty much my dream to go to grad school at like Stanford, Caltech, Berkeley, MIT, Harvard, or Princeton.) What about internships?"

I am currently 18 and finishing up my first year in university (currently going for a BSc in Computer Science). I am planning on transferring universities (and programs) next year, and because it is much farther away from my current university I am planning on living in the University Residence. I will be working towards a degree in engineering.

Anyways, right now my financial situation looks like this:

**savings and income**

 * Current Savings: **~$35,000** (from part time jobs in highschool)
 * Projected Income for Summer Months (less expenses): **~$5,000** (sadly, I was unable to find an internship for CS this summer, so I will likely be working retail. This number may vary slightly depending on the number of shifts I can get).
 * Monthly income during the school year: **$230 dollars/month** + hopefully some money from a part time job at the school.

**future expenses**

 * Tuition in the fall: **$4000** after scholarships
 * Residence: **$7500-$12500** (depending on the res that I get into. If I choose the cheaper one ($6300 + $150 a month for food), I will live with a roommate).
 * Miscellaneous throughout the year: **$600**

After next year, I plan on moving out of res and into a cheaper place. I have no car, so I have no expenses along with that. I have 3-4 more years in university left until I finish. At some point I also really want to take a trip abroad (Japan) for a year to have the experience.

My plan is to put **~$20,000** split between two ETFs through iShares and set that aside for retirement. I was thinking the S+P 500 or some other index. 

**My questions are as follows:** 

 * would it make more sense financially to stay put where I am and finish my Computer Science degree and then move on to work on the engineering degree? My school has a program worked out with another university where you can do a three year (or a four year) CS, Physics, or Mathematics degree and then take an additional 2 years at the partner school to get an engineering degree. My living expenses would be lower (about 6300 dollars with tuition, food, rent, miscellaneous - I have a good set up with my landlord), but I would take another year to complete it and I would only be working towards a Computer Science degree. I would also have no internship opportunities.

 * Should I invest less/more of my money for retirement?

 * How can you travel abroad frugally?

 * How do you stop worrying about finances when you know that you will be fine?

I am sorry about this post being so long winded. I am just a little bit confused on what I should be doing to help out my situation a little bit more. I am enjoying school (although it is weird not having a job for the first time in forever, and I don't think that I want to be a programmer for the rest of my life), and I think that I am enjoying life - but I feel like I am doing something wrong.

I am in a good position at the moment, but I don't want to screw it up.

Thanks!

22jusb,8,2014-04-08,"Exact definition of ""web development""?",A_Mann,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/22jusb/exact_definition_of_web_development/,"Sorry if this question seems naive, because it totally is. As I've been doing research about what kind of work I'd like to do when I get out of school, I've noticed a particular bias against web. That the pay is lower, there might be less opportunities, possibly difficulty moving to non web dev later on, that kind of thing. Now, while I am wondering if those things are true, that's not the important part of my question. 

I've had two internships, both working with C#. The first I was making WPF applications for a larger ECM company, and the second is in ASP.net making web apps. Is this second internship ""web development"" in the sense of all those negatives? It seems like it can't be because I'm working with nearly the same technologies. Just substitute some JavaScript or HTML for XAML. 

I assume that the negatives associated with web dev are for jobs which focus primarily in scripting languages. I just need someone to confirm or deny that and fill in my understanding. There's so many buzzwords and nebulous industry terminology that it can be hard to keep up sometimes. I really like the company I'm at now and I would be disappointed if my career outlook was harmed because of the work that they do. Thanks in advance!"

“This is a preparatory command, ‘What makes the Grass Grow?’ You all will find the most vicious war cries you can muster and thrust your bayonets in the air while screaming, ‘BLOOD, BLOOD MAKES THE GRASS GROW!’”

Then, the Drill Sergeant will continue, “I’ll then say, ‘What makes the Grass Green?’ You all shout, ‘GUTS, GUTS MAKE THE GRASS GREEN!’ While you shove that bayonet into the air. Do you understand?”

The hundred fat, bald recruits will then shout back:

“YES DRILL SERGEANT!”

This is a little long, so bear with me. 

I'm now realizing this after seeing basically everyone I know pursuing things they enjoy, while I'm sitting around trying to figure out if I want to nap on my couch or my bed. 

My roommate is always out skating. If he's not, he's watching skate videos. 

A good friend of mine is getting into body building. He's researching and improving his body basically 24/7 and LOVES it.

My girlfriend has an internship that she is very passionate about that is now turning into a career. It's all she ever talks about.

People always tell me: ""You're so smart and good at arguing, you should be an attorney or litigator!"" I feel a lot of people would be motivated by that statement, but I just don't care for it.

""You're really athletic, if you hit the gym more often, you could totally play on your college sports team!"" Again, I feel that many people would take that and run with it. Me, I just don't care. 

""Wow, you really sold me on that! You should go into sales!"" I know many people in sales/ marketing who are very young and make A LOT of money. I understand that I can make a lot of money through it, but I just don't care.

I find myself just going through the motions. Wake up. Think if I should fall back asleep or go to class. Feel bad that I'm going to skip, so I decide to go. Go to the Gym. Go to club meetings. Go back home. Spend time with girlfriend. Sleep. Party with friends on the weekend.

I'm tired of this rut I'm in. I want to be a better person ,take complete control of my life, and find something I truly care about. So I'm asking you, /r/DecidingToBeBetter, what are some steps I can take?"

I think a lot of my problems stemmed from the fact that I divorced myself from the Christian community and God during that decade.  I need prayer first that I can control and manage my bipolar disorder.

Secondly, even though I rejoined the church in the past few years, I haven't been able to make the leap into fully believing in God again.  I need to be rid of my unbelief.  I need to trust Him.  I desperately want to be filled with the peace that only the Holy Spirit can bring.

Third, I am graduating from my masters program at the end of May.  I need prayer that I may continue applying to jobs and internships and that I may get a job where I'm happy and paid finally.  I've been unemployed (and a part-time student) since 2011 and it's been rough financially.  In addition, my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer in the second half of 2013.

Am I crazy?,LOWBACCA,washingtondc,https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/22k1dt/thinking_about_moving_to_dc_without_any_knowledge/,"So I've came to the conclusion that my current city (Toledo, OH) doesn't really have much to offer me any more. I'm making about $10.00 an hour here with a degree and I'm quite frankly sick of it. I assumed a State Department internship abroad would *maybe* enough to help me find an OK entry level job here..... but I'm starting to see I was wrong.

Anyways, so I guess I'm just looking for some local opinions on two things. 1) What are the odds of me getting some sort of entry level job with a Poli Sci degree over there? I have to assume the market is saturated with Poli Sci grads, but are there enough jobs to match it?

And 2) What's the best neighborhood for someone who wants to live in the city and be able to walk to places and meet people? I'm planning on having at least 5-6k to keep me on my feet long enough to hopefully land some kind of job to pay the bills until I can actually find something related to my degree, and I'm definitely leaning towards living with roomies because it makes no sense to me financially not to.

I found a sticky, but it seemed to be years old. Any fresh opinions would be awesome though.

After I grabbed all my shit I headed for the register when a girl stopped me and started talking to me. She said she was doing a project and asked me about myself. I told her about how I was new in town at an internship. She was smiling a lot, laughing at what I said, and told me her name. She then began to tell me about herself, and how she needed my help. It was a magazine subscription sale of some sort... She mentioned that people usually buy magazine subscriptions for themselves and some to be donated to a children's center.

Since I get paid for my internship and I'm lucky to be making some money nowadays, I thought it would be good to donate something to someone and help this friendly girl in the process. When I looked at the magazine list they were pretty overpriced, but idk what the fuck magazine subscriptions cost and it was for two years anyway. I ended up getting one for myself and one for the children, I didn't have cash and I don't carry my checkbook so I got some cash out when I paid for my stuff.

When I got my cash out I asked her if she had proof that she was part of an organization. She looked at me funny and told me that I was getting a receipt (with a cancellation policy of a full refund if I really wanted). She wrote down a website on the receipt and gave me her Facebook address.

After talking to her a while longer about stuff like my plans for the future, my career, and whatever else, she then handed me my receipt. I started walking out of the store and she said she'd walk me out to my car. Me feeling a little strange, I kept the money in my pocket...

But this is the real kicker- She said thank you and goodbye to me and walked away without my money. I didn't stop her; I was extremely reluctant to give someone I just met that much money despite the cause. I got in my car and started to back out until she knocked on my window. She was laughing and said she forgot to ask for the money. I nervously laughed too and gave her $100 cash for the two magazine subscriptions. 

I got home and did some research- the company that was on the receipt (Midwest Circulation LLC) is a complete fucking scam. I read so many stories of people who had the exact same thing done to them, and when they try to get a refund the ""company"" makes endless excuses and threatens with lawsuits etc. Fuck I'm pissed and feel so helpless. I guess I'm more naive than I thought.

I'm a Canadian student looking to work in the US after graduating from GATech, and I have a few questions.

1. How available are internships, co-ops, and research opportunities at GATech, and what percentage of CS students are involved with these these?

2. The GATech website lists the starting salary for CS grads as $70k but a relatively small fraction of grads respond to these surveys, so I was wondering if some CS students/grads on this sub can give me more some more details regarding employment opportunities?

3. Are there scholarship opportunities at GATech for international students? Tuition is more expensive for out-of-state students and I don't qualify for financial aid, so it's a stretch for me.

4. How important is it to choose the right threads at GATech, and will your strings affect your co-op/job directions significantly?

5. Do many CS grads move away from Georgia after graduating? I'd like to join my family in San Francisco after I graduate, and I was wondering if GATech is a reputable school in Silicon Valley.

6. What is the male/female ratio for CS majors at GATech? Edit: I'm male.

Thanks! :)

Do I graduate early and go get a job, or do I stay back and work on my resume?

Some more little facts to help your answer:

-I currently have a job in which I am doing IT and programming for a department at my university

-I have not done any internships.

-I have little extra curricular CS things, but plan on working on that should I graduate next year or not

Before I decided to switch, I applied for a lot of accounting positions. I've gotten a couple of phone job offers but I'm not sure what to do. Here are my options: 

1) I could take the job to make some money and quit by September 

2) I could spend the next five months learning everything about computer science and doing projects so that I have a head start with my career. 

There are many factors to consider in my decision so here they are: 

1) I have not had income or a real office job for 2 years, just student loan money. I would be happier if I didn't have to live like a hobo and always worry about cash 

2) I will be completing my degree in 2 years so there is minimal time for me to complete my projects in order to sell myself for an internship or full time job 

3) I know some python and java but I have only done my self studies for 2 months 

Do you think accounting experience would be useful for my career? I am interested in all paths of software engineering including programming for accounting applications. Deep down inside though, I think I really want to do web development or mobile apps. However, in the end, I just want to have a good career in the field of computer science. Should I choose option 1 or 2? Thanks!"

I enjoyed going to her because she would push me to go out and socialize, be confident in situations I normally wouldn't feel comfortable in, and help me deal with my dysfunctional family.


Recently found out that it's not possible for me to continue seeing her.  I'm considering looking for a qualified cognitive-behavioral therapist in the area.  Another option that I have is my school offers free counseling services.  For some reason I feel ashamed to go there and have other students see me.  Also, it feels disheartening that I have to start over with a new therapist that doesn't know anything about my life.

I feel alone, have trouble concentrating on school work, feel mentally slow, and have no passion for anything.  Is it worth checking out the counseling services at school?  Are the ""therapists"" there generally students doing an internship, or are they fully qualified licensed professionals?

**tl;dr**

My therapist of eight years who has pushed me to succeed academically and socially in spite of my dysfunctional family no longer accepts my insurance.  Haven't seen her in months.  I'm now doing poorly both socially and academically.

Feel lonely and out of touch with society.  Considering cognitive-behavioral therapy or free therapy at school, but feel ashamed. Is the free counseling offered at universities professional?  Or just students with internships?  How important is it to continue seeing a therapist?

I learned Avid in school, and have since worked on FCP7, Premiere Pro, and am currently teaching myself After Effects.

I've worked on Avid mostly for short films, and use Premiere for my own personal projects that I shoot by myself.

I am not a stranger to doing runs, in my current internship on CONAN I get coffee and lunch for the post department every day. I don't mind it though, I am just lucky enough to be able to observe the editors work and learn as much as I can from them. I hope to serve a similar role as a Runner.

I'm a student with an internship so I did this in the evenings / weekends.

I use software in order to track the time I spend on a project.

Over the span of 3-4 weeks I've put about 30 hours into this mobile app.

But I hit a wall at some point, the app makes use of a database filled with data, data put there by other software.

The software(license) and a server (vps) are needed to continue.

When I informed the client of this, and offered to set it all up, he declined and said he would take care of it.

I don't hear from him in weeks, so I contact him and ask him if he has taken care of it.

""Taking care of it, getting a second opinion from a guy that knows all about this kind of stuff"".

A week passes (Like I said I'm a student and I had some tests to take during these weeks so I was quite busy) and I contact him again.

He regrets to inform me that he has to cease the project because of family issues.

So here I am with a dead project that I roughly put 30 - 40 hours in to.

What do I do in such a case? Send a bill for the hours even though I didn't complete the project? "

Right now I am 20 and in my third and final year at university studying Information Technology, I have only 1 and a half semesters to go. Towards the end of last year I started have spouts of anxiety attacks and depression, at the time I didn't realise this is what was going on and kind of didn't do anything to help myself, just thought there was something wrong with me and let it pass and it did pass. I then had three months off uni and it was pretty good, I felt better I felt like me.

Fast forward to the end of the holidays and I took up a internship that I was required to complete for my degree, everything was going great for the first few days. Then ""BANG!"" it was back with a vengeance, struggling with social anxiety and panic attacks during and after the days was done. This sent me into a hole, dreading going in everyday for my internship and then on top of that uni started back up. So at this time I was managing Uni, internship and part time work with no days off in between. I just felt trapped in a cycle that I just had to wait to get out off, as my internship was only scheduled to continue for 8 weeks. So then almost every week I would have at least one day off and normally I would pull myself back together and feel great again, normally this would involve smoking a whole lot off weed, which usually sent me into a panic attack but I thought it helped at the time for some reason. I have quit smoking now and maybe even drinking so I can pull my life back on track and face these things that have been pulling me down, mostly things I wasn't even aware of.

Anyway I am back to pretty much just 2 days of uni with no commitments in-between. But I have come to big heartbreaking realisation, I do not enjoy what I am studying. I come into uni and see other people passionate towards what we learning, and I see it as something I just want to get out of the way as quick as possible. I choose IT because in high school I really like creating animations, but I thought perusing a job in that would be too hard to find work. So I thought I opted for the next best thing, I was kind of just going to uni because I didn't know what else to do. 

Now I find myself at a crossroads I only have about a semester and a half left until I graduate, but I find myself miserable half the time although there are some days I seem to enjoy. I would enjoy studying something else, but I think I have had enough of studying altogether at the moment. 

My current plan is to complete my degree, travel for a while and then come back and find something that I would like to explore as a job. I just dont know how I am going to get through the rest of the year at the moment. I am starting therapy tomorrow, I really hope I can find the right attitude to just finish my degree, and not make all of those years a waste. I am starting to do better with my anxiety, and hopefully I can push past that sometime soon.

Extra thoughts:
I do enjoy working on things such as websites, but from teaching myself. I was just in a lecture for ""PHP"" and as much as I enjoy writing up the code and figuring things out from home, I was just miserable during the lecture and couldn't stop thinking about my future.

I will try to keep this as short as possible and any help is MUCH appreciated.
I am 22 and graduating this summer with 2 business Bachelor's from two different institutions (one of which is a top UK school and the other a quite respectable EU school). 

My studies were mainly focused on Economics/Accounting&amp;Finance and my work experience is also mainly related to finance. I've worked abroad in the US for a summer, I've done a banking internship, and for the last ~2 years I've worked part-time for a small investment bank as a junior analyst. 

My background has made it fairly easy to enter the finance industry as I got full-time offers from the accounting Big4 (E&amp;Y, PwC, Deloitte, KPMG) companies for audit positions. I've tried applying for start-ups and more creative type of business jobs, as well as data analyst jobs, but I can't seem to get into anything that is not related to finance.

My biggest concern is that I am NOT looking forward to doing finance as a career AT ALL. I've now sort of decided that I want to pursue a career as a computer scientist, but I'm unsure as how to do it. The way I see it, I have 4 options:

A) Join Big4 as audit consultant, gain work experience for ~1 year, quit, and enter full-time CS Bachelor's next year. How much would having a Big4 company's name on my resume help my CS career in the future? Even though the work is different, the hiring process of these companies is still fairly demanding and the names are both respected and well-known in the industry. 

B) Not accepting Big4 offers and immediately starting CS Bachelor's in September. I would not get a well-known corporate name on my resume, but I'd get a 1 year headstart on CS studies.

C) Working for Big4 for a while and doing CS Master's conversion course. This is an option offered by UK schools and takes 1 year normally. My concern is that 1 year is too short of a time span to teach me anything that is required in the industry so I will be completely unemployable in that field even with the degree. However, it would be much faster compared to a (third) Bachelor's.

D) I've also considered doing a CS degree whilst working for the Big4, but it has several drawbacks. I would have to attend a lower ranked school due to the location of my job, and my GPA would quite likely suffer due to the intense workload. This would also not leave me with any time to complete my own projects or create a portfolio to use when I start applying for CS jobs.

**TLDR:** Have 2 business degrees from good schools, and a very good career in finance is most likely available to me. Want to switch to CS, what to do?
Any help is very much appreciated!!"

I would like to know your opinions on what would be a good thing to work on as an intern at a (relatively) well-known security consulting company. The internship is organized by my university, it would last for 4 to 6 weeks and I need to propose a project that I can finish on my own in that time. It needs to be something that makes use of AI/Machine learning/Data Mining techniques and that can be of use to them in analyzing their clients' security infrastructure and providing advice and information services to them. 
For reference: one of the subjects I discussed during my interview that they seem to like is this: they have an internet scraper that gathers information about vulnerabilities and such in software that is used by their clients and I would perform analysis using data mining techniques on the data gathered by this scraper. 
All suggestions are welcome!"
22lvy3,26,2014-04-09,"Me [21 F] with my father [50s], where is the line when it comes to my education and life in general, and is he crossing it?",throwawaymyparents,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/22lvy3/me_21_f_with_my_father_50s_where_is_the_line_when/,"I'm starting to realize my father has control issues, and may even be emotionally abusive towards me. Background: He is married to the devil, and since he got married, he has taken out a lot of his anger and stress from his wife on me. He curses at me and becomes very explosive. He especially gets this way over my education, which he is obsessed with. Yes, I understand his anger issues at this point are not my step mother's fault because he is in charge of his own feelings and that if he's not willing to get help with his marriage or for himself, then that's on him. I'm just saying that she is the catalyst, because he never used to treat me this way before he started to get emotionally abused at home.



Anyway, my issue is him over stepping his boundaries. I'm a college student and I live 4 hours away from him yet I feel smothered. he has been obsessed with me getting into college and having a good career since I was born. My last name was even affected by this so I could get a minority scholarship [I'm half hispanic...but not his half]. He told me, ""you're hispanic on paper, but in real life you're white."" In high school, he made me take SAT prep for a year, rather than 2 months like everyone else. He also sabotaged a school play audition by calling my teachers behind my back to make sure I didn't get a role higher than chorus. When he thought I was going to get a lower grade in an AP class, he viciously tried to get my teacher with 20+ years experience and tenure fired against my will [he failed]. In high school, this made me extremely uncomfortable, but I thought he wasn't overstepping boundaries because he's my father and I lived under his roof and was still a minor. 



Now, I'm in college, and he still thinks doing these things is okay. he pressures me to provide him with my professors' and advisor's contact information...which isn't so bad except he thinks it's okay to call if he doesn't agree with their teaching methods. I can't have this. I am in a great program that treats the atmosphere like a professional studio. 



I don't usually give in to his demands for their information unless I think it will be a harmless conversation. He had questions about my program, so he called my advisor before. I thought it was overstepping his boundaries a little since it's my education and my job to keep tabs on him instead....plus it's not as if i haven't tried explaining my program to him before. However, he would not stop pressuring me and reminding me he pays for my schooling, so I figured what's the harm if he just wants general questions answered.



The harm is that he started asking, or more like demanding, to speak to professors. I'm working on getting an internship and my dad was not comfortable with how my program handles it. He wanted to speak with my professor. He pulled the money card again and wouldn't stop calling me during class until I had to pull her aside and ask if it was okay, apologizing in advance for my dad. I told him she's not just my professor, but my boss, he needs to respect that and not overstep boundaries and be careful with his words. I told him I shouldn't even really be having them speak, but it seemed like the only way he would understand and calm down about my internship. 



They spoke and he left me alone for a while. She didn't seem to mind, but I didn't want to make a habit of this. Now that it's closer to summer break, my dad was pissed at my professor that my internship is still being figured out. He came here to visit to ""spend time with me"" and meet my professors [we are a small nit major] and then threatened to pull my professor aside and talk to her about the internship. He had a nasty tone about it and was cursing her name so I didn't think it was a good idea. I purposely kept them from seeing each other in a setting where he could pull her to the side to discuss me. Again, I told him she's not my professor but my boss in this setting and he needs to respect that. I asked if he thought it was appropriate if his father were to contact his boss and he said no...but completely missed the point and went back to wanting to ""talk to her.""



So yesterday I heard back from HR for the place I plan to intern at and they asked for a letter of recommendation from an employer. I don't have time for a job at my university and the last place I interned at [abroad] has not answered my emails the past year despite me trying to contact them...and to be honest, they said I was over qualified for them and they ended up giving me busy work because they had no idea what to do with someone who already knew the same programs as their actual employees since it was unpaid. Any jobs before that were related to babysitting and were a long time ago. 



My dad was calling me for days for updates about the internship and I told him my concerns and immediately he started cursing at me. ""I told you to FUCKING get your letter of recommendation when you were abroad!!!!"" He told me this several days after my internship had ended and when I tried contacting them they didn't answer, as I said before. He started freaking out and then hung up on me when I told him I am under a lot of pressure right now and I don't need this from him and I need him to be supportive. I can't go back in time and get the letter. He hung up on me, then proceeded to call me all hours of the night which I ignored telling me now he has to get people to lie for me. He just called now as well and keeps emailing me. He even tried pressuring my grandma to find someone to lie for me.



When my grandma called, I told her what he's doing is emotionally abusive and not what a father should do. She said what he's doing is coming out of love and I told her even if it is coming from a good place, it's not healthy for me and I refuse to speak to him if he's going to treat me this way. 



He's also tried to control what major I'd chose before. I wanted to take this major since I got to my college, and he wanted me to go into nursing. He told me the only reason he ""let me"" accept my current major is because I'm ""not good at anything else,"" referring to how I struggled my first year of college because the classes I took weren't subjects I was passionate about like I am about my major.



He also threatened to stop funding me because he didn't approve the guy I'm dating because he has an associates degree and not a Bachelor's at least... but that's a whole different story. We went to therapy about that and how he was overstepping boundaries and acting inappropriately. His therapist said what he's doing to me is emotionally abusive and he needs to back off and stop cursing at me. It worked with the dating situation but he's still a pest when it comes to everything else.



I'm sure someone will suggest I take out loans. I'm already almost done with my degree at this point and doing that will cause more issues with my dad. He's been saving up since I was a baby and even though he treats me this way, I feel stuck because I live off campus and my major required supplies are extremely expensive and I have no time for a job to make up for it. Is there another way to get him to calm the hell down? So far I've been ignoring his 10+ phone calls since last night into this morning. What else can I do?



TL;DR: Father is emotionally abusive about college and is overstepping his boundaries because he thinks he is entitled since he is paying for my education. What is he entitled to exactly and where is the line? How do I get him to back off?"

I finally decided that I'm just going to be blunt and send this email

&gt;I'm sorry for the late response. I'm still in lab right now, and I will be for a while, then I'm going to the gym.  I understand that you would prefer to speak in person or at least over the phone, but due to my really hectic schedule lately, I don't have a lot of time in a row to be able to speak. Also, I want to be able to reflect on everything before I answer, so I'd prefer to go through email for now.

&gt;I appreciate that you are trying really hard to work on our relationship, but I'm just not interested for the foreseeable future.

&gt;One of the big issues is the time. For example, this week, I have 1 cs exam, 2 quizzes, 3 large hmwks, 1 cs project worth 15% of my grade, 1 com speech that's worth 20% of my grade, 1 lab report (if I don't get at least a C on just one, they automatically fail the lab portion of the class), and all this is a pretty standard week. I spend all my time in labs studying and doing homework, walking to and from my apartment (it takes almost an hour one way to class), and I try to make it to the gym for an hour everyday. Any extra time is spent maintaining my long distance relationship and planning a wedding. I average maybe 6 hours of sleep at night. Less than two weeks after the semester is over, I get married. The very next Monday I return from my honeymoon, I start my internship. I'm going to have to commute an hour each way during my internship as well as taking two online summer classes. All of this while maintaining my long distance marriage. I'm working right up until classes start again, and I have the same problem as above. I might have had time to maintain a relationship, but I don't have the time to restart one or to work on one. I've been spending so much time trying to figure out what to say to you that it's causing a lot of problems. I just don't have the time to try to figure out what to say to you. I need to be able to sleep, eat, and get good grades. You're just not a priority over my health or my future.

&gt;Even if I did have time, I'm not sure that I want to work on our relationship just yet. I'm glad that you recollect a pleasant past between us, but that's not my opinion of it. I'm surrounded by wonderful people here, and I don't want these bad memories to resurface or to make me anxious. I've actually had more anxiety since you sent me that original email about Andrew's diagnosis than I've had in a long time. It's not healthy for me, and I'm not willing to sacrifice my health, my happiness, or Jim's happiness just so you feel better. If you really are not narcissistic, then you will realize that talking with you so much right now is really damaging to my health, grades, happiness, and relationships, and you'll let me come to you when I'm ready.

&gt;That's right, I'd like you to try to be patient, and I'll come to you when I'm ready. I might be ready in a year. I might be ready in 30 years. I might never be ready. I will most likely see you at family functions, but I'd like to stop emailing for a while. I will most likely not want you to come to my wedding. I want us to go back to not talking for a while, and I don't want to have to be worried about when you'll email me next. I want to come to you when I'm ready. When I'm ready to work on things and move past things. If you decide at that point that it's too late and you don't want to, I can understand that. If I end up regretting this, well, that's my own problem. I really think it's best for me and my life for me to get my own shit together first.

&gt;Alright, well, I've said what I needed to say. I hope all the best for you and yours, and I hope things start turning around for Andrew.

&gt;-Emma


&gt;PS You may want to read the comments at the bottom of the page of that article you sent me. It seems like most people didn't agree with it, and they actually expressed opinions similar to my own.

I'm currently 2 semester away from graduating from my 5 year accounting program in NY. I will be applying for the Big 4 and top 10 accounting firms this coming Fall semester (September). I've been interning for almost half of my undergraduate life, 2 years and 6 months.

My work experience involves 1 year and 6 month in accounting at a small non profit and 1 year in tax at a BB.


I've been out of work for the past 4 months and am just relaxing and enjoying life. I was hoping to continue this beautiful work free life until I graduate, but I feel like public accounting firms may look at this poorly =(.


I'm deciding on whether I should apply for a summer internship or not. If I do, then it'll be good way to close to gap but if I don't I would have 9 months of no activities on my resume during recruiting season.


What do you guys think? Is it ok for me to continue bumming out like this? 


Thanks"

The 3 clubs are listed on my resume, but there's a serious gap in experience. It is as follows (for context I'm an accounting major):

Two jobs January 2011 - July 2011.  (very business related)

Camp counselor summers 2010, 2011, 2012. (nothing related to business)

Internship summer of 2013. (100% related to business)

And now these two jobs that I started this semester. 

My question is, should I delete one of the jobs in 2011, or the camp counselor job?  Without the counselor, there's a serious gap on my resume unless they look at the 3 clubs I did during 2013-2013.  But the 2011 jobs were very business related.  So I'm kind of caught in the middle.

22mmwb,29,2014-04-09,The cautionary life-cycle of a young director.,againsttheatre,Theatre,https://www.reddit.com/r/Theatre/comments/22mmwb/the_cautionary_lifecycle_of_a_young_director/,"You were a weird kid. You didn’t try to be, you just never cracked the code of fitting in. One day you linger after school to haunt the halls for no reason. A group of other weirdos, you discover, has congregated in the auditorium. You approach... and soon find yourself playing Cassio in the drama club’s forthcoming production of *Othello*.

Thereafter you habitually leave the building for home long after dark, laughing and jumping with an actual bonafide group of friends like the cool kids have. The warmth of *belonging* swells your veins to bursting every time you stride into rehearsal. A crush develops on a girl. Your acting becomes more focused in a complex and relentless campaign to positively impress her.

The pageantry and the rush of opening night, in front of everyone’s parents, the acclaim in the lobby when you emerge out of costume, as you steal glances at your crush, willing her to return them (she doesn’t), the shouted goodbyes to your new lifelong friends in the parking lot, all amount to being hooked, *hooked*, on these feelings.

You are involved in every play thereafter. The seniors get to direct. In sophomore year, you begin to devote serious time to daydreaming about how you’ll do it. And then, impossibly, it arrives. Your shot. And if all that preceded was cocaine, directing is motherfucking heroine.

And colleges, in a tacit implication that there is a profession to be had out there, actually offer drama club as a major. So you better believe that’s what you major in. And then it’s all the glory and belonging and sense of accomplishment of high school theatre plus alcohol and sex. It cannot be beat.

So when you graduate, what the hell else are you going to do but start a theatre company? Then it’s the glory and the belonging and accomplishment and the alcohol and the sex and the import of business and the purposeful devotion to the survival of the company.

And when you really feel like you know what you’re doing, the triumphs, the *narrative* of the company's success well practiced on your lips, what else will you do but seek advanced training? And grad schools, plainly stating that there *must* be a profession to be had out there, actually offer *advanced training* in drama club. Then it’s the glory and belonging and accomplishment and alcohol and sex and dinner parties and the first rich people you’ve ever met and elevated language and truly talented colleagues and two thousand years of history and the inevitability of success and the sense that you were put on this earth to do this.

Then, penniless and suddenly in massive student loan debt, you dutifully report to New York City. This exorbitant rent sounds fine, you tell yourself and your realtor, it’s only a matter of time before your talent will be noticed to the tune of champagne corks popping on the nightly. But it’s not the same here. Everyone takes theatre very seriously but in a strange, impenetrable way. the industry is run by middle-aged-women, gay men and privately-educated trust fund babies and you share, unfortunately, little in common with any of the above. You try to do the network thing but these cool cats smell the eager on you two weeks away. You’ll have to start as an intern at some theatre company among the twenty-two year olds. But you’re thirty. And were a massive success at a pretty well-regarded graduate school. Shouldn't you be a few spaces ahead on the board?

Meanwhile, none of your friends seem as panicked about money as you (later, to your great chagrin, you will discover that they are all either independently wealthy, from New York originally, or just a lot more resourceful than you). For you, New York feels like a port from which every ship sailed before you got there.

Someone advises you never to assistant direct. So you start taking gigs in the provinces. One year, you direct 11 plays, you can now call yourself a full time stage director. You are living the dream... and you make $11,000. Gone are the glory, the belonging, and the accomplishment. Lingering are the alcohol, the elevated language and the debt. Your life is suddenly one big hangover of three years in grad school delaying several inevitable truths.

You (permanently) sublet the New York apartment you barely ever slept in because you were too busy directing two-year-old plays in Boise, and you go home. Now you live with your mom. You are 31. You carry on the fight from your new base of operations for a spell, but then... one morning... you remember (or misremember) a sentence you read sometime in grad school, back when you were on top of the world, when you knew you were born to do this. A sentence that didn’t mean much to you at the time, but now, 30 pounds overweight, watching on-demand on your mother’s couch, the truth of that sentence finally reveals itself to you.

*Are you in this world to participate in the arts? Or are you in the arts to participate in the world?*

You haven’t read a newspaper in years. You now only feel comfortable talking to other theatre people. The Theatre made you feel fulfilled, deeply, because of the belonging and accomplishment you achieved.

You were not participating in the world, you realize. You were participating in yourself.

Everyone you know is proud of you for pursuing this ""passion"" against all odds, but now, in a flash, it all feels like a hollow, deceitful ego trip.

But you are an *artist*, for a *living*, a part of you pipes up to protest. Oh? What art have you made and why did you make it? Why did you direct a play in Florida about golf? Do you have the remotest connection to either Florida or golf? Did you even *like* the play? Have you ever liked *any* play? Be honest.

Holy shit, you think. I haven’t been participating in the world at all, I’ve only been participating in myself. How horrifying. From now on, you resolve, I will only participate in the world through this art form. And you might even get lucky, and find magical seaside towns that are last stands for important theatre. And you might squeeze out a few last beauties with some wonderful people.

But you will not escape the inevitable truth that this is not your art form anymore. It demands deep personal sacrifice. It isolates you from the rest of the world. You must miss funerals and weddings for it. And when you look extremely closely, you realize that, ultimately, it is an art form that is of, by, and for *the initiated*. The moral conundrums presented by the material have outcomes that everyone in attendance already agrees with. And when you look closely at the plays, they are too often written by the wealthy, for the wealthy, about the poor. The whole enterprise, the audience, the artists and the writers, begins to feel like an echo chamber for self-congratulating bourgeois sentimentality.

And just as you start to ask yourself these questions, you see a trailer for a little independent movie called No One Knows About Persian Cats. A fiction/documentary hybrid about rock bands in Tehran having illegal shows under the pretense of shooting this movie (but really just to have rock shows) and actually getting arrested and staying in character to use the footage in the movie. And you are struck by the fact the theatre, meanwhile, is still attempting to be cool with backwards baseball caps, popped collars and sunglasses. This movie is what is *actually* cool.

So that’s it. Now you do film. Penniless, you dutifully report to Los Angeles. You try the network thing again but you really are no good at it (years later, you will finally hear the advice you wish you’d heard prior “don’t network, make friends”). You spend years thinking about directing film. And years *drinking* about it. You go to parties where everyone just talks about “projects,” and experience the acutely fraudulent pang of referring to yourself, when asked, as a ""director"" while having yet to actually direct anything.

You visit a television set where everyone just talks about food, cars and real estate. These may not be your people. You surmise that television procedurals just reinforce xenophobic, gun-loving right-wing ""values"" for a Kansas pancake-eating audience. So features it is. You pick up the knowledge that horror movies always sell. You know it behooves you to just make a $50,000 horror movie, but that’s not you. It still feels wrong. You were a genius in grad school. They have to notice eventually.

They don’t. Finally, by the grace of many benevolent friends, you actually make a short film. Off we go, you think. In the making, you bring to bear your years in theatre, your advanced training in grad school, your awareness of the zeitgeist. You say to yourself, I didn’t come all this way not to take some risks. And you attempt with mixed success to shoot all sorts of moons. Six months of blood later, you submit it to several dozen film festivals at $50 a pop and wait for you career to begin.

And then as the rejections roll in, you have a harder look at film festivals. And suddenly you realize, dear god they’re pyramid schemes. And all the Cinderella stories you heard were deliberately publicized that way. And worse than that, in their programming, they’re the same echo chamber all over again. It’s wealthy people, making stories for the wealthy, about the poor. It’s no better than the theatre.

By now, you had the sense to marry that one woman at the Los Angeles party not talking about projects. And you have a hilarious and adorable baby son who has put all this, by nature of his very existence, into perspective... as the flailings of an egomaniac with no grit.

She makes documentaries, and she too talks of the echo chamber. Documentaries, she confirms, are wealthy people, telling stories to wealthy people, about the poor. And just like in narrative film, and in the theatre, there is a collective fever dream that any of this will make a difference.

That somehow John Boehner will stumble across our Showcase-code production of a Sarah Kane play, or our short film about charming minority pickpockets taking over their elementary school, or our documentary about incarcerated lesbian Eskimo softball teams and he will be forever changed about this issue, and institute policy changes on Capitol Hill starting Monday.

Now you are pushing 40. And you resolve with your wife to lean in to your day jobs, say ""fuck recognition"" forever, refuse to play the echo chamber game, die in obscurity and just make weird art to please yourselves.

If no one is interested in art made outside the foundation-program-director-pleasing, bourgeois, sentimental, toothless echo chambers, you resolve, at least you can leave your truest, most authentic, freak-flag-waving nonsense for your son.

And just like that, you are no longer a ""director,"" you are a citizen of the world who, among other things, happens to know how to direct."

I'm an 18 year old high school student from Ireland and am really interested in doing an internship over the summer. I know all the major law firms, banks, accountancy firms etc. around Europe do internship programmes but mostly for undergrads. I would be especially interested in getting into a fast paced technology or financial services start up. I do some coding, know Python, C++, java script etc. I take advanced math course in school and have French and Irish(not that would be of much use). I wouldn't mind travelling for this.

I also need to heavily review my Data Structures book because I'm assuming that will be a very important topic. I know I can kill any basic questions, but have forgotten a lot of the key Data Structures stuff. Anything about arrays or string traversals I can do off the top of my head.

Hi Mom, it's your 24 year old son. I left your place at 16 because we didn't get along. You'd give me shit for staying up late at night (3AM) when I had no school. You'd give me shit because I didn't want to study in the field  that you wanted me to study in. 

You're not the one who raised me. I would only see you every other weekends. From as far as I can remember, my grand-parents and my dad were the ones who raised me; the ones who put me in private school. From what they told me, you skipped town for a year for work when I was under 7. 

As a kid you would be so fucking mean to me. Calling me incompetent when I left something you were cooking to burn when you never asked me to watch it. 
Or cancelling a planned trip to the amusement park because my knife slipped from my greassy hands and hit the plate loudly. 

When I was around 12, you wanted to take my dad to court to have full parental rights over me. In the court papers that either you or my dad left somewhere, I saw that you accused my dad of being part of a cult where the followers would try to enter a ""trance-like state"" to speak to their God. (My dad is a pentecostal (born-again) christian. What my mom refered as trance was something called speaking in tongues.)

Even though saying bullshit about my dad should've been an indicator of how batshit crazy you can be at times, I didn't see it. To reach a middle ground, I proposed that I lived with you a week and with my dad the other week. 

At 16, I got tired of your shit. We would fight about the stupidest things. I'll conceed that some of the fights were entirely my fault. But most of them were yours. During a night like others, we would have one of our last ones. 

I almost hit you. I got tired of the way you wanted everything to be done the way you wanted. I got tired of how you claimed you were paying for the house when it was my step dad who did. When I asked for proof, you said no. I remember you telling me your should have aborted me. I remember calling you a whore. I can't remember much else except us, yelling at each other. Us yelling at each other woke up our step dad. What happened after is a little fuzzy in my head but I clearly remember you pushing him so violently that he fell on his ass. This was the last night I stayed at your place. 


You contacted me sometime later. You apologized, promised that you would become a better person. We both admitted our faults (and I have many) and slowly, we started builing a realationship. 

Over the past 8 years, we had many fights. Fights over the fact that I followed a sound engineering class and that I am only doing my internship now after finishing my final exam 4 years ago. 
Fights over me going back to school. Even if I told you countless times that I will do it, even if I told you countless times to stop talking about it because we always keep fighting over the subject, you fucking kept mentioning it. (One time it made me leave your place on Mother's Day)

Fights over stupid shit like how one time,  during a trip in New York I said something about a story of how mcdonald's coffee is brewed at a higher temperature and you started calling me a liar and that I sometimes invent bullshit in the hopes of recieving attention. 

Fights over what I want to do with my hair; I don't fucking care that you think dreads aren't ""cool anymore"" I wanna get them. 


Everytime we had a huge fight, you bought my love and a way back into my life with gifts and broken promises. For a reason I can't find, I accepted them maybe in the hopes that we would finally get a cool realationship. A realation that I sabotaged a few times as well. I've stolen money that you were supposed to give me from you. I've lied about why I didn't want to comeover to your place. 

Now, we are both looking into driving lessons for me that you said you will pay but that I know you will drop out along the way like so many times in the past. 
Maybe I am stupid to accept another one of your pathetic attempts at love but the way I see it, in a little more of a year of driving lessons, I will be free. I will be able to go back to school in a field that you won't approve of but I don't fucking care, I'll be 3 hours away. I'll be free of the public transit system, and I'll finally be able to apply to most jobs that are related to sound engineering and sound design. 

You can be so fucking hypocritical and manipulative at times but this is who you are and I guess there is nothing I can do to change that. 

I never asked for much. All I care about is your acceptance and your love. 

I'm starting to think it's too much to ask.

Since she has no tech knowledge whatsoever, she's reaching out to us to see if any of us have any idea of how to do it. I'd like to say that I'm fairly experienced with computers, but I've never really dealt with much networking related.

* Any recommendation on a camera? I'm assuming the best kind of camera for what she wants to do would be an IP camera. Our rescue is very small, so I doubt there would be more than like 10 viewers at a time.
* I realize that setup might vary from camera to camera, but generally how would I go about setting up the camera so that it can be accessed by other people from the website? I've read stuff about DDNS services, but the whole process is kind of confusing.

I'd also like to note that cost may be an issue. The rescue is run out of the director's home and relies solely on public donations for funding. I believe the director is paying for these cameras out of her own pocket, so I don't know how much she's willing to spend on a camera and any kind of monthly services. Cheaper would be better.

22o05b,3,2014-04-09,SFA tips from an alumnus.,elchicodelgado,sfasu,https://www.reddit.com/r/sfasu/comments/22o05b/sfa_tips_from_an_alumnus/,"/u/Snekcip asked me for tips about going to SFA in another post so I figured I'd just make a new thread. Full disclosure, I graduated in 2005 so I haven't been in school for 9 years or half a lifetime for the freshman out there. Given that don't be surprised if my thoughts are dated. Some thoughts are SFA specific and some are general college so, here it goes.

**Stick it out**-If you're from a big city then Nac might be a shock. I'm from Dallas so the town was suffocatingly small at first and I wanted to leave my first semester. Many felt that way but don't do it and don't check out mentally right away. Give it two semesters and you'll love the place. 

**Get outside**-Nac is so freaking beautiful and I squandered my time way too much. Go out, fish, play disc golf, shoot along the Angelina river bottoms (if you live off campus and can have a gun…). Seriously, take up outdoor hobbies. I played a lot of disc golf to get out but I could have done so much more. 

**Food**-Eat at Szechuan. Seriously, it's good. I worked there for four years and I still love it. Get lunch to go. It's cheap and they serve the lunch menu on the weekend. That's a do. Here's a don't… Don't eat four big meals a day. When I was there we had a pizza hut between 14 &amp; 16 that stayed open till midnight. Not sure if that's still there but I didn't need wings every night as a fourth meal and you won't need whatever BS you want to eat at 11 pm on a Tuesday… Do take advantage of your meal plan if you have it. You paid for the meals so why spend a ton eating out? Go now and again but don't throw money away. If they still serve the buttermilk pie in the cafeterias then do eat that. It was soooo good. 

**Entertaining yourself**-(no, not like that perverts). Do use the facilities on campus. When I went to school the facilities were god awful but I still used them. Don't you fools have a lazy river now? Seriously, the doubling of my tuition in 4 years paid for some really cool stuff on campus so don't be too cool to use them. Pro-tip, pick up racquetball. It's easy to play, hard to master, cheap and fun. Also, the freshman 15 doesn't stand a chance if you play that regularly. 

**Sports**-Go to the games now and again. I've been to more SFA Football games since college than when I was there and I regret that. They're fun and cheap. I don't mean stay in Lumberjack Alley and get drunk next to the game either. Go inside. I'm not advocating this but the if you have to drink then put a flask in the old boot. Don't drive though. Speaking of which…

**Housing**-Do enjoy the dorms and don't hate your roommate for no reason. If you can sleep regularly and he or she in't a total slob then you don't have to like them but not liking them doesn't make them a bad roommate. I didn't like my first one so I thought he was a bad roommate. Because of that I move my mattress across the hall and lived underneath a neighbors raised up bunks for a year. That was so effing stupid. Three guys in a shoebox with trash everywhere yet my roomie had his own place. Yeah, I showed him… So, not driving. I think most need to take a swim through Woodforest when they leave the dorms. It's cheap, shitty and close so you can walk to class. What more can you want???

**Maximize value**-Do take classes at Angelina college but not too many and not early. If you can barely get to campus by 8 then you're not driving your ass to Lufkin that early. Definitely take the harder classes there however. I could only muster a D in a class at SFA that was a pre-req for another so a D wouldn't suffice. I took it at Angelina, got a D and it simply transferred as passing so, boom, I moved on. Also, it's cheap cheap cheap down there. Take summer school classes at least one session but take ones that interest you. They are longer so pick something you don't hate but the vibe really is more laid back so it doesn't feel as stressful. Do use career resources on campus. I don't know what SFA has because I didn't use any of it. I landed ass backwards into a great career but it was luck. Now I work with interns at my company and I can't believe the lengths their schools go to in order to help them get jobs. Find out what SFA has and use it!

**Graduate**-I'm a lazy lazy man and I procrastinate but in my mind not graduating simply wasn't an option. I had way too much fun and didn't short change myself one bit but I knew I had to graduate and did it. Don't lose focus of the reason you're there. Have fun, drink too much at times, do dumb college crap, etc but don't forget why you're there. 

**Stick around on weekends**-Being a college town it becomes a ghost town on the weekends. Your first semester you'll go home instinctively on the weekends but don't do it all the time. Kick that habit early. Campus is really cool on a Saturday. It's so open and you can actually appreciate the prettiness of your school when you're wandering around without being stressed about class. Seriously, that's a beautiful school so enjoy it. If you don't think it is then take a swim through Commerce and look at A&amp;M Commerce. You'll be inspired by your school after that…

**Dump your high school girlfriend**-Especially if she's going to another… Nevermind, you're not going to do it. You'll be different for sure. Absolutely, you've got it all figured out like nobody before has. You'll see. Speaking of which, if you actually did figure it out and your buddy didn't then don't be a dick when he's all heartbroken. Trust me, you'll have a buddy that ""didn't see it coming"" so don't be a turd. You'll do something as dumb or dumber. 

**Don't drink underage at bars and take it easy at house parties**-Look, you shouldn't drink either place until 21 but I'm not dumb. That said, they do stings at bars and you will get an MIP, that's not good. SFA was really house party centric when I was there and I know you'll go but take it easy and *don't drive*! College students are 95% good and 5% predators. Don't get too inebriated to know the difference and when in doubt, leave. Just leave right away. There will always be another party but you may lose something you can't get back if you're dumb. 

**Don't drink and drive**-My best friend in college was such a smart guy but he drank, drove and drank while driving. He had big plans to be a firefighter but his junior year he rolled his truck, blew a .11 (that's barely illegal but it doesn't matter!) and now he stocks product at a warehouse. Just don't do it. 

**Don't get the stupid credit card**-Fine, you'll get one but just one please. Also, the $500 limit they give you at first will balloon quickly. Don't max it out. Seriously don't.

**Find scholarships**-That is free friggen money!!!! I got like $2k without trying hard and not being ranked in the top 30% of my class. Had I applied myself who knows what I'd have gotten.



Those are my thoughts for now and I'm speaking to a non-existent audience in this little traveled sub but if anyone stumbles across this post then feel free to PM me if you want to ask questions.

My question is, when should everything really come together?

In my college we do have a senior capstone project to do in order to graduate, but we have no idea what it is.  Is there a time to see all of these classes come together into a bigger picture or is CPE undergraduate school just studying the trees without ever getting to see the forest?"

I am documenting a SCCM setup for my internship and I keep on getting questions what kind of redundancy measures are possible in SCCM. Since my knowledge about SCCM is limited to what I've found on the internet and Microsoft course books, I am turning to you guys to provide me with some leads.

My setup consists of a stand-alone primary site with an external SCCM and WSUS database that is hosted on 2 separate SQL Server named instances on a SQL cluster. I have also implemented an extra server in the DMZ that hosts an extra MP and DP on HTTPS (since the company mostly has external consultants that connect to the domain through internet).

I know it is possible to provide an extra SMS provider at the cost of extra network load on the SQL cluster but since I only have 1 CfgMgr site it would be useless.

I have read that the very concept of SCCM does not require redundancy but I have not found meaningful reasons that I can reproduce in my documentation. Can anyone provide me with some insight on this?

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks"

I had some happy success testing each of these out today (but that might just be because the decks I faced were quite broken), but I feel some improvements could be made.

My primary concerns are:

* Gabe: The mixture of hardware might be a bit excessive. E3 did work for me with knight and against HB ice, but I could be persuaded that the slot is better spent elsewhere - similarly for Replicator and its influence.
* Jinteki: I am quite enamoured with RP/sundew/encryptiion protocol/ichi working together, the whole deck worked well to create some taxing centrals and a really painful remote. Neural katana is the only piece of ice I don't like (stops being taxing as soon as mimic comes out), but there is precious little else in faction. Power shutdown can be nice, but with only interns to recover agendas I can see it backfiring.

Are there any improvements you guys could make? As a relatively new player, I would also be interested in hearing some overall strategies to go with these decklists - what to mull for, general gameplans and so forth.

11. USA (San Francisco, Washington, San Diego)
12. Switzerland (Zurich) 
13. United Kingdom (London)
14. Luxembourg (Luxembourg) 

    ...

About us:

* Both 26 of age (going 27 late this year)

* My SO will finish by september her bachelor degree in marketing and communication (includes an internship at a public relations consulting company)

* We're both fluent in english, my SO is also in french.
* Reason for emigrating: Social-Economical

What I would like to ask:

* Is any of the countries/cities a no-no? Should i include any other country and/or city?
* Per country, What's the average living cost per person (or couple) ? What's the minimum wage? What's the average wage?
* Is it true that you have to pay to enter Australia?
* Is it really difficult to enter Switzerland this days?
* Any tips/advices?
* Also, what else should i ask? x-P

Thanks for reading!

edits: 

I intend on finishing my master degree in the place we emigrate to (just the thesis, depending on the accepted equivalences), so that's an important factor also on the final decision, education conditions.

Per country, do companies usually offer housing/transportation to foreign after the agreement or as part? Or is that something we must definitely not count with?

**Requisite on going is that at least one of us must already have a job offer at the destination.**"

22p1qt,3,2014-04-10,How to search for job when strongest experience is from current position?,iAMaHUSKY,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/22p1qt/how_to_search_for_job_when_strongest_experience/,"I am finishing my MBA in less than a year (part time, working full time), and I have a background in Civil Engineering.

I had 3 x 6 month engineering internships in college, followed by almost 3 years of experience as a Professional Engineer before quitting to work for a small manufacturing company.  I wanted to get out of engineering but needed more business-related experience, and this seemed like a great opportunity - and it really has been.

Theoretically I am the Head Estimator, but being a small company I wear many hats.  I am also a cornerstone of the Sales and Marketing team and a small portion of my week is always spent working with Project Management.  To be clear, I work for a small joint venture created with a company in Germany - our German manufacturing ""parent"" is a very large company, but my company (the US rep) is only about 15 ppl.  We engineer/manufacture/supply green construction materials and facade systems.  So we are really in a sense small because of the small number of employees, we are a ~$16 million a year business.

At a larger company I would not have the benefit of having such broad experience, but being a small company I honestly don't think i spend more than 30-40% of my week on estimating as I do so many other things.  I even take responsibility for managing smaller projects as a salesperson would in regions we don't have a dedicated salesperson, and develop and close on these contracts myself.  Initially I was working for another estimator, but had done so well he moved on to being sales full time and I took over estimating, and we are looking at hiring someone to work for me and they even offered me a sales commission on projects i work on (normally only done for sales) as a part of the promotion.

Without dragging this on, what I've gained at this company is invaluable experience to coincide with working on my MBA.  Since i now directly work for the CEO and he has little interest in growing the company outside of our niche market (no interest in vertically integrating or expanding to other products, etc.) I don't see myself staying here when I graduate.

My problem is, if I start applying to other positions and want to leverage my experience here as I look for other jobs, will employers hinge their decisions based on if I will allow them to talk to my current employer?  I feel uncomfortable making them a part of my job search by asking if any of them could be references, as we are somewhat of a ""family"" - but I may need that in order to move on to the right position.  

Just as a reference by the time I graduate with my MBA I would have been with this company for just over 2 years.

Does anyone have any experience in this situation or advice?

If I didn't provide enough detail anywhere please ask.  I just want to do right by them - they are good people and this is a good company, they just don't offer what I want long term.

TL;DR - My best and strongest experience is from current employer, small company of less than 15 employees. What advice would you offer on a job search and will/should I expect to have prospective companies speak to my current employer in order to secure a new job? As I plan to leverage my experience here heavily.

I just recently got my internship I was hoping for and as my reward, I'm investing into a new computer.  Now, I've never built my own computer and there are a few areas that I need help when decided parts for.  The areas are mostly the motherboard, case, power supply, keyboard, and memory.  I've done quite a bit of research, but I don't know the fine details that might separate the good from the best.  My budget is sitting around $2000 and I can change that if need be.  I'm mostly going to use this build for gaming, but I would like to be able to stream and capture without any problems!  Thanks for the help once again!

22pckl,2,2014-04-10,I want to ask if exist a tutorial on cryptographic/hash function and such ?,j3lackfire,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/22pckl/i_want_to_ask_if_exist_a_tutorial_on/,"Hi /r/learnprogramming.

This question might seem weird but right now, I need to learn quick to know and understand how to implement a hash function algorithm. Are there anysource I can find some basic tutorial on cryptographic and such ? Thanks.

Long version :
I am a 3rd years students in ICT and I am doing a internship for a local company. My project for the whole time would be on Document duplication Checking. The company is making a Online News Website, they produce hundreds of article a day, so they need somethings to check to make sure they don't put up a same article on their website over again.

That's the purpose. For the works, the guys at the company have already implemented a ""tokenization"" technique to do as below :

They devide the articles into token, and named them as ID (example : the strings Human would match the ID of 000001, for example). For every article, all of their information would be stored in a Vector of (n dimensions) with each dimensions is a token (human-000001, people- 00002) with a weight, for example, the token ""human"" appear 4 times, so the weight of it would be 4, the token ""people"" appear 0 times, so the weight of that is 0.

So and so, to compare the article, they compare the article's vector to see how similar those articles are.

After that is where my works start in.

Because the vector size is quite big to compare. So they need to reduce the size of the vector to make comparing faster and more efficiency.

In order to do that, they need a hasing algorithm. But the problem is that, hash function, like MD5, could make the very similar source, become much much different after encrypting. So, we need a encripting algorithm to make similar input, out come to similar out put. Which is called SIMHASH.

And the thing I want to learn is :
-I don't know anything about encrytion AT ALL. So I really need a quick tutorial (or article, or anything) to the beginner level of HASH algorithm
-Next, I would want to know about the SIMHASH or something similar to that.

Anything would be fine, super appreciated. Just throw everything you have or you know. Thanks a lot, a lot and alot :)"

Now that I'm past the general education stuff and getting ready to transfer to a university to get into my engineering classes I started thinking about internships and getting a job when I get out, but I'm a little concerned about how my credit will affect this.  When I couldn't find another job a few bills got behind and now they're in collections.  I believe I have a job lined up but it's not a company that is willing to work with students.  I'm left with the choice to continue going to school and see if I can find a different job willing to work with me or take the job and get my finances straight before trying to go back to school.  My main question is how bad would something like bad credit/collections on my record affect my ability to get an internship and eventually a job? If anyone has any experience or knowledge in this I would appreciate.  Thanks."
22pfrv,3,2014-04-10,"[PHP] Why won't the email send to the multiple recipients? Googled, read manual, still stuck.",yellowmarbles,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/22pfrv/php_why_wont_the_email_send_to_the_multiple/,"I am a programming student working my first internship. Wee! I am fixing bugs in a PHP-heavy website left behind by the last guy.

This code that I am working on comes from the registration page. After the user fills out the form, it is supposed to pull the user's email address from the form and send a confirmation email to that email, which works. My boss wants me to get it to send a copy of that email to another email address, so that he is notified whenever someone signs up.

After reading the [php manual mail page](http://php.net/manual/en/function.mail.php), I thought this would be easy. It says that the 'to' field in the mail function can take multiple recipients as a comma separated list. Only problem is, I still can't get it to work. Emailing the new user continues to work, but I haven't gotten the second recipient to work.

Here is the code: ($email is pulled from the form and seems to be working fine)

    $headers = ""From: no-reply@website.com\r\nReturn-path: no-reply@website.com"";
    $body = ""The Body"";
    $to = $email . "", second-address@website.com"";
    mail($to, ""Registration"", $body, $headers);

I also tried writing it as, mail(""$email, second-address@website.com"", ""Registration"", $body, $headers);

I also tried adding the second address as a ""Cc:"" appended to $headers.

Where am I going wrong?

**EDIT:** I solved this but I still don't know why this is the only thing that works. What I had to do was declare a second variable, $email2 = ""second-address@website.com"";. Then the mail() call had to be changed to mail(""$email, $email2"", ""Registration"", $body, $headers);. Using mail(""bob@site.com, zack@site.com"", ""Registration"", $body, $headers); did not send an email to either bob or zack. No idea why any of this is happening as such, based on the manual."

However, this scheme offers no additional funding and I am therefore limited in where I can go as I have an apartment. My long term aims upon completing my PhD are to complete a biology post-doc and attempt to enter into Academia. The opportunities for internships are mostly for law firms, banks and estate agents, none of which really appeal to me or I feel I would be able to win at the interview stage. 

There is also the opportunity to be assigned to a school for three months and assist in lessons, sort of like a completely untrained TA, which I thought might be interesting but maybe not very relevant. 

So I am posting to see if anyone has an opinion on where I should attempt to apply, if perhaps I'm not thinking long term enough, or whether teaching in a school for three months would/ wouldn't have any impact on my future scientific career. All advice appreciated. "

I was actually able to get my current job in retail from /r/SFBayJobs, and I've been working there for over a year now. However, I think it is time for a new opportunity as this job probably will not allow me to gain any more usable experience (I don't want to come off as whiny, I'm very grateful for the job, I just think its time for a new opportunity). The job, also, has gotten very repetitive, almost too repetitive. 


Anyways, I'm a 19 year old guy going to SF state right now (going to be a sophomore next semester) majoring in information systems, but have been thinking about switching to urban planning. Other than that, I have not really explored any possible internships yet as I am considering the major change, but I will explore some internship opportunities over the summer and next semester.


Another reason I need an actual job over an internship is because I live on my own (stupid choice?). Luckily, financial aid has been covering my ass (for now, at least). 

As for work experience, I'm pretty much settled in with the normal job responsibilities in retail (cashiering, merchandising, stocking, customer service), and I've been doing that for over a year. Other than that, I've also had experience working in a Japanese food shop in Honolulu, Hawaii (where I'm from) for about 6 months. I didn't do much cooking, more food preparation and cleaning. 


Like most if not all college students nowadays, I would say I have above average experience with computers and technology, and the introductory courses I've taken so far for ISYS have allowed me to gain some knowledge about networking. I've been really into building PCs, I've build 2 PCs from scratch for my brother and his friend in the past, and I try to help my friends with their PC problems when they arise. 


Talking about my personality now I suppose, I would say I find difficulty creating conversation with others (my customer service skills have kind of sucked in my current job, to be honest), but I try to help others as much as I can, provided I know what I'm doing. I feel like I would flourish in a clerical or office kind of position, but I'm always willing to step out of my boundaries. 

As of now, I'm vigorously searching through Craigslist and the student employment website for SFSU. Ideally, I'd like to have new employment near the end of this semester, so that I can fully devote myself to training over the summer. 

Sorry for the big block of text, I just thought I'd describe my situation in full detail, considering that previous post on this subreddit :P 

Thank you to anyone who reads this entirely! "

To search for more jobs (e.g. non entry level, non engineering, etc.):

 - Go here: https://jobs.boeing.com/JobSeeker/JobSearch

 - Occupation: 6 something, depending on what kind of engineering you want to apply into. (My area is 6G, “Mechanical and Structural Engineering”. For non-engineering jobs, choose whatever occupation sounds right for you, or just search for ""All"".)

 - Job Type: Salaried Non-Management (unless you want to apply to a manager job)

 - Country: United States

 - Region: Southwest (unless you want to look for jobs elsewhere, in which case you won’t find as much)

 - State: California (again, unless you want to try your luck in other regions)

 - City: Seal Beach (you can also try Long Beach and others, or ""All"")

 - Experience level: All Levels (or whatever applies to you: Intern, Entry, etc.)

----------------------

***A NOTE FOR NON-U.S. FOLKS***: A lot of people are asking ""I am not an American. Can I apply?"". The short answer is ""Sorry, probably not"". In most (probably all) of these requisitions, you will see ""US Person Status Required? Yes"". This means you need to either be a US citizen or have a Green Card. Sorry. There are exceptions, but in general, the only foreigners hired by Boeing are people working at the top of their fields, doing impressive work, not people who are entry-level and/or unemployed.

***BUT WAIT!*** Boeing suppliers and contracting companies, however, do often hire foreigners and support them through the visa and Green Card process. The one that is hiring most aggressively at the moment is [B/E Aerospace](http://www.beaerospace.jobs/be_careers/global_supply.htm). They make seats, including most 737 seats, which at 42 airplanes a month... is a crapload of seats! Another one is [Goodrich](http://www.utcaerospacesystemscareers.com/jobs/descriptions/continuous-improvement-specialist---aerostructures-everett-everett-wa-job-4263531), which makes all the landing gear for all the Boeing airliners except the 787. As for contracting companies, I have heard good things about [CTS](http://www.ctstechnical.com/index.cfm/employers/), but I know there are others. Anyways... If you're a foreigner, these suppliers and contracting companies are your best bet. Work there for a couple years, get your Green Card, THEN come over to Boeing. I know several people who have done this.

***A NOTE FOR NON-U.S. FOLKS***: A lot of people are asking ""I am not an American. Can I apply?"". The short answer is ""Sorry, probably not"". In most (probably all) of these requisitions, you will see ""US Person Status Required? Yes"". This means you need to either be a US citizen or have a Green Card. Sorry. There are exceptions, but in general, the only foreigners hired by Boeing are people working at the top of their fields, doing impressive work, not people who are entry-level and/or unemployed.

***BUT WAIT!*** Boeing suppliers and contracting companies, however, do often hire foreigners and support them through the visa and Green Card process. The one that is hiring most aggressively at the moment is [B/E Aerospace](http://www.beaerospace.jobs/be_careers/global_supply.htm). They make seats, including most 737 seats, which at 42 airplanes a month... is a crapload of seats! Another one is [Goodrich](http://www.utcaerospacesystemscareers.com/jobs/descriptions/continuous-improvement-specialist---aerostructures-everett-everett-wa-job-4263531), which makes all the landing gear for all the Boeing airliners except the 787. As for contracting companies, I have heard good things about [CTS](http://www.ctstechnical.com/index.cfm/employers/), but I know there are others. Anyways... If you're a foreigner, these suppliers and contracting companies are your best bet. Work there for a couple years, get your Green Card, THEN come over to Boeing.

Some background information (not exactly a necessity for the story, but thought I'd introduce myself): I'm a last-year high school student (meaning I'm a 19-year-old) from northern Europe studying Computer and Communication Technology (the closest you can get to studying IT on a high school level here) and recently finished an internship for a medium size company (~500 employees with nation-wide offices). The company does inspections on virtually anything that's using an engine: elevators (or lifts for the British people out there) escalators and so forth. I worked for their internal IT support, dealing mostly with pre-assigned hardware tasks but occasionally with on-site support.


So anyway, to the actual story....

&lt;$user enters IT dept.&gt;

**Me**:    Hey there $user! What seems to be the issue?

**$user**:     Well, my HDD crashed. Can you help me retrive some files?

**Me**:    Okay, I'll do my best. Is it anything from the DATA folder? (There's an automatic backup for this folder, plus a couple of other ones, for every user in the organization. Sometimes they don't initiate backup so it was worth asking).

**$user**:    No, it's not. They were some personal photographs...


Now, I (and the rest of the crew) were instructed not to spend time on non-work-related inquires but most of our users are genuinely nice people, even though they're lusers, we usually did it anyway. This time included.


**Me**:    Okay, gotcha. I'll do my best. And what would the name of the folder be?

**$user**:    It's the one named **No Backup**....


I did manage to retrive it, and hooked him up with a fresh SSD instead of a bulky HDD. I told him afterwards he should backup his files more often. Hopefully he'll obey.


TL;DR user's HDD crashed, wants me to retrive folder named *no backup*."

There's a branch of TechOps that is looking for someone with general computer support skills (like those in ITC 190 and 191) to work starting this summer for a longer-term position (as in, multiple semesters). You can also use parts of the work experience as credit toward one of the IT/CS internships.

22q6v1,1,2014-04-10,[Build Help] Crossfire or new card?,Tisaric,buildapc,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/22q6v1/build_help_crossfire_or_new_card/,"Hello,

So I've recently come into a paid internship thanks to my school's engineering program offering an internship as credits, so I've now got a little spending money for my build. I currently have the following:

CPU: AMD FX-8320 Vishera 8-Core Black Edition

Mobo: MSI 990XA-GD55 ATX

RAM: 2x Kingston HyperX Blue 4GB DDR3 1333MHz

GPU: HIS Radeon HD7850 2GB DDR5

HDD: 1x 1TB 7200 RPM 6Gb/s

1x 750GB 7200 RPM 3GB/s

PSU: RAIDMAX Hybrid 2 RX-530SS 530 Watt PSU


Now, with the current build, I can play most games around the typical ""High"" or ""Very High"" settings around 60 FPS (give or take), but as the newer games have been coming my way, I've seen more and more FPS readings reaching the lower ends of 30 or lower, which can be acceptable, I'd much rather keep close to 60.

And this is where the question comes in: would it be better/more futureproof to simply buy a new card, say a GTX 770 or Radeon R9 series, or buy a 7850/7870 and crossfire the two? I've heard arguments for both sides, but I'm tending towards crossfiring as I've loved my 7850 so far and it's only been about a year since I got it.

Also, if you see any major upgrades I could do other than the GPU, any help would be appreciated. I was considering an SSD, but I still feel at the current price, I wouldn't get as much out of it as I'd like.

Also if I HAD to put a budget for the card, I'd probably want to spend about $500 at the very most, and that's a bit steep.

Thanks!"

22q8i3,1,2014-04-10,I'm a [25/f] married for one year [26/m] wanting advice re: my feelings about a topic.,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/22q8i3/im_a_25f_married_for_one_year_26m_wanting_advice/,"Ok, so my husband and myself are just hitting our 1 year mark. We have been together for a total of 6 years, some years better than others, but this past year had been the best yet in terms of growth with each other. We have a great sex life, we are best friends, have our own hobbies, and have a great marriage thus far. However, recently an issue has come up and I want to make sure I am not over-reacting/ nip this in a bud before it has the potential to cause real damage. My motto is trying to prevent a “buildup of emotions.”

Prior to getting married he made-out with some girl when he was drunk while I was at an internship (making us many states apart). I decided to forgive him, mostly because I really respect him and I understand people make mistakes (not that it is ok to do). We had a nice understanding that we can forgive and not forget, and if I needed to talk in the future for reassurance (not to hold it against him) he would be there and willing to listen. I never bring it up, never get jealous, never treat him badly or blow up arguments into talking about that event....I made the decision to forgive and that is what I intend to do. 

The problem is, recently I have been feeling annoyed with his behavior. On 3-4 occasions I have caught him staring, rather intensely, at females he finds to be attractive. I don't care if he finds others attractive--hell I find other guys to be attractive all the time and I think that is normal. What bothers me is if we are at dinner for instance, and he is staring at a cute waitress to the extent he is not even engaged in our conversation and others notice. Or we are at the grocery store and he stares at someone the whole time and turns around to check her out. Honestly, it is rather embarrassing. 

I told him that it is ok to find others attractive and look, however when it is literally non-stop staring/ checking out I get frustrated. I think my feelings are hurt more than anything. I work hard to forgive and make sure I do not use those past feelings to make him feel bad, however I find his behavior to be disrespectful. I told him how I felt, and he says he “compulsively” looks and then when he notices I saw him look he stares almost uncontrollably. Basically he knows he shouldn’t “look” and that drives a compulsive-like behavior. This makes no sense to me because 1. I said he can look---just don’t be so damn obvious/ hurtful towards me and 2. He is aware of his behavior. 

Maybe I am being sensitive because he is about to start graduate school (a short 12-month program) where we will have to live apart during the week. Maybe feelings are re-surfacing? I need advice. I am trying to be upfront and communicate well but I don’t want him to feel like I can’t trust him or something. Sorry this is long and I hope it makes sense.

TL;DR: My husband and I have a happy marriage but a problem recently came up. In the past prior to marriage (while we on a distance relationship) he made out with a girl while drunk, I forgave. Now recently he has intensely stared at/checked out attractive women around me and I feel hurt. We will soon be spending the week days apart because he is starting graduate school. Am I over-reacting?

""Well why don't you get a job in that?"" People tell me. Well because it's not that easy, I have virtually no skills in programming (did a couple of modules of it. Hated it.) So thats out the window, I have no skills in composing or real world experience to go with my music tech degree. Plus I don't really want a job to do with my degree ie studio music stuff.

So then my mother tells me ""oh I just met a girl at a friends birthday party, she's a voice actor in gaming and all that kind of nerdy stuff, I added her as a friend on facebook, I told her about you and you should talk to her about getting into the industry.""
""but I don't want to get into the industry, you know that""
""Yes well, you don't know that, you probably don't know enough about the industry to say, she could help you""
By this point I'm getting upset in the conversation, I hate having to talk to random strangers, it's not like shes going to give me a job straight up and there definitely people more qualified than me. 

So I talk to her via facebook, she's nice enough and she gives me some links about women in the gaming industry, talks to me about what I'm interested in and tells me to look into internships. All in all, friendly lady. I only talked to her so as to appease my mother about the whole situation.

Well thats a sort of summary of it, I don't know where to turn to, my self esteem is really bad, I tried being a booktuber for a while and I enjoyed it but I lost hope in myself and stopped.

 I don't know what to do with myself, what is the right thing to do? When I think about it to much it just gets to much and I cry a lot so I normally bottle it up and move on. What's right for me?"

However, I'm just a Freshman and I can't find a lot on what I can be doing now.

I'm extremely passionate about all things computers and really want to be a developer. I just feel clueless what I should be doing though beyond showing up to class and throwing a thing or two on GitHub here and there.. What are some things I can do *NOW*?

Can I get an internship or part-time job at my level? (I have 6 months experience working as a Computer Information Technician, does that help at all?) I always see people recommending to contribute to open-source projects, but I only really know the fundamentals and don't see how I could contribute to something worthwhile with that. 

Right now it just feels like no one even acknowledges what they did for their first few years of college and just skip straight to saying how they are now making $120k at a big four company.

What are the steps that people are taking? What can I do?"
22qfkp,5,2014-04-10,A place where I interned 2 years ago can't/won't confirm my employment for my background check. Am I screwed?,evryvillainislemons,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/22qfkp/a_place_where_i_interned_2_years_ago_cantwont/,"I am a student set to graduate college this May, and I recently was offered a position with a large national company once I graduate, pending the background check and drug test, the usual. I'm going through the background check right now, which has been contracted through a third party (HireRight). I submitted it yesterday, and it looks like they were able to get in touch with all of my employers except for one internship I had nearly two years ago. 

I worked as a ""Graphic Design Intern"" for a local magazine. Basically, I designed advertisements for one of those crappy 'magazines' that are entirely made of advertisements that they stuff in your mailbox. The whole experience was pretty bad, but I was able to swing it well in interviews and make it sound like I got something valuable out of it. 

The only problem is, apparently HireRight now can't get in touch with the people that own the magazine. It honestly does not surprise me that no one is picking up the phone there, the place is an absolute shitshow. They want me to provide some sort of documentation proving that I worked there when I said I did, but I never got paid for the months that I worked there, and I don't have anything else I can use to prove it.

I guess my question is, what happens if they can't confirm I used to work there? I don't have any documentation that I worked there, and I didn't leave on the best terms so I am not sure how helpful the owners will be if I call them (Long story short, the internship was supposed to be unpaid until I learned the ropes, at which point they would switch it over to paid. I worked there for several months, and was skilled enough that they were having me train other interns, but they still refused to pay me. Between that and the fact I was also doing the job of their real-estate intern for no pay since they couldn't find anyone to fill the position, I ended up quitting with no notice a few months before I had originally promised to stay. Probably a stupid decision, in hindsight, but I was 18 and I couldn't afford to buy groceries and they wouldn't pay me, so I quit for a job that actually would pay me). 

If it ends up being that my former employers can't be contacted or refuse to cooperate with me, how much will this hurt me? I have two other employers on my resume, and I'm not even taking a job in graphic design - at the time that was my major, but I'm graduating with a degree in Computer Science now, and I have 2 years working at a helpdesk on my resume, during which I was promoted twice to a student leadership position. Both my boss here and the position I worked pre-college (tutor at a learning center) have already confirmed that I worked there, so is it going to look really bad if they can't confirm I was an intern for a couple of months two years ago?"

I'm a first year engineering major at Cal State Fullerton. I have a few questions for you higher grade engineering students and/or current engineers. 

1)I'm currently Engineering-Undeclared, but I'm leaning towards computer engineering as it is far more interesting to me than mechanical and civil. (My school offers those three, EE, and CompSci.) Because of that, I haven't taken any major courses yet, but I will probably start with the intro courses next semester. Any tips on what I should learn or know before hand? Currently learning some HTML, but I don't think we'll be using much of that, if at all.

2)Similarly, what did you all do during the summer after your freshman year? I have no experience with engineering and as mentioned above, I haven't taken any engineering courses so an internship or research for the summer is likely out of the question. 

3)Lastly, does the school you go to make a big difference when looking for internships/jobs? I know a lot of Redditors here go to big engineering schools, while I'm at a Cal State :( "

22qxfx,1,2014-04-10,Disney World Job Application?,[deleted],disney,https://www.reddit.com/r/disney/comments/22qxfx/disney_world_job_application/,"Howdy! Well, I'm not sure if this is the most correct place for the post, but I figured it's a start. I'm most interested in becoming an employee of the Walt Disney World company, and as such, am here to ask several questions to any and all current or previous employees/cast members, visitors, veterans, witches, wizards, ducks, or mice of the aforementioned company known as ""The Happiest Place on Earth."" I'm a senior in college and have been to several of the job fairs that Disney has been a part of on campus, as well as gone in person to the Casting center to gain more information. My issue? Everything seems to be of such a large variety that I'm unable to figure out exactly what to do or where to go! 

Let me start at the beginning, I'm studying Information Technology, yet am not looking for an internship. I've worked throughout my college years in my field, so I have a peak over 4 years of experience in customer service, technical support, and the likes. When I went into the Casting office, they gave me a little job information card and told me to apply online. Is this normal? I had actually talked to a cast member that told me to go over there in person and made it sound very easy to be informed. So you may understand my surprise when I was not even given a handshake, but a small card and a very curt, ""Thank you, have a nice day."" from the man behind the desk. 

Now, I'll go further into my debacle. I've always dreamed of working at Disney and making magic for people visiting from all over the world. So much so, that I'm willing to relocate to the area from where I am currently living. (Georgia to Florida, not too far!) And I have several plans that I'm thinking of putting into effect in order to make this happen. First option, apply for a career position with my resume and hope I get the job right off the bat. Second, get a smaller, part-time job whilst finishing my degree, and then after graduation, Fall 2014, attempt to apply for the higher position within.

I've looked on all of the sites that were provided and have found several positions I'm interested in applying for quite soon. Here are my main questions:

* What is the hiring experience like? Are interviews professional? Friendly? How long does it typically take to be considered/hired?
* How many interviews are normal at a company like this?
* Are there any other previous/current cast members that are willing to network or give information on what type of I.T jobs there are at Disney? (The descriptions are broad and somewhat vague.)
* Is there anything I can do to increase/keep from decreasing my chances of being hired?
* Any general tips or tricks of the trade to appear what they're looking for in a cast member? (I'm a bit shaggy haired, and have a small beard, both of which I am willing to turn ship shape in order to match my professional persona.)
* Should I do the wise thing to not relocate until I have the job in hand? Or would it be best to be looking for places? 

I appreciate any and all comments, and hope I have posted in the correct place! My most optimal and hopeful outcome is to be able to have this happen sooner rather than later, hence this post. "

To make a long story short: I was always a shitter in school. Then I went to college (UK college, 16-18) and retook my GCSEs and didn't do any better. Then when I was 18 I got a call from my old school saying they fucked up and it turns out I got a borderline A* in IT.

That meant I could apply to a better course at a shitty college. So anyway, I got predicted AAA doing the better course, but I'm 95% sure my teacher bumped up my grades because I'd never legitimately got an A in my life before. This meant university went from being a distant dream to very fucking real, and I could get into a good university too.

Got into a top 10 uni despite my academic record and began studying for an accelerated masters in computer science, I must've believed my own bullshit if I thought I was capable of that because I had to retake my first year, which they only let me do because my dad died.

Aaaanyway, while believing my own bullshit I decided I wanted to work as a banker or a software developer at a big tech firm, but the more I'm realistic about things the more I see that just isn't going to happen. I feel like I don't belong at this university, but because I'm here I'm being groomed to go into these top jobs where, even if I get them, I reckon I'll crash and burn. Even got a couple of interviews for internships on account of my school and college grades, but at interview I left feeling like the stupidest guy alive.

TL;DR: I am a retarded imposter at a very good university. Want a top job when/if I graduate and now realise that's not going to happen, and even if it does I'll crash and burn once inside. What would you do? Basically just wanna hear what other people would do in my shoes, plus advice."

I will be in Germany (with my SO) from 1 July - 31 December this year for an internship.  I am looking for inexpensive, furnished, single room, rental  apartments in Hanau, Frankfurt (300-500 Euro).  I've been searching the internet for apartments and I found many useful websites. eg. [Immobilienscout !](http://www.immobilienscout24.de/). 
I found that although the prices are listed by apartment rent/month, when I call and inquire they always say I'll be charged more (~200 Euro more) because my SO will live with me and for utility costs.  
What are the right questions I should be asking to make sure I understand the total price of living in a rental apartment for a month (including heating, electricity, gas, utilities, etc).  I've heard about a ""warm and ""cold"" cost, but I don't understand it.  Also, what are other questions I should ask the housing agencies to make sure I don't get scammed into a bad apartment.  

My requirements are listed here.

* total rental period, 6 months (1 July - 31 Dec, 2014)
* furnished apartment
* 1 room or studio
* living space &gt;20 m^2
* total cost (everything included) ~300-500 for 2 people (me and SO)
* dependent on public transport
* no pets/non smoker

Any information from locals about the rental apartments is welcome.

-------

**New Today**

* With the bastion config pretty much ready from what I understand I think we can roll out at will, so bastions will be going online some time in the next couple of days, since I actually have free time. 

* RealisitcBiomes continues to choke on its config for some reason, I will have to email a copy of the error and the config to the dev group, for some reason it seems my github does not have issues enabled and I don't want to dig around in that this morning. 

* I would really like to get some advertising in, we might just have to ignore our version behind situation while I have time to do an advertising run, its really just not going to be feasible to wait. 

* [The Humbug fix](https://github.com/erocs/Humbug/issues/67) issue still need to be patched. 

* I should probably start looking into internships for next summer. 

-----------------------

**Ongoing Subjects**

* It looks like the latest testing factorymod.jar keeps loading its own config out of the .jar instead of accepting the ones we give it, so we should probably get a new compilation with that fixed and then double check the config for yml issues. Once again this is pretty much whats holding back 1.7.5, I might just go ahead anyways without bastion if its not ready soon.  


* Current status of plugins that I would like to get online, all in one quick bullet:

 *   [Bastion](https://github.com/spaceFountain/Bastion) Thanks to Waffle for reviewing the .jar, the updates are in testing and all we need to sort out is production setup and radius. 
  * [FactoryMod](https://github.com/ttk2/FactoryMod) needs the BastionBlock factory, plus a serious decrease in printingpress costs. 

* The new ticket system is now pretty much ready for testing, if someone could please start sending plugin issues and non-sensitive modmail issues to this email just to test it out that would be great jira@civcraft.atlassian.net

I'm stuck in a rut and just don't know how to move forward. I feel like I've been stuck in this position for a few years and I don't know what I'll do if I don't move forward soon. It's killing me inside - the frustration, the anger, and the sad desperation. If you'd like some back-story, please read on. Otherwise, please tell me - how do you get yourself out of a rut? I feel like I can't even separate the 'me' who knows I'm stuck and the 'me' who's making me stuck (if that makes sense). As a result, I'm quite anxious a lot of the time and fast running out of stamina. I don't know how long I can keep this up.  

Back-story; Or 'Why I'm writing this now' 

I don't really know where to begin and I'm not particularly articulate at the best of times so I apologise if this is a little incoherent. I just need to get the words down and then I'll summarise them in a more lucid tl;dr afterwards. 

Let me begin by saying that I'm gay. It's been a long, very difficult journey to get to the point where I can say that. In fact, I'm 23 and only coming to grips with it now - despite not living in a part of the world (Australia) where homosexuality is particularly stigmatized.

A couple of years ago (almost two), I dated a guy called Michael. He was my first 'boyfriend' and I really wanted things to work. At the time, I was living out of home, had plenty of privacy, and was excited to finally - *finally* - make use of the freedom I had moved out of home in order to obtain. I thought that maybe I would become more comfortable with myself, I guess, and vanquish the anxiety and intense self-loathing that pervaded my adolescence. 

Well, perhaps I was expecting too much. I was needy and moody and not nearly as ready as I thought I was. The basic problem was that I found it impossible to expose myself emotionally . And I liked Michael - I liked him a hell of a lot.

We broke up after almost a year and I remember - quite vividly - the sudden and painful clarity with which I understood the nature of our relationship at the same moment that it ended. *Of course* he finds me overbearing, I thought, my god - how didn't I realise? And then something very strange happened - I fell in love with Michael. For the first time. I was experiencing love for him despite the fact that our relationship was over. The timing was awful. After a while, I kind of pushed it out of my mind. I dated a few other guys and, although nothing very meaningful came of it, I did enjoy myself a little. 

We remained very close friends and had several conversations in which he emphasized his wish never to date again. I respected that. I should say that he's only just moved out of his very conservative home - a home that made it more or less impossible to be with men. 

Fast forward to now. A lot has happened. I finished a degree that's practically worthless (I studied a language that I still can't really speak and it's not going to help me find a job). I move into the bottom of my grandmother's house to save money and... I've more or less failed to save any money at all. I've fought off depression, relapsed, recovered, relapsed, recovered... you know how it goes. At the moment I'm doing 'okay' - but 'okay' isn't particularly impressive. It's a mood in which I can get by but hardly a mood in which I'm 'flourishing'. 

Today I found out that Michael, who just moved out, has started sleeping with other guys. I want to emphasise that I think this is *great*. I'm not angry that he's doing this and nor am I so hypocritical as to think he shouldn't be. But when I found out - almost by accident - I realised that I still loved him. 

You still love him, said my brain. 
Fuck. What the fuck., I replied. 

I immediately wanted to cry. How could I have suppressed that knowledge for so long? And then the floodgates opened. How is it that Michael has moved out of home and finished his law degree and gotten an internship and started dating people and received a highly paid job while I basically *haven't changed* in a year. I'm not progressing. I'm not doing anything. I'm just treading water. All my wonderful friends (including Michael) - friends whose success I celebrate and don't resent at all - are doing terrific things. And I? I'm just... wasting away. 

I'm sick of hating myself. I'm really sick of being in the same goddamn spot. I just want to feel like I have the ability to achieve things. As it is, I'm taking things day by day. I'm terrified that in a year's time I'll still be the same person instead of somebody new and interesting and excited to be alive. 

This just isn't working for me.

tl;dr I feel like I haven't changed in any way for almost two years. I'm not doing anything with my life and sick of being stuck in a rut. "
22s2nb,18,2014-04-11,What's a good strategy for reading Cracking the Coding Interview also I kinda suck at these algorithmic questions am I doomed?,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/22s2nb/whats_a_good_strategy_for_reading_cracking_the/,"Sorry for the multiple questions in this post. I have an internship interview at a big 4 in the coming weeks. I'm going to try to set up an interview the week after next to give myself enough time to practice. My last interview was with amazon and I didn't get it because I only studied for one day because of exams.

I really would love to intern at this company and I am determined to get this internship. My only problem is that I'm not that great at the tricky algorithmic questions. I'm the type of coder who needs to read the spec multiple times to understand the problem. From there its 70% planning, design, and coding and 30% stack overflowing for solutions to a subset of problems. Overall I have no worries with my programming abilities that I would need to use on the job. I'm not a bad programmer, in fact I'm the guy my friends go to for help in their programming assignments, I am just weak at the programming competition style of these interviews.

I feel it is a weakness of mine to solve these algorithmic problems quickly and under pressure. Therefore I plan on going through CTCI to try to understand the questions in the book. Any advice on learning this book and not just memorizing it?"

22seks,3,2014-04-11,I (22F) am worried about my relationship of 1 year and 10 months with my boyfriend (21) who is leaving for boot camp,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/22seks/i_22f_am_worried_about_my_relationship_of_1_year/,"So for the first year of dating, my boyfriend and I had next to no issues. We rarely fought and got along great. We met at a party and spent our first summer together going a little too crazy. But we chalk it up to immaturity and new excitement in our relationship and we have grown together since then. I have more dating and sexual experience than him seeing as I was his first girlfriend and first constant sexual partner. But it never really bothered me, I was attracted to his personality and sense of humor. We really clicked and seemed to understand each other in a way I've never felt with anybody else from early on.

By the end of our second summer together (9 months ago), he expressed a great interest in joining the military. I was of course fully supportive of him because of how respectful a decision like that is. I was also at the time thinking about joining the peace corps after college so we both shared these dreams of traveling and doing what we could in the world. We were excited for each other but of course wanted to stay together. 

Last August, I unfortunately made the biggest mistake of my life. I was 21 at the time and he was 20, so when I went out to bars with my friends and coworkers, he couldn't come. This raised suspicions and jealousy in him that I knew was understandable but I never thought would lead to be true. 

One night when hanging out with some coworkers of mine, I got way too drunk and was dancing with them in a sort of circle like friends do. I remember a coworker, who I knew kind of had a crush on me, coming up next to me. I was just dancing and laughing but I remember the look he gave me when he leaned in towards me.  I was stupid drunk so it is a blur but I remember that we kissed. I also remember feeling terrible about it and trying to leave the bar immediately. One of my girl friends followed me and offered to take me home since I couldn't drive. I was so upset and ashamed that I broke up with my boyfriend the next day saying that I didn't deserve him and coming clean with what I remembered. 

Needless to say he was crushed and lost all trust and respect for me. For a few weeks we didn't see each other but of course I tried to reach out to him since I loved him and really wanted another chance. I knew that I could prove I wasn't the bitch I had acted like, and it was going to start with me not getting that drunk because of how  much it inhibited my judgement. This was the first guy in my life who had fully respected me and loved me for exactly who I am and I go out and betray him. Not only had I betrayed my boyfriend but I had betrayed my best friend.

So after weeks of talking, we finally decided to get together for coffee and discuss things. He said that he still loved me but didn't feel the same way that he used to. But he was willing to try to build up trust again with me and to build us up to the strength we had in our relationship before I acted like a dumbass.

I was so grateful for the second chance he gave me and since then (about 7 and a half months), I have not taken it for granted. I never once texted or talked to my coworker except for essential things during work, and stopped going to bars without my boyfriend. I have tried my best to make him feel loved and special by doing all sorts of things for him. I take him places, take us to concerts, make him dinner, plan surprises etc. I also validate his feelings of betrayal and have tried to show him how ashamed and remorseful I am. It really changed the way I thought about myself. 

For a while things started to return to normal. He was busy training for the marines, I was busy with college and an internship. We were happy. Recently (about a month ago) we even talked more seriously about having a future together. He even switched from active duty to the reserves so that he would be away for about a year and a half instead of four or five so that we could be together and build a family one day.

However, just last week he called me while I was at school (I live at school during the week and kept my job an hour away by him on the weekends so we only see each other then). He told me that he had been thinking a lot and needed space. I was a little caught off guard since things had been going so well but I let him have it. He then called a few days ago and said that he had changed his mind back to being in active duty instead of the marines. I was so shocked but all I could say was that he needed to do what made him happy and that I would support him no matter what. But honestly I kind of felt like my emotions had been played with because I was really excited that he wanted to be in the reserves. Maybe it is for selfish reasons because I would only see him about 11 days a year if he was stationed somewhere else and that wasn't what I imagined my love life would be like. But he made it clear that he really just wants to travel and see the world which leaves me wondering where I would fit in. I have huge plans for myself too though. I now plan to attend grad school out of state and start building my dream career. But I can't help but feel like I care a little more about what is going to happen to us than he does.

Upon more discussion, he then confessed to me that it has been really hard for him to get over the fact that I kissed another guy while we were together. He even said that he feels like he still doesn't care as much as he used to and that he feels like I'm putting in a lot more effort than he is in our relationship. I asked if it had anything to do with his decision to switch back to active duty and he said no but I have a feeling it is. But literally in the same conversation he says he still loves me and wants to try to work it out. He just wants to know how he can get over it if none of my efforts are working 100%. So this left me with conflicted feelings of whether I should really be trying this hard for somebody who really still isn't sure about me and of what I could do to make his doubts go away. Just last night I traveled home to visit him during the school week to take him out to dinner. We had a great time and it was as if nothing was wrong. He just changes his mind a lot and I feel myself waking up and wondering if he is going to feel good about us or if he isn't. At the same time I feel like I deserve this indecision because of what happened. Even though we both decided to get back together and work things out, it keeps being brought up which makes me also feel like we can't get over it. When it happens I just let him vent and then try to make him feel better or prove my love and devotion to only him. But it seems like a never ending cycle which he says makes him feel like he doesn't have a lot of hope for our future.

I love this man more than I've ever loved anybody and I will work my ass off until the day I die proving it to him if I have to. I know that's a little dramatic. But I really don't want to lose him. This is all making me nervous too because his ship date is this August and I know things won't get better just because we have distance between us. We have all these plans for our last summer together before he goes away and then he brings up these feelings he's been having. I don't know what to do.

Sorry for all the text, if you read it all and have some advice to give me it would be greatly appreciated, thanks guys.

tl;dr; Boyfriend and I got back together after cheating, things got back to normal, he is leaving for marines soon and started having doubts about us.

Edit: The first night we met, he and I actually had a threesome with one of his childhood friends... I am also bisexual and he has seen me kiss 3 of my girl friends (with permission). We have also three way kissed with two of his guy friends. And once when we were in one of these guy friends' bed, he asked me to give him a blow job then give his friend a blow job too. We're kind of...unconventional. "

22sq5i,78,2014-04-11,The ham and the city.,hipstersonhipsters,fatpeoplestories,https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/22sq5i/the_ham_and_the_city/,"Typing this on my phone so I apologize for any mistakes! 

Loved that you guys appreciated my last story. I have a ton more from my fast food days from my Midwest days. In terms of my New York life after living here for going on 5 years now you meet a lot of different people. I have a group of friends from my undergrad days that I hang out with maybe once a month. They're the kind of people you hang out with if you want to have a ""sex and the city"" sort of night: expensive clothes, expensive restaurants with tiny little portions, champagne at the table, bottle service at clubs that Miley hangs out at. I'm not saying that these people are my close friends or people I'll have long term relationships with, but it's NYC! It's okay to have fun. 99% of the time I live extremely frugally cause poor. I save up money to go out with these people so this doesn't represent my daily life at all. 

Here are the players: 

&gt; be me: 5 foot flat, 120, I work at a bakery in bk, I intern at galleries, applying to grad school for curation, had an eating disorder when I was 16, still have a lot of food issues that I don't talk about.

&gt; don't be trustfundmoon: 5'11, 300 pounds at least, writer at a fairly popular magazine, VERY flamboyantly gay, trust fund baby, his Instagram ""about me"" was ""and on the 7th day God created Berkin"". He owns several. I go way back with him and I consider him a good friend because outside of his outrageous public persona he's a good person. His fat logic hurts me though. It's complicated. 

The setting: restaurant in Chelsea. We're getting dinner. 10 pm. 

&gt; trustfundmoon: blahblahblahshopping blahblahblahblahworkstuff

&gt; me: Blahblahblahpretendingtobeinterested 

&gt; trustfundmoon: okay so you're getting the chicken, I'm doing the duck, let's get an order of steak for the table?

&gt; me: oh I don't need it, it's a 30 dollar cut and I'm already ordering the cheapest thing off the menu. 

&gt; trustfundmoon: But it's so LUXURIOUS to order the steak for the table here. It's fine, I'm on a diet anyways.  

Note: he says that to me as he takes a bite of his Cobb salad in which he asked for extra ranch on the side in addition to the regular dressing. 

&gt; me: yeah? How's that going for you?

&gt; trustfundmoon: I'm basically anorexic at this point! Waiter? Yeah I want the duck and the order of the steak for the table and she need the chicken. 

Waiter walks away. I've known him for long enough to know that he goes on these ""diets"" every couple months. Every time he claims he's anorexic and every time it hurts me a little more. I had anorexia in high school and I've never been open with it even with my parents who were fairly unaware. I was a pretty fat kid/teenager so when I lost 50 pounds down to 89 pounds people just thought I was a success story. Being so small it didn't look terrible, I just looked petite. I put myself into recovery when I went to college and did it all by myself. Trustfundmoon on the other hand, doesn't have nor never has had anorexia. If you talk to him for long enough you'll actually find out he's a little delusional about how large he actually is. He probably thinks he weighs a decent 100 pounds less. On that duality, he thinks everyone is maybe 50 pounds heavier. 

&gt; me: why did you order the steak? I told you I didn't want it! 

&gt; trustfundmoon: I need the protein! This restaurant is amazing. Let's get another cocktail?

&gt; me: no I was just going to get a glass of wine. 

&gt; trustfundmoon: wine is SO high in calories!

&gt; me: why do you say that? I feel like it's just as bad as this ginger, champagne, orange thing?

&gt; trustfundmoon : well honey, you DONT need it. I switched to non fat milk at Starbucks, diet soda in my drinks, went to yoga and I deserve everything at this dinner. You on the other hand look more... Thick than usual, you go up to a 6 honey? 

&gt; me: how can you say that to me?

&gt; trustfundmoon: I can say that to you because even with my various conditions and the fact that I need to eat every two hours I manage to be perfectly healthy even though I'm bigger and I'm making an effort to get skinny. You on the other hand are probably just as heavy as myself and you've never made an effort.  

&gt; me: do you hear yourself? You cannot actually be serious. I wear a size 2. You've been wearing those designer sweatpants from Opening Ceremony for like literally 5 years now. Do you own anything other than like 7 pairs of 500 dollar sweatpants?!??

&gt; trustfundmoon : don't even dare talk to me like that when you're wearing Zara. You're trash and you know it. 

I immediately got up from the table and left. Apparently according to some random acquaintances that were at the restaurant he accepted all the food that he had ordered, in addition to my food, and ate most all of it, and left.

Their Perl web framework was incredible easy to get install, configure, code for, and execute. I haven't really done anything with Perl since my internship days back in 2003. I was very impressed with how easy and straightforward it was to get basic web serving, HTML templating, and database connectivity set up. Within only spending an hour or two a day, I had a functioning web app up and running in less than a week.

My only complaint so far is that some of the documentation and tutorials are lacking. I admit some fault in my lack of understanding since I did not read everything before I started hacking. My major hurdle occured when I did not realize that the Template::Simple module that Dancer enables by default did not support processing listrefs and hashrefs in the HTML template (you need to enable TemplateToolkit for that).

I plan to document my learnings and post in an appropriate manor. I've never written a POD or contributed to CPAN before, but now is a good time to learn.

I'd have to take a year off since the course is new and I'd be ahead by one year. Both programs share similar courses and I wouldn't want to take a year off. 

I was searching for internships at big retailers like Target, Walmart, and Loblaws. One of the requirements were that you need to have completed 3 years of school. I just finished my second year and would like to try to get an internship anymore to get relevant experience. Would the best be to just cold call as many places as i can, or should I go to their head office? I live near the financial area and most of the Canadian head offices are within 5 minutes of my house. 

I've been working at Walmart for over a year in reeving so I have gotten some relevant experience with their inventory management systems. It's mostly basic, but anything helps. I talked to our store manager, but he didn't know anything. He said he will talk to the HR department and get back to me.

I'm a rising senior studying advertising, and I've got two main internships I'm looking at. 
One is a big name NYC ad agency. Been around a long time and is close to the top. I'd be a creative in their internship program and would make $10/hr, with overtime, so around 400/450 a week. 
The other is a promising NY SaaS startup. They have some big name clients in tech and social media, and are offering 800/week, though hours maybe be closer to 50/60. I'd be doing advertising/web/graphic design for them. 
Here's what I'm dealing with. My uncle got me a contact at the ad gig, so I feel like I'm partially oblige to take that job. That being said, I think I'd get more out of a start up in terms of what I'm able to actually work on. Also, I'm studying abroad in London this fall, so I'll have the chance to get an internship there (and the agency has offices in the UK that I could potentially work at). Also, the agency name is more recognizable. Also, I'm looking to travel a lot while abroad and the extra money would definitely help with that. 

TL;DR: Deciding between at big name NYC ad agency that would look good on a resume, or a Quickly growing start up that might not look as good but would offer a better experience. 

Any and all thoughts are greatly appreciated. I'll try to answer any questions I can without giving away PII. Thanks in advance. "

[Do you think Devin and Toby have similar voices? I never knew you had two vocalists when I first discovered you guys! Their voices just compliment each other so well.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sybo/im_matt_carter_guitarist_producer_from_emery_and/cgq29ms?context=5)|NO, I don't think so at all, but its incredibly common to hear that. It tru of most bands with 2 main singers. Ozma is that way, and the Beatles too.  Devin's voice is a choir boy RnB thing and Toby's is like a old dad that can sing.
[1\) What is a band that you always wanted to tour with, and could never make it happen?  (and why couldn't you make it happen\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sybo/im_matt_carter_guitarist_producer_from_emery_and/cgq2wvp?context=5)|We wish we could tour with Jimmy Eat World.  Not sure why we haven't other than ya'll haven't bugged them enough on twitter telling them.
[2\) What is a band that you NEVER want to tour with again?  and why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sybo/im_matt_carter_guitarist_producer_from_emery_and/cgq2wvp?context=5)|And you never really regret touring with ppl because you usually cant help but like ppl once you get to know em.
[Woo! Thanks for doing this Matt. Let me first start off by saying I love Emery, and your music has gotten me through some tough times in my life. Second, the book ""Bad Christian, Great Savior"" is amazing. I downloaded in November, and I've read it 4 or 5 times since then. My question for is as a college student wanting to take a leadership role in a campus ministry, what are some good ways I connect and preach the gospel to those who are unreached?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sybo/im_matt_carter_guitarist_producer_from_emery_and/cgq2hkd?context=5)|EASY, I'd would focus on liking the people not converting them.  Spend a lot of time with people with NO AGENDA. If you don't even genuinley like them, they won't buy that God loves them.
[Who are some dream guests for the Bad Christian podcast?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sybo/im_matt_carter_guitarist_producer_from_emery_and/cgq2m3d?context=5)|I'd like to have on some comedians i think. They are the most honest interesting, and often depressing people. It's a wildly attractive quality to me.  I love Louis CK and Norm MacDonald.  I don't anticipate having them on however. HA!
[With being a band that's full of Christians and getting crap about your faith, how do you deal with releasing BC and the negativity that people throw at you? I've seen some of the forums/posts/comments and holy crap people are negative about this whole side of Emery. What keeps you going?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sybo/im_matt_carter_guitarist_producer_from_emery_and/cgq2gmm?context=5)|Well, the truth here is that the negativity almost works as good PR.  Also we are pretty brutal to each other and therefore not fragile. We are not very insecure, and more than anything we LIKE exposing how shitty people are. I think its GOOD to see Christian and non Christians true hearts of criticism exposed. We love that irony of someone being mean and sarcastic when telling you you need to understand the Bible better. 
[Hey Matt! I've always been so impressed with all the really cool ways you guys transition into different keys and time signatures and tempos in your songs. Creates such interesting variance in the tunes. When you're writing songs do you start with several different ideas and then try and fit them together? Or do you start with one idea and does everything come from that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sybo/im_matt_carter_guitarist_producer_from_emery_and/cgq2d7e?context=5)|Both, its very fun to try to fit 2 very different ideas together and then try to make them sound like they BELONG together, but sometimes you just think of some weird shit and it turns out cool.
[What would you say to the better business bureau in regards to the slave labor you've been exploiting at BADCHRISTIAN? This is Matt Burleson speaking.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sybo/im_matt_carter_guitarist_producer_from_emery_and/cgq37vt?context=5)|BadChristian is run by a bunch of exploited sucker volunteers and interns that work their asses off so that I can get rich.  Its working so far.
 |If interested in volunteering, please email, iwanttohelp@badchristian.com.
[I've seen Emery live a few times and despite every other band on the bills (including Anberlin, Hawthorne Heights and other bands of the same ""caliber""\) doing meet and greets or hanging out after the shows, Emery never did.  Do you intentionally not meet fans or did I just happen to see you on nights that you weren't able to make it out?  PS: The Question is a perfect album.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sybo/im_matt_carter_guitarist_producer_from_emery_and/cgq2lc0?context=5)|I really don't know.  I know we have done a million meet and greets and I know that tons of nights I have avoided fans entirely and just sat on our bus to drink beer and cut up with my friends.  
[How would you respond to someone who says that wearing the title ""bad christian"" is endorsing living in sin?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sybo/im_matt_carter_guitarist_producer_from_emery_and/cgq2bwv?context=5)|I guess i really don't care enough to correct them.  Since its not true, its kind of like someone telling you that you endorse communism. i'd just say, ""okaaay, coool"" 
[What, if anything, can you tell us about the new record? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sybo/im_matt_carter_guitarist_producer_from_emery_and/cgq2ttc?context=5)|The new album YWNA is gonna be aggressive.  thats the best word for it.
[Easy one here. Is there going to be a living room tour this spring or summer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sybo/im_matt_carter_guitarist_producer_from_emery_and/cgq2aud?context=5)|Our big plan is that we are gonna start in the fall, doing living room tours 1 week EVERY MONTH and doing the Podcast live at the show.  Still a lot to work out, but tht is the idea.  So yea, we are gonna go everywhere! 
[Hey Matt, what are you favorite Emery albums in order?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sybo/im_matt_carter_guitarist_producer_from_emery_and/cgq2dbx?context=5)|Ah, I have no clue, because honestly, I NEVER LISTEN TO 'EM.   They are for YOU not for ME.  I guess they are originally written for ourselves, but once they are done, thats pretty much it, the journey is over for me.  It's all about MAKING the records, not listening to them.
[How about a *The Weak's End* anniversary tour when that rolls around?  EDIT: meant to say *The Question*. I saw *The Weak's End* tour at The Shelter in Detroit and it was incredible!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sybo/im_matt_carter_guitarist_producer_from_emery_and/cgq2cc7?context=5)|YES we plan do something for the Question next, not necessarily front to back though.
[I'm not convinced that's a point in his favour so much as it's a point against you.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sybo/im_matt_carter_guitarist_producer_from_emery_and/cgq3tjo?context=5)|Yes, thats my point.
[*its too easy to criticize.*  No, its just harder to criticize stuff when you are compromised in the same way...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sybo/im_matt_carter_guitarist_producer_from_emery_and/cgq3ttq?context=5)|Ok, im not sure what we gain by criticizing, how about that?  my guess is that nothing good comes of it and we just feel better about ourselves, which is pretty pathetic.
[I know several of you guys are married, but a lot of recent songs still talk about the pain of broken relationships. How do the wives feel when you write passionate, descriptive songs about your relationships?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sybo/im_matt_carter_guitarist_producer_from_emery_and/cgq3fb9?context=5)|Oh, simple. They don't listen to our music! Problem solved.
[What is the best advice ever given to you? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sybo/im_matt_carter_guitarist_producer_from_emery_and/cgq2i2t?context=5)|Bros before hoes??
[How can I get my band on Bad Christian?  Are you guys making this into its own label or is it only for Emery? There's probably a lot more artists who would love to get involved.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sybo/im_matt_carter_guitarist_producer_from_emery_and/cgq33uk?context=5)|Become successful on your own, then perhaps we can help.
[Matt! Big fan of Emery and what you guys are doing at BC. I have two questions for you.   You are originally from SC, so I can only assume that you know about Carowinds. Which is where I happen to work. If I could hook you and Toby and Joey up with free tickets, would you come hang out and ride some rides?  Can I have the guitar tabs to In Shallow Seas We Sail, or could you make guitar/bass tabs a perk on the crowdfunding sight? Thanks for hanging out! P.S. Can you let Toby know I think his beard is magnificent?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sybo/im_matt_carter_guitarist_producer_from_emery_and/cgq2cpy?context=5)|Ha, toby and devin and i used to work as stagehands at carowinds. in 1999.
[What inspired you guys at BadChristian to make a transition from just musicians to musicians/evangelists/bloggers/authors?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sybo/im_matt_carter_guitarist_producer_from_emery_and/cgq2tdi?context=5)|Those are all things that we naturally do, its all just communication.  we like to communicate so we just figured we would put it all together.
[Matt, a few months ago, my brother was surprised to find that Emery had followed him on Twitter, since he doesn't rub shoulders with you guys. Is following complete strangers something you normally do?  Also, thanks for *We Do What We Want*. It's a powerful album.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sybo/im_matt_carter_guitarist_producer_from_emery_and/cgq33b6?context=5)|We try to follow people that we think already know and like us, like a tap on the shoulder. ""here we are""

22tcta,0,2014-04-11,Looking for advice/perspective regarding my summer internship options.,[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/22tcta/looking_for_adviceperspective_regarding_my_summer/,"Quick background: Mature student, leaving another profession, finishing 2nd year in Accounting Major BCom program, entering Coop program next year (so over the next 2.5 years I'll be getting 1 year work experience), but this summer I'm pursing an internship/summer job to get my feet wet. Zero practical experience so far, only academic.


I applied for a few jobs, and interviewed for two for the summer. One with the local branch of the tax authority, and one with the University that I attend. Not *overly* concerned either way, I still have my job in my old profession as a guaranteed fallback, but here's my situation:


I have been made a *conditional* job offer by the tax office, in the audit division. This seems like a good opportunity, and it is conditional on the results of my security screening. While I can not perceive the screening disqualifying me from working for the federal government, I am not 100% sure what their criteria are and there is a level of uncertainty that I don't like about the conditional nature of the offer. In some quick searches, I've seen posts in forums about rescinded internship job offers before. Sounds as though the security screening is an extremely long process, usually back-logged, won't have a definite answer too soon, and job doesn't start for another month.  I should be receiving my conditional offer letter late next week.

Other job I just interviewed for is with the local University. Job is assistant in finance administration, working for an accountant, helping close projects, and investigating non-zero balance budgets. While they have not yet offered me a job, it's seems like a reasonable possibility, and they said they'd be making their decision early next week. I believe I did really well in the interview, and I'm the type to second-guess most of what I do, so I felt pretty good about it.
 

Anyways, I'm looking for some perspective. Basically, I have the conditional offer coming at me AFTER I'd get an offer from the university, if the offer is made. Obviously if the school doesn't offer me the job, the default position is to take the conditional offer from the tax authority, but I was wondering what you guys would do if the school job was offered? I *feel* as though the audit internship may look better on a resume and provide a better starting off work experience, but I'm not yet an accountant, and don't really know. Pay differential is negligible, one pays slightly more, but I'd end up spending the extra on a transit pass anyways.

So from your points of view, what is the better opportunity? Which one would probably give me a better experience, and look better to a future employer? If you were offered the Financial Administrative Assistant job, would you take it over the conditional offer for Audit with the federal tax authority? My current mindset suggests that I should take a concrete offer from the school (if it's made), the uncertainty of the other offer is kind of unsettling. Thoughts?"
22tklv,9,2014-04-11,Advice for someone with impostor syndrome?,UselessCSMajor,AskComputerScience,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskComputerScience/comments/22tklv/advice_for_someone_with_impostor_syndrome/,"Hey everybody,

So I am a third year computer science major at a research institution. 

I am to the point in my college career where I NEED to get an internship or at least get involved with some sort of research in order to set up for my post-graduate career.

I have multiple friends who are getting summer internships and the like through connections they know: a family member who works somewhere, friends who started a company etc.

I have never had a job or an internship in the CS people (IT is the closest I have been to having a job similar to computer science.) 

I guess I am just asking, is there any way that I can have a better chance at landing an internship? I have almost completed 3/4 of my CS degree and I still feel like I don't know anything. My GPA has much to be desired at 3.0, so other people who don't have some sort of a familial connection to secure an internship like myself look better even without work experience since my GPA is less than stellar (which is completely my fault.)


I guess this is kind of a stupid question. If anybody has advice, that would be greatly appreciated. I am having trouble finding available internships/research opportunities at all and when I do, my GPA stands out in a bad way.

Thanks for your time.

Also sorry about the bad formatting. Not sure what I could do to make it better."
22tt7z,4,2014-04-11,Any advice would be great...,weeziikz,sysadmin,https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/22tt7z/any_advice_would_be_great/,"I just got my first job as a junior sysadmin for a small church with only 50 active users after doing a 6 month internship for a large IT company. I'm still fairly green and still in college to get my Network Engineering degree. Is there any advice you guys can give me to make sure I'm successful in my position? My boss is dedicating 4 months to training me to understand the specific site I work at, but I just want to make sure I get the best of it all.

Thanks everyone!"
22ty20,1,2014-04-11,I spent most of my life as an awkward tomboy. I really don't want to go through that shit again.,smootie,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/22ty20/i_spent_most_of_my_life_as_an_awkward_tomboy_i/,"Growing up, I was a tomboy, partly because I was into building tiger pits and watching WWF but partly because I didn't really know how to be feminine and didn't have the self-esteem to try.

Recebtly, I learned how to do my hair, put on makeup, and dress for my body type (thanks to many of the helpful subreddits here).  I finally became comfortable dressing like an adult woman, and just recently *finally* assembled a flattering wardrobe.

But then I landed a great library internship (yay!) that requires me to completely change the way I present myself.

I live in a tropical climate so it's hot as fuck and humid, too.  So my wardrobe is almost all tank tops (to keep cool), skinny jeans (to be modest while still rocking dat ass), and sandals.

It took me ages to figure all this shit out, to finally be confident in the way I looked.  And now I have to start *all over again*.

My library maintains a cold temperature to protect the collection so I have to dress for the cold, and we have to wear closed-toe shoes (for fear of falling tomes?).  I have no idea how to dress for that kind of climate while still looking stylish and being comfortable.

My coworkers don't wear makeup, polish their nails, or wear perfume. I like all of those things.  Everyone is much older than me and dresses very conservatively.  I want to fit in so I'm following their lead.  I just started and don't want to stand out in a bad way.

First world problems, I guess."

[One thing that worries me though: how do you raise children? Do they go to school? Would living in a way so at odds with the outside world create problems for them when they grow up? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sm0v/iama_21_year_old_woman_living_on_a_incomesharing/cgpzvtk?context=5)|A lot of them are home schooled and there is a daycare program for the younger kids. I am actually going to play theatre games with the kids there one day soon.  One of the greatest things I've heard about education over there is this game called Heroes. Its like trivial pursuit mixed in with Dungeons and Dragons. My friend does the DMing for it. Basically the kids get to decide what they want to do in this fantasy world and roll dices for it like in D and D but if their roll is too low they have the option to answer a trivia question to roll again and some parts the story in the game are educational.  For example, in one game the kids were studying the religions of the world and all of their characters had to answer questions about the religions from the counsel of the gods. All the ""leaders"" of the worlds religions were there jesus, buddha, shiva, etc. Once they answered all the questions the kids were granted access to the library of the gods and were asked to make their own religions just for fun. One of the values of their religion was ""always eat your breakfast""
[I work at an educational children's toystore and I love this idea! Thanks for sharing! ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sm0v/iama_21_year_old_woman_living_on_a_incomesharing/cgqe8di?context=5)|I'm so glad!
[Kinda sounds like a cult. Religious group? what's the deal? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sm0v/iama_21_year_old_woman_living_on_a_incomesharing/cgpzoos?context=5)|No. Not a cult because with a cult people would try to keep people here forever and try to get everyone to think the same. People leave whenever they want, sometimes we're sad because they are our friends, but we want people to do what they want.
 |We share everything, but there is a wide number of opinions, which can often make decision making difficult, but it is valuable to have so many different outlooks.
 |I'd say we share a lot of the same values as in egalitarianism, feminism, non-violence. We are just looking to be the example of what we would like to see in the world. We are very focused on face to face communication and conflict resolution. We also have no leaders and we emphasize personal responsibility. 
[Sounds like a town now.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sm0v/iama_21_year_old_woman_living_on_a_incomesharing/cgq083q?context=5)|Yea you could look at it that way, except we live kind of dorm style. 
[*same values as in egalitarianism, feminism.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sm0v/iama_21_year_old_woman_living_on_a_incomesharing/cgqfpy6?context=5)|I've gotten into this conversation many times on Reddit. I agree that feminism, mainstream feminism, like girls on tumblr and stuff, have a tendency to propagate a lot of female superiority and not a lot of equality. I suppose for what we do as a community is better defined as egalitarianism. I think what we mean when we say ""feminist"" is that we encourage females specifically to do work in area that are generally considered ""mens work"" if they are interested in it. i.e construction. I would say we also do this with men also. A lot of men cook and clean here. 
[I am confused, because as far as I have ever seen those two things are opposites. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sm0v/iama_21_year_old_woman_living_on_a_incomesharing/cgqfpy6?context=5)| 
[Are there rules to your anarchist commune? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sm0v/iama_21_year_old_woman_living_on_a_incomesharing/cgpzggg?context=5)|Anarchism to me means lacking oppression and no hierarchy. Not necessarily ""no rules"" thats silly little anarchist teenagers.
 |There are policies which are kind of like rules, but these are subject to change depending on where the community is at the time.
 |There are norms, which are more like common sense things.. like don't put knives or pointy things in the bucket we put all the other silverware in the dish room. You know so no one cuts themselves.
 |There are actually rules I guess, our values are egalitarianism, feminism and non-violence. Meaning you can't be physically violent with someone, if someone did this who had been living here long term this would mean a BUNCH of long meanings.
 |Also non-consensual touching is a big no no also. 
[Hierarchies always exist. Just maybe not the type that inconvenience you personally.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sm0v/iama_21_year_old_woman_living_on_a_incomesharing/cgqidls?context=5)|You are right there are always hierarchies. Like the fact that there are full members (people who've been members a year +), provisional members (under a year)associate members(intern more than once) interns (2-6 month stayers) and visitors (3 week visits applying for membership). Full members often have the most power.
 |The best is that no one is my boss and no one tells me what to do or benefits more than I do from our income. 
[*egalitarianism, feminism.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sm0v/iama_21_year_old_woman_living_on_a_incomesharing/cgqgv0w?context=5)|I do not agree with the mainstream version of feminism.
[These contradict.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sm0v/iama_21_year_old_woman_living_on_a_incomesharing/cgqgv0w?context=5)|Someone else said something similar to this.. please read that. 
[Feminism poisons everything.  It just an evil hate movement.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sm0v/iama_21_year_old_woman_living_on_a_incomesharing/cgr0v9o?context=5)|Hey so the other guys didn't call it evil so I am just going to personally respond to you.  I honestly sympathize with MRM. I am not a feminist, I have been a feminist in the past, but I would tend to not take on a label. I just think its a bit ridiculous that you would call an entire movement evil, movements are made up of people and chances are there are feminists out there whose beliefs you would agree with. There are plenty of feminists who actually don't give a fuck about mens rights issues and I personally thinks thats pretty gross, but there is a good percentage of feminists who think that MRM has got some good points.Specifically I am into the whole legal paternal surrender idea and I think there needs to be WAY more resources for men who are being abused or who have been abused.  I'm sure you can see that there are quite a few MRAs who actually straight up don't like women, thats why a lot of feminists hate MRM not because they don't agree with the specific issues, more because its sensationalist propaganda to say an entire belief system is wrong, because in belief systems there is a tendency for people to have a wide variety of beliefs. And because the feminism has actually opened up doors for women in ways that have not effected men negatively. There are certainly things certain groups of the feminist movement did that was not fair to men, but think of it as many different kinds of groups.

[Whats your day to day life like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sm0v/iama_21_year_old_woman_living_on_a_incomesharing/cgpzo3f?context=5)|I usually wake up whenever I want unless I have signed up to cook lunch which is served at noo or if I sign up to do a phone shift that starts at 9 am. People generally work whenever they want, but there are certain jobs people sign up for at our sunday meeting. That includes cooking shifts and customer service phone shifts for our business.  A lot of things count as work gardening, cleaning, work for the business.
 |So here is a typical day as in my day yesterday:  I woke up, helped my partner build a new computer for the office, he is teaching me about the parts of a computer, I'm kind of interested in programming, so this is helpful. Then I cooked dinner. I made Lasagna, three different kids due to the diets of people I live with. I made one with local ground beef, one vegetarian one with just cheese, and one vegan one with crumbled tofu instead of cheese. Then I smoked cigarettes in our only smoking allowed area with some people visiting from a friend community in another state. We talked for a bit, had some laughs, I shipped out some packs of seeds in my room while listening to music for a few hours. Then I wrote a little bit, I like to write fictional stories and plays, then I went to sleep. 
[What do you do when some new technology comes out (smart phones, game consoles, etc\) and not the entire community wants one? Is there some form of barter system to trade goods, or is everything shared freely? I can see necessities being shared freely, but not luxuries.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sm0v/iama_21_year_old_woman_living_on_a_incomesharing/cgpykni?context=5)|If someone wants to buy something that is kind of expensive to be shared by the community we bring it to one of our meetings. We make decisions using consensus. 
[It is disappointing that when people are given free choice, they don't all bang each other?  is this surprising?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sm0v/iama_21_year_old_woman_living_on_a_incomesharing/cgq9nvs?context=5)|Why isn't it exciting that people have the chance to figure out what feels good for them?
[Are all meals communal or only lunch and dinner? Do you get a consensus for the meals themselves, or does someone meal plan? What does the community do if someone/s isn't working hard enough? Are there elders? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sm0v/iama_21_year_old_woman_living_on_a_incomesharing/cgq2zn6?context=5)|On Sundays Brunch instead of Lunch.

 |Meals are decided by whoever signs up, but people complain if there isn't enough of a certain food group.
 |If someone isn't working hard enough it'll probably be brought up in a clearness and maybe asked to keep labor sheets.. sheets where they record their labor for the whole community to see.
 |Elders? I mean there are people over 50, but no one especially influential just because they are older.

I miss some of my old friends and I miss all the theatrical opportunities NY had. I was studying to be a musical theatre actress before I came here.
 |I do often get to meet strangers here though, a lot of guests and people interested in community come through. Its a bit like non-nomadic traveling. There are community theaters nearby and sometimes we have music performances at parties and events and stuff.

Most are in there 20s to early 30s, but there are people in their 40s, 50s, and 60s. I'd say most people who live here have lived here about 6 months- 3 years. There are a few people here who have been here for about 8 years.
 |I see myself being here for the next couple of years. I may go try and be an actress, but I would still maintain a status of ""friend of the community"" and I would probably come back at some point.
 |There is quite a bit of turn over. The people here are often the types who are not worried about money and trust they can figure out how to survive. A lot of people also go off to do more WOOF type deals. 
[WOOF?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sm0v/iama_21_year_old_woman_living_on_a_incomesharing/cgqlria?context=5)|Working on organic farm. Its a work trade thing.

Most of us have some alternative political views. Many people here would identify as anarchists. I probably would, but I do not like labels. A lot of people are also interested in growing most of our own food and participating in capitalism as little as possible. We have no bosses. We use consensus to make decisions, meaning no proposals get passed unless everyone consents to them.
 |There is a bigger commune in the area that is our sister commune. Some members from there decided to start the one I live on, they were not related but many of them had known each other for a while.
 |Right now there is a woman who has lived here for a couple of years and her daughter in her late 20's just moved here this year. There are a lot of couples, I don't know if you would consider that related. There was a couple of children here, but their families moved to different communes in the area.

Then the group gets together for a meeting and talks about their clearnesses and if any conflicts were unable to be resolved in personal clearnesses we talk about it as a group. If people get violent sometimes we'll give them another chance if they've been here a while with no incident, but generally we have a no tolerance policy and that person will be asked to leave pretty quickly.
[Are there any particularly influential people in the group?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sm0v/iama_21_year_old_woman_living_on_a_incomesharing/cgq30qd?context=5)|There are people who have been here a long time who have a lot of experience so sometimes they want to have more influence.

 |We did have one member for a while who was pretty harsh with people. We have something called an Associate Member, someone who doesn't live here full time, doesn't have an official room, but comes and stays anywhere from 2- 6 months a year, stays in various places, usually works very hard and well-loved. This nasty person had a clearness with a very well-loved Associate and kept repeating to them that they didn't really live here and that this wasn't there home.
 |He was eventually asked to leave, this usually happens if people repeatedly do not treat their fellow communards with some level of respect.

I was rejected from membership in short because I am obnoxious and promiscuous. Then the guy I was dating from the larger commune asked me to come visit again, just as his guest, but I thought visiting the smaller commune nearby might be more interesting. I didn't plan to stay, but after a week I liked acorn more than my relationship and i stayed as an intern for months before becoming a member,

There are no bosses but some people do take on responsibility for certain areas. For example, if the person who ordered food like beans and rice from our bulk order up and left with no notice it might not be very nice. It is nicer to acclimate someone on how much we usually consumes, what to buy, etc.
 |It can be hard because of money, but people do come and go a lot.   Some people are members, which means they gone through the whole process to live here long term, they usually stay longer.
 |Interns who just come for work exchange are usually coming and going a whole lot.  
[I guess it could be executed in a fascist way if there were enough pressure that if you vetoed anything you would, for instance, be completely shunned. Or if one person or ""faction"" bullies people into giving them what they want by pulling a ""Republican Congress"" and blocking anything but their own agenda. Still giving everyone a veto, I think, typically would encourage everyone to collaborate or compromise. In that kind of culture I don't expect you develop the adversarial mindset that leads to these types of problems.  I can see that this would need some adjustment to work for larger groups but I think it has good potential.  I do wonder, what happens if someone is unhappy and wants to leave the community? Can they ""cash out"" and leave with some possessions or do they need to start over from scratch?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22sm0v/iama_21_year_old_woman_living_on_a_incomesharing/cgqkc1y?context=5)|People can leave with their own personal possession and sometimes get a leaving loan.

Some people want to focus on continuing to grow the business, some people want to do more natural housing (like strawbale), some people want a dairy barn for our goats and one cow, etc.
 |I'd say an occasional member can get a little out of hand with discretionary spending. Nothing thats ever been too big a deal, at least in my time here.

I would like people to be encouraged to pursue their interests, whatever they are. People can learn so many things from about a variety of topics just by heavily studying one topic, doesn't really matter what. For example, i know a lot of interesting things about history through studying one of my passions, musicals. A lot of musicals are based on something historical, causing me to be interested in reading up on those specific events, therefore learning. Woah. Wall of text.

So, I turned 23 this year and it sucked. Every year since when I turned 20 has been getting consecutively worse. I did a couple 1-year long college programs to make myself employable and that's a bit better but I still don't feel very proud of myself. My parents are happy and they keep saying I should stick my nose to the grindstone and work like a slave for the next 5 years so I will be financially sound but  I want to do fun stuff too while I'm young. I've been busting my ass for the last 3 years with school and internships so my life has been very dull, I feel like I've wasted the last 3 years I have no good memories.


I was getting jealous of seeing all my friends on facebook affording vacations, and doing cool shit, and I avoided Facebook for over a year. I deactivated it while I was at school so I could concentrate on my classes.


I turned my facebook back on a few days ago because I'm done school and I'm working. It just reminded me of how unhappy I am and how much I miss my old friends but since I haven't kept in touch, they've moved on. I messaged a few of my closest friends and we talked a little and it was really nice but everyone is busy doing their own thing and I live alone in a new city.


I feel like I've accomplished nothing. I don't drink so I don't go to the bar to make friends, and I haven't been able to afford doing the activities I usually do (like skiing and hockey) so I haven't made new friends. I feel so alone and I'm really disappointed at how I've ended up at 23.


I have a really good summer job and it pays really well, so I'm hoping it will be enough to pay my debts and then maybe I can take next winter off so I can visit some old friends and so I can have fun again but I feel like I'm going to lose my marbles before that happens.


I wish I never turned off my facebook so my friends wouldn't think I deserted them. I wish I didn't live in this city but I'm stuck here until August. I wish I wasn't so upset at myself. 

I'm trying to keep busy, I'm trying to learn guitar, and I talk to my parents a lot, and I'm doing my best to eat well, sleep and exercise but I still feel down on myself.

Does anyone have any extra advice? 


---   
**tl;dr**: Feeling down after I turned off facebook and lost contact with a lot of friends while I was studying. I live in a boring city and I have to wait until the fall before I can do anything fun but I feel like I'm going to lose my mind before then after 3 years of nothingness I need some extra advice."

22u45m,2,2014-04-12,Please help me move on.,atsuatsu,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/22u45m/please_help_me_move_on/,"Reddit, I need your help. I'm stuck in a rut and just don't know how to move forward. I feel like I've been stuck in this position for a few years and I don't know what I'll do if I don't move forward soon. It's killing me inside - the frustration, the anger, and the sad desperation. If you'd like some back-story, please read on. Otherwise, please tell me - how do you get yourself out of a rut? I feel like I can't even separate the 'me' who knows I'm stuck and the 'me' who's making me stuck (if that makes sense). As a result, I'm quite anxious a lot of the time and fast running out of stamina. I don't know how long I can keep this up.

Back-story; Or 'Why I'm writing this now'

I don't really know where to begin and I'm not particularly articulate at the best of times so I apologise if this is a little incoherent. I just need to get the words down and then I'll summarise them in a more lucid tl;dr afterwards.

Let me begin by saying that I'm gay. It's been a long, very difficult journey to get to the point where I can say that. In fact, I'm 23 and only coming to grips with it now - this despite living in a part of the world (Australia) where homosexuality is not particularly stigmatized.

A couple of years ago (almost two), I dated a guy called Michael. He was my first 'boyfriend' and I really wanted things to work. At the time, I was living out of home, had plenty of privacy, and was excited to finally - finally - make use of the freedom I had moved out of home in order to obtain. I thought that maybe I would become more comfortable with myself, I guess, and vanquish the anxiety and intense self-loathing that pervaded my adolescence.

Well, perhaps I was expecting too much. I was needy and moody and not nearly as ready as I thought I was. The basic problem was that I found it impossible to expose myself emotionally . And I liked Michael - I liked him a hell of a lot.

We broke up after almost a year and I remember - quite vividly - the sudden and painful clarity with which I understood the nature of our relationship at the same moment that it ended. Of course he finds me overbearing, I thought, my god - how didn't I realise? And then something very strange happened - I fell in love with Michael. For the first time. I was experiencing love for him despite the fact that our relationship was over. The timing was awful. After a while, I kind of pushed it out of my mind. I dated a few other guys and, although nothing very meaningful came of it, I did enjoy myself a little.

We remained very close friends and had several conversations in which he emphasized his wish never to date again. I respected that. I should say that he's only just moved out of his very conservative home - a home that made it more or less impossible to be with men.

Fast forward to now. A lot has happened. I finished a degree that's practically worthless (I studied a language that I still can't really speak and it's not going to help me find a job). I move into the bottom of my grandmother's house to save money and... I've more or less failed to save any money at all. I've fought off depression, relapsed, recovered, relapsed, recovered... you know how it goes. At the moment I'm doing 'okay' - but 'okay' isn't particularly impressive. It's a mood in which I can get by but hardly a mood in which I'm 'flourishing'.

Today I found out that Michael, who just moved out, has started sleeping with other guys. I want to emphasise that I think this is great. I'm not angry that he's doing this and nor am I so hypocritical as to think that he shouldn't be. But when I found out - almost by accident - I realised that I still loved him.

""You still love him,"" said my brain. 
""Fuck. What the fuck.,"" I replied.

I immediately wanted to cry. How could I have suppressed that knowledge for so long? How did I ever become so good at lying to myself and *believing* the lies? Do I even have the fainted idea of who I am and what I want? Then the floodgates opened. How is it that Michael has moved out of home and finished his law degree and gotten an internship and started dating people and received a highly paid job while I basically haven't changed in two years. I'm not progressing. I'm not doing anything. I'm just treading water. All my wonderful friends (including Michael) - friends whose success I celebrate and don't resent at all - are doing terrific things. And I? I'm just... wasting away.

I'm sick of hating myself. I'm really sick of being in the same goddamn spot. I just want to feel like I have the ability to achieve things. As it is, I'm taking things day by day. I'm terrified that in a year's time I'll still be the same person instead of somebody new and interesting and excited to be alive.

This just isn't working for me. I feel like a failure. The worst thing is... I can't even cry about it. I'd appreciate your advice, kind people, I really would. 

tl;dr I feel like I haven't changed in any way for almost two years. I'm not doing anything with my life and sick of being stuck in a rut.

22uusu,88,2014-04-12,"UPDATE: Me [21 F] with my father [50s], where is the line when it comes to my education and life in general, and is he crossing it?",throwawaymyparents,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/22uusu/update_me_21_f_with_my_father_50s_where_is_the/,"[original](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/22lvy3/me_21_f_with_my_father_50s_where_is_the_line_when/)

So the good news is my professor instantly had a solution to my problem and let me do work for her side company, which is also great for my resume. It's one less thing I need to worry about, but I didn't update my dad about it because, good or bad news, it'll still encourage him to think he's entitled to these updates. Last time I spoke with him, I told him what he was doing wasn't helping and I won't be talking to him if he's going to talk to me that way, such as cursing at me, cursing my professor's name, making me sound stupid, etc. 

He's been pestering my grandmother and even had his wife call and text. She and I don't like each other admittedly since she was emotionally abusive while I lived with her and my dad [she was part of the threats to take away my school funding when they wanted me to stop talking to my boyfriend]. However, she seemed open to knowing what's going on between my dad and me. I told her:

&gt;I'll be proactive in finding a letter of recommendation and I scheduled a meeting with my professor. However, daddy was cursing at me and blowing things completely out of proportion and making this far more stressful than what I need right now. I have a lot on my plate which he witnessed yet he still acted completely inappropriate. He needs to calm down before I can allow him to be more involved. I cannot get everything done effectively if he constantly calls me and curses at me and threatens to contact my professor. Had I known he was going to behave this way, I would have kept the information to myself.

She told me she'd talk to him about his behavior and didn't fight me on this. I also spoke to our family therapist and she was in agreement that the cursing was inappropriate, the phone calls at night were inappropriate, getting my grandma involved in the middle of the night was inappropriate, and he's overstepping boundaries. She's going to reach out for a session with him and told me it was alright to continue to ignore him. 

My private therapist also thought the whole dynamic was toxic and I don't have to speak with him yet but I need to establish boundaries the same way I do it with my mother who is mentally disabled. She has Schizophrenia and at times uses me as a sort of emotional punching bag to relieve herself, so whenever I notice things are getting inappropriate I hang up or tell her I have to go and then I limit our calls to every two weeks. My father is not mentally disabled, that I know of, so I'm not sure how I can adjust this tactic with him. My mom's mind is so all over the place she doesn't even notice when I hang up half the time. My dad would take it more personally and think I'm being immature.

Meanwhile, I've been ignoring his phone calls all together and his messages say, ""Okay you can stop ignoring me now. What is going on with your internship? I NEED AN UPDATE."" He's completely oblivious to why I'm avoiding him and only cares about the damn internship updates. I don't want to give them to him anymore since clearly it's a reason for him to fight me if things don't go his way. I sent out all the forms I needed to send and that's that. He doesn't need every grueling detail. He used to ask me about every grade I got in college too to make sure I wasn't ""fucking things up."" I live four hours away yet I feel like he's down my neck.

He's still bothering my grandma and is acting completely oblivious. She was on my side at first but doesn't think I should continue ignoring him because my dad ""has an unhappy life"" and I'm the ""only joy in his life."" I told her:

&gt;If I'm the only joy then he should treat me like it. No one should talk to their grown daughter with foul language and harass them hours into the night when they were told to stop and no one should overstep their boundaries on issues that do not concern them. He went over the line and I'm not going to give him detailed internship updates if he's going to take anger out on me over something that frankly isn't a big deal. I got both of my letters of recommendation sent out no thanks to him. His emotional reaction made me distraught and only made a hard week harder on me. And his life is what he makes of it and he chooses to handle it the way he does. If he's so unhappy with his marriage, he can take advantage of his prenup or go back to marriage counseling.If he's not happy with his life, he has to do something about it; I have nothing to do with his unhappiness.

tl;dr: Still ignoring my dad. My family and personal therapists said I can continue to do so and think his behavior is bad. They want me to establish boundaries. I also told my stepmom about his behavior which she apparently will talk to him about. My dad is bugging my grandma still to the point where she's starting to have sympathy for him and thinks I need to stop ignoring him because his life sucks. Should I continue ignoring him?

22vb8l,2,2014-04-12,Moving home was the worst decision I've made in college.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/22vb8l/moving_home_was_the_worst_decision_ive_made_in/,"I moved home for my mandatory internship required by my school. The rules say that students aren't allowed to have jobs while interning, so I made the decision to go back and live with my parents since I couldn't pay rent at my apartment anymore without a job. 

At first it was nice, because my parents make dinner every day for ourselves and my younger brother, who is still in high school. I didn't have to worry about paying rent or utilities since my parents were awesome enough to welcome me back with open arms. It's kind of just like being in high school again, actually.

But a couple of weeks later the loneliness set in. While I moved home, my boyfriend stayed back at our school an hour and a half away so he could finish his studies, where he has still another year left to go. We only get to see each other on the weekends, where either I go to him in our college town or he comes home to his parents' place about 45 minutes away from me. We talk every day, but it isn't the same as when we could hang out after school and go grocery shopping or take naps together after long days. His parents are super strict, so we can only watch TV at his place or go out to hang out. At my house the rules are more lax.

On top of not being able to see my SO, all of my high school friends have moved away from this city, or I don't talk to them anymore. I hung out with a rough crowd to say the least and cut ties with many after graduation. I talk to maybe 3 people from my high school, and they have all moved away to their respective colleges. All my other friends are at school with my boyfriend, and when I come up to visit, I hardly have time to see anybody because I'm trying to catch up with my boyfriend. 

I am so lonely. There is nobody I know left in this town, and every day my routine is this: Wake up, go to work, come home, eat dinner with my family, and go to sleep. My little brother goes and hangs out with his friends and I have nobody to hang out with. I am the youngest person by far at my internship, as well as the only intern, and while I am very friendly with many people, the type of job I am working does not exactly allow for the employees to hang out with interns on their off times. It would be seen as highly inappropriate. Most are also men (90%) and married. 

Basically, I have cabin fever, and it's driving me wild. My loneliness is so bad that the idea of not being able to see my boyfriend for an hour on one day but for an entire day the next day still makes me burst into tears. I have nobody to talk to, so basically my parents have become my ""best friends"" whom I tell everything about my day, and while it was okay at first, by now my parents have begun to roll their eyes in annoyance. They don't care about my day anymore. 


I just feel really alone and I regret moving home to do this internship even if I love the job. The 8 hours of the day that I'm out of my house are the best hours of my day. After that, it's back to boredom and sadness. "

22vhyb,5,2014-04-12,Should I stay or should I go?,asidy,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/22vhyb/should_i_stay_or_should_i_go/,"Thank you sooo much in advance for any help. I have had much internal conflict and I obsessively think over this question since it came up about a month ago.

I am a sophomore in college. I am able to graduate at the end of next year if I beef up my schedule. I grew up poor and it would be cheaper for me to take another year of school instead of shoving all I need into one year.

Option 1:
Currently I am employed as a developer.  I have been employed here after I graduated HS. The work is not challenging. I will not like to work here after I graduate and definitely not any significant portion of my life. I have a job offer after graduating that is a security net, but I would not like to have to use this.

Option 2:
I have another offer for a job, paying 10% more. This job however will only employ me during the summer until I graduate. Upon graduation this job has a 10% higher base salary than what is offered by my current employer. Still, I would hopefully not have to be employed by either after graduation.


Question time. Based on that information, what would be your decision? I hope to work in Silicon Valley (for the area, as well as the high tech atmosphere) as a Software Engineer. I am experienced with Java , Sql, Ruby, PHP, Javascript (doing node atm), as well as messing around with NoSQL and API design. I have 2 years of experience.

By choosing option 1, my skill set will not be pushed very hard at work, but I will have 2 more years experience, as well as the money (that I am currently paying off school with ;). I can continue to do self study, but at a much slower pace than option 2. I will have to take 1 more year at school doing this. However, that will also be 1 more year experience as well as the income and financial stability that might help when going to california.

By choosing option 2, I will have a much better company name on my resume (although for only a summer internship) and I will be able to do much more self study in my spare time. I will also be able to beef up my course work and graduate within a year. However this option will be more expensive, and since I don't come from any money at all I will probably struggle financially getting on my feet in California.

What would be your personal choice? Using your knowledge of the labor market, is there even much hope of me getting a job at a high tech company? THANK YOU!"

[F, 22 and M, 22] 6 years",throwaway-whattodo,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/22vo29/i_feel_this_is_either_going_to_make_or_break_our/,"My SO and I have been together for 6 years, and we have been friends for even longer. We've never had any serious relationship issues or any major fights. I've been very happy with him for the last 6 years, and I know he feels the same. I cannot imagine my life without him. 


Two years ago, we sat down together and discussed our future of attending a university together that would be perfect for his major and my major. We decided that we should take the next step of our relationship by living together if we both got accepted to this university. Last year, we graduated from a community college together and decided we would take a year off from school before transferring to a 4 year university. Last year, we applied to our top university, as well as other universities for a backup. A couple months ago, he got accepted into his backup university. Both of us have not heard from our top choice university yet. A couple days ago, he told me that he feels his backup university may be a better choice than our original top university choice. 


When he told me, I felt my stomach and heart drop. I wanted to talk to him about it on the day he told me. However, I was too distraught to talk. Plus, he had to leave for his other responsibilities. I don't know why he changed his mind. I have not talked to him about my feelings about this yet. We will be talking about this soon. I am absolutely, utterly terrified of what may happen. I am terrified that we will end up having to live in separate locations, and that we may break up in the process. I've had LDR relationships before. Those relationships always failed due to ""falling out of love"" due to the time apart. 


My top university choice is a hour drive away from the university he wants to attend. Realistically, we COULD live somewhere in the middle of the two universities and commute 30-50 minutes to school daily, depending on traffic. I am not even sure if this will work out due to the amount of gasoline and costs for wear and tear on our cars. My car is old and is constantly breaking down. I spend so much money to keep it running. I do not even know if my car can survive that kind of a commute daily. We do not know where we'll end up working. We do not know what our school and work schedules will be like. This will be our first time living away from home. This will be our first time having to pay for rent. I am not sure what our monthly budget will be and if we can even afford that kind of driving time. Sure, it would be easy to get a new car with better gas mileage, but I do not have anyone to co-sign for me, nor do I have enough money saved up for a down payment. 


If his university choice has my major available, I would attend that particular university with him without a problem. However, it does not, which is where this problem arises. There are only a couple schools in my state that I can attend for my major. He can attend almost any school he wants in our home state because he has a popular major. I would never force him to attend a school he wasn't comfortable with. But, I would be lying if I said I'm okay with this situation. I'm not okay with it. I honestly thought he wanted to attend the same school as me due to the great program it has available for his major. He was excited about the possibility of us attending the same university together. I'm not sure what happened. 


I may be making a bigger deal out of this than it really is. But, I do not deal with change well. I don't handle the unexpected situations well. I am trying to look at the bright side: it is only a hour distance between the two schools. I have family that lives a hour away from my dream school. I could live with them as a backup.


I still haven't heard from the university I want to attend yet. I am not sure what will even happen if I don't get in that university. Should I stay home and do a LDR for a semester or two? Should I move with him and work/do internships until I am able to attend school? Reddit, please help me see clearly about this situation. I do not have any questions in particular, but I would love your insight. I realize this post is probably all over the place. Bear with me, because I have not been thinking straight for the last few days.

I was lucky enough to snag an internship with a wine exporter in Buenos Aires right after graduating college. We had a small tasting room where visitors would come and taste our selection of Argentinean wine, mainly from Mendoza and Salta. Every once in a while, our tasting room sommelier would be unavailable and I was called in to run the wine tastings. I memorized the script and could talk the talk regarding tannins, terroir and tasting notes, but I hadn't had enough exposure in my undergrad days to any kind of decent wine beyond the boxed sort.

This one dreary Tuesday in our tasting room, I was conducting a private tasting with a husband and wife collector and we made it to our Malbec Gran Reserva. I poured myself a taste to enjoy with the duo, and had a zinger moment of true love and appreciation for what I was experiencing. The aromas of tobacco and leather were intense, and I could finally distinguish them from just wine smell. The mouth was bold - ripe fruit with an incredibly long finish. The husband, wife and I grinned at the same time out of love for this wine.

I sold six cases that night from various fincas and left that night not only ecstatic for my commission, but with a fascination and desire to learn more, taste more and dive further into the wine world. I was 22 years old. The wine was Carinae Malbec Gran Reserva 2008."

22weva,92,2014-04-12,Landed a job because of reddit! Keepin' the hope alive.,lager_half_full,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/22weva/landed_a_job_because_of_reddit_keepin_the_hope/,"My journey through unemployment was nothing out of the norm, I think most in the trenches alongside me could relate. I went to a good uni, graduated with a sensible major (A foolhardy STEM boy with med school aspirations), dropped out of med school-- *Enter black hole of unemployment. 

Shit took me two years to rebound. I went through all the cycles. The ~~ups~~ downs and downs, since I never felt the ups until I actually received an offer. Tons of resumes sent via courier pigeon and it felt like most of my flock migrated south for vacay, never to be heard from again. In the meantime, a couple handfuls of hiring managers, interns, sketchy old men (be careful with craigslist!), and well-intentioned alumnus took turns wasting my time at interviews, informational sessions, and so forth. The worst feeling, though, was mustering up the courage to roll up out of bed, reading a rejection email at whatever stage of the interview process I was at, and rolling back into bed, except this time in a fetal position resembling a post-food poisoning bout.   

I probably lost a lot of friends during this time. I just couldn't stand the ignorance. My dad, surprisingly so, knew what I was feeling inside. But my well-connected friends just made me feel alienated and frustrated that they couldn't empathize with their friend who didn't have a friend-of-a-family-friend that worked for JP Morgan or a father who could shell out monthly rent stipends in exchange for daily phone calls to the madre to keep the peace at home. 

Then the sun came out, and a reddit user delivered on his word. That's more than I can say about my friends, family, and university professors/advisors. They meant well, I'm sure, but words don't hold as much weight as actions. Your friendly redditor told me about job openings with his company and gave me constructive feedback on my cover letter and resume. I sent in my first application and thought I might actually luck out and finally get to ring the New Year on a positive note. My application was well-received and I had an interview lined up late November.

After one Skype interview I was rejected. I crawled back into bed and figured I'd wait until 2015 before propping myself out of bed again. God it was an awful feeling. Applying through online portals seemed like a distant last-ditch resort to try again with the job market. I knew I would need some sort of employee referral to make it that far again, just to get an interview! One thing was for sure, I wasn't going to take steps backwards and beg for another unpaid internship (I did two and I felt like not only my wallet was getting lighter from the costly commute, but my dignity was dangling like a bludgeoned piñata). I thought about volunteering.... 

I checked the company our fellow redditor worked at once more and another position popped up. I said to myself, ""I'll apply one more time, but that's it.""  I lathered, washed, and rinsed, just like last time. And a month later, I received an offer. :) 

The day I received my offer, I had a Skype interview lined up (I received the offer seconds before my interview) with a big pharmaceutical company. I was interviewed by two young associates, one had just been with the company for five months, the other was a college student intern. Apparently the company has a high turnover rate. Surprise, surprise. I didn't get the job. The interview q's kept digging at my flaws. They really wanted to know why they shouldn't hire me (They asked me what my biggest flaws were twice, and they had followup q's about those flaws... each time!). When they asked me what I tend to look for in a supervisor, my dad said I should have quipped: ""Big Tits."" 

I guess honesty is my biggest flaw. 

Why am I writing this? I guess I felt my story was like many of the other stories I've read which made me feel happy for complete strangers and inspired me to keep my head up.... off the pillow. So my advice for anyone looking for a job is plain and simple, nothing you don't already know, although a little reminder every once in a while doesn't hurt: Don't give up and don't be afraid to be honest with yourself. I can't stress this enough: being a realist does not make you a cynic or pessimist (disclaimer: I'm a big George Carlin fan).  Also, find out if you can get dual citizenship through your parents/ancestry. I was amazed at how many doors this opened. It opened only one, but still. One is all it took. 

Now I'm moving to a new country, doing a job that calls on my strengths that actually makes my diploma seem more than just a haughty wall ornament, and I get to work with great people. Who cares that I have no money, haven't found a place to live abroad yet, and don't speak the native language ;) I'm just happy I feel like my life is no longer like a plane just waiting for the go-ahead to lift off from the tarmac. I take-off in the next couple weeks, and I have no idea what's next. But, man, what a trip it's been so far. 

And yes, I plan to return the favor as soon as I've kicked some ace at the company.

22wkbw,3,2014-04-13,Cornell vs Georgetown,femme_kitten,lawschooladmissions,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawschooladmissions/comments/22wkbw/cornell_vs_georgetown/,"I have been accepted to Cornell but still have not heard from Georgetown.  But I interviewed with a Georgetown alumni representative on March 31st - so almost two weeks ago - and it went VERY well. I plan to put a deposit down on Cornell (deadline is the 25th) if I don't hear from Georgetown in time (or if I don't get in).  

I am really hoping to get into Georgeotwn because I think I will have better internship options and also will enjoy living there more than I would Ithaca (I'm a city girl).  Also I'm queer and the gay scene in Ithaca is not comparable to what I'm used to (in San Francisco).  Also the weather in Ithaca could be too harsh for me.  Basically I really hope Georgetown accepts me.  I visited DC and their campus last week and it just felt RIGHT.  I can really picture myself living there.  I visited Ithaca too, and was very impressed by Cornell Law - but I couldn't see myself there.  If Georgetown rejects me, however, I won't have any other desirable options (I am waitlisted at UVA, Columbia, and UCLA.  Also accepted at USC - but I don't want to stay in CA)


What are your thoughts on Georgetown and Cornell?  

Also - is it weird that I haven't heard from Georgetown yet? "

Perhaps, it was due to some high fever i had? or because my mom was really sick while she was pregnant. Or because of the meds she was on during pregnancy for her sickness?  Normally, I converse verbally. So, people didn't realize that I am deaf until they see my hearing aids.
[ beside most of then are extremly loud, do you know or even care when you are loud without realising it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22w22o/i_am_that_deaf_guy_with_bulky_alarm_clock_on_my/cgr5xqe?context=5)|Yes, i can be loud without realizing so that's why when I talk I make sure I am talking normally and with articulations at normal speed.

[I know you consider yourself deaf, but have you ever looked at it being hearing impaired or hard of hearing? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22w22o/i_am_that_deaf_guy_with_bulky_alarm_clock_on_my/cgrt9f4?context=5)|Yea i am hearing impaired but legally classified as deaf.
 |I thought deaf is just an interchangeable word.
[I went to a married couple's apartment this winter on a call. Husband was ill and had abdominal pain with vomiting for the past few hours so he called 911. We got to the door, knocked, and said ""EMS!"" like usual. No answer. Knock again. No answer. One of the neighbors came outside and told us we needed to press a special doorbell button that flashed the lights in the apartment because both the husband and wife are deaf. After the wife let us in I was thinking ""great, now I have to communicate solely via handwriting with this dude at 5am."" Wrong. After a couple minutes of hand waving and confusion, wife brings my partner and I to the room with the big TV and there's a woman on the TV speaking live both to my partner and I through the phone with her headset and with the pt's wife though sign language with a webcam in the patient's apartment. It was absolutely amazing. I would ask a question to the special services person, she would sign the question to the pt's wife, who would sign the question to her husband, who would sign the answer back to the wife, who would sign it back to the woman on the TV, who translated it via webcam to me on the phone! Probably the coolest use of technology for disabled people I've ever seen.  How common is this? Does every deaf person have this service in case of emergency? Even if you live with other people who have hearing, I feel like it would still be a good idea to have it in case something ever went wrong when you were alone. Also, are there similar services for deaf people for other types of emergencies? I mean, I'm assuming that if there's a fire or police is needed, they could use that system as well, but what about mundane day to day stuff---how much is this system integrated into deaf peoples' lives?  Also, what's medical school like deaf? I get that you have hearing aids and can lip read, but what about taking Hx's and doing PA's? Can you speak well and communicate with your patients and coworkers effectively? How does this affect you in the specialty you've recently matched into?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22w22o/i_am_that_deaf_guy_with_bulky_alarm_clock_on_my/cgr6ojc?context=5)|The technology they are using with the webcam and all is call Video Relay Service (VRS). They help communicate between deaf and hearing person.  Even I used a similar service called IP-Relay. It's not video but it's more of a instant messenger service where I use it to make phone calls. The relay service person talks to the phone and types it back to me and I respond back in text and then she relay the message verbally.  I don't use that anymore. It has its flaw because the hearing person would think it was a sales person on the phone. Pissed me off major time! I always have to instruct the relay person to not answer the phone with a question (it's different story and i'm getting offtopic)  but yes I am aware such technology exist. I have seen deaf people use it to communicate with other deaf people using this VRS.  I live with a hearing people. I have pretty good handle of how to listen on phone. In case of emergency, i have a backup plan. I would just call 911 and tell the person that i am deaf and this is my address. I would just text my immediate friend or family about the emergency.  I wish i could use the IP-relay services but man it's such a fuck up flawed system though. I wish there was something else better way to make business phone calls.  Medical school was hard and is still hard for me! I had to have note-takers, asked my study group for copy of notes, visit professors' office hours whenever possible to ask questions, clarify notes with professors, and practice clinical routines with friends and partners.  when i started rotations, i made sure i communicate with the people responsible and the attendings, residents and other clinical interns. I told them that i don't want to make things tough for them and i wanna be a team player. I was upfront with what i want and what i expect. My professors were able to help me make phone calls to some of the docs that they know at some teaching hospitals and made sure i was on track with what i was suppose to do.
 |Taking Hx's and doing PA's was a challenge in the beginning but i found my rhythm. My colleagues knows me and see the effort that I am putting into so they are more inclined to help me make things easier by telling me other ways to manage and giving me stuff that are ""in the know"". Because not everything is textbook. you kind of pick it up as you go along such as routines and Hx.  you have no idea how much respect they have for others in the professions. It may seems like cut-throat competitions but in the end, everyone is looking out for each other.
[Besides the hearing aids and wrist alarm clock, do you have any other specialized gadgets that help you out on a daily basis?   ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22w22o/i_am_that_deaf_guy_with_bulky_alarm_clock_on_my/cgqxu81?context=5)|Nope. that's all i've got. There's one thing I dreaded very much. That is Making phone calls or accepting phone calls.
 |I've gotten over it. You'll be amazed how helpful people can be if you ask them if they can help with you with phone because you are deaf/hard-of-hearing.
 |Nowadays, I don't have issues asking people for help if I need to answer/make an important call.
 |Edit: forget to mention that I have an electronic stethoscope with a headphone!

[Why is the deaf community so against cochlear implants? Why wouldnt they support something that makes their life easier and puts them on an even playing field?  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22w22o/i_am_that_deaf_guy_with_bulky_alarm_clock_on_my/cgqyfq7?context=5)|It's a pride thing! They like their ""deaf"" status. I don't know what's their problems are. I'd trade anything for normal hearing without CI or hearing aids.
 |I have no regrets, though.
 |I didn't like the deaf community either. They get all pissy when they learn that I don't know sign language. Not my fault. 
[Just cant wrap my mind around someone choosing to do without one of their senses.  Nothing wrong with being deaf, but if you had the option to not be then why not? I guess its one of those things you can't relate to unless you experience it though.  ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22w22o/i_am_that_deaf_guy_with_bulky_alarm_clock_on_my/cgqz2tk?context=5)|I agree! It'll be nice to talk on phone and learn to pick up the lyrics of song through listening. I always have to learn by reading the lyrics while listening.
 |Sometime, songs are too fast to keep up. Being deaf, it's hard to follow things like that even in big group conversations or during lectures.
 |I've always choose to listen and not participate.
 |But ya, if I had been given a chance to have no disability, I'd take it!
[Yeah i live in an area with a deaf school and my wife knows how to sign. She told me about the issue with CI and i couldnt understand it. Glad i got to talk to someone who can shed some light. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22w22o/i_am_that_deaf_guy_with_bulky_alarm_clock_on_my/cgqzv14?context=5)|I don't have CI but i wouldn't want them right now. When i was a baby my parents had the option to choose CI or hearing aids. I am glad they chose hearing aids because CI that time was in its infancy. CI was a new thing. There was lot of risks involved. I am sure now the risk are small but it would require lot of re-learning and re-training because the sounds you are used to are totally different.
[I can totally relate to that about song lyrics. I only have moderate hearing loss but I still have problems hearing the lyrics in songs. Saying that though, it can have its advantages as it turns the vocals in songs into their own ""instruments"" as I can't really hear what is being said, only really the tone. It definitely makes for some interesting listening! Do you experience this? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22w22o/i_am_that_deaf_guy_with_bulky_alarm_clock_on_my/cgr87rp?context=5)|Yep! totally can relate to that.

[I'm very late to the party but hopefully you'll still answer this question I thought of when I saw the original photo. For people who can hear, sometimes sounds can seem to get incorporated into our dreams. For example, one might hear the beeping of an alarm clock going off in real life but in their dream the beeping noise is coming from a garbage truck that beeps when it backs up to warn people. Have you ever experienced something similar with the vibration from your watch alarm?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22w22o/i_am_that_deaf_guy_with_bulky_alarm_clock_on_my/cgr6uwj?context=5)|Haha ya!
 |In fact, i woke up before my alarm goes off thinking why is it not vibrating?!
 |I've had few dreams similar to what you mentioned. in fact, i remembered this clearly because it had happened last night. I got tazed in my arm by a passerby when i was just walking around in some sidewalk. As soon as I got tazed, i woke up to my alarm vibrating on my wrist.
 |Wtf man!
[Do you know any ASL or do you lip read or can you hear well enough with a cochlear or hearing aids?

What is your opinion?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22w22o/i_am_that_deaf_guy_with_bulky_alarm_clock_on_my/cgqzx5n?context=5)|Well, I lip read because I'm used to it. I do listen with my hearing aids. It's like assistive device like glasses.
 |I've never used sign language as a method to help me learn how to speak or learn english during my developing years. I was trained by a private speech pathologist/therapist for 12 years.
 |I stand on the fact that I would encourage deaf people to actually learn to talk without speech impediment because it is a great way to communicate with people. If sign language help them learn to speak orally, then ok! It shouldn't be that their preferred method of communication should be sign language.
 |No one in the whole world knows sign language. Sign Language is an acquired language like spanish. You can't expect to go to other country and expect them to know Spanish. English is the most universal language and everyone knows them verbally.
 |That's what i really advocate.

22x099,17,2014-04-13,My boss at my paid internship has made it clear she wants to hire me upon graduation... how do I negotiate my salary?,MyCScareerThrowaway,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/22x099/my_boss_at_my_paid_internship_has_made_it_clear/,"Here's my [previous post](http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1pxp0s/got_interviewed_and_offered_my_first_internship/) from 5 months ago.  

I'm 30ish, and after losing my sales job in the recession I went back to community college for an Associate's in programming (I already have a B.S. in something unrelated) where I have been a 4.0 student.  I have fallen in love with programming.  I will complete my internship and earn my Associate's next month.

In order to graduate, I needed an internship, and only one company gave me chance... a company that specializes in IBM products, and I have been coding in various flavors of RPG since (see my previous post).

They have made it abundantly clear that they would like me to stay on with them after graduation.

Right now they are only paying me $10 an hour.

We are a small company of less than 20 people, some do sales and general IT stuff, but only around 5 of us actually code (most of the people there are on the verge of retirement or are already semi-retired, and they're just riding the wave). 

Anyway, to wrap this up...

It's not like there are a thousand places looking for RPG programmers, especially in the city where I live.  I would say Java is my best modern language... but I only have a piddly-dick Associate's degree.  Is it possible to find a gig with just an Associate's, in a town of only about a million people?  

I know I need to make a ""resume website"" and all that before I start job hunting, but I really just haven't had time the last 6 months because I've been taking 18 credit hours and working two jobs.

Thanks everyone for reading this wall of text... sorry it's so long, I'm just still starting out in my career.  I really appreciate it.

**TL;DR** -- I learned RPG from scratch as a paid intern making 10 bucks an hour, now they want to hire me full time when I graduate next month with an Assocaite's.  How much should I expect to get offered?  Is it okay for me to say I expect more if they low ball me?  I have no idea how to negotiate.

E:  I have discovered the guide to negotiation in the FAQ and am currently reading it.  However, I would still be overly appreciative for any advice above and beyond this guide as it relates to my particular situation.  "
22x7tg,1,2014-04-13,"I [27 M] let my girlfriend go [25 F]. Lost myself, lost my girl. Realized it was my biggest mistake. Need help winning her back.",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/22x7tg/i_27_m_let_my_girlfriend_go_25_f_lost_myself_lost/,"So basically I need help getting my girl back, and feel like beeing really creative so as she has no other option than to fall into my arms. Call it romantic or selfish or whatevver. 

First off all, my english is not that good, apologize in advance. 

So, here's the story. 
We've been together for about 5 years when we ended it. We had kind of drifted away for some time when we went different directions. It all startet about a year ago, when I got my first job in a new city, away from our home town. At the time it was no biggy. She was going abroad for some time, and we somehow made it work. I came over to her and she came to visit me. But after 6 months she ended her internship abroad and came to stay with me for the summer (before going back to our home town, to finish her last year of her masters degree). 
The summer was really something. It seemed no matter how hard we tried, we only drifted apart. I had kind of found a life, with new job and new friends. And when she came back, everything just became a hassle. I think she wanted to have me to herself for some time, which is reasonable, I just could not see it. Instead I was a bit more independet, wanting a lot more people around me. No matter what or why, we ended up fighting much that summer. It was like a wound that never healed. And when the fall came she moved back to our home town, and the gap grew bigger. I feelt more need for space and she only wanted me closer. In the process I lost myself a bit, a kind of midlife crisis. I didnt know what I wanted with anything anymore, and started excluding people from my life, alt the time trying new things and chasing a dream that was not there. I got really obsessed with finding myself, ""there's got to be something out there for me in life, what am I suppose to do??"".
So when christmas came, she said she could not wait anymore. Either she had to try us with a fresh start or we had to break it off. 
I was a really messy christmas. We met a couple days in a row, and cried, and I had such a hard time. But at the I didnt know anything, I was so confused and had really lost myself. I told her i still wanted to be by myself, and thats when we went different ways. 

Now, 3 months has passed. What have I been doing? I have read a lot of books, trying to find out what i want with myself in life.  Self development, and chasing my dreams. I have learned that I have to have something In my life that brings me up early in the morning and keeps me late in the evening. 
Have i found myself? Maybe not fully. But I have realized that part of my dream is having somebody to share them with, and without havving people I care about around me, life is nothing. I need her back! 

So 3-4 weeks ago, I called her, and booked a ticket back home, to tell her how much I miss her. I poured my heart out, I told her everything I know about us, and tried bringing out every good memory.    It ended bad.
She told me she was not ready yet, and didnt want to give me any hopes as she doesnt know how she will feel about us in the future. She has about a month left before her master's is due, so she's working a lot with that at the moment. Do not want any distractions, and is happy beeing by herself and only thinkin about herself after beeing with me for 5 years. 

Now what do I do? I know I dont want to disrupt her masters, but I go to work every day like a mess. I think about her all the time, and have realized she is the one. There is no other, and I want to spend the rest of my life making her as happy as I can. My job doesn't mean anything anymore. I loved working out and eating healty. But lately I have lost 5 kilos and eat whatevver. My hobbies are no more. 
I realize I have to be happy by myself, for us to be happy together, but thinking about me throwing away the best thing in my life really messes me up. I need her back. And if I can't I have her, I have to rethink me life. Start over somewhere new. Sell my apartement and live as if she does not exist anymore, because this can not go on anymore. But anyway, I ow it to myself to give it one more try. 

So reddit, if there is anything good in here, could u please help me knock the socks of her feet. Help me telling her I love her and miss her In a way that does not drive her away. I need to be creative.

Relevant information: 
 For the last 2 weeks we have been e-mailing (not much), where I tried telling her how I feel (she asked). Last night i got a respond, and think she got a bit paralized of everything I said (what she means to me and whatnot). She responded quite shortly, telling me she didn't know what to say, and asked if I was in town for a meet up. Poked at it a bit more, and said that I was not in town, but could come if she wanted me to. She responded with, something like"" It would have been nice to see each other, without it meaning something"". 
I found it a bit strange, since I in the mail before litterally told her I would ride a horse to Mogolia and back again, for her. So I do not know what she means with it? Anyways, we might hook up tomorrow. And I might be able to meet her and tell her something. But im uncertain if I should wait and knock her socks of some other time. I somehow want it to be tomorrow. 

This somehow turned out to be a diary or a blog or something.
If anybody has something useful to say, then thank you.

When I enrolled as a Freshman, I had no idea that I would later leave the Church.  I came to BYU expecting a happy, mormon existence, but found myself depressed and completely unmotivated. Last summer, between my Freshman and Sophomore year I started having doubts, but it wasn't until early this semester I realized that I really didn't believe in the church, and that I cannot, for the sake of my mental health and staying true to myself, continue to take part in TSCC and BYU. So I've been preparing myself to transfer to the U of U, I just haven't decided when. 

Originally I was going to stay for fall semester so that I would spend winter abroad on an internship for my major, and I've made some arrangements for living situation in the fall (I have a contract, but haven't turned it in yet).  However recently my professor mentioned that the internship might not be feasible, and so now I am trying to figure out if it is worth it to stay for another year or not. I already did the same internship last summer, so I'm not sure that it would even be worth it to stay for that. So the question is whether I transfer to the U for this owing fall semester or wait until next year.

Ex-mormon redditors, have any of you been in a similar position? realizing you no longer believe in the TSCC while at BYU? How did you deal with it? People that transferred to the U after attending BYU, what was the change like?

Also, when I transfer to the U, I plan on cutting myself off from the church completely, but how do I break it to my mom and her side of the family? (They are all super conservative TBMs, my dad's side are all ex-mos though).

22xd9s,0,2014-04-13,I [19 F] am unsure of my own rights because of my Mother's [50 F] pressure of her religious beliefs,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/22xd9s/i_19_f_am_unsure_of_my_own_rights_because_of_my/,"I am currently feeling pain and frustration from my Mother because of how much she wants me to attend church. Until my senior year of high school, I was a practicing Catholic. I lost my enjoyment around middle school since I never felt at peace with myself. I always thought prayer and having faith would bring you peace and give you a healthy conscience. Instead, I always felt guilt-ridden and shameful of myself. 


 I always felt like my mother used religion to make me feel below her and that I was troubled. I have always been good at school and participated in extracurriculars. People usually say I'm extremely quiet so I wouldn't say I'm a rude person. After I was done with high school and attend college, I thought I might have a little more freedom. I don't remember how but I was able to stop going to church for a long while (I remember hiding in my room with her banging the door and finally giving up).


I still live with my mom, and she has become a lot more judgmental about me, telling me how I've become useless and have done nothing with my life (I go to college, have a part time job, and have been accepted for a paid summer internship). She has always been like this though, her reasons are because I gained weight, and do not help the family out by taking care of the house (I'm always at school, or my two jobs).


She has these outbursts about how I'm not ""well-rounded"" and I need to go to church to better myself. She talks about how my siblings are so much better and mentally healthier because they go to church. They also yell at me about how ""useless"" I am but they have also skipped out of church a bunch; I am the youngest sibling so maybe that's why. They started going back all of a sudden, so my mother has a lot more reason now (I don't think because of me though). 


 I have talked to other relatives but they all feel that I must attend church with my mom until I move out. Because of the amount of money and time I'm putting into school, I don't expect to be able to leave before I'm 24 years old. I feel like even when I'm past 20 I shouldn't have to do these things for my mom anymore. I want to focus on school and work now instead of having to go to church 2-3 times a week. I feel like this is a way for her to control me and judge my character. I don't want that anymore.


I know I'm only 19, but should I have to go to church in order to please her while I still live under her roof?
 

**Apologies, longest post I've written so far.**

**tl;dr**: Mom won't stop belittling me about not going to church. Do I have a right not to go?"
22xqr9,2,2014-04-13,"Should I go for the job, or seek someplace else?",idonteven0,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/22xqr9/should_i_go_for_the_job_or_seek_someplace_else/,"I'm 23 years old guy.

I have been working in one company as an intern for about 3 months. Internship is part of my studies. I will graduate from my studies in the end of this month, and my boss has shown interest about hiring me.

However, I have some qualms about it. The reason why I have continued such time in this specific company, was that my employer had priorly hinted me of another job in different part of the same company, which had significantly better pay than I was hoping for. I went for the interview, but my co-worker got the job (since he was already under employment in the company, as a paid employee).

So, basically that means that this co-worker's position is now opening. But still, I don't know, would getting a job in this company would be what I want from a job, or should I not just be this picky about it.

Rational side of me thinks that is would make sense to take this job offer.. as this is more of a sure bet, or at least very likely one to get.

But the thought of getting remarkably better salary if I would get a job in other companies at the very same field I am haunts me. The salary in this company where I now intern is significantly lowest in all possible of the workplaces, and I would actually somewhat struggle to upkeep wanted level of quality of living, if I choose to work here. Also, the atmosphere at the workplace is rather negative, and work morale of the employees is seemingly low. It doesn't give much a vision of a more positive future to me.

I feel like if I would take his job offer, I would still not stay in the house for more than several months, maybe max. of 6 months. 

I am basically trying to choose between sure-but-not-as-nice-scenario and possibly-awesome-but-no-reservations-about-how-likely-scenario. These are, of course, just speculations at this point.

How would you do in my situation?

(I first posted this in /r/sanfrancisco but that didn't seem to be the right place, the mods redirected me to /r/AskSF!)

I'm not at all a frequent visitor of this subreddit, but I figured you guys might be able to help me achieve what I've always wanted!

I'm a 19 year old Belgian student. At this moment I am in my second year of my Bachelor's degree in Applied Informatics: Application Development. The total time for this Bachelor is 3 years. In the third year (next year) we will need to conclude our formation with a mandatory internship.

These internships mostly take place in Belgian firms. But luckily they also push students to take an internship abroad, it is allowed and supported, each student has a choice.

I've always been fascinated in the United States in general and became increasingly interested in San Francisco in the previous years, mainly because of the abundance of IT-companies and startups which are established in the area!
Unfortunately I've never been to the US in my life. It would be an amazing opportunity to engage in an internship abroad, and the US (preferably the San Francisco region) is at the top of my list.

I've been mailing some small companies, but this is just on a small scale of course. I wanted to take this a level further, so I turn to this subreddit for some help!

I am hoping to find some people here who can help me, guide me, give me contact details of IT companies (even startups) etc. I also have a few questions while I'm at it: 

- I've heard SF has a unique vibe, how is the area in general? 
- I've also heard living in SF is not at all cheap. Is this really true? Are there decent places for decent prices available? 
- Is it common for students to take an internship abroad in the area? 
- What would be my best course of action to contact companies and get myself an internship?

A bit of basic information about the internship: 

- internship has to be somehow IT-related (in a broad sense, but preferably something with software development/ engineering) 
- it will take place in May-June 2015 (I was advised to start looking early) 
- the internship should be around 6 weeks but can be longer if needed (for example if a company has an opportunity but 6 weeks is too short, a longer period is possible).

Please don't hesitate to reply to this post or send me a private message!

TL;DR: young motivated Belgian student in search for an internship abroad, preferably the SF area. Would like to get in contact with some inspiring companies to engage in an internship in May-June 2015."

My doctor is suggesting it because there is an area of my colon that has been inflamed for two years and another area it has expanded to the remainder of the colon since the previous colonoscopy. She fears that the expansion could cause complications in the near future so it might be best to remove it during my upcoming summer break. I feel pressed on time as if it's not now then I have to wait until the end of the next academic year.

So people who have been in this position, did you go through with it? Those that didn't, did you improve? What was it like and how long did it take you to recover? I really wanted to do an internship this summer, so is it possible to do this still(it would be a legal internship so mainly office work)? Also did you guys improve after?


If you have any advice or personal experience that would be greatly appreciated. Thanks

[As someone who's seen many attempts at producing/teaching Othello as a race play, I'm interested why you chose to teach Othello (a play which I don't believe has much to do with race\) instead of Merchant of Venice?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22xz6e/im_a_high_school_teacher_in_the_poorest/cgs0ac8?context=5)|One is that it goes really well with The Great Gatsby. And it deals with their concerns in life: cheating, backstabbing, etc. And I think it really is a play about race, and my students tend to agree. Othello has internalized the racism in his society, and is willing to believe Iago so quickly because he's right, how could a white woman love a black man? They get this.
[What is the hardest resource for your students to afford, and how do you work around that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22xz6e/im_a_high_school_teacher_in_the_poorest/cgrhjmx?context=5)|A lot of them don't have computers, but luckily, we have a computer lab at the school. They have a lot of access to that, but more than that, I accept most assignments hand-written when necessary. It's a shame, though, because many of them are computer illiterate. I recently took them to the computer lab, asked them to type something with right alignment, and got blank stares. I can't expect them to use computers at home when they don't have them, but if they don't use computers, they're not going to be ready for life after high school.
[I am going to make some educational videos for computer classes we learned in high school and middle school. What are some topics and how can I make learning online more fun?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22xz6e/im_a_high_school_teacher_in_the_poorest/cgrvuat?context=5)|That's an awesome idea! But kind of a broad question. What, specifically, are they for?
[Wow, I thought every American family had a computer in their home by 2014. This is really sad because without being familiar with computers you can hardly do anything without a high school nice enough to accommodate you.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22xz6e/im_a_high_school_teacher_in_the_poorest/cgrolbl?context=5)|From a quick Google search, in 2012, 25.2% of American households didn't have the internet. (Didn't find any states on computer ownership.)

[At least the basics. Like Microsoft office and how to use Google and more. Just stuff I learned in high school that others have not.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22xz6e/im_a_high_school_teacher_in_the_poorest/cgs36k8?context=5)|Ah.

[Hello! I'm a high school senior in a middle class suburban district. Putting aside the obvious cultural and demographic differences between the school I attend and the school you teach at, I'd like to know if there is a severe case of the government ""fixing something that ain't broke.""  I see as I'm about to graduate all the changes that are being made. Changes to curriculum, not exposing students to the critical thinking and analytical skills I was fortunate enough to be exposed to in my Honors/AP classes, and most importantly, taking away the independence that teachers have in how they do their jobs.

The corporate reform movement is a complete disaster. At the end of the day, this is all about profit at the expense of the kids. I could go on about this for hours, but I'm not going to spend too much time on this post, because EVERYTHING is wrong with this reform movement, and I can't cover everything in a few paragraphs.
[So do you think most teachers disagree with common core?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22xz6e/im_a_high_school_teacher_in_the_poorest/cgrlik6?context=5)|I can only speak from what I've seen, but I've met almost no teachers who like the Common Core. There is one survey that suggests teachers like the Common Core, but it was published by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the very same people who wrote and pushed the Common Core aggressively (and profit from it).
[What about fixing the teachers union?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22xz6e/im_a_high_school_teacher_in_the_poorest/cgs3v3g?context=5)|What do you think is wrong with teacher unions?

Or at least, they didn't before the Reagan administration started gutting public schools, justifying it with a statistical error in ""A Nation in Crisis.""
 |Most of our so-called ""underperforming"" schools are in low-income districts. Research repeatedly shows the effects of poverty on educational outcomes. It has little if anything to do with the schools themselves.
[What are your favorite and least favorite books/short stories/etc. to teach?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22xz6e/im_a_high_school_teacher_in_the_poorest/cgrhhee?context=5)|To the first: The Great Gatsby is probably my favorite. It's one of those famous ""I hated that in high school"" books, but my students always walk away adoring it. In fact, the school dance team is planning to choreograph a 1920s-style dance because they loved it so much! I teach it that it's not a love story, but a story about wanting the impossible in a materialist society.
[Also, I have to ask: How much of the overexplaining of what the author meant is based on your opinion, the curriculum, and/or actual things the author has said?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22xz6e/im_a_high_school_teacher_in_the_poorest/cgrhhee?context=5)|Which I suppose leads to your second question. There's always a matter of opinion in what I teach, that's unavoidable. That said, my kids know not to directly ask my opinion. Last school year, they pestered me to tell them who I voted for in the election. No dice. I try to keep my own feelings out of it but I also have such a passion for literature that, well, how could I?
[Now I have to ask: What did you think of the adaptations of ""Gatsby?"" (Any of them.\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22xz6e/im_a_high_school_teacher_in_the_poorest/cgrhnli?context=5)|The first one I didn't like. It's loyal to the book, in plot. But the director seemed to view it as a love story. He didn't have any sense of the fact that it's Fitzgerald's tale of a society crumbling before his eyes.
 |On the other hand, I loved the recent one. I went in expecting nothing, because it's a story about the emptiness of a life full of flash without substance, and Baz Luhrmann's films are all flash without substance. But I think he really captured it. I read a review that said something like, ""DiCaprio's Gatsby is like an empty champagne glass: Glitzy and shiny but nothing inside."" Well ... that's the freaking point. He nailed it.
[When you say ""the first one"", do you really mean the Robert Redford one? I have a feeling that you don't mean the 1926 silent film.  Wiki list.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22xz6e/im_a_high_school_teacher_in_the_poorest/cgs50bk?context=5)|Yeah, I'm referring to Robert Redford.
[Does your district have Zero Tolerance policies? Do you feel they help or hurt the school environment?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22xz6e/im_a_high_school_teacher_in_the_poorest/cgrie6l?context=5)|Thank goodness we don't have Zero Tolerance. What an awful concept. Some people have disabilities or emotional disturbances. Are we saying they are not entitled to an education because of these challenges in their lives? I wouldn't want to live in a society that tosses thousands of people by the wayside because they happen to be a challenge.
[You sound like a fantastic teacher, and I wish you and your kids every success.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22xz6e/im_a_high_school_teacher_in_the_poorest/cgs41zk?context=5)|:)
[Not to sound crass, but what is the graduation rate like at your school? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22xz6e/im_a_high_school_teacher_in_the_poorest/cgrhx8b?context=5)|No need to worry about sounding crass. That's a serious concern.
 |In New York, there are two types of diplomas: Regents and non-Regents. The Regents is harder to get, and the non-Regents is much harder to make use of in colleges and the job market. Our grad rates are 83% Regents, 94% overall.
[I'd say for being the poorest congressional district you guys are probably way ahead of the curve.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22xz6e/im_a_high_school_teacher_in_the_poorest/cgrhzzd?context=5)|In numbers, to some extent. The most recent report card from the city gave us a 69.9, which is .1 shy of an A rating. I don't think those ratings mean ... well ... anything, because they don't measure the right things. But graduation rate compared to similar populations is a factor.
[What do you mean by "" don't measure the right things?"" Sounds interesting, please elaborate. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22xz6e/im_a_high_school_teacher_in_the_poorest/cgrjbeg?context=5)|Well, they measure a lot of stuff that has feck all to do with education, like test scores. Standardized tests are among the worst measures of student learning there is. Other things it measures are suspension rates. A school is bad if it suspends a lot of students? Really? We get a few students with emotional disturbances and our ""grade"" can topple.
[Why do you think standardized tests are bad, and how would you change it? Sorry for drilling you with questions, you just seem like you know your stuff! :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22xz6e/im_a_high_school_teacher_in_the_poorest/cgrjhiu?context=5)|No worries.
 |A number of reasons. One is in the name: Standardized. There is no standard school, standard classroom, standard teacher, standard student. Everybody learns in different ways and at different paces. We teach our kids all differently, so why should everyone in a school, let alone a state, be judged on the same test?
 |Second, tests just aren't that useful as a measure of learning. Projects and other assessments are so much more effective. What if the student just doesn't sleep well the night before? Or gets depressed when it rains?
 |Third, they don't measure growth, just a benchmark. If I have a student who comes in and scores a 5 on a standardized test, and I get him up to a 60, that's amazing work! But he still fails the test, so I and the school get penalized.
 |All of these things wouldn't be that big of a deal if the tests were just used to gather data for study as opposed to high stakes. Teachers have lost their jobs and schools have been shut down over low test scores.
[Since the question is rarely asked: is our children learning?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22xz6e/im_a_high_school_teacher_in_the_poorest/cgshlce?context=5)|Yes, they am.
[It seems you are arguing against the notion that there should be any common standard against which to measure schools in this country.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22xz6e/im_a_high_school_teacher_in_the_poorest/cgrlkbm?context=5)|Well, no, not entirely. I dispute that the quality of a school or teacher is measurable by its students' success. It's a bit like trying to measure how good a doctor is by how many patients survive. Some doctors treat pimples and others treat cancer, just as some teachers teach gifted kids and others teach students with intellectual disabilities. Further, I have no control over whether a kid studies, just as a doctor can prescribe medicine but has no control over whether the parent takes it.
 |This is all aside from the fact that teachers now teach to the test. Do you know what I'm working on in class? How to structure a Critical Lens essay. I'm teaching them what to do on test day, not a skill or a life lesson, because this is how I'm going to be measured. Do you want your students spending their valuable time in school being taught how to take a test?
 |The tests are also absurdly over-stressful and not at developmental level for kids. Look, you wouldn't be willing to spend 6 hours of your day sitting motionless and staring at a paper that was asking you to do something that was above your developmental level. Excessive testing crushing our kids' souls and their self-confidence. It drains them of individuality. It's heartless.
 |I have 150 students. Some teachers have as few as 30, if they're elementary. The law of averages will not balance out external factors for us. And our livelihoods are on the line.
 |EDIT: You are also making the assumption that long, arduous tests are a valid measure of whether students know the material. Most education researchers and experienced teachers will tell you otherwise.

I find most teachers teach it as a love story, but there is so much more going on.
 |I once did a unit on The Things They Carried, which drew more snores than anything. I love it, but I think it's a bit too non-traditional for high school. Lesson learned the hard way.
[Last year in my junior AP Lit class, we were taught both those books and the reaction was exactly the same. The school I go to is one of the richest public schools in the country, so I think it must be the universal high schooler's reaction regardless of background. (I really liked TTTC though.\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22xz6e/im_a_high_school_teacher_in_the_poorest/cgroa9y?context=5)|I had a few kids who liked TTTC. Not many.
 |From what I understand, The Great Gatsby is one of those cliche books that high schoolers hate, so it excites me to hear that another class liked it too!
 |This year, after the first three chapters, I once found a piece of paper on my desk titled, ""People that don't want to read the Great Gatsby,"" with about 13 signatures on it. At the bottom, there was a drawing of a pig, labelled, ""Teacher."" However, by the end, most of the kids on the list loved it.
[I haven't been fortunate enough to teach junior Lit (this year I did 10th/12th\) but Gatsby was my favorite, I'm interested how you teach it if not just as a love story? (I think teaching it only as that diminishes it, honestly\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22xz6e/im_a_high_school_teacher_in_the_poorest/cguhx37?context=5)|I do a lot of frontloading about the 1920s and talk about how it's a story about the American Dream, how Gatsby wants to recapture the past because he THINKS that's what the dream is, but really the dream is lost in a society that has become so obsessed with opulence.
[Do you think it is odd we teach students chemistry yet do not have a single class that deals with taxes, personal finance (how credit cards work, mortgages, budgeting, ect\), labor law, as well as management skills?

It is an utter joke.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22xz6e/im_a_high_school_teacher_in_the_poorest/cgrw2sw?context=5)|I definitely think we need some sort of ""life skills"" classes, which include all those things. I also think we should include vocational training for all students, not just separating the kids we think are too smart from the kids we think are too dumb.

The math section is a straight forward list of math questions,  none of which require any advanced mathematics,  so you can't talk about that section being culturally biased.  How is it possible that ""Most of them want to learn"" and yet they have such a shockingly low score?  I mean,   if you just study the content of your textbooks,  you have the knowledge you need.

A 10th grader gets into some rage, so she picks up a desk and threatens to throw it at another student. Meantime, the teacher has to hold the desk (he's stronger than her) to prevent her from actually doing it. While he does this, he obviously can't leave to get security, so, not really thinking, he says to the kid nearest the door, whom we shall call D, to go get security.

[Thanks for doing this AMA! I have two questions that aren't really related to each other. Sorry if they've been asked before.  What do you think could change in the curriculum to better prepare high school students for the real world? (Classes, common core, etc\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22xz6e/im_a_high_school_teacher_in_the_poorest/cgs2p17?context=5)|I think less of a focus on careers and more a focus on humanity. There is nothing wrong with preparing students for professional skills, but creativity and imagination and self-reflection are all just as important, and America's schools tend to ignore them because a) we have a belief that schools are job preparation, and b) creativity and self-reflection aren't job skills. I dispute both.
[What subjects are the most difficult to teach due to your lack of materials/ students' lack of computers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22xz6e/im_a_high_school_teacher_in_the_poorest/cgs2p17?context=5)|Professional writing. I can teach them the actual content, but translating that into word processors on computers is a challenge. Some of them don't even know how to change the text alignment.

Making students socially conscious and capable of standing up for themselves is also a part of economic advantages. Creativity makes them more valuable in the economic market. Political awareness will help them understand why they're in the situation they're in, and help them know when a politician is trying to take advantage of them. Etc.

I more often deal with the opposite -- absent parents. As for workplace politics, right now in schools, that's a challenge. With what's going on in education reform right now, it's become a hotbed of politics and scandal as people push new instructional techniques and tests on you and tell you you'll be rated on these as a teacher, even when the people who told you to do these things have never taught a day in their lives. That said, the culture of your individual school is huge. I've been fortunate enough to have a principal and assistant principal that support us all tremendously. There are ways to avoid the politics. What do I do? I just teach. I leave all the other stuff to the politicians. When my kids are in the classroom, I just teach.
[Do you notice the difference between popular and unpopular pupils, and does this then directly relate to grades? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22xz6e/im_a_high_school_teacher_in_the_poorest/cgribx9?context=5)|From my own experience, having been a huge outcast as a child, I can say that popularity and ""status"" in school probably affects grades. My school is really small, and to some extent, we don't have a lot of outcasts. But I do know one, and I've made a huge effort to relate to her. I think I've made some impact. She turned in her latest project, albeit late, and that's a big change.
 |But overall, it's hard to say there's a straightforward correlation. Some kids are popular because they're really bright and successful, and some are popular because they're too cool for school.

Let me say that every child needs a good teacher, but the kids in suburbs or in Manhattan are going to be fine regardless. If they don't have a good teacher, mom and dad will get them a $200/hr tutor. (No exaggeration, I've seen Craigslist ads.) I try to do something with my life that, well, matters.

In 11th grade, I want to focus on things like reasoning skills, and some of them come to me writing run-on sentences. So I spend some time teaching these things when I wish I could spend more time on higher-order thinking.
[You're right. We should see that, but in all honesty how many of these students are gonna have a chance to become a teacher?

Isn't that a shame? Kids grow up getting one perspective on the world. I think the education profession should actively recruit minorities, so that kids can learn about the world through many sets of eyes.
[I am trying to get a job in a poor charter school in Fl. any tips for new teachers? I am white and the students will be black/hispanic. This is my first job so anything will be helpful. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22xz6e/im_a_high_school_teacher_in_the_poorest/cgrx5hk?context=5)|First bit of advice: Don't go to a charter school. Not just for political reasons. You'll be treated better as a public school employee.
 |But in terms of actual pedagogy: Don't assume that your race will be a barrier, but don't ignore it either. Acknowledge the issue of race in the lives of these kids. Don't pussyfoot around it. Depending on what subject you teach, you can bring in a lot of text and information on race issues and engage the kids tremendously.

What I actually think would improve our school the most would be resources outside the school. Universal, free healthcare for these kids. Or more expansive universal screening for disabilities. Or a higher minimum wage. Things like that, because there's a lot of research suggesting that student learning is influenced most by out-of-school factors.
[Are ASD students mainstreamed in your district?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/22xz6e/im_a_high_school_teacher_in_the_poorest/cgrhv1l?context=5)|Depends on severity. My particular school has no self-contained classrooms. I have some ASD kids but none with severe behaviors. In NYC in general, there is more and more mainstreaming. If you're an idealist, you believe the city when it says it is doing so because kids do better with their mainstream peers. Cynics say it's about saving money. Either way, it's the wave of the future.

Just landed an internship in the computer science field, I was told by my new boss that I would be doing a lot of work with Java and SVN (which I'm more than familiar with). However, he told me that all of my work would revolve around the use of PowerShell. 

I'm pretty used to command line work with my experience in the Linux terminal in Ubuntu but have never touched PowerShell once in my life. Is there any recommendations for where I should start learning it, especially if I'm working in version control?



TL;DR: I need to learn version control commands in PowerShell."
22yr96,11,2014-04-13,How much debt is UCLA worth?,Nokusu,ucla,https://www.reddit.com/r/ucla/comments/22yr96/how_much_debt_is_ucla_worth/,"So right now, I'm pretty much set on either going to UCLA or UCR. I know I'll be taking out loans either place, and UCLA is 10k/year more expensive (just because of the amount of money offered by the school). 

I'll be majoring in English (or Creative Writing at UCR), hopefully with a double major or minor in something else, though I don't know what at this point. My goal is to have a writing or editing job, possibly journalism, and eventually an author. I know how difficult that is, so no need to lecture me on that. I expect to be working a second job (most likely entry-level) in addition to that, at least while paying off loans. 

Both schools seem to be able to offer similar things academically (though I'm guessing there would be more internships at UCLA, if I can even obtain one at any point). The biggest deciding factors, in that case, are location and cost. UCLA is located where I'd like to be, in the Los Angeles area, and UCR costs less. 

I thought about attending UCR first and trying to transfer to UCLA, but apparently transferring to English there would be difficult since they have limited space or something, so it's competitive.

Since I want to be able to write believable characters at some point, I want to gain a variety of experiences. And, you know, gaining experiences in general is exciting. As I see it, I will have more opportunities for this at UCLA than at UCR-- considering the fact that the Metro reaches a wider range of locations than Riverside Transit, and I know I won't have a car at either school. (There's zipcar, but the more money I can save, the better. Obviously.) Plus Los Angeles has more people, and there are communities such as Little Tokyo around (which, being of Japanese descent and living in a southern town, is pretty exciting to me). 

I've also heard Riverside is a lot hotter, in terms of weather, which is intimidating since Los Angeles already seems pretty hot to me. Plus, apparently it has more pollution? But Riverside has that Creative Writing program. And some kind of week-long event where authors come or something. Which sounds fun. And I'd be in less debt. I know I'd want to move away from Riverside after graduating, though. (Well, right now, that's what I think.)

I'm also an out-of-state student. Because of the state I live in, however, I do not think it's good for me to stay here at all. (I'm in the LGBTQ community/whatever, and my state is extremely conservative. I've been /lucky/ so far, but I'm not comfortable here. I'm also not comfortable with the thought of continuing to go to school with many of my fellow high school classmates, honestly.) It's a great town, but I've known for years now that I can't stay here. I also think that if I establish myself here first, it would be harder to move to LA, since the cost of living is different. (But if I go to LA for school, I'd meet more people there, etc.) (Another note is that I have quite a few friends in the LA area.)

Essentially, what I'll be paying for at either school is the set of experiences/connections/friendships/location that comes with it -- not just the pretty sheet of paper that will have my diploma printed on it. 

All that said, it's pretty obvious where I want to go. My dad has gone back and forth between encouraging me (""One way or another, I know you'll be able to pay off your debt!"") (""You should probably go ahead and go there!"") and seemingly discouraging me (though he says he's not) (""I wouldn't go to such an expensive school--"") (coupled by statements that he wouldn't have even been admitted, so he supposedly has no idea what someone like me should do ?? whatever that means). The thought of not being able to go to UCLA stresses me out, but also the thought of the amount of debt stresses me out. I do not know how much I'll be capable of paying since I don't know what my income might be. My whole career choice is a gamble, but if I don't stick with it, I know I won't get anywhere. 

Anyway, any advice is appreciated. Even if you don't think you're ""qualified"" to give advice, I'll take it. Thank you in advance, and I apologize for the wall of text.

EDIT: I don't know exactly how much I'll take out in loans each year yet, since I'm still applying for as many scholarships as I can and will not hear back from those for a while. It also may vary from year to year, and I'm not sure how much."

The position calls for proficiency in programs like Microsoft Excel and Powerpoint which have been one of my strengths throughout my academic career.  Along with anything Microsoft, I’ve taken classes on website design. If given the chance of this internship, I can ensure you that I can provide a plethora of fresh ideas, energy, and motivation to any and all my assignments.

22yyxw,1,2014-04-13,I'm thinking of quitting my job CAW,Xyuli,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/22yyxw/im_thinking_of_quitting_my_job_caw/,"I've worked part time at an asian supermarket in the food court for almost exactly a year now, I started last April. I'm thinking of quitting because of everything that has built up. Sorry this is really long! 

The only reason I can't is because I've grown used to having my own money and my independence, I don't need to rely on my parents anymore. I started working because my parents were struggling a bit and I could support myself. 

But I've been so stressed lately, I'm still in high school and I don't have time for homework anymore. I leave my house at 7:30 in the morning, I don't get home until 9:30 most days (I usually only have 1 day off). I work almost every day, and even if I get a day off it's on a weekday, like Tuesday. I rarely, VERY rarely, have weekends off. I can count on my fingers the number of Saturdays I have had off. And I have to have extremely valid reasons for it too. My (part time) coworkers, they have to beg to start late on Sundays so they can go to church (or to take the day off). 

I don't see my friends anymore, if I do it's when I finish school early and have time to visit them before I have to head to work. If I want to see them it's only after work on Friday nights. I recently changed schools too so I haven't seen a lot of my friends and spent quality time with them for what feels like ages.

Some of my coworkers are really great. I've become really close with them and we're like a family. My boss though... She's another story. She likes to yell at us, for one. Which isn't that big of a deal, but it's just annoying. But she doesn't treat us fairly.

You have to understand the dynamic here - there are full time and part time employees. The full time employees get paid under the table and they get paid less per hour than us (around $7/hr vs $10.25/hr). The full time employees work from 9am till 9pm, doing lots of different things.

But the thing is, when it gets busy, like really busy, a lot of the times the full time employees will not do anything and leave everything for the part time. All the hard stuff, like cleaning and taking out the garbage and helping customers, they leave to us. If we're busy, then they do it. Or if there's a customer they'll look around and wait for us to help them. They won't do anything unless they absolutely have to. They just stand around and talk a lot of the time. Or do small things, instead of actually helping when there's a lineup. 

Most days me(usually me) or another part time has to clean the back and take out the garbage. Today was a bad day, I asked if I could go home early because there was almost no customers there. The full time were standing around doing nothing. The part time were occasionally helping a customer. There was no reason for her to make me stay. Except, to clean so that none of the full time will have to do it. I had been ordering food for almost my entire shift (12-7 at the time),  short of my breaks and the hour and a half or so my coworker switched with me.

I asked her if I could, she said no because ""who else would clean the back?"" I told her my friend (another part time, who I asked beforehand if I should ask to go home early because I knew she would have to clean, and she said it didn't matter to her if she did).Then my boss said ""What? She's going to do the work of two people?"" 

The thing is on Sundays we do a big clean up and two people clean. Another part time was taking out the garbage today so she would have been cleaning and I would have been cleaning too. I said that she would be cleaning as well. 

My boss then said ""You can't just give people whatever jobs you want, then there's no one else here to clean over here. Who is going to do this then?"" (rough translations because we were speaking Mandarin). 

I'm not one to complain, whenever she asks me to do something I do it. But it's ridiculous how there's like 7 other people at work who are fully able to clean and she wont ask them. Last week I had a large amount of homework to do (even today I still do, it's hard for me to get things done on time now - a problem I've never had before) so I asked her to go home early. She said fine, as long as you finish the cleaning. 

I thought that was fair enough, but KNOWING that I wanted to go she kept on asking me to do more and more things that she could have asked ANYONE else to do. Nobody was doing anything, and she still asked me. She asked us to clean at 7:30, when we;re supposed to clean at 8:30 (we finish at 9). She looked again and told me to clean the tables again because they were dirty. Then she told me to wash the garbage bins. Then she told me to mop (which my other coworker was already doing).  

So obviously today I'm upset... I felt my eyes burning so I walked away, and I tried to calm down. My coworker tried to talk to me and make me feel better but I still felt like crying. I went to the washroom and I hung out there for a while trying to calm down. Eventually my boss came to the washroom and we talked a bit, I told her I was stressed with school and work and she said she would cut my hours. See if I could find a way that it would work. 

But it's not just the hours, it's what's going on here... My coworker has been getting pissed at the full time because yesterday (I went to visit an university - one of my rare weekends off) they were super busy and the full time wouldn't do anything to help. My boss talked to us about it and she said how the reason it seems like we do more is because we work for short shifts. They do work in the mornings when we aren't there, so they don't do the same work again when we are there. 

But how does that make sense? If you're getting paid to work, do actual work instead of making us do it. At first it made sense for us to order when they're tired, but now they're just relying on us to do almost everything when we're there. Not all the full time do this, but most of them do. 

Then after I finished cleaning today, my boss said I could go. But because I wasn't there yesterday and it was payday, I didn't get my paycheck yet. I had already left but I called my coworker and asked her if she would take my pay check for me instead. She said she would, gave the phone to my boss and I told her to give my pay check to my coworker. I thought it would be better because we might see each other at the gym tomorrow morning or before work so I can deposit it. I literally have 42 cents in my account because I paid for a volunteer trip to Costa Rica with my school. I need the money because I haven't had money for lunch or dinner since I don't go home from school to work. 

But then my coworker calls back and says ""well you're working tomorrow anyways, and I don't want to lose your pay check, so why don't you just get it tomorrow?"" So I gave in and said fine, whatever, if you don't want to take it don't. 

But then my boss calls me again and she's yelling because she's saying how she went and got my pay check to give to my coworker but now she's saying that she doesn't want it. So what is she supposed to do? So I tell her to just give it to her and now my coworker is mad at me because they're yelling at her. 

I have been thinking of quitting for a while, I've been looking for a new job anyways. But I don't think I can find one. I don't know how I found this one. It's shady, it's unfair, it's stressful, and I don't even know if the money is really worth it anymore. I've given up so much of myself to work here - I don't get to do anything I really enjoy anymore.

I'm leaving for university in a few months, I applied for a 6 week job (kind of like an internship) that pays 385/week for the summer. If I get that job I can easily quit. Even if I don't, I'm not sure if I want to work here during the summer. I'm going to quit in a few months to go to university anyways, and I'm sick of working here. But it would be really good if I could just save up some money to use in university since I'm not sure if I'll have a job then. I know my parents have money saved up for me and there's some scholarship money and OSAP, but I don't know how I'll get by.. 

I'm thinking after next week (which would be the last week including in the next pay check) I should quit. What should I do? Do you think I'm wrong to be so upset over this? Is the job worth it? Should I stick it out? I know my coworkers and I are unsatisfied and want to find something better. I don't agree with a lot of the stuff that they do in the kitchen here and I don't trust how clean it is here. I miss having freedom and I miss out on so much by having a job - or just this job. 

I don't think there is an in between. Even if they cut my hours, like if I worked 3 days a week, I don't know if I would want to work there. I keep thinking about what I can do once I quit. I could dye my hair. I could spend time with my friends. I could actually relax and read. I could actually do some homework. I could get home when it's not dark outside. I could just do whatever I wanted with my time. 

Edit: Forgot to say, that usually when you order food you don't clean. I ordered all shift (and it's important to note that I ordered when it was actually busy) and I still had to clean. Which happens, but everyone there is fully capable of cleaning or ordering too, but they don't. 

There's also the fact that you don't get raises. My boss mentioned to me a few months ago that she was going to ask if I could get a raise. I haven't received one. I've asked other coworkers and they said no part time workers get raises, that's why everyone leaves. There's no way I can move up in the company. Even my friend at Mcdonalds gets continual raises - even if it is like 10 cents every 3 months. He started at 9.60 and now makes like $10.00 "

I'm desperate for feedback.",bigvic69,needadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/22yzne/hey_reddit_how_am_i_doing_im_desperate_for/,"A little background: I'[m] 20 and currently finishing up my sophomore year of uni as a Computer Science major.

*I'm struggling to define how well I'm progressing in life. Am I on the track to success? Or am I being set up to fail? In a society where a college education has become just another thing you have to do before you can be considered successful, I wonder has the value of a degree become next to nothing. Am I even pursuing the right career? That sort of thing...*

I feel like I'm getting nowhere with school. Most of my classes seem irrelevant, and the ones that are, move at a snails pace. This semester the homework is so easy that I rarely ever start it until the night before it's due. It all seems so ""un-involving"".

*Is it just me? Is my school running a skeleton curriculum? The schools population is exploding, and every department has quite a few new teachers...*

I'm not friends with anyone from my major and most of my friends don't have majors even remotely similar to mine; it's hard to make a comparison of progress.
My parents don't have anything to say. Growing up, my dad was always at my 2 siblings and my heels for anything and everything. Once I got to college (I'm the youngest), my parents' feedback ceased to exist. These past 12 months, I've been on an emotional trip, reassessing my view on life. I've partitioned some of my attention on my health/nutrition. I've lost 57±1 lbs, and I've made some big strides with facial acne that I have neglected for far too long. I consider these as huge successes, but it barely seems to invoke any enthusiasm from my parents. No ""congratulations"". No ""I'm proud of you"". It was more like an ""oh wow"" or a ""that's great"".

*Should I not expect much input from my parents as an adult? Has my disassociation with Christianity gotten to them?* In reality, they're wonderful parents, and I love them. If anything, they trust me too much. I think the cynic in me tempts my outlook with worst case conclusions...

Just a few days ago I saw a post in this subreddit or the next; and in the comments, internships were being given out like religious ideological flyers with candies attached. I've always heard that internships for computer science students don't happen until junior year. I'd kind of like to know if that is even a valid assumption. I have next to nothing prepared for this summer, job-wise. I've put it off more and more, and now I'm in full on panic mode. I've dreaded calling about the dish-washing job I had last summer. Just the thought of spending another summer, finger-pruned, in that windowless 5ft X 5ft dishroom at a high volume grocery store deli with a bar and lake view. 

I have all these ideas for games and other software that I am so eager to bring to fruition and begin developing. Am I even good enough material for a job like that, at the forefront of creativity? Perhaps it's unrealistic to expect to land a job at a studio, and I should focus my goals on something more realistic...

Anyway, I hope this came out coherently. If you have read this far, I just want to say thank you and that I appreciate all feedback given.

tl;dr Plz respond!"

Thanks!

EDIT: I've got a lot of great advice, thanks guys! Just wanted to elaborate a bit.

The reason I'm focusing on EC's is because my GPA is sub-par. 3.8 on a 5.0 scale, and about 3.3 unweighted. My SAT scores are near perfect, 2350. In addition, I've taken the most rigorous curriculum possible, and my school is a well-respected private institution. So the only thing that really brings me down is grades, and those are definitely improving. I just want to maximize my chances by becoming as well-rounded as possible."

&gt;The GNOME Foundation has run into cash flow problems and as a result is freezing non-essential expenses. The GNOME Foundation has eliminated their cash reserves leading to this dire situation, but should be recoverable in the months ahead. The GNOME Foundation got into this situation through its Outreach Program for Women (OPW) and managing the program (and funds) for a number of other participating organizations. The GNOME Foundation staff and board fell behind in their processes with being overwhelmed by administering OPW. GNOME's Outreach Program for Women is explained as ""The Outreach Program for Women (OPW) helps women (cis and trans) and genderqueer get involved in free and open source software."" They've had around 30 interns for their most recent cycle. 

I'm sure you guys are all aware of feminism's war against the technology industry. Well we have another casualty. The GNOME Foundation, the makers of one of the most popular desktop environments for Linux is running into financial troubles. The culprit? In 2012 (2013 report isnt out yet) shows 1/4 of their expenses went to ""Women's outreach""[1]. In a matter of 2 years they went from spending $0 on women's outreach to over 100k while at the same time spending on Hackfests went from $82k to $21k. In 2014 the program hired 30 women's outreach interns who each got a $5,500 stipend[2][3]. All you aspiring software developers out there better be ready to walk on eggshells and put on your feminist friendly face.

So, I have been dating this girl for almost 7 months now. We have been taking things slow, and just enjoying dating each other. We are both in college, and this upcoming summer we both have internships, hers in in Washington, mine is in Chicago. If we both werent leaving, I want probably want to take this to the next level, but because we are leaving, I dont want to start a relationship and then be gone for 3 months. I rather just wait it out until we get back. 

So assuming both of our internships go well, we will get offers for full time positions. We both have another year left, but this just guarantees we have a job after graduation. Neither one of us is planning on staying in our city where we go to College, so this brings up a pretty big problem that will need to be addressed sooner rather than later.

If we do get back and are still into each other, I would like to be in an actual, exclusive relationship with her. At this point we would have been seeing each other for almost a year, and I want to know if I need to move on with my life (I think this is fair right?).

Since neither one of us is planning on staying, one of us would have to look for another job in either Chicago or washington, or do a LDR. I feel like this is so early to bring up in a new relationship, but time is running out, and I dont know if this is the right thing to do.

This is my current build. I built this about 3-4 years ago for around 600 Euros. One of the problems is that there was no there was no CPU fan included with the CPU, which was a mistake on my part. The dealer who I bought the parts from (azerty.nl) was kind enough to put in some kind of standard fan but the sound it makes is horrid and can be heard throughout my house.

I'm looking to upgrade my current rig as cheaply as possible to be able to run ArcheAge on maximum settings without any problems. At the moment I have to switch from DirectX 11 to DirectX 9 and turn everything on lowest settings just to be able to play it without Bluescreening.

[Here are the minimal and recommended system requirements for the game](http://i.imgur.com/jUf3Ojv.png). Unfortunately I can't find anything about the requirements to run the game on maximum.

The game runs on CryEngine 3 and it's an MMO with a lot of party PvP. So I guess a good CPU, GPU and RAM would be the primary focus? (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong)

Thanks for reading, I hope someone's able to help me out. Feel free to ask me some more questions if I forgot to mention something."

We met on Okcupid about a week ago, started chatting and got along well enough so we exchanged numbers. We spent a fair bit of the evening texting one another and just generally getting to know some basic things about each other. The next day he asked me if I wanted to get together and watch a movie sometime and I said yes, and as it turns out he literally lives around the corner from me (less than a two minute walk) so we are practically neighbors. 

He came over the next day and it wasn't awkward in the slightest. He walked right up to my roommate and I (we were on the front porch enjoying the sun!) and shook our hands, introduced himself, chatted with us then followed me to my room. We sat on my bed and ""watched"" The Internship. We talked through the whole thing and just had each other absolutely cracking up. My roommates got nosey and came down and started chatting us both up and told us to come upstairs for a drink, so we did. I expected it to be a quick drink but we actually all had quite a few, and before we knew it it was 2am. Everyone started filtering off to bed so I invited him to watch another movie before he left, he agreed. We ended up cuddling, kissing, and one thing lead to another and we had sex. 

I honestly expected him to get up and leave after that, figured I likely unknowingly met up with someone who was just kinda looking for a hookup - but he threw his leg and arm over me and pulled me in for a cuddle and we fell asleep. He stayed the night, we fooled around a bit more and we talked a lot, then he left in the morning. 

He texted me that day, we chatted throughout the day and into the wee hours of the next morning while I worked a midnight shift. It's been only 5 days but we have seen each other every single day since. He came over the following day and we went for an hour walk, stopping by his place so I could see his cat and his house, etc. Then returned to my house where we hungout with my roommates for a few hours til almost midnight when he walked me to work. During our walk I mentioned that I saw he had two ukelele's at his house and that he should play for me sometime because I love ukelele's. He dropped me at work and we texted again til the wee wee hours of the morning. 

The next day he had all these plans to get school work done and then visit family then visit friends in his hometown but he texted me throughout the day AND stopped by my place on his way out of town with his ukelele. Told me to hold onto it and learn something for him :). Again, we texted all night and into the morning. 

Then yesterday he came over after doing some school work and we sat on the porch with my roommates and all hungout and chatted and had a casual time, just enjoying this amazing weather and then he and I went to his house. His roommate wasn't home so we went into his room and got into bed and just talked for about an hour. He admitted that he felt extremely comfortable with me and that it's pretty undeniable that there's something between us. We get each others jokes, understand each others life situations, etc. There's no awkwardness and it honestly feels like I've known the guy for years, I'm so at peace in his company. We ended up kissing and having sex and then cuddling naked for about 5 hours, yeesh, before I had to get up and leave for work. He texted me a short while after I left and stayed up chatting with me til about 2am this morning. 

We have plans to start Keto together (both have done it in the past!) again and embrace the spring by going for walks and just going outside lots. We have seen each other every day since we met and, it's hard to explain without sounding like a giddy teenager, but there's something between us that is just so amazing and I'm very much enjoying it. He told me he was looking for a relationship, not just random hookup type things and I agreed. 

**The Question**
So NOW, all that being said, I am super curious what happens next. Do we just keep doing this? Should I mention that I'm interested in making things ""official""? I'm cool with waiting a bit still because I know it's super early on, but I'm just curious how this kind of process works really! He reaches out to hangout with me just as often as I do him, and he's returned all the feelings of happiness with us doing whatever we are doing. Should I just leave it? Hmmm what do you guys think?

***TL;DR:*** Seeing this guy, have hungout/talked every day for almost the last week, insanely great chemistry that even my roommates and his roommate have picked up on. How to move things to the next level? "

I'm being drug tested soon for my summer internship. The test will probably be April 28th, so 2 weeks from now. I read your guide [here](http://beyondchronic.com/2011/09/ask-old-hippie-will-cranberry-juice-help-you-pass-a-drug-test/) and it was very helpful, but I have a question regarding my specific situation.

For the last few months (September-March) I have smoked 4-5 times a week with friends, usually a few bowls each time. Starting at the beginning of this month, I began to cut down and have only smoked 2-3 times up until this past weekend (where I took edibles on Thursday and Friday).

Do you think it's likely that I will have to resort to the substitution method? I plan on exercising and drinking lots of water each day up until then and am about 15% bodyfat, so my friends say that I have a good chance of passing. But it's not really something I want to leave up to chance and would like to be as prepared as possible.

Also, I was thinking about buying a few home test kits to check on my status every few days; is this something you recommend/think would be a good idea?

Thanks for your time!"

As people that thrive off attention from others, I'm sure there are other ENFPs who can relate to this.

I'm getting ready to graduate college and the uncertainty of what I'm going to do and everything else that comes with that is leaving me in a pretty vulnerable state. I also went through a shitty breakup a few months back that I'm still struggling to overcome. The girl and I share many friends, and I can't help but feel that most of them are on her side.

Over the past couple months I've felt that I'm slipping from the minds of others. Some friends are preparing to start big internships and others are involved in projects. It seems feeble, but I've noticed a somewhat drastic decrease in Facebook interactions with others. When with others, I can't help but feel that I'm not welcome or liked. I've brought these fears up to my best friend, and he told me that I was wrong...but he sounded like he was trying to make me feel better, as if he knew that on some level, I was right.

I know that these thoughts are illogical and that the more I think about them, the more anxious and ineffective I'll become. My whole life I've struggled with these kinds of thoughts so I'm rather confident this social anxiety is somewhere engrained in me.

Have any of you dealt with this? How do you deal with feeling lonely despite evidence that you aren't alone?"
230kuv,3,2014-04-14,Living in Madison Hall this summer?,ThrowawayDC_2014,gwu,https://www.reddit.com/r/gwu/comments/230kuv/living_in_madison_hall_this_summer/,"Hello, 

My husband will be working as an intern in DuPont circle this summer and we're currently scheduled to live in Madison Hall on GWU (paired as roommates, which yes, all of our family and friends think is hilarious).

I talked to someone in the housing office today who said she couldn't personally attest to how well the window A/C units work in the summer. It would be wonderful if anyone here could comment on their experience with the units.

Additionally, the furnishings listed aren't very clear. Can anyone say what furniture is usually included in the dorm in addition to the bed? Couch, desk, chairs, etc?

Any other information on what it's like to live in the hall would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you!

230lc7,5,2014-04-14,Is this potential relationship worth it?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/230lc7/is_this_potential_relationship_worth_it/,"I (22F) have been hanging out with Todd* (25M) for about two months. We knew each other for about six months prior to this, as we both work in the same store (different departments) and have a few mutual friends. I like him, but I take a really long time to open up and I haven’t fallen for him yet. There is plenty of sexual attraction, I always have a good time when we hang out, and he’s very nice to me.


Todd is pretty introverted. Not in the sense that he is quiet and shy—he is outgoing and quite weird (which I enjoy). However, he keeps all of his feelings locked away and is very insecure, despite being crazy handsome, smart and funny. In the past Todd has had a really hard time being comfortable with people sexually. However, recently he has begun to open up to me. He told me he’s never been so honest with someone, and he’s even told me about some pretty fucked up stuff that happened to him when he was a child that probably is the root of all his insecurities and why he is so uncomfortable sexually. Todd also has a bit of a drinking problem. Almost every night he goes to bed with 3-4 beers and a glass or two of wine in his system. I know this is his coping mechanism, and I am not yet and maybe never will be in a place to talk to him about this, because as of right now I don't think it's any of my business. 


So yada yada we get along great and it is obvious to me that he is falling for me, and I possibly am too. However, there’s another catch. Todd has accrued some pretty bad credit card debt. I don’t know the exact amount, but he is very careless about spending money. He openly talks about his debt and how poor he is, and usually in a joking matter. The other day he bought something and said, “Oh well, another $100 doesn’t really matter when you’re already in this much debt. I’ll pay it off sometime.” This scares the shit out of me because I am a freak about my finances. 


Lastly, I am graduating in May and will be starting my internship at the hospital in August (still will be living in this city). I have lofty goals and plan on doing something great with my life. However, I don’t think Todd has goals. He went to school for photography right out of high school and then dropped out after a year. He talks about planning to go back to school for automotive stuff, but I’m not sure when. And I’m not saying a college education matters to me at all, but aspirations do. All in all I just think he’s pretty lost in life.  


I guess what I need help figuring out is if this is all worth it. I like this guy and we share so many of the same values and opinions. But I don’t know if I should be the one to deal with all of this baggage. I know he needs to figure out his own shit before he can be with someone, and I don’t know if I should stick around to be there for him while he does. Don’t get me wrong I really would like to stick around, but I’m scared of getting too involved and then it being hard to turn back. I feel like I can’t talk to him about this because we haven’t been together long and we aren’t even dating. I would have no idea how to bring it up without overstepping my boundaries. Sorry for all of this word vomit. I'm not sure if I'm worrying too much and should just relax and see what happens. Any advice you have to offer is much appreciated.


**TLDR: great guy, lots of baggage. Do I stick around and see where this relationship goes, or do I get out before things could get messy?**

230opf,1,2014-04-14,"[Linux] Karen Sandler steps down, Gnome out of Money?",Totsean,totse,https://www.reddit.com/r/totse/comments/230opf/linux_karen_sandler_steps_down_gnome_out_of_money/,"I got this quote from Anonymous:

&gt; You're missing the real picture. GNOME is running out of money because they spent it on stupid outreach programs for women and ""trans-women"". And now that the financial shitstorm is coming to light... the female exec director responsible for this [debacle resigns](http://www.gnome.org/news/2014/03/karen-sandler-steps-down-as-gnome-foundation-executive-director/) 
&gt; 
&gt; So basically men made it...men funded it. Women showed up later and demanded all the money be spent on them... and now there's none left. It's almost a microcosm of the Western nations economic woes.


And here is the story:

http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=MTY2Mjc

&gt; While GNOME has been riding high lately with driving the development of its Wayland-based compositor and being the first major desktop getting there natively for most of its applications, and the overall work on the recent GNOME 3.12 release being fairly exciting, on the foundation side they are running into a budget shortfall and funds are becoming very tight within the GNOME Foundation.
&gt; 
&gt; The GNOME Foundation has run into cash flow problems and as a result is freezing non-essential expenses. The GNOME Foundation has eliminated their cash reserves leading to this dire situation, but should be recoverable in the months ahead. The GNOME Foundation got into this situation through its Outreach Program for Women (OPW) and managing the program (and funds) for a number of other participating organizations. The GNOME Foundation staff and board fell behind in their processes with being overwhelmed by administering OPW. GNOME's Outreach Program for Women is explained as ""The Outreach Program for Women (OPW) helps women (cis and trans) and genderqueer get involved in free and open source software."" They've had around 30 interns for their most recent cycle.
&gt; 
&gt; The GNOME Foundation Is Running Short On Money
&gt; Making matters worse, in their 2014 budget they made assumptions based upon the previous year's incomes and expenditures, which were more optimistic. There's also the matter of payments from GNOME sponsors and others owing the GNOME Foundation money being rather fluid or coming in late.
&gt; 
&gt; For rectifying this budget shortfall, the GNOME Foundation is going through with its invoicing of conference sponsors, more pro-actively following up on unpaid invoices, better invoicing OPW sponsoring, increasing their general fundraising efforts, and taking other efforts.
&gt; 
&gt; As a major step in acknowledging and correcting the problem, the GNOME Foundation voted last week to ""freeze Foundation spending which is not essential to the running of the Foundation. By keeping expenditures to a minimum while some delayed revenue is regained, the board aims to have things back to normal within a few months."" 
&gt; 
&gt; 


Now what this means is, instead of fixing stuff that matters and listening to feedback, they spent their resources in Women outreach programs. THANK YOU KAREN.

[What are your thoughts on the discovery of water on Saturn's moon? What are the chances of other life forms existing in those conditions? Can it be habitable?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgs8i0i?context=5)|That's pretty awesome. We now think there may be liquid water oceans on Enceladus (Saturn), Europa (Jupiter), and Ceres (main-belt asteroid). Since we know that life on Earth depends on liquid water, these all may be good places to look for life. But also, life depends on many other factors, that we need to explore more on these bodies - like a source of energy, carbon molecules, etc. -BC.
[So, because it has liquid water, would there be any way to... teraform... it for human life? Could it be habitable at some point?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgs9x9u?context=5)|My personal opinion? Anything can be ""terraformed"" with enough energy. But that's the trade - enough energy may be enormous and not practical. Plus, you need other gases besides water and oxygen for all life forms (not just humans, but also plants and microbes). -BC 
[How would you best describe a total eclipse of the heart? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgs9i5i?context=5)|Love is like a shadow on me all of the time. -BC.
[Can you use your super secret weather machines to eliminate the cloud cover over Charlotte, NC tonight so we can observe the eclipse?  Big fan of that space stuff, btw. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgsb1v7?context=5)|When I'm able to control the weather I'll let you know. Or not. Muah ha ha. -BC 
[If the moon was made of spare ribs, would ya eat it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgs8v0o?context=5)|Probably, I'd be pretty hungry by the time I got there -RCW.
[What is an average day like performing your duties at Nasa?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgs8nai?context=5)|An average day is pretty boring to the outside observer, my research is all data analysis, so I do a lot of computer coding. Depending on my current project, I have to sit in a lot of meetings or teleconferences. But I get to do some cool stuff sometimes! Like doing public outreach: NASA hosts web-chats, stuff like this AMA here on reddit, going to the Space and Rocket Center here in Huntsville to participate in events (touch a Moon rock!). I go to conferences and team meetings around the country to talk about my research and collaborate on projects. Right now I am working on an analysis of the shallow moonquakes that were recorded by the Apollo seismometers, and I am also on the science team for the upcoming InSight mission (Mars geophysical station) which will launch in 2016. -RCW.
 |I really enjoy working at NASA. On an average day, I work on several different projects, including lab work and mission planning. I work on geochronology - or how old a rock is - so I need to get samples, crack them open, and pop them in my mass spectrometer. We write proposals and papers, and review other peoples proposals and papers, and present them at conferences when we can to make sure we are doing the right science. For NASA, I sit of some committees that help plan NASA's new missions and goals, which I enjoy helping with. -BC.
[Thanks for the reply! When you say *coding* do you mean programming or classifying and identifying things?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgsaidb?context=5)|Programming. I use FORTRAN, MATLAB, and Mathematica. -RCW.
[Does the lunar eclipse only happen during a full moon?  If so, why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgs98el?context=5)|Hi Eva! Yes, eclipses only happen during a full Moon, because the Sun, Earth, and Moon need to be all lined up in a row. If the Moon is not lined up with the Earth and Sun, it wouldn't look full. Don't forget to remind your parents to wake you up so you can catch a glimpse! -RCW.
[Do total lunar eclipses happen often? Are their partial lunar eclipses? How often do they happen in comparison to solar? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgs8ovw?context=5)|Eclipses come in cycles. Yes, there are partial lunar eclipses, but during those the Moon doesn't appear red. There's another total lunar eclipse coming in October. This is a good site with info on when eclipses occur and which areas of the world can see them: [Link to eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov](http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/OH/OH2014.html#LE2014Apr15)  -RCW 
[What is the most widespread myth about our solar system or what we have been taught in the past about space?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgs83wr?context=5)|I tend not to pay much attention to myths, was there something specifically you had in mind? -RCW.
[Why does it take on a reddish hue?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgs8tpk?context=5)|It is the same effect that causes the sky to look red at sunset. The light that is reaching the Moon from the Sun passes through the Earth's atmosphere at low angle and is scattered; red wavelengths are scattered least.
[What is the difference between a ""harvest moon"" (an orange/red moon seen in the fall\) and a blood moon? They look the same on google searches, but apparently ""blood moon"" is also some silly name for a full moon in October.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgsaq6a?context=5)|Various cultures have given names to each full Moon of the year - presumably related to their importance in planning for sowing, harvesting, animal migrations, etc. A harvest moon is the full moon closest to the autumnal equinox, it doesn't generally have a color associated with it (except what you might see as it is rising or setting). The blood moon or hunter's moon is the full moon in october. Other names include flower moon and wolf moon, etc. -BC.
[Do you know of a website where I can go see in what location in the world and at what time the eclipse can be seen (best\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgs8crp?context=5)|This one is good too: [Link to eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov](http://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/OH/OH2014.html#LE2014Apr15T)
[I don't want to stay up that late to watch the lunar eclipse. Can you guys reschedule it for earlier in the evening please?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgsbfsq?context=5)|Have your people call my people -RCW.
[What is the most incredible thing about our moon that most people don't know about?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgs9n5b?context=5)|There are lots of neat things, it's hard to pick the most incredible one, but here's a nifty tidbit: the Moon is tidally locked to the Earth, which means that the same side always faces us. But thanks to slight orbital variations, the Moon experiences librations, meaning that the leading and trailing edges (and also the top and bottom edges) sometimes expose slightly different hemispheres of the Moon. So we can actually see about 57% of the Moon's surface over the course of about a month. Here's an animation that shows it better than I've described [Link to en.wikipedia.org](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lunar_libration_with_phase2.gi) -RCW.
 |To me, the most interesting thing is that every crater you see on the Moon had a counterpart on the Earth at some point. We don't see those craters today because the Earth recycles its crust through plate tectonics, erosion, etc. So the Moon is the place to look if you want to see the cratering history of the Earth. Which is huge! -BC.
[One of my highschool teachers once said that Hubble isn't powerful enough to see the objects left behind by the first moonwalk. I find this hard to believe due to how powerful Hubble is. So, can Hubble see the small objects on the lunar surface?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgs9ri2?context=5)|The issue with Hubble isn't resolving power - Hubble can't look at the Moon because it's too bright. It would saturate the camera -RCW.
[For Dr. Weber, how does earthquake activity on other planets compare to that here on Earth? Are our landers/rovers frequently equipped with seismographic equipment or is this something you're just now beginning work on?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgs8t99?context=5)|Right now, the Moon is the only body besides Earth that we have seismic data for (from Apollo). Moonquakes are a lot different than earthquakes. The Moon has no active volcanoes or plate tectonics, so the seismic activity there is mostly all related either to impact on the surface, or solid body tides. We sent a seismometer to Mars on Viking, but because it was located on the lander body and not in direct contact with the ground, it only recorded wind. The good news is that we'll be sending a new seismometer to Mars on the InSight mission in 2016! I would love for every mission to have a seismometer, but because of the technological requirements (most importantly, that it can live on the surface for a long time), sending them to other planets is pretty tough. -RCW 
[1\)  How often does a blood moon like this occur so that the USA can see it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgs8fxf?context=5)|Lunar eclipses occur every few years - it's not terribly uncommon. Whether we can see if from the US or not depends on the exact timing - see the top for links to eclipse times.
[Would setting up a moon base significantly contribute to the advance of our technology, or are we already very much capable of such feat?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgs9f9j?context=5)|We have the majority of the technology now to set up a moon base - if you think of something like a space station on the Moon. But right now it would need to be resupplied from the Earth, like ISS is now. NASA is currently working on closed-loop life support systems that would lead to autonomous lunar bases and long trips in space. -BC.
[Is it possible that there is a planet exactly the same as ours that rotates at the same speed and distance on the other side of the sun.  but we cant see it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgs8ftn?context=5)|No, all the planets are in orbit around the sun, so nothing is ever permanently on the other side of the sun from us. -BC.
[I think you're missing his point! What if it had the same orbital period as our own planet? It would remain hidden from us as we moved, because it would move too, at the same rate.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgsa3qp?context=5)|Oh, I see. Well, it's incredibly unlikely, but also we have sent spacecraft all over with different vantage points, so they would have been able to see it even if it was hidden from our point of view. -BC.
[Where do you think NASA would be in terms of technology if the government had continued the amount of funding that was provided in the 1960's and 70's? Thanks!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgs8un5?context=5)|This is a difficult question (but one many what-if historians enjoy thinking about). The Nation's goals have changed since then, and NASA follows the will of the nation. We have developed a lot of new technologies related to the space shuttle, the International Space Station, and robotic science missions. But, if NASA had had more money, it's probably fair to say that more could have been developed. -BC.
[What time can I exspect to see this over North East Ohio?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgs865q?context=5)|Total eclipse will start at 2:06am eastern, with greatest eclipse at 2:45am eastern  EDIT: forgot to account for DST, sorry! greatest eclipse at 3:45am eastern.
[That's okay, I didn't really want to get up for work tomorrow anyway...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgs9gfe?context=5)|I remember as a kid, making my mom wake me up in the middle of the night to see an eclipse. She swears she did it but I have no memory of it! -RCW.
[It's a plot against having to wake up themselves at 2 in the morning.  ""Of course I woke you up honey, but you were so tired you probably just forgot!""  SHENANIGANS!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgs9z2m?context=5)|She denies it :)
[What would the next steps be for scientists if we discovered life on another planet? Does the Mars Rover even have the technology onboard to check for life?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgs8tni?context=5)|It's very difficult for us to positively identify life on another planet for many reasons - some reasons are cleaning all life off our own detectors, and another is that life may be different. But even if you just mean earth-like life (DNA), we had an experiment on Viking that did not discover any (to the limits of its detection ability) and of course we tested the Apollo rocks extensively and found none. We do keep looking though - life on other planets would surely teach us an enormous amout about both that planet and about our own life and evolution on the Earth. -BC.
[Is it true that the distance between the Earth and the Moon is increasing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgs8skr?context=5)|Yes, but VERY slowly. The interaction between the Earth and Moon causes torques to the Moon, which causes it to essentially ""spend"" its energy. The less energy it has, the farther it moves from the Earth. But it's a slow process - only about 1 cm a year. Nothing to worry about! -BC.
[If the Earth had two moons like Mars, What types of eclipses would we be able to witness? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgs8djm?context=5)|The moons of Mars are much smaller than our Moon, even in relation to the diameter of the parent body. So the moons of Mars don't cover the whole disk of the sun (no solar eclipses from Mars). How the shadow of Mars covers Phobos and Deimos depends on their orbits - I don't know this offhand. -BC 
[What about the moon being in the earth's shadow makes it appear red? Also, is it possible for earth to ever appear in transit across the sun from the surface of Mars? Like Venus can for us?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgs8cje?context=5)|The Earth's shadow is bending the light from the sun, so we see the red part of the spectrum just like you'd see in early sunrise or late sunset. Someone said, it's like seeing all the sunrises and sunsets all at once. I'd have to double-check the orbits, but I bet you could see an Earth transit from Mars. I don't think any of our spacecraft have ever seen that happen, though we have seen Mars' moons transit the sun. -BC.
[Do you or anybody else you know at NASA play Kerbal Space Program?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgsbmbq?context=5)|I don't but I know tons of people who do! -BC.
[If I'm not in group U3-U2 is it worth staying up to see it in all honesty? I'm in the UK so I'll be P1 and that's around 4am. So I'd like to know if it's going to be fairly noticeable or not. Thanks. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgs8kll?context=5)|It'll be in penumbra (outer shadow) as the Moon is setting. So it would only just look slightly dimmer, possibly not noticeable, I'm guessing.
[In an imaginary world where NASA had a much larger budget and you had carte blanche over it, what missions would you fund?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgs9atg?context=5)|All of them? -RCW.

[As I understand, tonight will begin the tetrad (four total lunar eclipses in a row\) Exactly how rare is this?

It's very exciting work to me because I get to understand other planets without even going there. I work like a geologist - but instead of mapping and studying earth rocks, I use rocks from other planets and study them in the same way. This winter I participated in finding new meteorites - which are pieces of rock from other worlds. It is a big thrill to discover a new meteorite and wonder where it came from! -BC.

So we have been thinking of bases near the poles, where the temperature is colder (-50C) all the time but doesn't vary much. There are some places near the poles that are on mountain peaks and see the sun all of the time, so that would be good for solar power at a base. These places also can see the Earth much of the time, which is good for communication. Finally, they are within reach of unexplored territory near the poles and the far side, so that's good for science. -BC.
[Question for Renee Weber from an aspiring geologist/seismologist: based on what we already know, what is your best guess on what we might find when we bring seismometers to Mars?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgs9qq4?context=5)|I would guess, verification that Mars is stratified like Earth (crust, mantle, core), some information on the properties of the crust (fractionation, density, properties relevant to transmission of seismic energy like wave speed velocity and attenuation). We might be lucky to record landslides or meteorite impacts - the potential for a good science return from that type of event is higher because the location can be verified with satellite imagery.

Understanding the size and state of a core (whether it is solid or liquid), and the seismic properties of a body (such as the speeds at which seismic waves are transmitted, the density and porosity of the layers, etc) tell you a lot about how that particular planet formed and evolved.  We only have data from the Earth and the Moon right now, and that's why I'm interested in sending seismometers to other planets. We're sending one to Mars in 2016! -RCW.

No shading indicates that the entire eclipse from beginning to end will be visible; full shading means that none of the eclipse will be visible. Partial shading indicates that the Moon will either rise already eclipsed, or set before the eclipse is over.

Why will the moon appear red tonight?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/230o8j/tonight_is_a_total_lunar_eclipse_were_nasa/cgsorqt?context=5)|The Moon appears red because light from the sun is scattered as it travels through the Earth's atmosphere.

The largest tides occur when the Sun and the Moon are in the same direction in the sky relative to Earth - that would be during a solar eclipse. But it's the position of the bodies in their orbits that causes the tides, not the eclipse itself. -RCW

  Anyhow, I work in sales, but I'm going to college for a degree in computer science so I'd like to think I'm somewhat competent when it comes to fixing computers. As an aside, I had an old C2D machine because I'm in college and it was inexpensive.  
  
My manager came up to me one day and said ""hey, my computer keeps randomly shutting off all the time. I think it's broken"". The way he described the problem, I suspected nothing more was broken on it than a bad hard drive, so I offered to have him bring it to work and I'd take it home and try to fix it. Long story short, he ended up just buying a new laptop, but he offered to sell me his old rig for $60, as he didn't really want or need it anymore. The machine was custom built by a friend of his and had an Intel core i7-920, 4GB of Corsair Dominator RAM, a gigabyte mobo with 2 PCIE x16 slots and a 9800GTX+ (which is old as sin, but I'm sure I could find something to do with it).   
  
  Anyways, I connected the motherboard to my power supply because I thought his PSU could also possibly be the problem, stick in a linux boot disc and voila, the thing POSTs, boots, and handles a linux installation. I gutted my old computer, dropped in his old motherboard and CPU combo and ~two weeks later, the thing still runs smooth as butter.

I've been interning at this small agency for the past 8 months and, because I'm graduating, they just offered me a position to keep writing for them. Regardless of this, I had plans to stay where I am because a) I don't think moving back home is a very productive idea b) I have a decent amount of clout here that'll come in handy when I work on personal portfolio things c) my writing partner and best friend has one more year to graduate and I really would like to stick around with him. 

My logical brain is telling me to take the position because it's a pretty solid gig and, frankly, it's not like I have a lot of other offers on the table. Staying here could be good for displaying longevity and any agency experience is better than no agency experience. Besides, I plan on leaving this city as soon as this year is up. What's a year?

My creative/emotional brain, however, is telling me to blow this popsicle stand ASAP. The people I work with are great, but the work this particular agency does is not my cup of tea. Our clients are largely conservative small business owners that aren't very openminded to newer marketing approaches. As an intern at this agency, I have to write a lot of web and social media content that tends to be on the more bland side of things. A lot of my content has low amounts of traffic because my audience is so small and so disconnected from social media. I'm not sure getting paid to do this will make things any better. I'd hate to not be able to work on things I'm more passionate about because I'm busy making lousy Facebook posts.

There is another, more nationally recognized, agency in town that I could potentially work for, but there is no promise of being able to secure anything. If I did manage to land something, it'd likely be unpaid and possibly unproductive for my portfolio. Despite this, the work would be a lot more exciting, creative, and in line with the kind of things I ultimately want to do. 

I'm in a heck of a pickle.

Any input here?

Thanks!"

1. During my degree I have to do 3 internships (optional 4th one). I was wondering if it is possible to submit internship applications to companies in the U.S. and expect a response from them.

2. What would be the best way to land an interview with one of the big 4 (whether it's internship/full-time job offer) ?

3. In know Google has an HQ in Montreal, what would would be the advantages of interning/working there instead of the one in Mountain View ?

This subreddit has been insanely helpful so I just want to say **thank you** before I even begin.

Alright, here's the issue:

I landed a good internship at an advertising agency in NYC this summer. As I said earlier, I've been building up my wardrobe this past fall/winter, but as the weather is getting nicer I'm quickly realizing that I don't like a lot of the stuff I have for the summer. It's mostly stuff from high school (band/graphic t-shirts) and I kinda feel like a kid whenever I wear them. 

I've come to really like this sort of [americana style](http://www.fashionising.com/trends/b--americana-menswear-63378.html), and I think it fits for the Northeast area of the US I live in. What I'm having trouble doing is transitioning this style over to the summer. It gets really hot here June-August so pants/long sleeve button downs don't really seem to be an option. 

I'm also having trouble with shoes. I bought a pair of [Katahdin Mocs](http://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/74748?page=mens-katahdin-iron-works-boots-moc-toe) last November that I was basically living in, and the transition back to sneakers seems kinda weird. I was looking at these [Blucher Mocs](http://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/11575?page=mens-handsewn-moccasins-blucher-moc) but I'm not sure how well they'd go with shorts. I was trying to avoid boat shoes since I'm not sure the preppy look is for me, but I'm open to anything at this point.

**TL;DR: Rising senior looking for a slightly more adult wardrobe for a summer internship. Pants/long sleeve shirts are a no go as it gets very hot/humid in NYC during the summer.**

Sorry for the lengthy post. Let me if there's any more info you guys would need and thank you in advance! You'll be helping me not look like an idiot this summer."

231mb7,76,2014-04-14,[UPDATE] I [20 F] need to tell my quadriplegic Dad [46 M] that I got a job.,notinsidethehouse,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/231mb7/update_i_20_f_need_to_tell_my_quadriplegic_dad_46/,"[original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ux7wk/i_20_f_need_to_tell_my_quadriplegic_dad_46_m_that/)

First off, I'd really like to thank everyone who commented on my original post.  It was a topic I'd never explained to anyone before. I know it was a while ago, but I thought I'd post an update since there was a bit of response... I know this is a less dramatic and immediate dilemma than most who post on here, so I'll keep it short.

In short, everything has improved dramatically.  Following reddit's advice, when I got back to school in January I sought out counselling through the university.  I've been meeting with a counselor weekly this semester.

At first, I felt extremely uncomfortable and weird trying to explain not just the relationship I have with my Dad, but related anxiety and emotions.  Basically, my counselor admitted that he had no expertise in family cases like mine, but we have ended up talking a lot about, and working through, personal issues of competency, emotional-independence, and overall anxiety.  

Many things have happened in the last few months, and I feel like I've matured a lot.  I've been happier too... which I credit to keeping the part-time job and for the first time having a personal income.  

All this growth of self-respect and independence culminated this week when I had to start making real decisions about what I'm going to do this summer.  My Dad called and started pressuring me for exact dates and times for plane tickets, although I still have over a month left.  I very cautiously told him that we should wait on plane tickets until I knew exactly when I would be in town. He became very upset and angry about me implying that the dates and times would not, in fact, encompass the whole summer.

For the first time in my life, his anger and distress didn't immediately fill me with deep-wrenching guilt and the need to comfort him.  Instead, I took the steps to finalize my decisions... I put in a deposit for a room I'm renting in my college town (I toured it, it's ideal and affordable), talked to my supervisor at work about summer hours, and applied for four other jobs just in case.  (I decided against the internship in Vietnam, which feels a little bit like a shame, but I just love the idea of having nothing to do but work and play in wonderful weather...)  

After talking with my counselor and adviser, I sent out an email to all my family members updating them on my credits, my graduation path, life in general, etc... i included a paragraph about my intention to work and live on my own for the summer.  From my mom, grandparents, brother, and stepdad, the response was overwhelming love and support.  I had forgotten, or not realized ever, maybe, just how much I'm loved and able to talk to my family.

The response from my dad was overwhelmingly negative.  I called him, and on the phone he was distant, unresponsive, and sulky.  He had nothing good to say about my email (even though I'm on track to graduate in only 3 years, and am maintaining a high honors GPA!), and instead, after almost an hour of coaxing and idle, tense chit-chat, told me, in a voice just on the edge of a ""rage,"": ""if it was up to me, you'd be here the whole summer.""  

I'm really proud of myself here, reddit. My immediate instinct was to compromise, shift my tone of voice, do whatever I could to calm him down... Instead, I took a breath and calmly explained to him that I needed to do what was best for me- that I would rather work to break even with rent than not work, and have nothing to do (but be there for him)... that I already had a room, that I was looking forward to it... but most of all, I used a tone of voice that was not too-careful, too is-this-okay? There was no argument.  For the first time, he was upset, I was responsible, and I was not falling apart to please and ease him.

The phone call inevitably ended badly, but last night I called him and asked him to turn on Skype. 
**edit:** occurred to me to expand here... after our bad phone convo, he called and left a message at a time he knew I was in class and wouldn't answer... instead of listening to the voicemail, I waited to call back until I was home, and then called him and was like ""I'm in front of my computer, are you in front of yours?""
We skyped for almost two hours, in which I, as lightheartedly and familiarly as possible, asked him about his day, about his work, how it was going, how he was doing... it was wonderful. He chatted back at me, and every so often would drop an emotional ""hook,"" which I wouldn't respond to. My summer plans didn't come up until the end of the conversation, in which I was once again firm, sure, and removed from his terrible guilt-trip. I think, seeing me over skype talk about it, and smile about it, even while he was inadvertently trying to get to me, changed his mind about the whole thing.  I never imagined how much me not catering to his emotional neediness, would improve my ability to actually have a relationship with him.  It was definitely a step in a new and good direction- he told me he would support me in whatever decision I made, as long as I knew that he missed me horribly.

I came to the realization, thinking about that conversation, that I may never really be able to be my dad's daughter. But as an adult, and as adults who can update each other on their lives and share their feelings without a deep, knot-like obligation to 'deal' with them... I think we may finally form some kind of equal relationship.

In other words reddit, the last few months have been a huge success!  And it definitely started with me posting here. Thank you.

---   
**tl;dr**: Sought counseling and self-improvement to deal with my quadriplegic and emotionally dependent dad, who has resisted me getting a job or living independently since that takes time away from him... Finally was able to talk to him as an equal, force him to accept my plans, and have a real, healthy conversation. "

I've been told I should dress ""business professional."" I'm assuming that means a suit, so I'm planning on purchasing that this week. I'm prepared to spend about $200-300 for this one but probably not much more.

Where can I get a good suit for a lowish price like that? Do I even need to spend that much? Also I am tall and skinny (6'0"" and 150 lbs), so I've always preferred a slimmer fit on the pants. Does that mean I should account for getting it tailored or the pants taken in?

Also on the topic of shoes... I still have the same dress shoes I've had since I was 15 so I think it might be time to replace those as well. Any suggestions on where to buy/ how much to spend?

I live in pittsburgh and the places that come to mind that are near me are macys, burlington coat factory, jcrew, banana republic, jos. a bank, mens wearhouse...

Any and all suggestions (including general suggestions about how I should dress for this interview) would be greatly appreciated!"

231uyz,2,2014-04-14,About Flatlining...,IrishP,NoFap,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/231uyz/about_flatlining/,"WARNING; there are possible triggers ahead. I try not to talk to much about my sex life, but I can't keep in all details, I must get them out.

EDIT- A little misleading title. I went on a rant that was supposed to be about how it was good that I passed up sex, as I almost had it at the beginning of my flatline. The flatline is pretty much ED leaving your body. 




I want to take all of you back to my 24th day of abstaining from pornography, masturbation, and orgasm. 

I woke up on a Friday heading for a new city to see an awesome band. The city is only two hours away, so my friend and I headed out after class. We went to see one of the most awesome concerts that I've ever seen. 

Before we went up, I decided that I would stay with a girl who is a friend, that I happened to be quite into. Even though we flirted a lot, I never made it clear how I felt. She was out, and I got in at an extremely late hour. After a long day of traveling, I noticed I was sick. This was bad, since the girl texted me telling her it was going to be just us at her place. 

I knew that she wanted to have sex with me. I can tell you right now I was dying to have sex with her. After 24 days of abstaining, I hit a conundrum on the way over there. I remember not thinking about it too much, that either way I would do my thing. Finally, I arrive at her place. 

She was out, so she was a little tipsy. She had on a shirt, and no pants. She was extremely tired when I talked to her on the phone. We decide quickly that it's time for bed. She tells me that I can sleep in either of her roommates rooms, on the couch, or in her bed. I take her bed. When I get in, I said ""I promise not to invade your personal space"". It was one of the most awkward comments I could have made. 

She says to me as I'm getting in, ""SO, was that a lie?"" I tell her no, take a side of the bed, and go to sleep. 

I was up all night thinking about what an idiot I was. I could have had what I wanted from nofap, and have arrived at the destination. I felt like I made a pussy move, not granting myself what I wanted. 

Eventually I fall asleep, when I have an idea; I have all day with her tomorrow. That wasn't me being a pussy back there; it would be totally pussy of me not to tell her at some point tomorrow how I feel, and that I was sick but still wanted her. 

I remember when she woke up, I dropped my voice to the most baritone I could, because I remembered the night before part of my problem was in speaking with a high pitch. She was totally into it, we just enjoyed each other's company in the morning. It was totally easy to move on from the ""mistake"" that I made the night before, once the sun came up. It was a new day, and a day I promised myself to prosper. 

We spent an amazing day together, when we came to a park. I will never forget how awkward and intimidated I was, it was extremely uncomfortable. But eventually, I put my arm around her and say, ""I want to kiss you really badly right now, but I'm sick"". Before I say anything back, she leans her head into my shoulder. Probably the best feeling ever. 

Now I've made out with a bunch of girls before, had some drunken sex, and got a few blowjobs when I was at parties. Let me tell you something-doing something that you feel like you need to be drunk to do when you're sober is incredibly worthwhile. You feel as though you are not only overcoming your dependence on alcohol to lubricate the way you express your intentions, but you also gain the ability to speak truthfully and deal with real women and not hyper-real sex. The way she reacted was one of the most worthwhile things I've seen in NoFap. 

Now looking back, I think that I probably would have had sex with her under different circumstances. If I was with her a week earlier, I would have. If I was with her, not sick, and had spent some time with her before going back to her place, I would have. But it was an awkward situation in the first place, as I had been awkward in expressing my intentions to her. I arrived late at night. Her roommates weren't there, so I thought that she told them to stay out while she bring a guy back. It's pretty obvious she wanted to have sex with me right then and there, but there were a few reasons not to. I was not drunk, she was. That is technically rape, even though I trust her not to get me in trouble with the law. We were both tired. I was sick, even though I used that to rationalize why I didn't go for it. 

I'm now flatlining. It was probably for the best that we didn't have sex, because I probably still have ED. It would have been some wham, bam, thank you ma'am. Gone in the morning. Forgotten forever. 

But now I'm looking forward to her returning. I have improved myself since I left. I now have a job (or at least an interview, which is looking good, and I interviewed for another internship), I've read more books, I'm leaving a lot of the things that I've been so attached to behind. I'm only getting stronger with each day of NoFap.

The point of this post is that you can do two things; be rational, or you can rationalize. We all do this, and are unaware of it. I was actually being quite rational back there if you ask me. I did not want to get her sick. I knew that having sex right then and there was a bad idea. I passed up sex with a beautiful girl, something that many people here and elsewhere would say is ""pussying"" out. But you know what? It doesn't matter. I didn't get laid. So the fuck what. I could have so fucking easily, if I just went for it. I got my validation. I didn't get satisfaction.

But yet, by waiting I think that this fruit will grow into a bigger bush. I have a great feeling about the future. I believe that the decision I made was for the absolute best. I know that when she comes back at around day 140, I am going to be ready for her. I just have to commit to the goddess of NoFap before I can give everything to this girl. Because she is fucking awesome. She is beautiful. She is incredibly intelligent. She is super cultured. I learn so much from being with her. I enjoy things much more when she's around. And I'm really looking forward to getting to know her better. "

2328lq,6,2014-04-14,"Pre-Employment Background Check, Employment Discrepancies - Should I be worried?",oasis01322,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2328lq/preemployment_background_check_employment/,"So I've had two phone interviews and an on-site interview with a company I applied to last November. The first phone interview was last December, the on-site interview was in March, and the follow-up phone interview was a couple of weeks ago at the beginning of April.

Last week they asked me to do a background check through a third-party background check provider. I just got the results back today and there were two discrepancies with my employment (everything else was fine though).

One discrepancy was that for the end date of my internship last summer, I put 8/29/2013 (a Thursday). The company I interned at told the third-party that I left on 8/30/2013 (a Friday). They were on a 9/80 schedule and my last working day was on a Thursday before an off-Friday, so I put that Thursday as the end date instead of that Friday.

The other discrepancy was that I indicated I was still employed at my last job, which I left in the middle of March.

The thing is, I provided the information the third-party used for the background check back in February. The company I applied to made me fill out an application form with my education, employment history, etc. in February before the on-site interview in March. So at the time, I was still working at that job and the information I gave about that job was correct.

When the third-party actually performed the background check, I was no longer at that job. Thus, they marked it as a discrepancy.

Should I be worried about these discrepancies when all the other parts of my background check were fine? Should I try to contact HR to tell them that the background check company used outdated information?"

Come to find out, that a book my boss is going to publish, (a workbook style book) is basically another workbook but reformatted and words tweaked here and there.

I've already been making arrangements to leave this company quietly and with no burned bridges.

Where is the line in plagiarism? How close is too close to the original article? Am I duty-bound to report plagiarism if I think it's been done intentionally/unintentionally?

Also, What can I do to protect myself from being tied to something I had nothing to do with? How can I avoid being the scapegoat ""intern"" should my boss get caught? How can I keep my boss from retroactively putting my name on the book because of my editing and cover art?

I signed an explicitly non-binding contract for an internship this summer with a data management company with the expectation that I would not receive any more offers. I just got a call today from a different company that is more involved in robotics which is a field I'm definitely more interested in exploring than data management. Is it good form to even consider an internship at the latter company? From what I've heard from friends, it is in bad taste to entertain other companies after you've signed anything that indicates that you'll work for a company that has given you an offer. Opinions?"

I recently accepted an internship--this will be my first CS internship. It was my first offer in a pretty long and draining process of trying to find an internship. It pays $30 and hour and to be honest I think that number played a big part in swaying me. I was so happy to have found and internship and impressed by the salary that I canceled an interview at another company. I probably would have gone anyway--but I had a lot of class work to do and it was a full-day interview. I think its possible that the company whose interview I cancelled may have a better environment--but I also knew it probably didn't pay as much. Did I make a terrible decision? This has been weighing on me for a while. I think the fact that I really don't know what the hell I want out of a CS career led me to use money as a determining factor."
232dcl,0,2014-04-14,BSMET major with decent GPA. I have time next year for a math minor. Should I do it?,[deleted],engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/232dcl/bsmet_major_with_decent_gpa_i_have_time_next_year/,"I'm a junior in my third year with a 3.25 overall and a 3.64 in major GPA majoring in Mechanical Engineering Technology. I have a minor in Manufacturing Technology declared already that will not be an issue. I am ahead of schedule with my classes and my major requires i think 10 hours of ""technical electives"". With my minor, I think there will be 5 left for next. Well to get a minor in Math at my school, I only need 7? more hours of math credits above a 143 level math classes. These credits will count towards my tech electives. I spoke with my advisor today, and he thought it was a good idea. 

The three classes he suggested were:
* Matrix Algebra (2 hrs) - mixed signals from people
* Elementary Statistics (3 hrs) - everyone says its easy
* Calculus 3 (3 hrs) - I've heard its much easier than calc 2 at my school.

My math skills are decent, but I can do anything I set my mind to. I am worried I will get a C in Matrix Algebra and drop my GPA a tad (only 2 hours). I think I can get A's or B's at least in the other two. 
BTW, this semester, I'm taking 19.5 hours, and currently have A's in all of them. Hoping to graduate with around a 3.5.

My logic here is: I have heard the debate against BSME vs. BSMET and have a pretty good idea of the strengths and weaknesses of each. I am hoping that these extra classes will help with my current weaknesses upon graduating, and companies will see my resume and say, ""Oh, just another BSMET, he can't handle real engineering.. But wait! He has a minor in math, some club activities, and an internship, maybe I am wrong. Lets set up an interview.""

Am I wrong? How valuable is a minor in math? My school has great job placement, especially with someone with a 3.25 GPA, but the problem is they are all midwest positions. I have lived in the plains my entire life, and my goal is to not only get a great job in a year, but in a more exciting location. Ideally aerospace position in Colorado. I have great family and friends in the Kansas City area, but I'm looking for a change.

We're both 24. I'm finishing Paramedic school in a month and then I will be done. No more ""working"" 60-72 hours in a week (normal schedule will be 48 hours 3x per week but I'm doing my internship) it's rough and she's a nurse and also works 3 days a week.  

I'm basically trying to wrap my head around this depression that she has. She won't see a physician, go to a marriage counselor or see a psychiatrist. Her only response to when I ask her or try to talk to her about it is, ""I don't know"" or ""just everything""  

I don't understand what depresses her. We're about to move into a rental home in a nicer area that is closer to her family and mine, our current place is basically ghetto (no offense but I work this district and it's ghetto) and I'm about to finish school giving me more time at home.

It's driving me nuts because she won't talk about it and I don't nag her about it because it does no good. We're also in a dead bedroom and maybe have sex once a month and she's recently told me she hates having sex. (she's not cheating she's too lazy to go out or cover anything up and this isn't new)  

Maybe I'm shallow or young and stupid but I feel like I'm too young to waste my 20s with someone like this. Everything was great (kind of) before hand but then we got married and then depression. It's the shittiest feeling in the whole world. I married someone and caused them to become depressed. I'm to the point of calling it quits but I do love her and she does mean the world to me. Just like she's not happy (which I've also asked her what she is un happy about and same response as above) but it's also making me unhappy. I'm constantly led on that we will be intimate or that she says she wants to be intimate then nothing. I don't know what to do anymore

I just have a few quick questions for you guys over here at r/accounting! :)

1) Which qualification would you say is the most well respected/rewarding for a successful career in finance/accounting?

2) What advice would you give to a new intern? Would creating a LinkedIn account before starting be beneficial or would you, as an employee of the firm for example, find it strange for an intern to add you on LinkedIn?

3) Are there any accountants here who have worked for a utility? If so, how was it? Pretty generic question but I'm curious.

| | 

&gt;&gt;My background
I will try to keep this short.  I had a rough time in my teens and it weighed on me heavily.  I became extremely withdrawn from social interaction and believe I was living with Major Depression (Clinical Depression).  I was never diagnosed, but, met regularly (almost daily) with my schools child and youth counsellor, and twice with her supervisor at the board office. This 'treatment' did not help with the depression, but, I feel as if it helped me avoid attempts at self-harm/subside.

&gt;&gt;Then I was off to College, leaving everything else behind and starting over.  In the beginning I found it extremly difficult to meet people and have casual conversations. I would never approach anyone, and was always looking for a reason to leave and be alone.  This was not what I wanted to happen, so I forced myself to be social with the people in my dorm.  This started as me quietly sitting off to the side (ie- Raj from the Big Bang Theory when a girl is around).  As a way to combat this I began to drink.  It started off as 'normal' college drinking, but when others would tell me how much fun I was when I was drunk, I drank more and more frequently. This went on for about two years, and by the end I was a daily drinker.... I guess an alcoholic. I was not as depressed, but I was no where near happy or even content.

&gt;&gt;That summer I did an internship, which I took seriously.  It kept me busy, and I only drank a handful of nights in those 4 months. I recognized I had a problem with alcohol and decided to avoid it.  The same cycle repeated, but this time I began smoking pot daily and drinking when at bars/parties (1,2 times a month).  The pot felt better for my health, but I was still depressed, and for 3 years I was high daily, smoking multiple times a day.  I would not interact with people unless I was high (everything from work to parties to grocery shopping).

&gt;&gt;It has been 3 years since then; I very rarely smoke or drink now. This is easy because I have almost 0 interaction with people.  I work from home, I live alone, and I move to a different city 3/4 times a year.  I tell my family and other that I move around because I like to see new places, but in reality, it is just a reason for me to justify being alone. The loneliness really started to effect me, and I could feel myself slipping back into a serious bought of Major Depression. I am going to skip some details now and just say that I am really close, or already addicted to cocaine. It started last summer, casually and but I have being using daily for over a month. 

||
:--|:--:|--:
| | 

&gt;&gt;The weekend that just passed, I consumed what I would consider to be a very large amount of cocaine. From Friday around 8pm-Monday around 9am, I had about 6 hours of sleep, and when I was awake I 'dosed' at least once an hour.  I am not a stupid person, I know this is very serious and I am slowly killing myself, and was probably close to overdosing on the weekend. 

&gt;&gt;My fear is what comes next.  I do not feel the euphoria from taking it.  This is why I first started. It was a way for me to be feel energetic, be happy, and easily talk to people. It is difficult to put into words; it allowed me to be who I felt like I was on the inside, I was the person who I wanted to be. Now after my first hit I get an energy rush, and then every hit after that is just me delaying the crash. I am worried that when I stop (I am moving again next week, and will not be able to locate it) I am going to hurt myself; either physically as the depression takes over (which will be compounded by withdrawal) or, I will find a new dealer and will start again...or even worse move on to something heavier (my history points to escalating risks).

||
:--|:--:|--:
| | 

&gt;I asked the above question because   

**I have done a lot of research on the internet. More than a quick google and wikipedia read.  I have spent hours and hours reading sites, blogs, boards, news articles, journal articles**   
&gt;about they types of depression, types of anxiety and treatment options.  

&gt;Based on how I feel during my times of sobriety (sober for months at a time),  

**I am convinced that I have depression.**
&gt;It is hard for me to determine the narrow type, I think I have Dysthymia, and at times will have Major Depression Episodes.  There is probably some socially anxiety type of disorder mixed in as an side effect of the depression.

||
:--|:--:|--:
| | 

&gt;&gt;I have decided (aka scared myself) to finally seek proper treatment.  I want to stop now before I completely loose control, but, I know if I require more than therapy and am looking to be prescribed something.  Ideally, I will have both psychological and pharmaceutical routes. I have looked into SSRIs, but am conceded with the side-effects, and, believe that Bupropion will be a better option for me. However, I am willing to try whichever the doctor thinks is best.

But I Think I did not add it to be called like that on the host computer for the printer and left it as the standard HP printer name but I still configured it with the correct driver and IP adress..

Does that not matter or do they have to be identical?
Or am I just overcomplicating things, just want to make sure since Nothing is really logical when dealing with printers.

Am I?",Gladrias,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/2338cu/im_23m_thinking_about_breaking_up_with_my_gf_23f/,"Sorry for the long post. 

**Context:**
Me (23m) and my gf (23f) have been together for 6 years. We met at a bar when we were both 17 (legal drinking age here was 16) and graduating from different high-schools at the time. I started flirting with her and a week later we had a date. On that date we started the relationship. I was her first boyfriend, while I already had 2 really short, sexual relationships. 

When we were 18 we decided to live together, because we already did at her and my parents house, and I really wanted to leave my parents. We were both in university at that time.
After my 19th birthday, she got really depressed. She disliked the neighborhood and really missed her parents and sister (they only lived a 20 min bicycle ride away) and was thinking about dropping out of her course. Our sex-live turned from active to nonexistent at this time, for the first time. 

She decided that she wanted to move back in with her parents. Leaving me on my own in the apartment, but we didn’t break up. 

I got really bored  and lonely and I didn't take good care of myself. 
In the weekends she would come over, and those really where good times. Because I missed her every week, it was really nice to see her in the weekends. I lived a strange life back then, depressed during the week, and as happy as ever in the weekends. Our relationship and our sex-live peeked in those weekends. 

Close to her 21st birthday we decided that we wanted to live together again, in another apartment, another neighborhood and within a 5 minute walking distance to her and my parents house. And for about half a year our relationship was the same as it was when we were living apart form each other. 

That’s when our sex live turned nonexistent again. I confronted her about this, without blaming her. She tried to think about it more, or let me get her turned on more often and we even tried some things to spice our sex live up a bit, that really helped.
 
About half a year ago things have changed again, and for the worse. 

**Here are the problems:**

*we really live alongside each other now*


* i’m working on a graduation project, a start up and I do freelance work 


* she’s working as an intern, follows classes, has a parttime job and is a very active moderator for a healthy lifestyle community


* when I’m with her (at home) she’s really obsessed with her phone (moderating and social media i guess)


* we only get to have one evening to spend together other than falling asleep next to each other because


   * our friday-evening turned into a weekly visit of her younger sister (18) which I have to stay home for


   * she plans our saturday-evenings by going to mutual friends or to her parents house (although I want to plan an evening together for months now)


*bad sex-live*


* we only have sex twice a month and what we did to spice things up, is not going to happen anymore


* she makes fun of my sexual urges, like i am the bad guy for having them


* the circumstances have to be perfect for her


* she lacks experience and won’t try new things anymore


* sometimes sex only leads to me making her cum, without her doing anything for me (the other way around is even out of the question)


*she has terrible double standards with me*

**example 1:** at sunday she wants to go to bed early because she has riste at six in the morning on monday (she works as an intern on monday and tuesday) and she leaves me to do the dishes,  feed the cats, scoop the cat-litter, while I have to get up at six in the morning too (and unlike her I have to rise at six all of the working week). When I confront her about this, she just doesn’t see what’s wrong with this. 

**example 2:** she works at saturday and sunday, so I have to do the groceries and housecleaning, although she’s mostly free on thursday and friday. I asked her frequently if she could do the housecleaning if she has those days off. The only problem is that I always have to ask her

I really don't know what I want anymore. I have a feeling I've tried fixing our relationship enough. I still love her, but I'm afraid what the future will bring. If our relationship is so bad right now, how will it be 10 years from now? 


**tl;dr:** we hardly have compassionate moments anymore. it seems like she's not interested in me anymore too. Am I right by wanting to break up with her?

I've tried talking with her but she dismisses the problems with excuses. Formatting edited thanks to: Falco98"

As the title says - I'm potentially going to be looking to quit my steady low-lever managerial role in a telecommunications company in the UK to become a self employed web developer contractor/freelancer for one sole company that I worked for during my internship whilst at university. 

I'm currently in the research stage, looking at the best/easiest/cheapest way to accomplish something that's mutual benefical for both the US company and myself. 

I'm currently on £24,000 + company car (no fuel), and the US company have said that my salary of £30,000 ($50,000) is within their budget, so I could potentially earn more that £30,000. 

I have a friend who works for Parasol Group (an umbrella company) and she swears by them. I've also looked into this route, and although it's likely to be the more costlier route, it's both easier/less hassle than becoming a Sole Trader or LTD company as I know there's a lot of paper work, and I'd have to save 1/3 of my monthly salary, and pay all my tax in one lump sum.

My only concern with the US company is that they would need to pay me in GBP if I were to take the Umbrella company route, which I don't think is possible (they're a small digital agency in the midwest). 

Which route would you recommend? This opportunity is too good to miss, and I just want to get all my options laid out before I make a decision. 

I'm just wondering if anyone has any advice, or has done something similar? 

Anything would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!"

I want to do a PhD in computational neuroscience (leaning towards high-dimensional statistics) in the US and that's been my dream ever since I started university. The last of applications were depressing and now I'm wondering what 'else' I can do to improve my chances.

I've graduated from a liberal arts and sciences in college in Europe, associated with a good research school. I got a fair GPA 3.75 with a very strong upward trend in my last year. Had a half-year stint at a top research university in the US, where I took grad courses, but couldn't get an internship. I spent the last 2 years working as an RA, because I couldn't afford a MSc. I published 2 papers as first author in Neuron. They don't exactly match my interests as they are in biophysical models. I'm going to a conference, a computational neuroscience summer school and I'm networking as much as I can.

Now, this shouldn't be too bad, but the competition for the PhD's I'm interested in is insane. Five hundred people, 10-15 spots and at most 2 spots for internationals. I've tried last year and I didn't even make it to the interviews. What can I do to make myself more competitive?

I took the GRE and got V170 Q166. Should I take a subject GRE?

Can I apply for funding independently of the department? I could only think of the Fullbright, but my national division of the organization refuses to even consider my candidacy, because I studied abroad. Are there any other scholarships for international students?

I've been accepted at couple of paid MSc in Germany and Switzerland but I worry they won't improve my chances for a PhD and furthermore I'm already quite old so I'll be done with the MSc's at age 27. Could my age be a hurdle? Is it wise to start one of the MSc's and apply concurrently for a PhD? Will dropping an MSc have 'repercussions'?

TL;DR: Why won't they love me?

I understand that companies look at more than just GPA, I just feel that my resume would get through more quick screenings by companies if I had GPA on it. I've gotten two internships so far, but I've had problems getting interviews from bigger companies.

Thanks for reading."
234by8,11,2014-04-15,I'm [19 F] starting to resent my boyfriend [21 M].,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/234by8/im_19_f_starting_to_resent_my_boyfriend_21_m/,"Like the title says, I've been recently feeling really resentful towards my boyfriend lately. I love him to bits and I intend to stay with him but I'm really having a hard time trying to stifle these feelings. 

It starts off with my parents. Whenever I talk to one of them, especially my dad, and tell them that I'm doing something, the first thing they ask is if he's coming with me. Ever since I started at college, they've basically drilled it in my head that he should be with me at all times. I'm very independent (I get it from my mother so I'm not sure why she's treating me this way) so this takes a huge toll on me. Yesterday, when I called my dad and casually mentioned that I was going out with my coworkers, the first thing he asked is if my boyfriend was coming. I said no and that my boyfriend often hangs out with his coworkers and I'm never invited. My dad (jokingly) said that it was different, but I think it was the straw that broke the camel's back. I feel like he's more of my babysitter than anything. Even my roommates question it when he's not there some nights during the week. It's like I can't even spend a night or two alone. I love that everyone loves him, but I can't stand how suffocated I feel by the situation.

This past weekend was the first full weekend (Friday morning to Monday night) we've been apart in about a year. We both had to work. It honestly felt great. I'm looking forward to it happening again this weekend and I'm even considering going home for a few days, so we'd really be apart from Friday morning to about Tuesday or Wednesday night. I was able to clean my room this weekend (he's really messy when he's over and I hate that) and relax by myself and do a bit of shopping. It was great. Things are a little better now that I have my own car since I don't have to rely on him for rides or ask for permission to use his car, but I still feel like I can't go anywhere without bringing him along or telling him, even if I'm just going to the grocery store. He does things all the time without telling me but it's like I'm not allowed to do that. Once, last year, I went out clubbing for the first time with a few friends and he barely spoke to me for two days. He ruined the first good night I'd had in weeks. I don't feel like he's controlling or anything, he just breathes down my neck too much sometimes.

Now, on top of feeling like he's my babysitter, I'm starting to resent him for his job situation. He works (and is paid for) about 30 hours/week, and actually does about 15 hours worth of work. I currently work about 40 hours a week, and with all that I do, I'm paid for 16 hours worth of overnight shifts. It's obviously not anyone's fault and I'm trying to find another job, but it sucks. It's not like the money really makes a difference. We both get enough financial aid to be able to survive without jobs, but it makes me so upset that I do so much and get so little back from it. Don't get me wrong, I love what I do, but the day he told me he was gonna start getting paid for what was supposed to be a volunteer position, I honestly broke down. 

It's not like he's stingy with his money either; he often takes me out or gets me little surprises, but I don't know. I feel bad that I can't pull my own weight often. I should be making more than him with all I do and I'm not.

Like, right now, he's out to lunch when he should be at his his internship. I'm taking a brief respite from doing admin work and grading papers at my internship to get this all out before I start to cry. A lot of it comes down to feeling like he'll get into graduate school for the program we're both in because, on paper, his internship is better than all the fieldwork and internships I do. I have a higher GPA and I'm good at standardized testing, but it feels like none of that even matters. 

Sorry for making this so long. Thanks for reading though.

Edit: I've tried to talk to him about this, but it's never been easy for me to get the point across. I need tips on how yo address this. 


TL;DR I'm feeling resentful towards my boyfriend of two years because I feel like he doesn't deserve his salary and he treats me like a child he babysits. "

A little bit of back story first: I graduated in December of 2013 with a BA in Philosophy from a very good university.  I have been interested in programming for over a year and considered changing my major but I did not want to be stuck in school for another 3 years to round out my CS degree.  

I have been speaking with alumni who work in developer positions and other programmers, and the more I read and hear about the field the more I fall in love with it.  I can simply think of nothing else that I would rather be doing.

Thus, I have set the goal of becoming a developer in NYC.  I will be moving there in September, and want to use the time inbetween to develop enough skill to perhaps be taken on as an intern at a company, and using this to break into the field.

I was hoping for some advice on what languages to study in the meantime in order to be a great candidate for an internship.  I was going to focus heavily on Javascript and Ruby, and try to build a solid personal portfolio before September.  Then, once in the city, I plan on attending the weekly meetups for startups and tech companies to pitch my skills and build connections - and hopefully get some work as a developer.  

Thus, my questions revolve around whether the above sounds like a good plan, and what languages you would all recommend to study.

If any of you are involved in the tech scene in NYC, what skills to you see as being the most in demand currently, and what do you predict to be the most in demand in 6 months?  

Thank you all so much for your time and effort.  The FAQ has been immensely helpful on beginning this journey, and I know your words will help immensely as well.  

Best,

ontherise89"

I graduated this December with a BS in CS from a pretty decent/known school. However, during that time, I never built up a resume or had any impressive internships, which left my job search not yielding too many results. My goal was to work in NYC doing software engineering for a modern web company, but my lack of personal projects was probably my reason for lack of interview opportunities. I took a job in the ""IT"" section of a major corporation, which has turned out to be completely unrelated to my degree.

I saw an ad for App Academy - whose high average salary and job acceptance rate seemed almost too good to be true. A couple interviews later and I was accepted, but now I'm left with the choice whether to accept or not. Do any CS grads have experience with one of these programs? Do you believe them to a smart fast-track to a career ready portfolio, or a waste of time and money?

Thanks for any replies. I know questions like these are pretty common."

So I happen to be lucky enough to land myself a tech internship this summer. That's not a concern, but I've been calculating... I think I'm going to fail my physics class this semester. and retaking it plus other credits I should have around 2.6 to 2.7 GPA (I was conservative) at the end of my first semester Junior year.


* My school offer a semester during christmas break (between two regular semesters)

My question is **should I take easy classes during that time to boost up my shitty GPA? I believe if I take bunch of easy classes I should be able to raise it up by .2 to 2.9 or even slightly more...**

I really want to hit that 3.0 mark as I believe a lot of companies requires it as a bare minimum to even look at your resume...

Where I'm struggling right now is picking a niche and really going for it. I was a straight Econ student until the summer of 2012 (junior year) I decided to give a programming class a try. I loved it and immediately added CS as a major. I'm now graduating in May, so essentially it has been less than 2 years since the first time I wrote a line of code. What I know for certain is that computing and information technology is my passion. I am in love with learning as much as I possibly can each day, and I'm excited to at least be at this point. 

I like to learn everything, but since I got into the field so late, I feel behind in my technical skills compared to other CS graduates. I have general knowledge of several languages (Java, Python, C, Obj-C, Scala) as well as HTML and CSS. Since my first programming class in 2012, I have been working at the university help-desk and risen to be one of the top student-consultants there, so I am extremely proficient in troubleshooting machines, software testing and documentation, working with end-users, all operating systems ect. I also had an internship last summer where I worked under two web developers and spent the summer building and maintaing sharepoint sites for a very large private firm, as well as working with the Project Management Team to migrate the company intranet from SharePoint 2007 to 2013. (A lot of what i did was meet with stake-holders within the company to gather requirements, opinions, data).

Given how late I got into IT, I feel like I've accomplished a good amount since that first class, but I also just cant seem to commit to a skill (front-end developer , or iOS developer, or Java Developer, or .NET developer). 

I'm fairly extroverted (which from my job and school experience seems rare for software devs), but I also feel that I have a strong analytical mind and a good blend of technical skill / ability to communicate. I'm pretty certain I want to be a full-time developer.

I guess I'm just looking for advice from anyone on here that's made it in the field/is in a position exactly where they want to be. How did you go about narrowing down your expertise within the field ? 

At this point, I do not believe I am skilled enough to be hired as a full time software dev. As I said, I believe the foundation is there, and I'm excited about that, but the problem is basically picking a language/technology subset to focus on. I've never built any projects of my own, and the only skills test i've taken so far was pretty much a disaster (it was java, and I really got tripped up with syntax errors).

I really appreciate any perspective/advice. Thanks for taking the time to read this in advance. "

However, they only notified me today (around 2 pm) that they need me to come in tomorrow from 9:15 AM-5:30 PM. The thing is, I live 3 hours away from this office and so I would need to leave my house at the latest at 5:30 AM (in case there is traffic etc.) and I would start my drive home during rush hour and likely get back around 9 PM.

 The interview is a day long process and I'm very nervous/stressed about it. What I'm concerned about is the driving and being alert on the road and navigating through highways and roads I'm unfamiliar with. This whole prospect makes me more anxious and I would feel completely more comfortable if I had someone with me. I'm terrified of dozing off at the wheel and being exhausted and getting lost etc. The first person I think of who would be willing to go with me is my boyfriend. We are both in school and I am having to miss all three of my classes. My boyfriend has one class tomorrow (a freshman history class) evening in which he has a quiz. 

I asked him to go with me, to help me drive since it would make things easier and I would feel a lot less anxious and worried. 'He said no way, its too much to ask of him. I've begged him to talk to his teacher about rescheduling the quiz. I dont have money to stay the night before at a hotel. 

I normally don't ask him huge favors or for large sacrifices. I feel like I would completely be willing to help him out in a situation in which he feels very uncomfortable and nervous about. He sees me as being completely unreasonable and crazy for begging him to go with me. 

The thing that gets me is, it may not be a big deal for him to have to drive through unknown roads and be tired and what not, but for me IT IS. This is one of the few times I can remember in which I am truly asking him to please put himself aside and do this for me, because it would make me feel so much more calm and focused on my day ahead and less worried that I'll be exhausted on my drive home after waking up at 4:30 AM that same day. 

This isn't the first time I feel like he isn't willing to sacrifice something for me or help me out. I feel like this situation is kind of indicative of bigger issues in our relationship. 

---   
**tl;dr**: Boyfriend won't drive with me for 6 hours to a job interview that I am nervous about. I am scared of falling asleep at the road on my way home and he thinks I am being unreasonable to ask him to miss a class (and rescuedule a quiz) to drive with me in order to make me feel more comfortable.

I got turned down for an internship, saw a post that my crush put up of another guy, and just felt as though I wasn't very productive. I think I'm heading out of the flatline, and it's a way slower lift-off than what I was expecting. 

I think that people out there should know that there is a hard side of NoFap, something that is totally unexpected. Trust me when I tell you that the emotional side of nofap is the hardest part, not abstaining from masturbating. I just feel so depressed some days, and today is one. There is no reason for this, except for irrational behavior after treating an addiction. 

I just deleted my Facebook, as I never had these stupid, over-insightful stories in front of me. I created one recently to be part of a study. I think that Facebook makes us read too much into other people, as I have seen in myself. I will stay away, as I feel as though it is a dangerous trap that I am messing with. 

You need to be mindful everyday of nofap. Even though today was tough and I hang my head low, tomorrow will be a new day. Day 57. I'm thinking that the last thirty days I keep myself a journal..."

I usually enjoy learning things ahead of schedule to feel a comfort and when I work, I can imagine the whole picture in my mind and grind it out at my own pace (usually slower). When it comes to working with someone in programming labs (EE labs are fine for w/e reason), but I find it's a waste of time explaining it to them until I have the whole thing finished and I can explain it layman's terms.

Even when I help people (which is quite frequently, and will often due it to procrastinate my own work), I find myself using their laptop more than they do and just trying to program it out for them (maybe I'm impatient?). I love seeing when the lightbulb goes off for people but want to be more approachable about help/work.

235om8,8,2014-04-16,Everything I ever wanted to tell you,[deleted],UnsentLetters,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/235om8/everything_i_ever_wanted_to_tell_you/,"A,

I made the mistake of not giving you the space or time.  I didn’t respect your needs.  Even now, I am once again interfering with your space to tell you this.  I  have to carefully consider what I did to you, and now I am only realizing the full extent of the errors in judgment I made.    Instead of giving what you needed, I responded with what I wanted. I suffocated you. It was not a hallmark of a true friend.  I am happy that you have moved on, and that you might have found someone to make you happy.  I am sorry I was immature in my actions.  I can’t offer you a good explanation for my actions because they were inexcusable no matter what my intentions were.  For what it is worth, you were a good friend to me.  You tried and that is all I can ask of you.  To ask anymore at this point would be a disservice to our friendship.   

All the text messages that I sent to you in the last couple of weeks were a mistake.  I was upset about the situation, and I did not handle it maturely.  I have been bouncing around from high and low, from anger to disappointment, to sadness.  My emotions were unfairly targeted to you at some points.  I knew it was stupid, but I did it anyway.  I didn’t want to lose you, and by doing what I did, I guaranteed that fate.  I knew that what I was doing was a mistake at the time, yet I did it.  I can’t offer any good excuse for what I did.  I have spent the last several weeks struggling to figure out what to tell you. How to win you back.  I have come to conclusion that I have to accept your decisions, and I can’t fight this anymore.  I am sorry that it has taken me so long to make this realization.  If I had been more patient I might have not lost you in the first place.  I used you as a crutch for working out my feelings and that is inexcusable.  

I don’t like failing like this, especially to someone that was important to me, but I did fail.  I can’t erase the past, and at this point you have no reason to trust me.  You have no reason to be my friend because of what I did. I enjoyed being your friend.  Despite how it ended, or maybe due to how it ended, you taught me some very important life lessons. I am grateful for the time we spent together, and the memories we shared.  I wish it could have lasted longer, but I can’t alter the past no matter how much I want.  

Words cannot express my anguish at hurting you, and driving you away.  I have spent the last several weeks reflecting on my mistakes.  I ask for your forgiveness, and for you to grant me the opportunity to make amends.  It took me longer than I thought to put my house in order, but now I feel I am ready to make the necessary changes to revive our friendship.

I know this is a difficult request to grant, I only wish to right the past wrongs, and reestablish our friendship on a solid foundation.  I don’t expect immediate forgiveness and absolution for my mistakes.  Your friendship was something I treasured.  You helped through one of the toughest periods of my life.  You gave me strength to continue. If it wasn't for your presence I would not be here today feeling the deep remorse at losing you.  You are someone I greatly admire.  For your gift of friendship I will always be grateful.  

I am not a perfect person, I have made a lot of mistakes in my life.  Very rarely do we get second chances, so I know I am asking something significant from you.  If you agree to give me one more chance I would like to sit down with you and work out what steps I need to take to restore your trust in me.

There are three things you should know about me.  The first is that I am loyal to all people I consider my friends, I will move mountains for them.  The second thing is I love each and every one of my friends, they are like family to me.  The last thing and most important thing, is if I have wronged a friends, I will do everything in my power to correct it.  

The last thing I want to do right now is to make you feel pressured to make a decision.  I want you to feel comfortable letting me come back into your life.  I do sincerely want to make amends to you.  I don’t want to stop you pursuing relationships with other people, I only want to be friends again.  I made the mistake of misinterpreting you intentions, and I don’t want to make that mistake again.  I understand if it is too soon and the wounds have not healed. 

I hope you are doing well.  I know your internship is coming to an end soon, and I want to extend my congratulations for a successful year in a field you are passionate about.  My Door Will always be open to you.  If we never see each other again, I hope you will find someone special someday.  Someone that can accept you better than I did.  I wish you the best, and a future of joy and happiness.  I hope that you will fulfill your dreams and ambitions.  I know you will become a wonderful teacher.  I am proud of what you have accomplished, and who you are.  

May the road rise up to meet you.

May the wind always be at your back

May the sun shine warm upon your face,

And the rains fall soft upon your fields. 

And until we meet again,

May god hold you in the hollow of His Hand.

235sdf,6,2014-04-16,High school junior looking for a paid internship to gain experience/knowledge. Need some tips/advice. Am I being too ambitious?,thecolombianjesus,web_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/235sdf/high_school_junior_looking_for_a_paid_internship/,"***Bless your soul if you read this entire thing. I really appreciate it.***

Hi guys. I'm currently a junior in high school. I took Web Design I this year, intrigued by the idea of web design/development. I fell in love with the class from the start. Learning the basics of HTML and CSS sparked my interest in building websites. I delved into Codecademy, starting reading blogs/articles on web design (many of them coming from this amazing subreddit!), making my own little projects in my spare time, and am currently reading *Javascript: The Definitive Guide* in hopes of becoming a better front-end developer. 

Ever since I was a kid I have loved computers. I enjoy technology and digital media, unleashing the creative side of me in terms of having a keen eye for design. After extensive hours of research and thought, I have decided that I want to follow the career path of a Front-End Developer.

As a 17 year old in high school, having a job is of somewhat importance to me. A source of income to fund my technological desires or social activities is extremely helpful. However, trying to balance schoolwork, a job, the gym, and a girlfriend is a lot to undertake. This is why I don't want just any boring retail/fast food job that will serve me no benefit in the future. However, if I am able to get a paid internship at some sort of local web design/development agency where I am able to work in a professional environment and gain some experience pertaining to the industry while also acquiring new knowledge each and every day then the long term benefits are tremendous. I will be ahead of the game when I enter college and will hopefully have an easier time finding another internship, or maybe even a full time job, as a Front-End Developer. 

Now, for those of you thinking, *""Well do you have what it takes?""* Considering I'm only going off of what I've learned in a years worth of my Web Design class, and through my own personal effort to learn more about HTML/CSS/JS, I believe that an internship would be a whole new experience for me; one that will be challenging yet rewarding.

In terms of my portfolio/personal achievements so far, I won 1st place in the Web Design division for a local school district competition between all the high schools in my county. **Here's the [link](http://everyday-auto.corenode.io)** to the site (Sorry if it's slow. It's being hosted off of my dropbox). I also worked with a group of 4 fellow club members to design and build a website for a state competition, in which we placed 4th **(I can get the link to this site upon request. I don't have the files uploaded right now)**. I am also currently working on a site for my friend's mom's cleaning business, which will hopefully feature a flat &amp; responsive design.

As you can see, I am very serious about my future. I want to take steps as early as I can to fulfill my ambition for success in my future career. So therefore my question is: **How should I go about finding a paid internship at a local web design/development firm that will actually look into a 17 year old high school student like me? Are my ambitions too far-fetched? Anything I can improve on/learn?** I'm all ears to constructive criticism!

Thanks!

235twj,0,2014-04-16,I'm slightly worried about my class performance affecting a firm's opinion of me.,[deleted],Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/235twj/im_slightly_worried_about_my_class_performance/,"More information: I'm a junior Accounting major/Econ minor with a Big 4 Audit internship for this summer. I have to take 18 credits/semester (means 6 classes, most people take 5) in order to reach 150, and I also work two part-time jobs on campus. 

So far, things have been going mostly fine. My GPA when I applied was 3.55, now it's about 3.48. My accounting grades should be pretty much fine, I might get a C in my Intermediate Accounting this semester though. My main concern is that I am currently failing an Econometrics class, and probably the best I can do is pull it up to a D (MAYBE a C if the teacher is super nice). The teacher said that this would still count as passing, so it shouldn't affect me getting 150 credits. The main thing is that the lowest grade on my transcript when they looked was a B-, whereas now there will be Cs and maybe even a D. 

I'm not really all that concerned about my GPA personally, but I hope they don't see this as a significant drop in my grades and re-consider the offer. I don't remember exactly that they said about maintaining grades over the remainder of my schooling... 
Should I bring it up, or just assume they won't ask? "

I'm French and moving to Paris for 8 months, including 6 during which I'll be doing an internship in the luxury business (which is why I need to wear casual but elegant clothing at work).
As a personal challenge, I have chosen to only take a (big) backpack with me, and a handbag (big enough for carrying my computer). 

Here is my packing list. Do you think I've forgotten some important stuff, or there are some things that I absolutely don't need? (For the first few weeks I'll be staying at friends' or couchsurfing, until I find a small flat to move in.)


BACKPACK

-Power strip

-Small purse (for work and going out)

-Plastic cups (so I don't need a glass immediately when I move)

-A Thermos food container (also works for liquids)

-A plastic lunchbox I can use every day

-1 or 2 washing cloths (my mom has many of those in very high quality)

-A towel

-My toiletries and makeup box, which is the size of a small purse

-Glasses and sunglasses

-1 large T-Shirt as a pajama

-A small purse of jewelry

-Underwear

-Work shoes (high heels) and casual (light) shoes

-2 pairs of work pants, 2 skirts (one for work, one casual), 1 jean

-Sports clothes (one top, one legging)

-2 pullovers

-2 tank tops, 2 work tops, 1 casual T-Shirt

-A formal business ensemble

-1 small black dress

-1 rain jacket


HANDBAG

-1 pen

-Pair of scissors

-File for paper documents (insurance mostly) + Times covers (not heavy, doesn't take much place in the file and makes nice decoration for an apartment wall)

-Ethernet cable (often better quality than wifi)

-Notebook

-Computer, charger, mouse and mousepad

-Earphones

-Deodorant

-Wallet

-Phone &amp; charger


WORN WHEN GOING THERE

-A scarf

-Sports shoes (since the casual shoes are much lighter and smaller, and I can't travel with high-heeled shoes since they aren't very comfortable, especially with such weight to carry)

-Jeans

-A pullover

-A top that's fit for going to work

-A warm jacket



What do you think? What could I take off this list, what else should I take?

EDIT: forgot phone &amp; charger

236eds,2,2014-04-16,My [f18] boyfriend [m19] of almost two years doesn't think it'll work only because of the possibility of meeting someone someday that might be a better fit. (long story),[deleted],LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/236eds/my_f18_boyfriend_m19_of_almost_two_years_doesnt/,"Our relationship is extremely complicated. Junior year of high school, I was head over heels for this guy and unfortunately, he seemed to be after one of my friends. Before my feelings had developed, I asked this friend if she felt anything for me (because she knew how he felt) and she gave me the okay to go for him. So I went; I had never had a boyfriend before but I don't think I really ever tried that hard to be with someone. Well, two weeks later, she up and decides that perhaps she did like him and pretty much just ruined our friendship (although we never fought about it, and I've forgiven her, I can't trust her anymore). They end up getting closer and closer for about a month but never even dated when she once again decided that it wasn't anything real. She thought she liked him, but turns out, she just wanted him as a friend. This was the closest that he ever got to having a girlfriend so he took it pretty hard for a while. Meanwhile, I'm still hurting from them being together in the first place. I had shared a class with both of them and I know that it was one of the hardest things that I had to sit through each and everyday. I tried to recover and I told myself that I didn't like him anymore. And then I was no longer drooling after him. I lived my life (and I was also going through a lot of problems trying to find the right friends so I was alone for most of the time) and thought I moved on. Senior year rolls around, and he knew I probably still liked him and so he kept trying to get himself to like me back. Eventually, we got to talking, the timing and pieces fell just right and by November of that year, we started dating. It was ridiculous for me because I never even imagined that this would happen and for a few months after that, I had trouble believing that it was actually happening. I was scared to fall in love because I was afraid it was all a fluke. We had a first kiss. I went to my first prom. We moved much faster than I would've liked and rushed into things I wasn't ready for, but I adjusted. We graduated and spent the whole summer together and he was attending a state university in town and I was moving six hours away for a rigorous school specialized specifically for my job field. We agreed to try our best to make our LDR work. I always got a bit nervous and jealous when he would hang out with that girl (his friend) from junior year. He had forgiven her completely but I still had trouble trusting her. He said that he would decline invitations to go hang out with her, but if she happened to drop by while he was with friends in public, he wouldn't do anything. I thought it was fair enough. We've gotten through 2/3rds of the year fine (it was tough and we did fight occasionally) but it wasn't until this last month and a half that we had one of the biggest issues we've ever had. I get irrationally depressed the week before my period and it just kind of lasts through the period. I probably had one of my lowest of lows this time around because the timing was awful; he just started becoming friends and hanging out with this attractive physics lab partner. That same day that he spent a few hours with her playing his favorite game, he also was with this girl from junior year simultaneously. My emotions felt so intense, and I know I was wrong to take it out on him, but I just kept trying to voice my concerns. He never really definitely dispelled them either. I asked him to just take a break from hanging out with the two of them because I could not handle the things I was feeling. I knew it was unfair of me to ask, but my heart could not stand it. I really was trying to get used to the idea of it so that I wouldn't be this irrational. He agreed; one day while we were video chatting (which we hadn't really been able to do as often lately) it was past the time that we agreed to set out for each other. So he says he's leaving to go hang out with the ""junior year"" girl. I couldn't have felt more hurt in that one moment than I did in our entire relationship so far. And of course, I got upset and he postponed meeting her and eventually she left. I found out later that he did in fact go meet her that night though. I trust him to not do anything but it still doesn't make my heart any less restless. A week or so ago, he applied for an internship where his lab partner works. He says this could turn into a career, he doesn't know. Fundamentally, with our relationship, I feel as though I'm putting in more effort than he is. I'm always the one to WANT to talk to him and call him and text him. I constantly slip his mind and he always wants to hang out with other people. I've tried to be patient with him but I got lonely. Everytime we would talk, things always got serious and he hated that. He just wanted to casually talk and have a good time. But I couldn't help this doubts and fears I had on my mind constantly. Two days ago, after I kept pressuring him to tell me what he actually thinks about these things that I've been worried about, he finally lays everything on the table. He doesn't dispel these doubts because they have some truth to them. Out of our high school, he believes I was the best choice for him. But that doesn't mean that in this entire world of billions of people, I am the best choice for him. This is both our first relationship and I think he wants to try other people. He said that one day, if someone came along that he thought he was more compatible with, he wouldn't leave me for her, but rather unintentionally resent me for having this obligation to stay with me. He knows that to have someone at their best, he needs to be there at their worst. He told me that the weeks we had our low, I was at my very worst. And he couldn't handle it. He said he absolutely did not deserve me at my best.  I asked him what we should do and after a few hours of talking, he didn't want to, but it's the only thing his mind would lead to, and he truly thought it was the best move: we should break up. I don't think I've ever had my life crumble so fast in front of my eyes. But after a few minutes, we decided perhaps it would be best to stick it out until I got home from college. We know that once I get home and we can be intimate together, it'll all seem fine. It's just the LDR part that seems to be too much for him. I'm willing to make it work by any means possible, but he knew that I loved him more than he loves me. The fact remains that he still loves me. Aside from fear of future possibilities and the difficulties of long distance, our relationship is great. So I feel like it's so stupid to just throw away something perfectly fine (but not easy) just because of ""possibilities"". That night, after we agreed to try to stay together, I called him desperately begging for him to try his best to change his mind and stop thinking that way. I pleaded him to give me a chance to work on my ""worst"" so that it can perhaps be tolerable. I can only be better if I decide to work on myself. I just don't feel that he will try his best because he's notorious for not liking to work for things, whereas I can be a workaholic. And yesterday, I kept thinking about the situation and knew that once we called it off, I would be in pain much much longer than he would. He deals with his problems by compartmentalizing and just ignoring them. And it always works, except with deep stuff way underneath, which is why we've arrived at this giant issue to begin with. I kept thinking that this summer, I would have to be the best I could be and being a better girlfriend, I had to break it off because I feel like he'll always resent me for trying to make it work when he believes someone else out there could be better. I've talked to two friends in private about this issue and each time, I'm sobbing hysterically with snot incessantly drooping out of my nose. I had started to love him so hesitantly because I feared this exact issue might one day arise and now my heart is in pieces, even though we are still together. I start doubting if he even really liked me in the first place because he told me he actively tried so hard to like me back in the beginning and he wonders if that was a mistake or not entirely genuine. When we talk not, we kind of just avoid serious things, or discussion about our life after this year, or if we make it long distance for three more years, life after college. We've been trying to keep it positive and just good vibes. And yesterday, I came to acceptance to just throw away all those ideas of me ending it during the summer. Instead, I'm just going to try to be the very best version of me I can be so that I won't have any regrets on my end of things. I tried my best and it hopefully it'll be enough for him. One day, I'll let him decide whether or not he can't stand me anymore and I'll let him go (hopefully, smoothly and acceptingly; I know it'll hurt no matter what though). 
But now, today, each night I lie in bed thinking these thoughts. Each morning I wake up, having forgot momentarily everything that happened, and then it floods back to me and next thing I know, I'm running to the bathroom to cry my eyes out, careful not to wake my room mate. I don't know what's the best thing to do and how to deal with these things. It hurts so much more than it should because I'm so young and he was my first everything. I know that I'm strong and if it doesn't work out, one day I will find someone where it can. But I don't even know how to live life without him anymore. I have to lose not only him, but his family members, and probably some of our mutual friends because I'm long distance friends with them. I think he might've started thinking of these possibilities because he became friends with that lab partner, but who knows. I certainly don't. He doesn't tell me these controversial underlying thoughts. I'm just so lost and need some advice or even just to talk. "

236rfl,1,2014-04-16,"Me [29F] with my sister [26F]: bad blood between us, relationship in shambles, don't know what to do",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/236rfl/me_29f_with_my_sister_26f_bad_blood_between_us/,"Bad blood between me 29F and my sister 26F and not sure what to do now. 

I’m not sure what to do. There’s a lot of bad blood between me and my sister, which has been made worse by her physical and mental health state. 

Background on my sister: My sister, 26F, has had a lot of issues in the past. She’s been in several car wrecks (none were her fault) that resulted in a traumatic brain injury, and slipped disks which lead to spinal fusion surgery. She’s also suffering from PTSD (resulting from a traumatic incident with a guy), frequent panic attacks, and extreme anxiety. Also, she has always presented with extremes in moods (even when we were kids). Needless to say she’s struggling with so much. Currently she’s seeking therapy regularly (3 times a week I think). 

Background on our relationship: We’ve never been close. As kids we fought a lot - as much or more than most siblings. I don’t remember a time when we were buddy/buddy. We weren’t close growing up, and haven’t been close as adults. There’s a long long list of things she blames me for, but I’m not convinced it’s things I deserve to be blamed for. 

I wasn’t going to post a lot of examples or background of what I’m being blamed for, but my reactions and current state of emotion on the whole thing don’t make much sense without context. So here’s a long list of things I’m still being blamed for over &amp; over again, some of which are 10+ years old…..

1. Not stopping bullying in high school (10+ years ago). 
2. Not coming home immediately from across the country when she was in a car wreck that didn’t have any immediately apparent injuries, but ultimately she had a traumatic brain injury from (9 years ago). 
3. We were roommates in college for 2 years but I worked 3 jobs and wasn’t there for 24/7, which she is mad about (7-8 years ago). 
4. I graduated college on her birthday, therefore ruining her special day, which she made sure to voice repeatedly (7 years ago). 
5. For not putting forth enough effort to be friends and to hang out frequently when I was in grad school (4-7 years ago). 
6. For being good friends with her ex-best friend. She thinks her ex-best friend is trying to get close to be as revenge (this is ongoing….)
7. For not going to more than 2 family therapy sessions (1 year ago). 
8. She was raped, and that’s my fault. (6 months ago)

My side of the above: 

1. I didn’t know bullying was going on, I never saw it. And nobody told me it happened until literally three weeks ago, which was 10+ years later. 

2. My parents said she was fine, and my internship ended 3 weeks later and I came home then. 

3. I worked 3 jobs and was in college full time. I wasn’t even there for myself 24/7. 

4. I didn’t plan college graduation… 

5. I was in the field 5+ days a week and in class the others. I didn’t see much of anyone. 

6. Her ex-best friend is the younger sister of MY best friend. I’ve known her for 20 years. Us being friends isn’t a recent development. 

7. I tried to make more, but in the 6 weeks she was in the outpatient therapy place I was out of town for 2 of those and in the field the rest of the time for work. My job requires long and early hours and lots of time in remote locations but I left work early on the days that I could to make appointments. 

8. She says it’s my fault she was raped because she doesn’t have any friends and I never invite her to hang out, so she tried to make new friends and then this happened. 


I’m not trying to justify my actions by explaining my side, I just feel like both sides are useful in seeing what’s actually happening and both sides matter to the story. 

My mom says I need to just accept all the things she blames me for, let her be angry, and just say “ok sorry” to everything. But I don’t think that’s fair. What about my feelings? My mom said its not about my feelings. Except that if I’m involved, so are my feelings. 

I’ve reached my max capacity for coping with this. I don’t want to be involved anymore. Of course I wish my sister will be able to heal mentally &amp; physically, and live a normal life. It’s the point though where talking to my parents on the phone stresses me out so much that I get chest pains. I cannot physically handle the stress anymore of being the perceived source of everyone’s problems in the family. 

I love my parents and the rest of my family, and want to continue a good relationship with them. I just don’t know what to do about my relationship with my sister. And am I in the wrong for any of this? If her blame is legit, please tell me. I just need advice and outside opinions… Thanks!

---   
**tl;dr**: My sister and I don’t get along. She blames me for lots of things, but I think the blame is misplaced. Our relationship is in shambles. What do I do?"

Budget ~3000 but any savings is good! 

I say I want a gaming laptop, but I don't play games. 

Although currently this is because I have a laptop with intel HD, and am running linux. Why do I want a gaming laptop I don't even know, but I don't want to buy another laptop with intel HD graphics ever again. The only game I play is EVE online, although I can see that changing if I buy a laptop that can support more. 

Why don't I buy a gaming desktop? I need to finish up another year in college, and in between I need to travel for my internship, and I like to carry my laptop places.  Also you can't use a desktop on a bus. 

 This is what I'm looking for, the perfect laptop:

* 13"" screen size.| 14"" is acceptable as an alternative.  | may be a very very very pretty 15"" laptop, but then it has to be sleek and can't make any other sacrifices. I want 13"" because it's easy to fit in a bus seat in front of me or on an airplane. 

* For a processor I want i7-4XXXMQ, if you can convince me an i5 will suit me for compiling code and matlab I can accept that too. 

* For a graphics card I want NVIDIA 880M/780M/870M or AMD equivalent if it exists. I want it to last as long as humanly possible, which means play the current iteration of EVE online/dota2/CS on minimum graphics (on linux) for the next 4-5 years.  If it can run two instances of EVE, that's better. If it can run three, that's more points. 

* I want four USB ports. | 3 USB ports is acceptable.

* I want a CD drive | I can live without it

* Do they even make docking stations any more? If you find one I can accept a 15"" laptop.

* Large battery |.. or a battery will do of course. 


I understand this is impossible: portability and power do not go well together and who games on linux anyway?

This [13"" clevo](http://www.xoticpc.com/sager-np7338-clevo-w230ss-eta-march-p-6992.html) is in first place. 
&gt; 13"", no cd drive, 3 usb ports, ugly, 860M. Costs only 1000. Good linux support, no windows tax. 

New [razer blade](http://www.razerzone.com/store/razer-blade) in second place

&gt;it's 14"", but costs twice as much, still doesn't have a CD drive, only three USB ports, and no removable battery I think, but it's battery is slightly better. The biggest pro is the 870M, which according to [this](http://www.anandtech.com/show/7834/nvidia-geforce-800m-lineup-battery-boost) is a 35% improvement. Also questionable linux support.

 I just want to hear your opinions. If you want to encourage me not to buy something so ridiculous, that is welcome too.

2373o0,96,2014-04-16,"UPDATE 2: UPDATE: Me [21 F] with my father [50s], where is the line when it comes to my education and life in general, and is he crossing it?",throwawaymyparents,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/2373o0/update_2_update_me_21_f_with_my_father_50s_where/,"[Original](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/22lvy3/me_21_f_with_my_father_50s_where_is_the_line_when/) [Update 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/22uusu/update_me_21_f_with_my_father_50s_where_is_the/)

I'd just like to start this by saying during my father's visit here he told me he wanted me to touch base with the family therapist in general. Also, he left his push to talk cellphone behind. He's not tech savvy, barely uses it, and rarely keeps it on. He also has my old cellphone and my stepmom's old cellphone that can be activated for no charge. My classes run all day long and I have had project after project due almost every day. I'll try to get it to the post office but I've been delaying it for my own work which he's well aware of and was a witness to.

Anyway, back to the update. I'm still getting emails and calls from him, my grandma, and stepmom about the internship. Now he's saying his life is on the line because I have his cellphone. I have 48 hours to get it to him or else.  As well as the internship updates. I'll try to get to the post office today if I can but that's the most contact I plan on giving him.

Also, he said my update to the therapist he told me to contact is expensive and I can't get her involved just to justify ignoring him. He NEEDS his updates about the internship. 

I also got an email from my grandma saying she knows I'm swamped with work but he needs his cellphone and returning it will show how responsible I am. I haven't answered her for days, but I did today. Here's my response:

&gt; I have three final projects due this week and I had big projects due last week. I have been working every day with little to no sleep so the post office was not my top priority. I get out of class most days when the post office is closed. I will get it out as soon as I can but getting emails from everyone 50 times a day will not make it happen any faster. Dad has my old cell phone in his room last time I checked and could have activated it days ago for no charge through Verizon. I will get it out when I can but I need everyone to get off my back.

&gt; He will be receiving his cellphone but he will not be receiving detailed internship updates anymore until I get it. He cannot handle any information I give him without acting like a child; I will not be encouraging his temper tantrums with the subject matter that encourages them.  The cursing is unacceptable. Calling me hours into the night is unacceptable. Getting other people to contact me is unacceptable. This is not up for discussion as he has serious boundary issues. I will not discuss internship details with you or my stepmom as well; it's nothing against either of you but I don't want him involving other people in something that is already not his business. By over reacting and treating me poorly, he has made it clear that he will be more harmful than helpful. It is in my internship's best interest that I distance myself from the drama as it is way too distracting for me to complete my work. 

&gt;I have gone well beyond most people my age to show him how responsible I am therefore I do not need to prove my responsibility to him. Whether he realizes it or not, distancing myself IS the responsible thing to do. His distraction and over-involvement is interfering with my college which he pays thousands of dollars a year for. I will not have his emotions ruin my workflow, grades, and opportunities. The first night of his drama alone, I couldn't get my work done because he made me too emotional to concentrate. I refuse to let him interfere with my work again.

 &gt;He told me to touch base with his therapist when he visited, yet when I did, he made it seem as if it was out of line because she has encouraged me to distance myself for the time being. This is the last time I will be discussing internships and his attitude with you. I will not entertain the subject anymore since it'll only encourage him to use you as a bridge of communication even further. That isn't fair to you or me. I'm sorry dad is pressuring you and I'll call you when I get a chance, but I am telling you in advanced the internship is absolutely not up for discussion. Please respect the boundaries I am laying out. 


I'm starting to question how I'm handling things. The cellphone thing is my bad so I'll try to get that out despite having 2 more projects due tomorrow as well. But I don't want to stop ignoring him. I'm afraid that if I do, this will have all been for nothing and it'll just encourage him more to see me as a selfish immature little brat. So, what now?

tldr; more pressure from family. Finally answered my grandma saying it was the last time I'd be discussing this with her. More threats from dad. What now?"

I graduated this past summer with degrees in Planning and Public Policy and History. I realized through internships that I don't want to be an Urban Planner or work in Policy and everybody already knows History is pretty useless unless you want to teach.

I would like to go back to school and pursue a degree in Geology, since I've always enjoyed the subject. The reason I didn't pursue it in the first place is because I have always struggled in Math. However, now that I am older and less concerned with partying etc. I think I could apply myself and achieve at least a decent GPA. (If it makes any difference, I graduated summa cum laude so I wouldn't be going back to boost my GPA)

Has anyone had experience getting a second bachelors? Should I take prerequisites like General Chem/Calc at community college? Would any of the liberal arts courses I already have taken count for general SAS electives/writing requirements?

My bestfriend/roommate who I will call Max, have been friends since high school. We've gone through a lot, death, drug addict, disease and because of it we've become very close friends. We got were romantically involved with each other for a few years, a few years ago. Never developed into anything and though I always wonder what would have happened if it did, I have no feelings like that for him and I'm happier with our friendship now. I genuinely care very deeply for him and just want him to be happy. 


Well he moved into a room in the house I rent about a year ago after breaking up with his ex-gf. She pressured him into getting apartment together, he told me that he was trying to save the relationship. I told him it was a dumb idea, did it anyway. They lasted 2 months together before she moved out and he was stuck in a new lease, covering whole of rent. So once a room became available in my property, he broke the lease and moved in. 

Soon as he moved in, he started dating his new girlfriend, Amy. So they have been only dating for about a year, could be a little more. I really like her, she is a nice girl and we've spent days watching t.v. and getting food. We've hung out together without Max and she honestly a great person! It was very apparent though, that Amy came from money early on as she didn't hide the fact. Her and Max go out pretty much every night and she normally flips the bill. She is currently a full-time student and is about to graduate at the end of the 
semester. 


A few months ago, Max went home with Amy to visit family. He came back amazed, neither one of us really understood exactly how much money Amy family has. He went off about all the things they did and saw with her family. He mention to me how her father was a high class attorney and made back. A few weeks later, he changed his major to political science and now has this idea he is going to be a big shot lawyer. Silly but it's whatever. 


So Amy and I hungout recently and I asked her what she planned on doing after graduation and she mentioned some pretty awesome things her father has offered to her to do after school on his dime. None of which includes her getting a job unless she stayed here, she would have to get a job and pay her way. If she stayed for Max, which would be the only reason why, he father said he won't fund her anymore. Which I could tell she had no intention of losing his funding. When we were discussing her options available I could tell, none of them included Max. Her father has made it clear that he doesn't want him to come with her, that if he did, he couldn't live with her etc. She most likely moving back with family after graduating or moving to NYC (close to family) to take an internship. Which is across the country from where we are.


Well Max came up to me last night and told me how he applied for several school, all within the area she is planning on moving. I asked him, ""Are you planning on moving with Amy?"" He informed me that he was moving so he could be with her.


I've watch him make stupid decisions for women before and I can't help but think, this is a bad idea. He has no family or friends out there only Amy, who has tons of money, family and friends out there who will take care of her if anything happens. Max and I come from family's who kicked us out as soon as we were 18 and have supported ourselves. If Max can't live with Amy, where is he going to live? I can tell he hasn't thought this one through and I hate for him to move cross country just for them not to work out and he alone, broke, without friends/family in a strange city. I

I'm wondering if I should say something to him. Part of me feels that it isn't my business, which is partly correct, it isn't. But as Max best friend and after all we've been through, what type of friend would I be if I DIDN'T tell him it was a bad idea. Max has always been a relationship guy and when he is with a girl, he is devoted which is admirable but it leads him into dating ungrateful women who treat him badly and normally ends with him getting screwed over. I don't believe Amy is this way, but I can tell she isn't being honest about her true feelings on the situation as well as about her father's intentions regarding Max. Don't know what to do.


**TL;DR** Bestfriend/roommate been dating a girl for around a year now and wants to move cross country with her after she graduates. she is moving closer to her wealthy family who doesn't seem to want there daughter to have any involvement with him after graduation. I don't know whether to talk to him about how I believe this moving isn't in his best interest.

237n3c,4,2014-04-16,Delay graduation from 3+1 program by a semester for a Fall internship? Or just finish out and graduate next May?,MrGorillaNoodles,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/237n3c/delay_graduation_from_31_program_by_a_semester/,"I'm set to graduate by May 2015, but I'm feeling like I might need some work experience to put myself in a better position.

This summer I'll be finishing up my ""junior"" year at a community college in a 3+1 program and in the fall I'll be entering the +1 portion. This fall semester will be the first iteration of the +1 portion of this program ever. While this local private university has produced CS graduates before, I'll be among only a handful or two of students that will be the first to graduate from their 3+1 program. It's an excellent way to save money on an education, as I'll have minimal debt, but I'm a little worried about the merit of a program that hasn't been done before. I can't be sure of job placement stats, if we'll have recruitment services, job fairs, etc.

I'm also a bit uneasy about how much I'll have accomplished by graduation. I just received my first exposure to programming last semester in a C++ course, and each semester here on out will be a crash course in CS and programming since I finished the brunt of my general education a couple years ago at a university I previously attended. For instance, this semester I'm taking 18 credit hours with Assembly, C#, Advanced C++, and a Windows Networking course. This summer I'll be taking Calculus, another Advanced C++ course, and a Data Structures/System Design course to finish out my ""junior"" year. It feels like it's all coming so fast that I don't know if I'll find a suitable niche in CS and be able to produce from that niche by graduation.

I've got some school projects from this semester that I could polish up and put on GitHub, and I'm either going to teach myself Objective-C and code an application/game or find an interesting implementation for C++ or C# that I'll enjoy coding into a project over the summer. However, I feel like I could use some mentoring since all but one of my CC professors are pretty out of touch outside academia. As a result, all of the programs I've coded, except a couple games, have been problems out of a text book.

With that said, would I benefit from delaying graduation by a semester for a Fall internship? Or should I just finish out school and rely on my school projects, prospective side projects, and whatever the level of merit a 3+1 program will provide? 

Thank you guys for your time."

I have had no IT experience other than an internship immediately prior to this job, so this job is the first real IT job I have had. I want to professionally interface with my boss's boss and bluntly but elaborately explain where I want to be in the organization. How should I carry this out? I am furthering my education next semester to go for my undergrad. All I have is an associate's but if I could work my way up while I am earning my degree that would be most ideal.

I'm starting to get anxious now because I heard from other interns that they are doing background checks through the university. On my résumé, I put that my cumulative GPA is 3.0 but that is also including a bunch of cmunity college courses that I have taken (which were all As). Also, I have been in a bad place before I switched to computer science, and I was on academic probation for a semester. The GPA is accurate if you count my other courses but I'm worried they won't see that or think I was lying and rescind me before I can explain. 

My major GPA is 3.3 and it includes only CS courses at my uni except for 1 (which was at community college)

All courses have been transferred to my uni but I'm just worried that they won't care about those courses and judge me off my performance at the uni."

237t9e,1,2014-04-16,When should I plan on taking my internship(s)? [US],MyOwnPath,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/237t9e/when_should_i_plan_on_taking_my_internships_us/,"I'm about to finish my third year of college. However, due to switching my major a couple of times, I'll have to take about four more semesters of college to get my accounting degree. I'm well aware of the fact that I need to get an internship in order to make me employable at the bachelor's level. However, given my circumstances, I don't know when I should plan on taking.

The obvious answer would be to take one over the summer between two years. However, I know that most firms only give true value to those with a winter internship, due to how the busy season tests you. 

Thus, I think taking a winter internship would make the most sense. However, when would I take it? If I complete the next two years I'll end in a summer semester, meaning I'd have a gap in my work history from waiting for one to come along. Alternatively, I could take one next winter; however, that would leave a significant gap of time between getting the internship and getting hired; almost two years.

Also, I should point out that I've met with recruiters from a few firms (no big 4, but as I understand they rarely hire at the bachelor level anyways). I would assume they expect me to apply ASAP, given the fact that I went out of my way to meet them personally and give them a copy of my resume; I don't want them to think I'm ignoring them.

Is there any ideal time to take an internship, or am I overthinking this way too much? Also, would it make sense to take two internships, say one during a summer and another during a winter?"

237we5,28,2014-04-16,"Just got off the phone with a recruiter, I can't help but feel like I'm being horrendously low-balled on potential salary",Dislikes_Pun_Threads,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/237we5/just_got_off_the_phone_with_a_recruiter_i_cant/,"It sounded like I was talking to a salesman.

He kept talking up the company I would work for, saying that having that specific company (A local company that I had never heard of) on my resume looks really good because they have a reputation for having focused employees that deliver results.  Eh, whatever, he's a recruiter.  His job is to find people and get them apply for jobs and get hired so that he can get paid.

But what bugged me was salary.  The position would be iOS development, and he said the salary would be $45k/year.  This seems REALLY low as my college (And other sources, for that matter), said the average starting wage for a software developer is around $70k.

He said that salaries for a new job are typically going to be based on your previous job, and since my internship only paid $13/hour, I shouldn't expect more than double that.

He also said that this company is working for people willing to work 50-55 hours per week.

It just seems like I'm being horrendously low-balled.  However, I've been unemployed for over two weeks now and I really need a job.  I'm thinking of moving forward with this just so I have work, but I'll continue looking for something better.

Thoughts?"
237z6e,0,2014-04-16,I'm [23/m] dreading my 1 year anniversary with my clingy girlfriend [22/f] and considering breaking it off,torbald128,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/237z6e/im_23m_dreading_my_1_year_anniversary_with_my/,"So, I've been dating a beautiful, brilliant, caring woman for the past year, but I'm not sure if I want to keep going. Our 1 year anniversary is coming up, and I feel like I would rather hang out with someone else than see her.

I was content with everything until about a week ago, but she made me stop hanging out with one of two friends other than her that I ever see in person. This friend was a girl from my high school (who I had a brief fling with then, but mind you this was 6 years ago) who I hadn't even had contact with until she moved into town a few months ago. She has a stable boyfriend of 4 years, and we never did anything other than play video games and other shit I do with my male friends. But I absolutely had to stop seeing her because of my girlfriend's insecurity. I told her over and over that it was purely platonic, but she said that it doesn't matter. She said having her as a friend made her want to hurt herself, and awoke a dormant eating disorder and that wouldn't ever change as long as we were hanging out. 

So I broke it off with this friend and have been questioning the relationship ever since.

Reflecting on the relationship, I have felt more and more that she's not letting me be myself. I've always been a very independent, introverted person, but recently I have stopped all of my hobbies (I've been a pretty avid musician my whole life until a few months ago) other than playing video games and browsing the internet. I feel like I can't get engaged in anything on my own time because she CONSTANTLY is messaging me and gets really upset if I don't respond. If she texts me and then sees me on g-chat, I'll always receive a message asking why I didn't respond to her text. If I don't respond to anything for more than an hour or so for whatever reason she thinks something is wrong, even if I'm just busy with schoolwork. She drains me dry every single day, and I basically never hang out with other friends, or even IM/text them, because I'm just spent. I've seen all of my friendships except two or three completely deteriorate over the course of the past year.

I feel like when we started dating that it was helping me grow as a person, but now I don't see that. When we hang out, it's always cooking something together (her personal hobby is cooking; I couldn't care less), or watching some shitty TV (I never watch TV on my own). Her only interest in any of my hobbies is asking me to write a song for her, despite me being super disengaged from any musical practice for the past few months. I was recently applying for internships during the summer, and she was supportive for the ones in town, but ambivalent to anything else. I don't feel supported professionally. Her only support is a fantasy of hers of moving to California after I graduate next spring, despite neither of us having jobs there at this point.

Which brings up another thing: she never lives in the present. She's asks way too often if I feel she's ""The One,"" and talks about marriage way than I'm comfortable with. I'm just not at that phase in my life yet. She says that anything I buy or she gives to me is her's as well, because we're going to be moving in soon enough anyway. Ignore that there are no actual real life plans for moving in yet. She makes me promise that I'll ""be with her forever"" every other time that we hang out, it seems. If I say I can't promise that at this point (the truth!) she breaks down and says I don't love her, so I just lie whenever asked now.

She has such an entitled view to everything. I recently was talking about giving her ""whatever she wanted"" for a night because she was in a shitty mood. Her response was, and I quote, ""Oh, I always get what I want anyway."" This even holds true in sex, as we've slowly cut out everything that I really like doing that she's neutral on for her same favorite positions every time. If I try something new, she never really seems engaged, and often just tells me to stop.

Last weekend, I woke up on Saturday knowing I had agreed to spend the afternoon with her at a local festival, and spend the night later. When we were driving to the thing, I told her that I needed to finish a paper and wanted to leave after the thing we were going to so I could work. She thought I was staying from noon until the next morning. This upset her because ""I just got there and only wanted to leave."" Upset her so much that she would have driven into oncoming traffic if I didn't grab the steering wheel. We switched so I could drive her home at that point, and she spouted endless hurtful shit until we got back. She later revealed that she ""didn't mean it"" and ""was only saying it because [she] would rather [I] be mad at [her] than have no reaction.""

So our one year anniversary is coming up, and I'm at a loss. I'm not excited for it. I know that she bought me some inappropriately huge present (according to her she told a friend about it and he said ""why? are you sure you want to spend that much?"") and I can't afford to get her much of anything, so I feel terrible about that. I just don't want to hang out that much. I already told her I would spend a lot of the upcoming weekend with her, so she has me down for spending all of Friday evening and all of Saturday. Just not looking forward to it.

Should I break it off with her? I still love her, but I feel she has too many traits that I just don't want to deal with at this point in my life. I'm not sure if I know enough about myself at this point to want ANY relationship. We took a break for a month for all of the above reasons last December and both started seeing therapists. She stopped after we got back together, and whenever I suggest starting again to her, she just blows it off or flat out ignores it. I felt I gave her a chance to change things, but she doesn't want to so I can't help her. She expects me to be the cure to any issues she has. I don't know. Just not sure I should stay around any more. Help me, reddit!"

I'm pretty sure I'm not going to get an internship this summer due to applying pretty late and having mediocre credentials. Here's how it is...

I have no real extracurricular activities (volunteering, active club membership etc) and leadership. My GPA is mediocre at the moment (&lt;3.0) but my major GPA is a 4.0. My only past experience is a minimum wage customer service job. Not sure how my skill set compares to others in my major; I know Excel/Publisher/PPT etc, SQL (barely but willing to familiarize), photoshop and plan on developing some skills over the summer....Also, my network sucks! My family and family friends all are small business owners of restaurants and dry cleaners. And I haven't made an effort to draw connections from elsewhere.

Long story short, I fucked up pretty bad my first year and it has made me pretty unmotivated and depressed to do anything for myself. But since seeing counseling and advising, I want to be very proactive from now on.  Even though I feel like it's too late. 

I ~~HOPE~~ NEED to get an internship of sorts (preferably in supply chain, accounting, human resources, but anything really...) next Spring semester. For Fall term, I plan on joining a finance related club and actually be an active member. I'm going to get an alumni mentor to help me in my job search endeavors. My GPA will increase to above 3.0 by the end of that term (probably) because I'm taking 18 hours (let me know if this is too much). I'm going to try to get an on campus tutoring job or work study. Also, I'm expecting a leadership position of some sort in a new upcoming club. 

ANY tips, support, words of wisdom for me? What things could I do over the summer to amp up my resume and really set myself apart? What are some skills to develop that are attractive to employers?

TL;DR Feeling pretty desperate to get an internship...Any things I could do over the summer/Fall to make myself more attractive to employers to land an internship in the Spring.

I've changed the names because my friend looks at reddit.


TL;DR


Anyway like the title says I fell in love with my best friend girlfriend (They've been dating for almost 3 years), and the way things have been I guess could be described as anything ranging from ""awkward"" to ""tense."" Initially, I didn't have any interest in her for the obvious reason that she was dating my best friend, however as time went on I started to like her more and more to the point where I had a crush. After that, one night we spent several hours alone talking waiting for my friend Rob to get off work (He works 5pm-12am, or 4-11pm) and that's when I guess I decided that I didn't just have a crush, but that I loved her. (I should mention that I hangout with Rob and Rene almost everyday, (up until recently) so Rene and I waited together for him to get off  5-7 days a week.)


I know the TL;DR normally goes at the end of the post but in this case it kind of helps for me to put it at the start. 


Rob and Rene started dating when he and I were both 20, and I think Rene was 17 at the time. Out of all our friends, I was the only one that didn't see a problem with Rob dating a 17 year old, mostly because I didn't see it being any of my business and I supported them both which I guess must have made Rene think highly of me and she got me a mug (because Rob mentioned I'm a big tea and coffee drinker) with my nickname on it which I thought was a little weird because I had only known her for a month or so, but I was gracious about it and accepted the gift and honestly I love that fucking mug so much.


Fast forward to Valentines day, Rob and I are now both 21 and while I was alone with Rob he told me he was thinking about breaking up with Rene so he could be ""free"" for the summer (whatever that means since Rob doesn't go to bars, or go clubbing or anything of the sort.) I told him I thought it was a mistake and actually kinda pushed him to stay with Rene because I knew how happy he was to be with someone who loved him, despite his flaws and short comings. So, they stayed together, and somewhere between valentines day and the start of summer, Rene and I started texting each other.


So summer started that year, and during the summer Robs hours get extended so he gets off work later and Rene would sit at home and wait for him to get off work, because she was a host and obviously didn't work as long hours. So, one day Rene asked me if I wanted to come pick her up and go on a bake route (Basically smoke weed and drive around, stupid I know for numerous reasons.) We drove around for a few hours and ended up parking on a residential street and got stoned, listened to music, and talked. This was the first time both of us learned any details about our respective personal lives beyond what her and Rob had shared with me and vice versa. (i.e family, pets, college, friends, interests, hobbies.)


So this became a pretty regular thing, and Rob knew about it and didn't mind and I checked with him multiple times over the course of the summer and fall that year. Sometimes, we'd hop in my truck and go for a bake route, or sometimes we'd sit out on the back deck of their house in the dark and smoke. This cycle repeated itself all the way through to the next spring/summer, and it wasn't until this past summer that I started to realized that I might actually love her. I wasn't sure, and I guess I'll never be sure if she felt the same way about me because I've only had one girlfriend and she just used me for whatever she wanted at the time.


That feeling got confirmed over the course of mid-june 2013 when we were waiting for Rob to get off work, I told Rene I was kinda tired and wanted to lay down and she went and got me the pillow she sleeps with  and her favorite blanket, and started playing country music (which I used to loath) and told me to ignore my dislike of country and just listen to the melody of the songs, so I did while I was falling asleep. Anyway I woke up, and I remember feeling different somehow. I couldn't put my finger on what exactly felt different but when I sat up on the couch, I just remember looking over at Rene and saw her looking at Facebook on her laptop. She looked up at me and for what felt like the longest time we held eye contact, and I'm not talking staring contest eye contact, I'm talking about significant, intimate, eye contact. After what I can only assume was a few minutes, she asked me if I wanted to keep her company outside while she smoked a cig (I only smoked weed at the time, now I'm sober.) So I said sure, and we went out on the back deck and she started playing country music through her laptop, and after the 3rd or 4th song had passed, I realized that not only did I not hate country music anymore, I knew the lyrics to most of the songs in the set list she made, and I wanted to hear more country songs. After this particular night, I realized that everything I thought and felt about Rene had changed, and I realized I loved her. 


This is where the problems, self-loathing, and guilt started to sink in to me. Over the next couple of months, I started to feel more and more guilty about the way I felt towards Rene, but I didn't want to change my pattern of behavior for two reasons. One I was enjoying spending time with her and two I didn't want to raise any suspicions because I didn't want them to cut me out of their lives. Eventually, I ended up not being able to take the guilt or deal with my shame I felt anymore and purposefully told Rene's best friends boyfriend, whom I knew would tell them because I lacked the courage to tell them myself. Rob has been my best friend for the better part of a decade, and I knew him when we were both very young (he used to stop me from getting bullied.) I wanted to tell him and apologize to him over and over again, but I could never muster the courage too, which is disappointing to me because I have a strong constiution and morality.


The fallout wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be. They didn't hangout with me for a week, which let me know something was up, and deep down I knew what it was. They had found out about my feelings for Rene, and after a week Rob called me. I asked him if just he and I could talk and he said that sounded great and that he missed me. Anyway, I went to go pick Rob up and I just remember rambling and rambling and making no sense and finally he just said ""troubledthrowaway01, you're still both mine and Rene's friend, we're not mad or disappointed at you."" I was stunned. Anyone else would have bashed my teeth out, and told me I was a dirtbag and a snake, and Rob just told me that I was still his best friend no matter what. I couldn't believe it. 


Things went back to normal for them, or atleast so I thought. This is where it gets complicated, I can't tell from this point on if I'm the one who's having issues with awkwardness, remorse, and self-loathing, or if Rob and Rene have been playing off my feelings to continue getting me to keep preforming small to large random acts of kindness. (I'm generous to all my friends pretty equally (I.e I pay for meals when we go out, I always shared what weed I had, and if any of them need a ride to or from somewhere I'm reliable and will pick them up.))


Ever since Rob and Rene found out about the way I feel, it feels like Rene tries whenever she wants something to attempt to get me to comply by guilt tripping me/wooing me (not seducing, nothing has ever been sexual between us.)  I wouldn't say that Rene guilt trips me or attempts to get me to do something for her all the time, but when she does it makes me feel like crap. That, coupled with Rob's decline in interest to talk when I hangout with them has started to make me feel...uncomfortable and I've tried addressing the issue of Rob not being interested in conversation, the activity we're doing, or much of anything really but nothing ever comes out of it. Rene on the other hand is still very willing to talk to me during hangouts, and share details with her day with me while Rob just sits here and looks at his phone or plays pokemon X. 


They're not bad people, but whether they're acting this way intentionally or subconsciously it causes problems occasionally and I end up isolating myself from them for a few weeks to a month. Like I said earlier too, I'm not sure if Rene ever really loved me, or it was just my loneliness convincing me that we had a connection. I tried to rationalize it, and still do from time to time in my head that she did love me with things like (She could be hanging out with her best friend right now instead of me, or watching tv alone, or whatever.) 


I haven't seen them in roughly 3 or 4 weeks, and I've been taking better care of myself, (I've been working out harder because I am a big dude I  Went from 550+lbs down to 378 in about a year and a half) volunteering, doing yard work, and looking for internships related to computer science.  I'm writing this right now because in an hour or so I'll be going to hangout with them. I just wanted reddits input on what I should do at this point. I don't really feel anything but neutrality and numbness towards Rene now since I haven't seen her in a month, so I think that this friendship is worth keeping as long as I'm able to say no to unreasonable requests/special requests and if I can get Rob engaged and talking again.


What do you think r/relationships? I know that the length of a friendship doesn't make it a good friendship but since I've been (or possibly have) moved passed my feelings I think that things may return to the way they used to."

238d7v,40,2014-04-16,"How to Build a Network Like Macklemore's, Step-by-Step",stillnotahipster,WeAreTheMusicMakers,https://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/238d7v/how_to_build_a_network_like_macklemores_stepbystep/,"A lot of people praise Macklemore for being an ""independent artist"" who has accomplished a lot without a label backing him up- multiple chart-topping singles, Grammy awards, heavy radio rotation, sold out stadium shows- the stuff that's usually reserved for the top stars on major label rosters. What the average consumer (and even the occasional aspiring musician) probably isn't aware of is the EXTENSIVE team/network behind him, making all of these amazing things happen- a network that includes major label radio promo departments, a fantastic manager, dedicated fans working on his behalf (even before he had extensive celebrity), and more. 


Without further ado, here's a broad overview of how to make music industry connections in 7 manageable (not always simple, but not impossible) steps:


**1. Be your own biggest cheerleader first**

There are a couple elements to this: First off, your art needs to kick ass. It doesn't have to be perfect (how much music do you see getting a lot more attention than yours that sounds ""meh""), but it needs to be something that you're honestly proud of, that objective listeners have praised and expressed a legitimate love for. This is the easiest way to be confident and sell yourself- having a legitimately great ""product""/cause. 

If you're going to ask people to believe in you and be apologetic for asking, don't bother. If you aren't confident in yourself, why ask other people to take the leap? This isn't the time to be looking for external approval or praise- ask your friends if you want that. Walk into this process feeling good (not cocky or egotistical, but confident and assured) that you have music worth hearing and working for. 


**2. Identify the players you need on your team**

What are your goals? To get on some sort of radio? You'll need a radio promoter. Is it to go on tour? A booking agent. Don't have enough traction to do ""anything""? You want a manager who will argue on behalf to people like a booking agent or radio promoter. This step is pretty simple, so I'll leave it at this. 


**3. DTFR: Do The ~~fu~~..err... Fabulous Research**

This is where you do your own little private headhunting. Want a record label? Identify 5-10 labels that release things that sound similar to you, figure out who does their A&amp;R. Want a radio promoter? Go shopping and see who does radio promo for your favorite artists. Google is your friend, maybe a LinkedIn premium account is your friend, literally any stalking tool possible. Once you have names, find their email address, find out who your mutual friends are on Facebook, figure out their cat's name. What's going on at their company, what projects are they starting, what do they like to do in their spare time? 


**4. Reach out, be succinct, and offer them value**

There's one tactic here that will increase your chances of success literally tenfold- *get introduced*. Nothing beats a warm introduction, even when it's just via email. How do you ask for an introduction? Here's a sample request I could send to a potential connector, along with some comments showing what I'm doing (email them, facebook them, whatever): ""Hey Bill- so sick that you guys are putting on that Shooby Taylor show at the Rat's Nest next week! [say Hi if you aren't homies, build rapport] I saw you're friends with Robby from the Koncertz Agency- we're looking to tour this summer and I think we would fit really well on the bill for Discoband's tour. Would you mind introducing us so that I could pitch him on the idea and give him some numbers on our draw? [using the lingo that promoters/bookers use, showing that I understand his business, and OFFERING HIM VALUE- our draw]"" 

This is a pretty direct ask- for times when you think you need a subtler approach, or won't be able to get an introduction, I'm a fan of starting a conversation/connection by asking if they'd be willing to answer 2-3 questions you have about their job/experiences. Important people love to have their brain picked, as long as you do it in a way that's respectful of their time and you ask GOOD questions. 

Just to illustrate ways that I've creative gotten introductions and used the ""interviewing"" approach: I've gotten job opportunities at record labels by using a LinkedIn premium account to look for people who have interned there in the past, asked these former interns if I could ask them a few questions about their experience there, and then after having that conversation, tactfully asked them to introduce me to the management at the label itself. 


**5. Persistence is courteous and respectable, not annoying**

If somebody doesn't get back to you, DON'T BE AFRAID to try consistently to get in touch with them/get their attention. I'm not saying be an annoying fanboy, email them every day, or contact them on email AND twitter AND facebook AND comment on their instagrams. That being said, people are *very busy* in today's world, and often times may need some prodding before they get back to you. It's completely courteous to send followup emails every few days, unless they say ""Hey you freak stop emailing me."" That rarely happens though. In fact, I can't tell you how many times I've had people say ""Hey, thanks SO MUCH for being consistent here- I've been so swamped this week and would've totally forgotten to get back to you if you hadn't pinged me again. Sorry about that!"" Hell, I myself have told people that countless times. Persistence is courteous and respectable, not annoying. 

This is true AFTER you initially make a connection as well. Keep in touch! Every 1-3 weeks, shoot them an email with an article you think they'd be interested, a connection you encountered to something you two have talked about, etc. etc. Just keep following up to say hi and casually share something (that ADDS VALUE)


**6. Ask**

Going into any sort of persuasion/influence tactics is way outside the scope of this Reddit post, so I'm keeping this step simple. **ASK** for what you want. Speak in terms of the benefits they could gain. Be direct, and be confident. Remember- your music is worth believing in. 


**7. Do the work**

Follow-through on YOUR responsibilities. If you expect a manager to help you by promoting you to all of their connections, trying to get you shows and opportunities, they expect YOU to continue making great music, doing what you can to promote yourself, building your own connections, playing polished and exciting gigs, etc. etc. If you expect other people to do all of your work for you.... just get out now. Understand what YOUR responsibilities are, versus what your team has signed on to help you with. 



**Alright, that's a LOT of writing for a Reddit post.** I hope these tips, although they just skim the surface of this stuff, are really helpful. I think I'm going to start writing a lot more on building music industry relationships and other Music Systems that I've tested to build success in the music industry, so if you want to read more of this type of stuff I have a [brand-new mailing list](http://forms.aweber.com/form/97/1451014297.htm) I just started (not selling anything, don't worry!)

* engineering student
* a lot of really great things going for me, including fantastic internships at fortune 20 companies, stuff like that
* older
* do poorly on exams, never really get As unless it's something I'm naturally good at
* diagnosed with insomnia and depression
* veteran

I saw a therapist for awhile, but, frankly, it's way too difficult for me because I can't take what they say seriously, and I can't buy into many of the ""do xyz"" things.... I've tried others, and this therapist is a senior therapist who is supposed to be experienced. I don't really feel like they care that much, so I stopped going. 

Most days, I have reoccurring thoughts that I'm disgusting, stupid, worthless, etc.... How can I feel valuable when I don't really have any friends outside of school, or no romance to make me feel that way? I got rid of social media, because it was making me feel bad. I don't feel intelligent at all. I do ok in school, but I'm definitely not an A student, but I also feel like school isn't that hard. I really try and find active ways of getting rid of negative influences in my life. 

I've given philosophical approaches a shot, but it doesn't seem to be helping. I have ""good"" days and ""bad"" days. I really don't want to feel this way, but most days, and excuse the cliche, I feel like somebody is just standing on my chest, or pushing my shoulders down. I have reoccurring thoughts of people in my life dying, or me dying. 

I'm not looking for sympathy. I'll never get that. I just don't know what else I can do, and I've been this way for quite awhile.  This is a shot in the dark I guess. I'm not sure what I'm looking for? Somebody to tell me it's ok, even though I know it's not? 

Thanks for any help/advice I can get. 

-edit-

I also have very low self esteem. I've had a lot of sexual partners, but not many loving/caring relationships? My last relationship I was verbally abused. My last sexual partner pressured me into it, and after just stopped talking to me. I'm not sure how much these things have affected me. :("

How do I move on without feeling like this everyday?",[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/238vc5/stuck_ashamed_and_alone_how_do_i_move_on_without/,"Hello r/depression. I need to talk. For three years I hid my depression from friends, family, and work. It wasn't until about 5 months ago that my employer reached out to me about what was wrong which led me to admit that I was a chronic marijuana user. That week was when my depression fully surfaced. They were supportive and suggested that I look into rehab. So on the night of December 18th, 2013 I smoked an eighth of the weed to myself outside of a hotel room close to the facility I was scheduled to check in with the next morning.



I stayed there for 21 days with no internet, video games, television or outside communication. I was given a routine which began at 6am that included group therapy, individual counseling, AA, NA CDA meetings, 3 meals, and free time that concluded at 11pm. I can honestly say that I want to return just to have the structure back in my life. 

It felt great being given the tools to deal with my problems head on, but as soon as I was discharged I felt a major shift in my outlook. The sober living house I moved into is isolating. The guys are much older (I'm 25) and are consistently joking about their old days of getting fucked up and sleeping with girls in AA. I haven't had a relationship in 3 years, but hearing them joke about it makes me upset that I can't find something more meaningful and causes me to question if I should try their methods to satisfy my needs. 

That's not the problem though. Sex isn't what I want, nor is it a relationship. What I want most right now is job satisfaction. Something I can wake up every morning excited to do and come home feeling like what I did actually had a purpose. The worst part is that I have an opportunity in front of me, but no clear path to get there. It's like a giant puzzle without any picture for reference. I'm obsessed with solving it, but it's become debilitating. 

I work as a job coach for adults with developmental disabilities and last year I attempted to create a [vocational training program](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEHQJW-Y9Z4) with a local university. The idea was to create workplace internships for my team that would give them better job experience and education about working in the community. This project was very important to me, nothing had been done like it before in my area and I knew it would help me get a scholarship for grad school to pursue a career in public policy / assistive technology. We spent 6 months planning for the contract by cleaning offices and animal shelters but it was eventually pulled from the bidding process. That week was when my addiction fully surfaced. 

I went from being a casual smoker to full blown multiple times a day while perseverating over this failure and coming up with ways to try something new. But nothing worked. I kept having ideas and never acting on them. I stopped hanging out with friends and felt safe by myself playing video games or doing research. The truth is, weed kept me motivated. It was my reason to get up every morning and it caused me to think about how I'd want to improve my life and my job. I'm trying my hardest now to get myself happy and productive again without subjecting myself to drugs or alcohol and it sucks. 

In the future I need structure and moderation. Right now my structure and sense of purpose is lost. Sleep has become my new drug. It takes so much out of me just to get out of bed and put a smile on my face before work. I'm hoping to talk to anyone who can advise me on what to do to get myself back to normal. I've been prescribed Lexapro and Buspirone, but I'm convinced that my depression is purely environmental. I have no family nearby, I'm hopelessly trying to do something important at my job, my friends are moving on and the worst part of all is that I'm alone in almost everything that I do.  

How do I get over this slump without carrying my past with me?"

Even though I'm surrounded by friends and people who care I always feel like I'm just by myself. 

For some background I guess I have to start about 3 or so years back. I was diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma at the age of 19. Being in college I had to take a leave of absence because they wanted to start the treatment right away to hopefully stop it from spreading anymore than it had. At the time of diagnosis I was handling it pretty well and everything seemed fine. I had to come home from school to do all this but I had just begun a relationship with my best friend. However she was in Massachusetts and I in New York so it was long distance. We were madly in love and everything was great, or so I thought. I realized much later that even though I was the one fighting for my life I was continuing to have to be strong for both parties in the relationship and it took a toll on me mentally. This caused arguing and fighting because no matter what I did I couldn't help her overcome her anxiety issues even when I convinced her that talking to a school therapist didn't mean she was crazy. All the while having to deal with the mental and physical stress of chemotherapy. Fast forward six months to when my treatment was over I had unfortunately formed blot clots from the change of my blood composition and had to be put on blood thinners for another six months. I actually pin point this as to where my depression started and remember the emotional breakdown I had when they told me. The unfortunate thing about this was I was a very active person before getting sick ( I had already gained 20 lbs from not being able to move really for six months ) and I had to wait another six to play any sports I enjoyed or even spend too much time in the sun. This sent me on a spiral because I had been wanting to go back to normal for the entire time I was sick. 

I went back to school in the fall of 2011 and began working my ass off to catch up. I had missed two quarters of classes and a summer I could have been interning somewhere. My girlfriend moved to Rochester ( where I was in school ) to complete an internship and to be with me while she did it and I appreciated it immensely. However the fighting wasn't stopping and I couldn't figure out why ( mind you I had no idea I was depressed at this point ). Fast forward through the year and my roommates and I who were best friends when we started living together all started to resent each other. My girlfriend moved back to school to finish her last semester and had planned to move back to Rochester with me the next fall. I didn't necessarily want her to move in with me because I thought her living with friends she had here was a better idea so that the two of us could have space. Unfortunately it was all or nothing. So I agreed to it and we planned to move in together. While at school she ""cheated"" on me by letting another guy kiss her. She called me the night it happened and told me everything. I bottled it up and let it go at the time but I think secretly I resented her for it. So fast forward to us moving in together and she's now having doubt's about everything. About a month in to living together I agree to go see a therapist because I'm not getting better mentally and this is when I had the realization that I was depressed but I didn't know what to do about it. Fast forward a couple months and she breaks up with me while living together. Joy. 

Unfortunately this has a traumatic effect on my mental state and I pretty much went into a major downward spiral. I had to rethink everything about my life all at once and I had lost my best friend even though we still had to live together for six months before she could move out. That was a fun period of time. Since then I've been dating and such ( this all happened from January 2013 on ) however not been able to form a stable connection with anyone. I lost a lot of friends during my stages of depression and the breakup and its made it incredibly difficult for me to trust or make new friends in general due to the fear of going through it all again. I've caught myself purposefully self sabotaging potential relationships for no reason and I can't figure it out. I had shut out my family for a while and have slowly been letting them back in.

I graduate this summer and have a full time job lined up in August in Norwalk, CT that I'm incredibly excited about but I'm terrified of the making friends process and relationship process.  

The question I guess is does anyone have advice about how to handle this? The whole feeling alone and purposefully self sabotaging relationships without actually knowing it?


Apologize in advance if the story is a bit confusing. It's a bit of a brain dump and felt good to kind of write it all down."

My main issue here is that I have no relevant experience and don't want to go to grad school right away, and want to get a job in a computer science related field.  I am in a dual major program for math and computer science, but ultimately lean more towards the math end of this.  I really enjoyed number theory, and I have also enjoyed most my class where we code in python doing math oriented programming.  I do eventually want to go to grad school, probably for a masters in computer science or a phd in math if I don't end up liking computer science, as I haven't gotten very far in to the course load.  What kind of job should I look for in the 1 to 2 year interim that would set me up for success where I could use my math background and my computer science skills?

I was wondering if there are any places that would consider letting me join their team. I enjoy building things properly for people on the web. 

My goals for this summer are:

1. Join a team and use my skills to help in anyway I can.

2. Allow room for my own personal growth, I think actually working within a setting of other talented people would be a valuable experience. 

3. Increase project productivity. Both personal and professionally. 

If anyone would like more information please ask or pm. My professional work is limited, to just about one client who I am working with as a freelancer.  I've got a github, a personal site, and an active twitter if you would like to see more about me.  I've also some ideas for projects that I want to take on myself this summer, but it would be really nice if I could get my foot in the door professionally. Any recommendations on where I should look for such an internship would be greatly appreciated. "
2395qs,7,2014-04-17,Trying to be supportive during SO's job search (rant/advice) [22f],AgainstHope,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/2395qs/trying_to_be_supportive_during_sos_job_search/,"So I've been a lurker for awhile, but this is my first post in this subreddit, so I guess I'll give some history.

Me (22f) and my boyfriend (23m) have been together ~3 years now and have been long distance (2k miles cross country) for a little under a year.  We met and started dating sophomore year in college.  During our 2 years together in college we were long distance for ~9 months on and off for 2 summer internships and 1 semester abroad, but we lived together our entire senior year.   On graduation we both got job offers, but not in the same place.  I was the more employable of the two of us and could have turned down my offer and looked in his area, but we both agreed the offer was too good to turn down and was a job I loved, whereas he wasn't thrilled with his position, so we'd do long distance again, and in a year he'd start looking at new positions in my region.  That was last May.

He didn't make it to a year.  He hates his job, and started looking for other work within 3 months.  The focus has mainly been on jobs where I am, but he hasn't gotten very far, mainly rejections or ""we'll keep you in mind for future positions"" sort of form letter responses.  I'd originally offered to look for work where he is, but I like my job and have better pay/benefits/location for both of us, whereas he dislikes his job, current location, and pretty much everything to do with the situation, so at least for now it doesn't make sense.  We'd just live together with one job if we could, but we're both in technical fields where every year of unemployment kills job prospects by a ton, and we both have student loan debt, so if we lived together on 1 salary right now we'd be screwing ourselves over long term.

Recently though a new position at his company opened up, one that's in a better department and more the type of work he enjoys.  It's the sort of job he wouldn't hate, and he got an interview for it.  On the one hand, I'm thrilled for him, finally someone's giving him a chance, and he doesn't have to feel so defeated, and it might finally make his day-to-day life less depressing.  So I want to be supportive, and I'm trying so hard to be.  But on the other hand, he's getting all excited about this position, and all I can think of is the reality of what it means for our relationship.  If he gets this job, he'll be staying where he is for at least another year before even looking for work where I am, and that's from after he starts the job, which due to their hiring practices might not even be for 2-3 months.  So while I'm trying to be supportive-girlfriend all I can think in my head is that this is just postponing our end date, that it's just longer that he's so far away from me.

I have talked to him about this.  We're a very open couple.  He says he understands, that he wishes he could get a job out here instead, but that this job might make him more attractive to companies in my area in the long term. He doesn't expect me to be as excited about it as he is, and I'm not UNhappy about it.  I am thrilled for him... at the same time though I'm sad for us.  He says he gets that, but I can tell it hurts him that I'm not as optimistic as usual with this job app. I feel bad for being selfish... but I don't know how to be more supportive, at least not genuinely right now.

I'm sorry for the long rant.  I'm not sure what I'm looking for exactly, but I think I just wanted to get this off my chest, hopefully to an audience that at least sort of understands how hard it is to be so far apart.  If anyone's gone through something similar I'd love to hear how you dealt with it?  Or any general advice on being supportive to your SO in these kinds of situations?

Thanks for listening...

tl;dr - My boyfriend is applying for a job that'll keep us LD for at least another year.  It's better than his current position, and would make his day-to-day life better, but I'm having a hard time being supportive for selfish reasons, cause I want him here with me."
239b1p,6,2014-04-17,"Looking for a dual monitor dev setup, possible gaming",indigojuice,buildapcforme,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcforme/comments/239b1p/looking_for_a_dual_monitor_dev_setup_possible/,"* What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible. 

There's what I need and what I want. What I *need* is a PC that I can
develop on. That means compiling large software projects, running multiple operating systems, running multiple virtual machines *at once* and using all of them *at once*.

I need to have two monitors with HD high quality screens. I have poor vision, in particular I have a condition that makes glare very difficult for me - if it's possible to take this into account that would be amazing for me. In particular I need less-glare, screens that I can see from a bit of an angle (my current laptop screen is totally terrible when you look from the side), and high resolution.

 

* What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes? 

I would like to spend no more than 1,000 dollars. However, if you have some super primo whatevermajig that'll be amazing, I can maybe go over. I'm a student, this is all internship money, it's not like I'm rolling in it. If you can save me some money, of course, I'll love you for it.

* When do you plan on building/buying the PC? 

August but I could put it off until like mid-September or something if some new thing'll be released. Latest I'd want is December, really would prefer not to push it that late.

* What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc) 

I have a Samsung 830 128GB SSD
(this i believe http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIA0AJ0ZF4605 )

and that's it. So I'll need 'the works'. Mouse, keyboard, two monitors, tower, everything *except* Windows. I have my own Windows licenses and I'll primarily be on Linux anyways.

And I realize this is not the best place to ask but I'm also in the market for a chair - outside of the computer budget. If you have any suggestions on that, again, much appreciated.

* Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location? 


I'm in the US - New York. I don't have access to one as far as I know

* If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated. 

As mentioned, the Samsung 830 SSD is all I've got. Link above.

* Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU? 

If it's simple and painless (ie: run program, it's done) then perhaps. But most likely not interested unless it's necessary.

* Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc) 

I'm mostly leaving that to your discretion. A solid chunk of hard drive space for my files would be nice and I can just put the OS's on my SSD. Lots of RAM for VMs, preferably a nice CPU for compiling. 

If it's in the budget I'll take a nice GPU , but if not just prioritize the aspects that will matter for the activities mentioned.

* Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components? 

I don't like flashy/ gaudy things. Minimalist is nice. I'll just cover LED's anyways since I have to sleep in the room with this thing.

* Do you already have a copy of Windows 7 or 8, or do you need a copy included with the build? 

I will handle the Windows part.

* Extra info if required:

I guess I'd say 12GB of RAM minimum (16GB would be nice), preferably a quad core CPU (intel), as long as the HDD is 500GB or more that's fine.

edit: Oh, and maybe something to protect from power surges. That happens sometimes.

If there's any other information you all need just let me know.

23aclw,1,2014-04-17,"My crazy roller coaster ride, a 4 year span, all for you ENTs!",[deleted],trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/23aclw/my_crazy_roller_coaster_ride_a_4_year_span_all/,"It all started in the summer of 2009.  I was away working at a company as an intern engineer.  That summer/fall I came back home to finish up some general education classes at my local community college.   My mother had managed to do the yard work without me and then some.  My first week back I was mowing the lawn like I always did, I get towards the back of the yard and there it was, an 8 foot male plant.   I stopped the lawn mower to inspect it, I went inside, her and I had an awkward discussion, she said her friend gave her these seeds as a joke and told her that they were really challenging to grow.

Now, I’ve been drunk before, a few times, I remember hating being hung over the next day.  That pretty much did it for me as far as drugs are concerned.  But growing it out in the open, in plain view, hidden among the Earth, it jolted me into a new exciting way of thinking.  I did research, I spent weeks reading up on it, strains, equipment, laws, basically everything out there (I was on my neighbor’s wireless internet, so I wasn’t worried).  

Then I found it, her little stash, she had it curing in a plastic sandwich bag. I carefully examined it, and saw a few seeds hanging out of the pods.  She must have cut down the female plant and let the male plant just keep growing. I took a whole branch, and picked the seeds out.   I bagged the buds for my friend to try, (this friend will have a key role later on).  So now I had the first key part in my future plot to rule the world!  

Fast forward to the spring of 2010.  I planted a few outside with her permission. They got damn big, but still were not producing buds. Towards the end of the summer an old fling and I re-connected.  This girl said she smoked, so I figured this was something her and I could do to bring us closer.  How fucking wrong was I?!  I get a Facebook message from a pal of mine that said her and her ex-boyfriend were going to steal it all from my.  So I blew the lid off of all the secrets and verbally threatened both of them that if anything happened, “something” would happen to their pets.  I cut everything down and that was it for me for a while.

“The weed be lettin’ you know… evil lurks” – “Smokey” Friday, 1995.

So now it’s March 2011.  I got a small indoor kit and planted some seeds.  The idea was to get them to be about 8 inches tall and then put them outside.  I got everything to 8 inches and put out the most robust of the bunch.  “YES!”  I thought after I put all them in the ground!  The first two weeks went good, then it happened, frost… all was lost.   It got too cold for anything else and the few I had left inside were getting lanky and burned from the light.  I threw in the towel at this point.  I didn’t have the freedom and space to do this the way I wanted, I put the project on the back burner.  I told a close friend of mine about my struggles, (the friend from paragraph 3), he told me that the market around us was dry as shit, no game in town and we’d do well.  That was all I needed to hear.  

January 2013.  I purchased my first house in the whitest neighborhood in my area.  Got together some equipment, some was high quality but I remember my shade was held up with a twisted coat hanger.  It worked decent and we got our first batch!  Gave some away for people to try and moved all of it.  Now here is where this “friend” started to reveal his true colors.  Off the bat, we agreed to put all the profits back into it for equipment upgrades and supplies, he said “nah man, let’s just split the profits 50/50”.  I was fine with that, which meant he didn’t own any of the equipment and I could liquidate it at any moment or sell to someone else if the opportunity presented itself.  So I moved on.

Now we’re at batch #2.  I had some very nice stuff now folks!  My “friend” (soon to be partner and not friend) wants a bigger role (Idk why).  He wanted to sell it faster, so he kept the jars of it at his place (the dark and damp basement of another friend’s house) so he could sell it right after it fully cured.  One day he comes by the next week and accuses me of giving him shitty trees.  I basically yelled at him and said that the only thing done differently was what he wanted to do different, I blamed him and took everything back in case he tried to say it was bad and just sell it anyway and keep the profits.   I am now cautious, leery, and short tempered with this guy, he apologizes verbally with a laundry list of excuses.  I now own all the equipment, he is just the guy on the streets and we have completely separate roles.  

Batch #3.   So after much stress and patience it finally happened, we got a batch worthy of some serious money (a few thousand a piece for each of us).   At some point between my handover to him, his pill dealer died, my friend found this guy dead on his couch from a massive heart attack.   My friend was pretty shook up so I gave him a lot of slack, I knew he wanted to tell me to back off asking about the money so I did, I honestly felt bad that he lost a friend.

Backup for a sec!!!  My fiancée told me to stop growing, she wanted to have friends over and the smell was too strong to hide at this point.   So after Batch #3 in December 2013, I shut it all down (it’s still shut down as of now).  

Batch #3 cont’d: January 2014.  I’m kicking back and waiting for the cash.  But my former pal is going down a tough road with losing his “friend” and getting evicted from his apartment for letting two other people live there without documentation.  I asked what was the status of my money and then he tells me “I had to get my car repaired and needed a down payment on my apartment”.  He didn’t ask if it was ok or anything, he just did it, took my money and funded his well-being.  I told him, and I quote “if you don’t give me the money you owe me, I am going to give you a scar, it will be on your hand, every time you look at it you’ll remember how you tried to screw me, you have 4 months to pay me back”.

Aftermath:  After him and I not speaking for a few weeks, and his pill dealer dying, he invites me over to his place.  It was a decent place I guess, he looked cleaner, more alert and with it, making eye contact and everything.  He said he’s going to pay me and that I’m his first priority along with more apologizing.  So here I am, an envelope with about 2K in it, waiting to be spent on a tent and supplies for grow room 2.0.  He still owes me about $400 but so far so good.  I have a parts list and hopefully after my wedding in June, it’ll start up again!  But until then, we wait…

Just thought I’d share my behind the scenes experiences from the beginning!  Questions?  Comments?  Suggestions?

23adia,1,2014-04-17,"At my workplace, almost everyone dislikes me, how should I react to their teasing?",[deleted],socialskills,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialskills/comments/23adia/at_my_workplace_almost_everyone_dislikes_me_how/,"Ok so, I work at this law building, and our office is made of 7 people (including me). I work here for 9 months now and I can say that 4 of them dislikes me (including my boss). In front of me, my boss is a sweerheart, she will help me with anything I need etc, but you just know when someone is talking shit behind your back. Then there's this girl and this guy, let's call them Ashley and John. They work here for a year now, and I don't know if they dislike me because I'm the younger here, or if I am in fact an idiot, but I doubt that, because I mostly just stay here using the computer doing my work, and I'll only talk to any of them if I have a work question or if they talk to me first. I've had to put up with some of Ashley and John's teasing (John is like Ashley's dog, he will do ANYTHING for her, so he uses me as a way to look funnier to Ashley by ""putting pranks"" on me). Here are a few things that happened:

* I can't count how many times I got here to start working on my computer, and there was a funny picture on my desktop. I mean, it got annoying already. Today I got here and there was a picture of a really ugly woman. I know it was John since he used my computer this morning, he was probably trying to look funny to my boss and the other girl who works here, let's call her Jessica. (she's new here too, started out last week and is already making fun of me). Jessica had the courage to ask ""Didn't YOU put that picture in there?"" She knew I didn't because she works here in the mornings too, meaning she and my boss saw John putting the picture. And it wasn't the first time as I said, there's always a picture waiting for me when he uses my computer, my boss won't say anything because well she's on their side, she makes fun of me behind my back too.

* In the kitchen, you had to write your name on your cup and let it there on the kitchen so it would be there anything you needed water, I did, and one day I got there, put the water in my cup, when I drank it I tasted sugar in it. Someone  had put sugar on my cup. Funny, I wonder who.

* Ashley teases me all the time, any chance she gets. She tries to look responsable to my boss (who is like her best friend, they met here), Ashley tried to look like she is my boss all the time, telling me what to do or not. She's an intern like me. I have a boss to do that.

I know that Ashley and John hate me, I have proof. My boss is one of those people that goes with the wave, so if everyone is talking shit about me, she will do that too. Never in front of me though. I'm just tired of there people, I'm the younger here but feel like I'm the only mature one. I just try to ignore but I want them to respect me, not feel like it's okay to tease me."
23af73,59,2014-04-17,Robin Hoodlum and his Merry Mandem.,Kazium,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/23af73/robin_hoodlum_and_his_merry_mandem/,"Hello Again! Very surprised how much my last story took off, I even got gold! So here I am with another fantastic tale...this one is from my time working as an unpaid intern, doing help desk for a very very bad university in London, I wont name names, but it's next to the Cutty Sark, for those that care.

Anyway, we worked out of a small 'walk in' clinic which was basically a room with a desk, a computer and some cupboards with basic equipment like cables, keyboards, mice ect. Students would often come in and ask to borrow things for the day, mostly for presentations and group work using the ceiling projectors built into all the classrooms. We would take names so we could keep track of what is coming and going, there was very little trust as there is a lot of theft and vandalism within the school. For some reason, £2.99 mice and keyboards are worth possibly getting expelled over. Anyway, one special day, a group of model students waltz into the clinic demanding a bunch of equipment: 
 * Two VGA Cables 
 * Two HDMI Cables 
 * THREE mice 
 * a keyboard 
 * A monitor (?!?!!?!?)

I ask what it's all for and flatly refuse to give them a monitor. They tell me it's for a presentation in one of the rooms and things are broken. Instead of giving them the equipment I went to the room with the 'broken' equipment, to find it's simply missing. I see what's going on here... Acting on gut feeling, I tell them that I'll 'be right back' and go to the next door classroom which is empty, and oh look...missing equipment... I move onto another, there is a class but they're not using the computer, from outside the door i don't see a keyboard and mouse where it should be. I guess these delinquents are going around pillaging the classrooms for equipment! I go back to the walk-in and call my manager to let him know what's going on. He says he will be down in 5 mins. 2 Mins later he comes rushing down with a head of department! (i better be right or I'm in deep shizzle).

I lead them to the room that the A+ students are sitting in, listening to loud music and shouting at each other. On one of the desks is a pile of equipment, it looked like at least 7-8 different items. There is immediate silence in the room (bar the music in the background, which was quickly fumbled around and turned off). The head of department demanded the students empty their bags, and guess what? A torrent of our equipment comes pouring out, I imagine breaking some of it, but I didn't care honestly, it's worth less than my lunch! There was lots of shuffling and 'That aint mine!', but they soon turned their attention to me, shouting about how I'm a 'rat' and that I 'grassed them up'. They started getting pretty aggressive and I was beginning to worry, but the police were called and all 3 students were held for a day, and then expelled from the Uni. However, they knew my name, where I worked and what time I left for the train station every day...shit... Luckily, I was coming towards the end of my internship, with only about 5 days left of the 2 months. I came to an agreement with my manager to end the internship early in light of recent events. I still got a shining reference with mention of my ability to 'remain calm and make the right decisions when faced with a difficult and unique situation'. I tend to avoid that area now :)

*And they would have gotten away with it, if it wasn't for that meddling intern!*

Thank you for reading.

EDIT: I should clarify, the extent of the theft was not just 'the value of my lunch' that was just the sum of a few items which may have been broken when emptied from one of the students bags at waist height. In total I estimate £400-500 worth of items, ranging from long, high quality cables, splitter cables, wired AND wireless mice/keyboards (most of the value from wireless stuff here) as well as a few USB memory sticks which had names and contact numbers on them (stolen from students, most likely containing course work). Basically anything that wasn't bolted down.  That was what was just on their persons at the time, we had been seeing things going missing for weeks, possibly more unreported theft from other students too. Scumbags deserved what they got."

""Thank you Facebook, finally they have the ability to hire new people."" Seeing as how working for Oculus is one of my dream jobs (I've been part of this community for quite a while) I went straight in today and doubled over the fair looking for Oculus. They weren't there. I asked the administrators outside thinking they were running a bit late.

We both got strung along by our respective others, so when we were at work we'd talk about it and we would both tell each other that they needed to end their relationship, but it always seemed that one of us was in it while the other wasn't and if just flipped around like that every couple of weeks for the past few months.

The other day I told her that my relationship was completely 110% done, and told her how great everything in my life was going with internships and such and she said she was excited for me. She said along the same lines as I did, but she said she's ""not really looking for a relationship right now"" and I didn't really think anything of it because at the time I wasn't either and hadn't even hinted at it so I didn't really think anything of it. 

I ended up telling her that I had food that I was going to cook for my ex one last time (I wanted to go out on a good note) but she, instead, said horrendous things to me. So I said ""I've got all this food with nobody to eat it with"" and my coworker got all excited and invited herself over my place (we have never hung out outside of work) and said she'd bring drinks too. It was so fast and I didn't even really think about what was happening but I said yeah.

So now she is supposed to be coming over tomorrow night and I don't actually really know what is going on. I think she likes me because she always laughs at my stupid jokes and tells me I always make her smile. We also have a work trip planned together that is two weekends and it's going to be a 4 hour car ride one way, so she's clearly comfortable spending extended time with me. But then I'm confused because I'm somewhat oblivious and I probably think too much about things that don't matter.



TL;DR We're both single and she said she wasn't really looking without me even hinting at it, and then she invited herself over for me to cook dinner that was supposed to be for my ex, and she is bringing wine.

Should I treat it as a date? Or should I treat it as just hanging out and having drinks? "

I've got some insane amounts of tech and people skills, and have handled huge amounts of responsibility in this job so far. If qualifications would be useful, I can list some of my skills and responsibilities to see what you all think?

**EDIT:** Skills from this job, as well as some responsibilities:

- Reviewing resumes and applications for new applications to a position below mine. [over 100 applicants a year]
- Interviewing applicants and rating them to determine if they would be material for said job position
- Training new employees
- Designing and improving training sessions
- Upkeep of our technology on site
- Maintenance, repair, and troubleshooting on our devices
- Internet, Networking, and Virus remediation
- Solving customer issues with their devices, be it Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS, other
- On committee meetings for how we communicate out to the rest of the university [student only job, remember?]
- Keeping employees in line and making sure they are happy in the job, and conducting employee evaluations
- Firing employees if necessary
- Excellent troubleshooting with user-end hardware and software
- Conducting outreach events to tell others about the job
- Organizing work group events, training days, etc
- Constant improvements with policy, procedure, hardware, software, and literally anything we can do to make our jobs easier, our customers happier, or our workers happier.
- Lots more.


TL,DR; I am in school, soon to lose my student only job of 4 years which will look excellent on any resume, but it is out of the field of my Degree, and I just want to be in a financially stable job ASAP."
23ap0o,22,2014-04-17,The story of how red pill was forced on me,depressedthrowaway55,TheRedPill,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/23ap0o/the_story_of_how_red_pill_was_forced_on_me/,"Six years ago, I was a well-mannered teen. I was quiet, docile, and complacent. I was the epitamy of a wallflower. One could honestly overlook me four times before realizing I was right next to them. 

The senior year of my high school, I met a girl. She and I hit it off - our first day we made out. After that we hung out a lot and started dating. I fell in love.

She was someone I put all my time into. I put her on the pedestal, and hard. I did no self improvement. It was always about her. This went on for five years. 

She started hanging out with a friend of mine; he is not red pill, exactly, more a creature borne of desperation. But he has enough selfishness to be more ""alpha"" than I. I brought this up to my girlfriend at the time, and she said it was friend crush. I let it slide. 

Finally, after she had done an internship abroad, I had enough. I wasn't getting the ""love I deserved"", or the attention I wanted. 

We split up. A week later, she slept with my old friend, despite her various claims before: he smelled; his fat rolls held mold; he was a bitch.

Needless to say, I was upset when I found out. It was half a year ago and I'm still upset. 

But now I have TRP. I read, and I read. I realized that she wasn't a whore - she was just a woman. A woman who thought she was a little hotter than she is. She and my old friend are now in a relationship. I run into them from time to time, and I want to be better than them. I hit the gym 3, 4 times a week. 

I know my blue pill mistakes. I know the female imperative. I'm still learning,  and boy it can be hard sometimes to let go of that hero image I used to want to be years ago. But I realize that the only one who will ever truly care about me is me. 

So thanks TRP. I'm growing, even if a little slowly, because of you."

I want out of PA and after a lot of research and thought, I have decided that Boulder is a location where I would be happiest in moving to. It's not perfect, no-where is, but it provides that best balance for me and what I desire in a place to live.

My most desired field of work would be in the mobile development field, specifically iOS development (Although I do have some Android knowledge). This is where I have the strongest experience in terms of knowledge, projects, internships, jobs, etc... I have applied at a few places already (Quick Left, Reolv, Jive Software) and have been routinely looking on LinkedIn, http://bdnt.org/hiring, and Indeed.com. As well as just doing general searches here on Reddit and also on Google. Mobile development isn't a must, as nice as it would be, for I have experience in other areas of CS also...

I was wondering if anyone here has any knowledge of places to look for jobs in this career field, great places that are hiring, etc... I realize being out of state puts me at a slight disadvantage but I have the financial means to relocate myself when the time comes, I wouldn't expect that company to pay for this. Any help would be appreciated and I would love to be able to call Boulder home in the near future. "
23ar6z,3,2014-04-17,Can I get some advice about how to use my downtime at work constructively?,throwaway113812,getdisciplined,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/23ar6z/can_i_get_some_advice_about_how_to_use_my/,"Hey, guys. First of all, I'd like to thank the people in this subreddit for helping me make some really positive changes in my life. The X-Effect, in particular, has been incredibly helpful. Okay. Now onto the good stuff

A few months ago, I started an internship at a local startup company. It's great! The hours are the standard 8 to 5, so no more working late for me (at least not in an office), and I'm learning a lot about my chosen field (IT). The problem is that, since this is a startup, there isn't nearly as much structure to this job as I'm used to with work. I used to work my ever-loving ass off at whatever job I happened to have. Most of these, however, were low-level fast food and retail jobs where it was expected of employees to be constantly moving and/or on their feet. 

When I got here, it was a major shock to not have that constant feeling of ""okay! now on to the next thing!"". I'll get a bit of work to do MAYBE once a day, if I'm lucky and then nothing. I could keep asking for more work, but I've done that in the past and ended up slightly annoying my supervisor and I don't want to risk doing that again. 

I've gotten really good in the last few weeks about using my down time constructively, but when I'm at work I feel like I'm not doing what I'm supposed to be doing. The trouble is, there's nothing in particular that I'm supposed to be doing.

Is it okay to do my homework here? Should I learn more about programming? Should I keep bugging my boss? What do you guys think? Thanks in advance!"
23ass1,1,2014-04-17,Electrical Engineer Internship/Grad School Advice,[deleted],engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/23ass1/electrical_engineer_internshipgrad_school_advice/,"I am currently in the hunt for an electrical engineering internship for the summer. Endless job postings have been unsuccessful (thus far), and each posting I find myself tailoring my resume for things I'm not particularly interested in.

I'm a senior at UC Santa Cruz and will graduate in December of this year. I am very interested in embedded systems, sensors and smart grids. I spent the past summer in a lab on campus continuing the development of an energy monitoring wall plug, and in the fall I built my own autonomous robot from scratch (a class I really enjoyed). My senior design project is a small scale power grid which will be used for research and to show control improvements available to the power grid. I will acknowledge I'm no computer scientist, but I do enjoy coding. I would consider myself fairly strong in C, but I have experience with object-oriented java. I'm also beginning to learn python.

Here is my [resume](https://www.dropbox.com/s/rza2u9611i7jq46/Blank.pdf).

For those of you with internships... any suggestions? Any red flags about my resume? I feel guilty playing the ""key-word"" game with the resume scanners and don't want to falsely market myself.

I have a 3.3. Is engineering grad school an option? Also, as it pertains to my interests, I am debating between CS and CE for grad school. Suggestions? Better career options in either direction?"
23avi5,0,2014-04-17,Verizon forcing cancelation fees for someone switching to a Verizon phone provided by his job,[deleted],verizon,https://www.reddit.com/r/verizon/comments/23avi5/verizon_forcing_cancelation_fees_for_someone/,"This is just a story of how Verizon is currently trying to screw over my dad. I just feel like he is being mistreated and I think people should know.
  
So my parents recently got a divorce and my dad had to create his own phone plan. No big deal. But, because of the divorce, he moved to a new city, got a new job, and as a result got a work phone from his new job (he is in HVAC sales). So, he contacted Verizon and wanted his old line (he had it for maybe a month) because he was going to only use his work phone. So, Verizon says no--he has to keep both or pay a cancelation fee.
  
He said that is ridiculous, and that he is still keeping the plan in place (my brother is on it) and still keeping a Verizon phone (the work one), but just using a different Verizon phone (as in, not the personal one). So, because he said he should not have to pay a cancelation fee, Verizon locked (or whatever the right word is) all of the phones on his personal plan.
  
My brother tried to switch over to my mom's plan because he is in college and summer is getting close (and he is in talks with a lucrative agency after accepting an internship). But they will not let him because they said that the fees need to be paid.
  
Verizon is holding his plan hostage all because he said he should not have to pay it, and I think he is right. The debate on cancelation fees aside, he is not backing out of his contract. He is just saying that since he is only using his *other* Verizon phone, he should be able to drop the old (but really only about a month old) phone.
  
I hope this proves true:
  
&gt;All on-topic posts are accepted, even those which may put Verizon in a negative light, but please keep it civil. We are all here to help each other.
  
And any advice that others can give for me to pass on to him would be greatly appreciated. I know that issues like this sometimes just take a nasty call (although that has not worked so far), so any tips are appreciated.
  
**TLDR;** Dad got a VZW work phone, VZW makes him pay for canceling new personal line.
  
Edit: VZW employee redditors -_-"
23axww,1,2014-04-17,Getting some other points of view. (long post),[deleted],depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/23axww/getting_some_other_points_of_view_long_post/,"I guess I'll just start from the beginning. So my folks split when I was 10, and they didn't handle it well at all. My mom moved in with the guy she cheated on my dad with, and he ended up being about as much of an asshole as my dad was. My dad had major anger issues, and was pretty abusive emotionally, even getting physical with me once right before the divorce. They didn't really explain anything to me, I just got dropped off at my new house with my new step dad one day. 

Things were alright at first, but ""new dad"" soon showed his angry and violent side. I went from being a model kid, to hating almost everything but smoking weed and music. I got into a little bit of trouble with the law around the age of 13, and basically became the family fuckup for the rest of my teens. I learned my lesson, but was still treated like the classical burden stepchild anytime I was home.

I quit breaking the law, except for weed, and pretty much stayed away from my house as much as possible. Being around my step dad was like constantly walking on eggshells. There really were no specific triggers, he was just a depressed and angry person who wanted to take it out on the easiest target in the house, me. So I stayed the fuck away. 

Right around when I turned 17-18, is when life became really dark. My folks lost the house because the step dad quit showing up to work and mom didn't work much/make much. She was also hating the situation and dealing with it by taking pills and drinking. So she wasn't really there for emotional support for me either. This put me on the streets with no working skills or anything to fall back on to get me on my feet. 

I found a job, and things were going well. My father comes back into the picture around age 20, because he agrees that he will finally help me get through college. I quit my job, which was on track to management, based on the promise that he would help me pay for college if I took care of rent. He broke that promise during my first quarter of school, and never provided a good explanation.  Here I was sincerely trying to make my life better, and now I am over 100 miles from my hometown stuck in another city with no purpose. 

I find a girlfriend, eventually a better job, then bam! Car accident. At the age of 23 I was facing possible permanent disability. Paralyzed arm, no medical insurance, and eventually lost the job. During this time the father wont even help me get insurance to cover some costly care, and I am handling the whole thing on my own. I begin to recover from my injuries after a long year of surgery and rehab, and the girlfriend leaves. 

Well at least now I am 24 and can get financial aid. I go to school, get great grades and find a great internship. Then I go to university. My dad keeps saying he's going to help, then never does. This happened at least three times. The last time I told him I had enough of him pulling the rug out from under me, and to not contact me with promises that will only end up broken. 

By now I'm still going to university, I am 26, but am not doing well in school. PTSD from my car accident and abusive childhood are consuming my life. Can't concentrate, sleep, remember important data for school. I was going to melt down. New girlfriend and I agree that university is probably not the best thing for me now. So I quit. Things get better, I keep working part time, and like the work I fell into. The career doesn't really require a degree, and I actually like it.  

This brings me to now. The girlfriend left due to her own emotional baggage, and the job I have wont support me for long. I'm getting interviews for the jobs I want, but they take forever to get back to you in city/gov jobs, so I'm hanging out in limbo until then. It really seems that everything I try fails, and I have been at my wits end for way too long now. I thought I would at least put the story out there to hear some outside opinions or just get my fucking mind off of all the misfortune I have survived. Feel free to ask questions because there is a lot more to the story.

Few Pointers is appreciated.,[deleted],seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/23b9yw/i_am_getting_better_at_this_but_no_result_yet_few/,"I have made an alternate account because my lil bro reads all of my reddit activity and recites them to me as jokes.

Hi seddit. I have been watching PUA videos and reading PUA stuff for a long time and I have finally gotten better but I am still AFC kid.

A brief description of myself. I am 20, 5""5, ""Indian"" looking in race terms (small brown kid that no girl finds attractive) and skinny (~50 kg.)

I am very inexperienced when it comes to girls. I have kissed 1 girl a year ago and made out with two few weeks ago. So I have only kissed 3 girls. That resume sucks donkey cock. I have actually ran away from girls that wanted me because I was inexperienced and was scared of embarrassing myself. Like, girls would show interest in me but I would ignore it because I thought I am gonna be a terrible kisser and show to everyone that I am so inexperienced. I am still scared about making myself look bad for this reason. I don't know where my logic is in this.


I think there are a few reasons I suck at PUA;

* I still have approach anxiety. I need a few drinks in me to get me started.
* I have terrible self worth.
* I am still horribly inexperienced so I am scared of showing this.
* I am looking in all the wrong places. Girls don't go to clubs looking for me.
* ...

More on the self worth part; My inner game is terrible. I literally have asked myself more than once ""why would girls want to be with me?"" It's a virus I can't get rid of. I am not a bad looking guy, good career ahead of me (nearly done with my 3rd year of college as an engineering student with an informal job offer from my manager where I did my internship,) I am smart, I am a nice guy (as in genuine kind not the kindness coins for sex kind,) I don't have bad sense of humour (mind you, it's a little dry.) I still am not able to change my self image even though I know the above. 

Anyway, I have been getting better, even though it requires a drink or two in me. Some of my friends even have said ""you are good with girls,"" ""you've so much confidence""... If they say that I must be doing something right. I have gone out 4 times in the last 2 months and I got 2 k close, 1 badish date, 6/7 numbers first night and 5 facebook add (most of them didn't accept, didn't expect them to.) I got 4 numbers second night and 5 facebook add (same as earlier,) third night I got 2 facebook add (one girl was very interested in me that night but after about 2 15 mins of conversations she told me she can't give me her no because she has a bf, asked her to add her on fb from my phone, she didn't accept the friend request. The other girl I still chat with some time.) The next night was a mess, I didn't approach anyone and got nothing.  Here comes the bad, very few replies on the text and very few facebook add. What am I doing wrong? I would stop drinking altogether but I feel out of place in clubs if I am not drinking, hence my most recent night out. I also can't close.


Thanks in advance."

I'm a sophomore CS/History double major in a rather difficult situation. Early on, I didn't apply for nearly enough opportunities as I should have.

I'm a qualified programmer with solid grades at highly-regarded liberal arts college with a good cs program (3.6 major gpa), but my experience is almost entirely theoretical, which might be a hinderance.

If this offer falls through, which I think it most likely will, what do I do? Are there any smaller firms with informal programs who are having trouble finding qualified applicants? Working at a start up is really appealing to me. What should my next course of action be?

I was recently selected for the KPMG National Leadership Conference in Hollywood, CA. I was beyond excited when I found out I was the only student from my university to receive this offer. 

However, EY has been  my number 1 choice for a while after doing my own research, from visiting each office, and talking to many students and alumni. I was really hoping to get EY's summer leadership as well. I just found out this week that unfortunately did not happen. 

Here is my dilemma: Given the situation that I might be offered an internship from KPMG this summer after the leadership, I will have to accept or deny before fall recruiting. This means that I will be basically locked out of any of the other Big 4 internships before I can even interview for them.

I know it would be foolish to reject the potential internship just for a chance at an interview for an EY internship. So is there anything I can do to still start my career off with EY? I have heard of people switching firms after internships but I'm not sure how often that happens.

I also don't know how prevalent KPMG's reputation of being ""the worst Big 4"" is outside of the online community, but it is always in the back of my head when comparing EY and KPMG. Sorry for all the text guys, I've just been thinking about this a lot. "
23bmmz,11,2014-04-17,[Rant] [Advice] Unsupportive parents...,spamlewin,teenagers,https://www.reddit.com/r/teenagers/comments/23bmmz/rant_advice_unsupportive_parents/,"Greetings. I don't know if this is the right place to post this, and if consulting an online community is the appropriate course of action, but here goes.

I'm the older of two children in our family. My parents, divorced (but still friends) have always ensured my sibling and I stay in school, college, etc. etc. etc. However, there's a distinct level of difference between the support we receive. To preface, I'm bored in school. I'm thoroughly uninterested in classes and subjects that don't interest me. As a result, I haven't always gotten the best grades. Not terrible grades, but not good ones either. The only exception is computer classes. Anything involving a computer is a top priority to me. I've always been good with them, and it's no surprise that I can always be found in the computer lab at my school. My sibling is sort of the ""be good at everything"" kind of individual. She's good at everything. Around 6-7th grade, my parents began shifting support and positive reinforcement away from me to my sister. To my disavowing, it's had a negative effect. I don't know why or how, but it just happened. I would be told that I was a failure night after night (by my mother mostly, but both my parents are guilty). Things went well during 7th grade. I spent all my thought-power on ignoring them. My sister would occasionally chime-in, sometimes calling me a failure, sometimes supporting me. My parents had all manner of hurtful material ready to go, ranging from accusations of ADD to just simple stupidity, to simply wasting my time and theirs with school. It's been going on for years now. If my sister so much as went to school, she was congratulated. If she scored a C on her open level (not honors or AP) science test, she'd receive a congratulations, even a Tweet or Facebook post (and since I'm forced to be linked with my parents on social media, I get the pleasure of seeing every single one). I recently participated in a computer-based competition, and was one of two people from my state/province to advance to the international level. I got a half-assed ""Good job"" from my parents. I take challenging courses (but not impossible by any standards), work my butt off to get a B or C, and sometimes lower, and I get nothing. No recognition whatsoever. I asked why a while back and they said, ""It's because we expect you to do it. Same for your sister. Why should we celebrate what you already should be doing?"". I was in the car the other day, and said (with a noticeable joking tone), ""I wouldn't mind getting an internship at Google!"". My father said, in a quite serious tone, ""That won't happen. You don't have the grades."" I was very close to opening the door and just sort of falling out. My parents know that computers are my life. I've had psychiatric help in the past to help fix relations between my father and I (we had a really lousy ""relationship"" up until I was about 13 or so). This very same psychiatric help was restricted to a ""parental-approved agenda"", which was also bored into my brain every night. When I tried to deviate to fix my inadequacies, I was promptly yelled at, and I stopped going to avoid further incursions. I tried sports. I used my talents in a season of track. My mother attended one meet. Out of the few that I stayed for. After that, I just sort of quit, due to lack of support. My educational career has been a mess ever since my parents stopped providing positive reinforcement.

If you've read this far, I appreciate you more than anything. On to the advice part. My questions are:

1) What could have caused the ceasing of support? Did I do something wrong? Say something?
2) Am I justified in planning to never seeing my parents again after college?
3) For those of you who may have dealt with this kind of thing, do you have any advice?
4) Where can I look to for support?
5) Am I simply being an emotional teen that's blowing things out of proportion?"

I honestly want to give up. Everything in my life makes me miserable and I genuinely have no hope it will get better.  "
23btdw,2,2014-04-17,"Undergraduate: focus on academics and grades, or on hobby projects?",sirciny,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/23btdw/undergraduate_focus_on_academics_and_grades_or_on/,"I'm an undergraduate at a top-tier liberal arts university, and I plan to graduate with a degree in CS and pursue a software engineering / CS-related career. During high school, I got in the habit of prioritizing academics above almost all else, but I realize that many of my CS peers appear to be miles ahead of me because they work on hobby projects or do programming work almost every day, often sacrificing either academics or sleep. They remind me that I could be preparing for a more advanced career earlier on if I made coding a regular habit during, and not only after, my undergrad years.

I think sleep and socializing are pretty important, so to maintain a realistic balance between the most important aspects of life for the next couple of years, it seems that the only way I can add more coding is by cutting out some studying and spending less time on academics. In light of the fact that I don't see myself pursing academia or, apparently, anything for which grades matter, is a slight drop in my GPA permissible? I currently have a 3.75, and I imagine that if I made coding a priority, it would hover around 3.0 - 3.3. Intellectually, I suspect that this isn't a big deal, but it's hard to convince myself to actually change my deeply ingrained academic habits.

Other potentially relevant information: I have had two coding internships in the past, and I currently work as a webmaster and web developer for a professor."

I'm looking into the field, not sure I want to walk the plank yet.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23bztu/iama_childhood_cancer_survivor_and_parttime/cgvj7ik?context=5)|It's like an Internship, but they have to pick you, and if they don't...you'll end up walking the plank.
[My daughter is currently going through treatment for leukemia (she is in remission\) and I'm trying to be there as best I can for her. She is 6. Is there anything you would have wanted your parents to know at that time that would have helped you more while going through treatment? What can I do to make it easier on her?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23bztu/iama_childhood_cancer_survivor_and_parttime/cgvnf2v?context=5)|Visit her, she may not ask for you to visit but she wants you to be there.
[What do you want to be when you grow up? What would you tell an 11 year old that's about to go through a similar thing?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23bztu/iama_childhood_cancer_survivor_and_parttime/cgviowq?context=5)|I want to be a Biomedical Engineer.
[I've had hair in my mouth that tastes like shit, too- but I'm dating classier girls now.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23bztu/iama_childhood_cancer_survivor_and_parttime/cgviowq?context=5)|Now, that's a hard question. I guess I'd tell them never to give up, never to look down, and always try to make the best of everyday.
[I wish you nothing but the best!  I think you are a fine example of what a human should be!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23bztu/iama_childhood_cancer_survivor_and_parttime/cgvj5g6?context=5)|*I wish you nothing but the best, to you tooo!*

[Edit: words.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23bztu/iama_childhood_cancer_survivor_and_parttime/cgvi6kf?context=5)|I feel like the Medicinal use of Marijuana is perfectly fine, but the recreational use, when used before the brain is fully developed is NOT okay. Marijuana can stunt to growth of the frontal lobe of the brain.
[A monocole and a patch?!...well doesn't this picture have everything awesome in it! This is cool.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23bztu/iama_childhood_cancer_survivor_and_parttime/cgvjlvl?context=5)|Don't forget the top hat!

And congratulations :\) I'm so happy for you!!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23bztu/iama_childhood_cancer_survivor_and_parttime/cgvikhb?context=5)|I was mad, after all that I was *mad*, I was mad at god that he didn't save my eye. Mostly because I had this idea of mind over matter, that if I thought I would survive, I would survive; That if I would keep my eye, I would keep my eye. 
[Sorry to hear that :( How do you feel about that now?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23bztu/iama_childhood_cancer_survivor_and_parttime/cgvixot?context=5)|I've made amends with God now. I will let him take me on the path he's taking me on.
[not only that but you're bringing monacles and eye patches back](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23bztu/iama_childhood_cancer_survivor_and_parttime/cgvks2b?context=5)|AT THE SAME TIME!
[It's incredible to me that you're able to maintain your faith through the things you've been through. That's a testament to your strength of will. Did you grow up in a religious household or did you adopt religion later in life? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23bztu/iama_childhood_cancer_survivor_and_parttime/cgvksr8?context=5)|My father is Irish Catholic and my mother is Protestant. I grew up going to Mass until the cancer, and then went during remission to a regular christian church. I've kinda made my own religion in my head...
[What was the worst part of treatment? Chemo, surgery or radiation?? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23bztu/iama_childhood_cancer_survivor_and_parttime/cgviblt?context=5)|Apples to Oranges tbh, but it did get worse over the years. 
[You said that you had some possible upcoming surgeries to replace the jaw bone and for a prosthetic eye. What do you feel are the benefits and the drawbacks?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23bztu/iama_childhood_cancer_survivor_and_parttime/cgvirhp?context=5)|The prostethic eye will cost a shitload, that's the only drawback.
[You also mentioned pain in your jaw; is it a constant pain or intermittent?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23bztu/iama_childhood_cancer_survivor_and_parttime/cgvirhp?context=5)|The jaw bone's drawbacks, would be that, first of all, it is a surgery, and second of all, those pains. Those pains are weir. We can't figure out what they are; nerve, muscle, or phantom pains. The only thing that helps is if I put pressure on it, but if I placed the jawbone in the flap I wouldn't be able to do that anymore. 
[Do you chew food normally? From the picture it looks as if you only have about half of a functioning mandible and maxilla (same side\)? Did I see correctly?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23bztu/iama_childhood_cancer_survivor_and_parttime/cgvj4a1?context=5)|Harder food is harder too eat.

[What type of cancer did you have?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23bztu/iama_childhood_cancer_survivor_and_parttime/cgviiic?context=5)|This is actually a bit of ""idk"" topic. It was first diagnosed as Rhabdomyosarcoma, then as undifferentiated Sarcoma, and then *Hardvard* got it's hands on it last and called it a ""Malignant Triton Tumor"".
[How does it feel being a medical mystery? Did they keep your tumor in a jar somewhere to study?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23bztu/iama_childhood_cancer_survivor_and_parttime/cgvpa0j?context=5)|It feels great to help medicine. Probably, raiders of the lost ark style.
[How was/is school and how has your social life been affected?

It didn't really matter too much to me until Freshman year, since I begun it with a few new friends and a few old ones, but once I took that year out my friends made new friends, and I had to make new friends, since I was put a year back. With this new mouth speaking is difficult, or rather it's hard to understand me.
 |I don't think I can answer your second question.
[Will you be able to have kids in the future? If so, is the type of cancer you had hereditary? Also, what is your favourite thing to do to pass the time?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23bztu/iama_childhood_cancer_survivor_and_parttime/cgvjd8s?context=5)|Uhh...I don't know about the status of that. I had an experimental chemotherapy that may or may not make you fertile. Kinda, I have a rare disease that causes early giantism, and may lead to cancer during puberty.

[May I ask how you eat it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23bztu/iama_childhood_cancer_survivor_and_parttime/cgvixap?context=5)|Like any other person with only half a jaw would eat it. With the half the jaw they have. I've been doing it for awhile though, since the tumor made it hard to eat on that side.

My surgeon wants to do some adjustments to the flap, like fix the drooping lip and put a jaw bone in there. I'm actually going into Biomedical Engineering to create a bionic eye.
[You're all, 'I can fix me. I am the tools, I am the technology!' So cool. :\)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23bztu/iama_childhood_cancer_survivor_and_parttime/cgvld0y?context=5)|""I am the experiment!""

But then again, does anyone really ever know why someone lost a limb or they're sick?
[I'm sorry if this comes across as ignorant or rude, but I'm curious. Your hair looks thin in your pictures, kind of like it's receding. Is that left over from the chemo? Or just genetics? Or maybe actually it's just the way the photos are taken, I can't tell really.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23bztu/iama_childhood_cancer_survivor_and_parttime/cgvlad3?context=5)|I lost all my hair, it grew back somehow a year ago, it's thin but I love it.

[You and me both, haha.  On a more serious note. Why did the doctors wait so long to remove the tumor? Judging from your picture, it looks like the tumor must have been a decent sized one. Did they try other means of treatment before removal or did they discover it late?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23bztu/iama_childhood_cancer_survivor_and_parttime/cgvkodr?context=5)|Cancer was technically inoperable. We tried tons upon tons of chemos to stop the cancer, but eventually we had to give in to the surgery.
[Inoperable how? Was it due to the complicated location on your face? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23bztu/iama_childhood_cancer_survivor_and_parttime/cgvkr11?context=5)|Yes. I think it was because of my cheek boned. IIRC it was wrapped around the checkbone.

[You're fantastic OP and honestly I hope and believe there will be people in a similar situation as you and age as you and your perspective on life and how you deal with this is really fucking honourable. You deserve air time to talk about this and let others know that life can still be amazing as long as you let it.  Have you ever had any air time about your condition? Also what's the future plans about reconstructive surgery?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23bztu/iama_childhood_cancer_survivor_and_parttime/cgvmwi7?context=5)|No, but there was a kid that had a similar condition to my early giantism disorder on Oprah back in the 90s. 
[How do you feel about the advancement of nano technology, and it's ability to deliver otherwise toxic drug payloads safely to cancer patients?  Do you believe this kind of treatment will be reserved for only the super rich?  What is your favorite food to eat as a pirate?

[Can't think of what to tell you. I thought I would have advice or something considering I wore an eyepatch through my childhood and spent my early adulthood researching carcinogens and working in labs manufacturing radioactive tracers, but I don't have any advice for you. I don't have to tell you to make something of yourself since you are better known than me and have a clear idea of what you want to work on. I don't have to tell you that no person is completely perfect (not even Einstein\) because you can already see how our imperfections make us who we are.  I don't have to do anything at all actually, but I choose to. I want to help you understand why other people's aspirations will fall short of your own, why your path is more difficult then average, or why you have so much potential. The truth is that I haven't got those answers for anyone but myself. If there is one thing I'm perfect at, it's being me.

23c8fq,31,2014-04-18,College Tech Rant,s3c7i0n,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/23c8fq/college_tech_rant/,"This is my First post here, I just figured I'd rant about a few of my stories. So recently I've more or less become the ""official unofficial"" tech of the area I hang out in at college. This place is just a general hangout / study zone, with a student store at one end. My name is finally getting well enough known that people I've never met are asking for me by name, which is fantastic considering I'm currently freelancing. 

First, a guy shows up, claiming to be an expert in building computers, brings in his laptop, nice Asus ROG, and wants me to strip it, clean it, and put it back together. Apparently the guy had done it himself before, but it ""doesn't work quite right ever since. "" So I open it up and check the heatsinks, first thing I see is a block of dust. A block. Like, sheet of dryer lint after 10 loads of laundry block. This thing has dual heatsinks, and the other one is no better. After those are dealt with, I check the CPU and GPU. Oh god. This guy used a full syringe of arctic silver and pretty much just hosed the area with it. Of course it wasn't gonna work right, but at least he didn't use any hydrogen peroxide.

So I clean it all off, make it all nice and spiffy, and properly apply the paste, then put it all back together, total time: one and a half hours. The computer boots about 5 seconds faster, and idles at room temp, down from 70C. Customer is thrilled. 

Another time, some guy walks in, starts messing with Ethernet cables, pulling them from the wall sockets, tying them in knots, etc. Security had to come and remove him from the campus, but left the cables in a pile. As none of the sockets were labeled, I had to spend 2 hours cursing that man and a lazy IT department until every cable was back in the right place and specific socket. Is it normal for a networked printer to only work if plugged into a specific socket? If it matters, the school uses novella for logging in. 

Lastly, today the copy machine was acting up, wouldn't work for anyone for no apparent reason, no jam, plenty of paper and toner, every option set properly. I walked by, coffee in hand, and jokingly put my free hand on top and said ""heal."" It immediately started working again, much to my surprise, and to the delight of the man standing there, who offered me an internship at a local social center for developmentally disabled people, starting in the next week or so. 

Thanks for reading my rant, this is by no means all my stories of college tech support, and I'm sure I'll have plenty of new stories in the upcoming weeks, definitely starting with the epic of Martin the slob.

23c8oe,1,2014-04-18,"April 18, 2014 - /r/Ijustwatched: You ever watched a movie before? Well, that's step #1 for this subreddit.",[deleted],subredditoftheday,https://www.reddit.com/r/subredditoftheday/comments/23c8oe/april_18_2014_rijustwatched_you_ever_watched_a/,"#/r/Ijustwatched 

**5,987** film-goers for **4 years.**

You like movies? You like talking about movie? Hey, me too! Let's head on over to /r/Ijustwatched and strike up a conversation! Many filmmakers old and new have stressed the importance of watching films in a cinema to enhance your movie-watching experience visually and socially. Movies just aren't the same when you can't talk to someone about it right after you watched it. So after next time you hop on Netflix to watch a movie and deprive yourself of the visual experience the director intended, you might as well preserve the social aspect. But seriously talking about movies is really fun. 

Did you just watch [Blade Runner](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083658/?ref_=nv_sr_1) for the first time after years of being nagged to see it? Great, head on over and talk about it! Did you just watch it for the billionth time and just noticed that Deckard could be a replicant? Great, head on over and talk about it! Just don't click on threads of movies you don't want [spoilers](http://xkcd.com/109/) for. Even if you just want to talk about how badass the music in [The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQGGQ-FCe_w) was, head on over!

Sometimes you watch a movie you just don't ""get"" and need somebody to talk too about it. Director David Lynch says claims that everyone understands a film after they see it, but they sometimes need to put their thoughts into words in order to bring out their understanding. And if David Lynch, a guy who has started dedicating his life to transcendental meditation says its true then it must be true. 

I just watched La Dolce Vita, it was a really good movie; one of Fellini's best. The cinematography was excellent and the music added a lot to the atmosphere of the film. Oh look! I just made an /r/Ijustwatched, its that easy! Even if just want to say you watched a movie and don't feel like discussing it, that's fine too! Just making a post shares movies with people who might not have heard of them otherwise. Some of my favorite films like [In Bruges](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0780536/?ref_=nv_sr_1), [8^1/2](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056801/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1), and [The Seventh Seal](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050976/?ref_=nv_sr_1) I discovered because of /r/Ijustwatched posts. You can find tons of awesome movies you haven't seen before here too!

So whether you want to talk about that scene where Snape kills Joe Pesci who was actually dead the whole time or just want to say how awesome a movie was, then head on over to /r/Ijustwatched. So sit back, relax, grab some popcorn, get watchin' and get talkin'.

Now lets here from the very friendly mod team over at /r/Ijustwatched:

&gt;##1. Tell us a little about yourself! (You personally not your subreddit)
&gt;&gt;**ARS_:** I'm twenty two and live in Texas, I really enjoy movies and love to hear people talk about them with more passion than I can.

&gt;&gt;**DaedalusMinion:** I'm a 20 year old guy who likes movies. I'm currently studying Mechanical Engineering and my lifelong dream is to one day direct and star in a movie.

&gt;&gt;**Girlwithnousername:** I'm our only female mod. Besides film, I'm a regular gig-goer, I like fashion and makeup but also own a kick-arse drill and a huge tool box (no pun intended). But I've always dreamed of being a princess, and I LOVE shiny things. However, I'll probably always be a tom-boy at heart. I also have real life friends outside of Reddit, as implausible as that may seem. I like ale and champagne in equal measures, although if forced to make a choice I'd choose champagne (as long as it was chilled). My ideal people to be stuck on a desert island with would be Sir David Attenborough, Louis Theroux, my two BFFS (both of whom sadly live on different continents to me), my mum, and the amazing drummer Thomas Pridgen. Obviously I’d lose all of the above in favour of David Bowie, but let’s just hope none of them see this post.

&gt;##2. How did you get involved in /r/Ijustwatched?
&gt;&gt;**ARS_:** I got the idea from an /r/movies comment I believe, the subreddit sat dormant for months until it spiked and got hundreds of users in one day.

&gt;&gt;**DaedalusMinion:** The head mod /u/ARS_ put up an announcement where he said he wanted someone to take over while he was inactive. So I applied, I got the job. My first time being a moderator on reddit.

&gt;&gt;**Girlwithnousername:** /u/ARS_ (whom I prefer to think of as /u/ARSE ) recruited Minion and I when he was about to vanish off to a war somewhere or other. I believe we were the only two who offered. So the poor sod basically got lumbered with us. I'd been reading the sub for quite a few months at this point and was happy to help. We grew the readership by several thousand in his absence. He got quite a shock when he returned. Is that the key achievement of my life? Well, if I get run over by a bus tomorrow, it probably is. Put that on my gravestone.

&gt;##3. Whats your favorite(s) post so far?
&gt;&gt;**ARS_:** I can't say that I've had any favorite posts seeing as they are all helpful but I enjoy how the same people keep coming back and making posts for new movies, that makes me happy that we have a community that people like to return to.

&gt;&gt;**DaedalusMinion:** This post where a user watched The Shining backwards and forwards simultaneously. Yup.

&gt;&gt;**Girlwithnousername:** What a rude thing to ask. The answer of course would have to be all the posts made by moi (you have to imagine this in Miss Piggy's voice, obvs).

&gt;##4. What lesson have you learned from browsing / modding /r/Ijustwatched?
&gt;&gt;**ARS_:** People really hate some movies.

&gt;&gt;**DaedalusMinion:** I learnt that not all subs are shitholes to moderate. We get trolls sometimes but this is a relatively easy going sub.

&gt;&gt;**Girlwithnousername:** To chill the eff out. I hold /u/DaedalusMinion entirely responsible for this. Note: this does not mean I accept the lessons, but just that I have an easier life as a result.

&gt;##5. Tell us about your community!
&gt;&gt;**ARS_:** They can only get better.

&gt;&gt;**DaedalusMinion:** Chill, easy going and loves movies. If that's not the best crowd there is, I don't know what is.

&gt;&gt;**Girlwithnousername:** They’re mainly a good sort; we’re lucky enough not to be attacked by trolls very often. What most appeals to me about the sub is the many levels of discussion. It really is a sub for all film watchers. Sometimes people post reviews including ‘I didn’t like it, it didn’t have this’ or ‘I really didn’t understand the last third’ and other readers will take the time to chip in and explain what the OP didn’t understand or to give their alternative perspective. Sometimes such a discussion will entice the OP to go away and watch the film again, bearing in mind such comments. We can’t all pretend to be intellectual film buffs and so I think that a second, third or fourth opinion and/or watch can be invaluable in appreciating (or dismissing) a film. In short: the sub is all about dialog, which is as it should be.

I'm a new intern at /r/Subredditoftheday, and as a first time poster (and a massive movie buff) I am very proud to present /r/Ijustwatched to you all for my first post. Thank you to the mods for being so polite and helpful! I hope I'll see guys there soon to talk movies!"

Being the head of the operation to unravel Project Firered, he was getting constant reports from those underneath him. He set aside a folder of classified information and sat up straight.

""Come in,"" he invited.

The door opened to reveal a short, balding old man in a lab coat. Looker smiled and gestured for the scientist to take a seat. The man did so, and Looker noticed he seemed to be jittering a bit.

""Mr. Charon, is something the matter?"" Looker asked.

""Oh, no, quite the opposite, in fact!"" the scientist replied excitedly. ""We've been hard at work in Bill's programmings. I believe we have finally found cracks in his security. We have begun file extraction.""

""Really?"" Looker asked, smiling with the scientist. ""That's great news! Alright, extract everything you can and report back to me when it's complete. Back it all up on a flash drive and I'll go over the documents on my own computer."" He breathed a heavy sigh of relief. ""Finally, we may be one step ahead of-""

Two more scientists burst into the room without warning, surprising both figures already in the office. They looked much less eager to share their news than Charon had been, but even so they rattled off their reports loudly and simultaneously. Looker saw more people - mostly interns and techies - crowding behind them and joining the babble. Eventually, Looker had enough, and he stood up. He put up a hand to call for silence.

""One at a time. What is the problem?"" he asked.

""S-sir! The files from Project Firered were-!"" one scientist exclaimed.

""They had a virus, sir! Built right into them!"" the other scientist finished.

""Every computer in our network is shut down!"" one of the techies yelled. ""Our files, our firewalls, everything! We've only got one file left, and it was put there BY the virus!""

Looker's eyes went wide, and he looked between the crowd and Charon. Charon looked no less nervous by any means. Looker sighed and began to push through the crowd, which cleared for him. He walked straight up to one of the computer. True to their words, they had been wiped clean. One single file, apparently a video, was seated in the corner of the desktop.

Well, it wasn't like this could get any worse. He clicked on the file. A video popped up on the screen, with Bill's smiling face playing across it. Bill began speaking once the video was up.

""Good morning! If you're watching this video, congratulations!"" Bill said cheerfully. ""You've clearly managed to hack into one of my most secure databases. I don't know if I could hack past my own security for this. Unfortunately, your forethought clearly is not as strong as your foresight. You're probably fuming right now about how I've wiped out your entire hard drive. Hey, that's the price you pay for trying to outhack me. Have a good day.""

The video shut off, leaving Looker to put his face in his hands. Of course they wouldn't so easily thwart the men who'd invented the PC. It would take months to recover from this one mistake. Even so... they couldn't give up yet. He stood up again and turned back to the crowd of Interpol employees.

""Continue as planned. Recover any files that you possibly can, and recreate those that you can't. Contact Agent Teala on the surface and let her know of this development,"" he ordered. ""Remember, our number one concern is still Miss A. Get a 20 on her and continue observation. Back to work!""

The crowd returned to their stations at his order, and he gave a brief nod as he returned to his office. Bill would not defeat them so easily."

I've been interning at startup (~20 employees) in the San Francisco bay area for about 9 months doing development/validation testing.  Most of my work includes test fixture development and Labview programming.  The CEO and CTO have expressed interest in hiring me on full time after graduation so they've set up a meeting to talk about it.  I like the atmosphere and work I'm doing at the company so it would be ideal to stay with them.  Between my internship, class load, design project and TA position I havn't applied to anywhere else.  My questions are:

1.  How should I negotiate salary?  I have no experience in asking for a salary from management.  The average in my area for new grads is $64k/yr but I think I've shown them that I'm worth more than the regular joe.  

2.  How much should my experience and knowledge of the product play into this calculation?  

3.  I have no idea what the other people on my team are making.  Is there a way to ask them without offending them?

Some of you might remember me from a similar thread that was posted a couple of weeks back. Well, I am back again after a successful spell with a couple of folks giving them practice in programming interviews. I had to delete the last thread to cut the incoming PMs so that the number was manageable.

Who am I ? I am an engineer at Amazon(can verify if you are really interested in taking this up.) looking to help provide interviewing practice to people who are interviewing at Software companies - both internship as well as full time.

Why? 
When I was interviewing one of the biggest pain points was lack of practice in actual interviews. I could sit and solve problems all day long on paper, but when it was d-day my performance would not be of the highest standards. I am looking to fix that same problem with other folks out here. All along I received help from unprecedented quarters and I would like to do the same in whatever way I can. Also - There is nothing more awesome than helping people get successful.

How do I sign up for this? 
Send me a PM with the following information. - Name - Email address - Position (Intern / full time) - Companies you are interviewing for (If there aren't you can say meh)

Do you have to pay? 
No.

What does this cover? 
Resume overview - Phone screen practice - Feedback

What happens next?
 I am looking to have a slot or two next week. Last time there were a lot of PMs and I managed to get replies across to most of you (sorry if I missed any). After your PM I would definitely try my best to accommodate you. If not, we will set up some time in the future.

The interview would be mainly around algos/DS/OOPS , so if the position you are applying for does not have any such interviews, this will not be of any use.

I will be starting my internship at Amazon in a few weeks, and I am extremely nervous about it. The reason is because I will be using Java, a language that I have never used before. I am CmpE major (graduating next year) that has been using C for the past three years, and I am good/great at it (relative to my classmates). 

I assume I am in the minority, as most of the other interns would be CS majors who will have had prior experience in Java. Were any of you in a similar situation as me while interning at any company? How did it turn out for you? Was it stressful having to pick up a new language while doing the necessary work required?

I am unsure of how ""difficult"" the assigned projects will be, and there are supposed to be ""code reviews."" I am mostly worried about writing code in Java that would be considered ""horrendous"" for Java (even for interns).

I am currently going through the MIT online Java course, and I plan to go through other ones that I can find as well. Is there some other website/documents that any of you could recommend for C programmers to get up to speed on Java?

Is there any advice any of you could provide me with?"

How should I approach this?",ElectricGoldfish,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/23dydk/i_got_an_internship_offer_but_im_still_waiting_on/,"I had an interview for my dream job (well, dream internship, but it would lead into my dream job), and they originally told me that they would make a decision by April 16th, and that they would be in touch with their decision either way, but they still have not been in contact with me, and I'm not sure what that means.

For the record, I felt that the interview went pretty well and that I'm a solid candidate too.

Today, I got an offer from another company, which while a great job at a great company with a decent salary, would still be completely trumped by any offer from the first company. I told them that I would have to consider my offers, and that I would be in touch, but since it's approaching the end of the semester, there's not much time left before I have to make a decision, and I don't know how much longer it will take the first company to make a decision.

How should I approach this?

I emailed them the day after the day that they said they would make a decision, but never got a reply to that either.

Should I e-mail them again, and tell them that I need a decision because I have another offer?


And as a corollary, am I just deluding myself with optimism by thinking that their silence is a good sign?

 My reasoning is that if I was rejected, they would just need to send me a form-rejection email, but sending out a job offer takes more time and that this is what's causing the delay.

I didn't even get the chance to interview. What should I do? Here's the set-up:

I applied to a GIS Internship position (entry-level, obv) for a fairly small environmental consultant group (probably not that many applicants). It seems they do impact statements and advising for energy and construction companies. I was so thrilled about this job because I need an internship to graduate in the fall and it was absolutely the best option I've found so far. Making maps for the field workers, making optimal site reports, and providing vulnerability analyses. This is literally what I want to do as a career in the future and have done that stuff multiple times in my class projects, so I was thrilled. I even followed up after applying two weeks later to tell them how excited I was about the position.

I am a senior undergraduate student studying Forest Ecology and GIS/Remote Sensing with a certificate in environmental studies. I've worked in two labs on my university which are environmental GIS/RS labs. In my mind, I was set up perfectly for the job. Maybe not, because they rejected me without even an interview. 

So my question is: Is there anyway I could change their mind and at least get an interview? How would I frame that approach? Or do employers not change their mind like that? It seems like a really small company and I'm baffled that they don't even want an interview.

*TL;DR: I have what seems to be the optimal experience needed for this GIS internship that I've been so excited about, but they don't even want to interview me. Can I change their mind, somehow?*

BTW it wasn't my resume's quality or anything. It's been reviewed by my advisors and I've had interviews with my state government, a giant energy company whose HR told me personally, ""Something about your resume really stood out to me,"" and other resource management companies this spring.

This was crushing news to me, as I've been waiting to hear back from them for 3-4 weeks now, have gotten rejected by other jobs in the mean time, and am on my last legs for this summer internship stuff. So I appreciate any sympathy and advice on how to go about this!

**EDIT: Thanks, everyone who responded. I was curious to see if they do change minds about doing an interview but I guess that's not the case! Will be moving forward with a strong mindset. It's the first time I've been genuinely disappointed about a job so it's definitely a learning experience about myself. The applications will keep flowin'.** "

While it was fun, I also had some incredibly creepy things happen to me. Here's one of the many.


 This actually begins before I even reached campus. My mother and I were at the airport, waiting on my *twice* delayed flight when she runs into the son of a friend of hers named Matthew. She freaks out like only my mother can do, then remembers that Matthew is a sophomore at the same University as me. She introduces us, has us exchange cell numbers, and talk for a while. Eventually, hunger makes it's way to the top of my priority list and I bug her about feeding me until she caves. But just for reference, she made *me* pay for that ludicrously expensive airport food.

+ After we touchdown in Louisiana, and start unpacking my things for my dorm, my mom asks me to text Matthew and make sure he made it back okay. I do, and he ends up sending me a picture of his flight itinerary. Weird, but whatever. I believed him when he said that he made it, I didn't need proof. After drawn out (and by drawn out, I mean my mother nearly ran out of the building after we were done, thanks a lot mom) goodbyes, I was left to my own devices for a few days before school actually began. During this time, Matthew text me and tried to make plans with me for upcoming parties, which I declined. 

+ At the end of the first week of school, Matthew text me and asked if I wanted to go get ice-cream. Excited, because I hadn't really made any new friends in a week, I jumped at the chance to feel like a real college student. He took me to Cold Stone Creamery, and paid for our ice-cream, and began a conversation with the server. Somehow they ended up talking about school, and he proceeds to tell her that he only came to this particular University because I begged him to. As confused as I was, I let it go. He'd been going to the school a whole year before I had, so I didn't see why he would say that, but I chalked it up to him wanting to be funny and make a good impression on the girl. Later that day, he text me, and many of his messages had a very flirty feel to them. I explained to him I had a boyfriend, and that I really just wanted to be his friend. He said he understood, and apologized for his ""flirty personality"". While I believed him, my mind changed when right after he asked me if I was ticklish, because he wanted to tickle me. I stopped texting him.



+ The next creepy encounter I had was when he met my boyfriend. My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 5 years now, so we're pretty serious, not to mention ridiculously comfortable with each other. So we tend to hang out with other people for a while before they notice that we're actually together. This night we were hanging out with a couple of my boyfriend's friends, tossing around a football when Matthew pulled up in his car. He came out, greeted everyone, and began to talk to just me, blocking everyone else. My boyfriend, feeling a bit territorial, strode over and placed his arm around my shoulders. It took a minute for Matthew to put two and two together, but when he did the look on his face changed completely. My boyfriend's friends tried to interrupt the awkward moment by inviting us to go hang out in someone's dorm, to which Matthew accepted, but my boyfriend and I declined and headed back to his apartment. As soon as we reached the room, I got a text from Matthew saying that he ""approved of my choice in boyfriends"". I rolled my eyes and sarcastically replied saying ""Thank you, oh so very much"".




+ The straw that broke the camel's back was a few weeks later, after all the nonsense with him had died down. I hadn't heard from him in a while when he text me out of the blue at about 11 on a Friday morning. My university only gives classes on Monday-Thursday, so we always have 3 day weekends. On Fridays, I usually just lounge around while my boyfriend goes to his internship at a local radio station. It was simply a good morning text, and not wanting to be rude (also because I hadn't discovered how to turn off the 'read at [insert time here]' notification on my iPhone, I felt obligated. The conversation was civil for a while, until he asked whether or not my boyfriend was around. I didn't see the relevance, so I asked him why he needed to know. He responded by saying that he wanted to say something crazy to me, but didn't want me to get in trouble with him. Being incredibly naieve, I asked him what would be so bad. He responded with a pornographic picture of what appeared to be a man *raping* a teenage girl, with the text: ""I want to cut tf up with you."" I didn't reply. A few minutes later, he sent another text, asking if I'd gotten the picture. I still didn't reply.




Since then, I've seen him in passing around campus and do my best to avoid and ignore him. He even asked me to go to the movies with him and a few friends. What really bothers me about this guy is, he is aware of my relationship, and even speaks to my boyfriend whenever he sees him. My boyfriend, being a non-confrontational person, only nods back. What bothers me is that our campus is small and I run into him almost daily. And it scares me to think what he might do if he ever has the chance to get me alone. He's a pretty big guy, and I only weigh 92 lbs, so this situation could end horribly. I've been doing my best to stay with people, have my phone ready, and be aware of my surroundings, but I don't want to spend my time at school paranoid. Plus, I'm not putting my social life on hold for this creep. So far so good, but there's bound to be more in store."

Can I ask the new company for different terms than what they are offering me ?",Lived2PoopAnotherDay,legaladvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/23etdi/company_where_i_worked_as_an_intern_last_summer/,"Hi, I am a resident in Ontario, Canada.

I am a student at a Canadian university and keep enrolling into internships fairly regularly.

In the summer of 2013, I worked at a software firm for 4 months and they gave me a return offer for summer of 2014. After negotiating with them, I got a couple things revised in my contract like the pay and the term of work. Please note that this contract was signed by me and submitted 8 months before the starting date for the next internship if that makes a difference.

In October of 2013, the old company where I worked got acquired by another company. I contacted them back at that time and confirmed that they I was guaranteed a return spot for my internship in summer 2014. I liked the old company where I worked so I was happy that I would be going back to work with the same people.

Now, I am in the process of getting ""rehired"" by the new company and they are going through their background check procedure. They sent me a offer letter yesterday and some of the terms were different.

     * Old pay - Weekly. New pay - Hourly

     * (assuming 40 hours work week) Difference of about $25 per week. Its significant because I would be working for only 4 months and the accumulated difference is my one month's rent.

There were some other minor changes here and there as well but since I would be working for a short period over there, they dont matter a lot.

I should also mention that the company that acquired my old company is based in US. 

Now my question, do I have any grounds for going to my recruiting manager and explaining her the situation and revising the offer letter ? This person is different from the person who hired me back before because now the company HQ is in US. Do I have the legal ground in saying that they are not respecting their old contract ? 

Thanks for the help !"

It used to be great, I would sometimes take notes on it, take it with me to watch movies with or review notes while donating blood or sitting between classes. Using it for basically all reading needs. I would even use it at the coffee shop. But now I find myself gravitating back to my laptop and my tablet being largely unused, and it's not that I don't like it, but now after using my laptop again consistently, I feel things are still much easier to do on it. Granted, it may not be anywhere near as portable as the tablet (one feature I really do appreciate), but overall it seems to have more benefit. I'm not a big user of cloud networks so the limited storage on the tablet tends to be quite annoying and while I do have an OTG cable and flash drives that I use, it simply is not convenient. I've come to the point where I do like the idea of having the tablet around for when I just want to light browsing or maybe watch a movie if i'm out and about, but at the same time I see it as a gross misuse of potential funds. I could sell it and use the money to do several other things, or even sell it, and buy a first gen Nexus 7 to keep around and still put money back into my pocket. So fellow redditors, I ask your humble opinion and personal thoughts as to the fate of my tablet.

TL;DR - Own Nexus 10. Great Tablet, not using it as much, but do like having it around. Keep it? Sell it? Sell it and buy 1st gen nexus 7."

I also get a lot of in depth questions about ""Hibernate"" and databases, which I actually don't know much about. The purpose of my project was to show how the rest of the company's systems would work with ""Hibernate"" so I mostly used dummy variables and actually didn't have to use that much ""Hibernate"".

I have a question about clothes and I figured that this would be the place to come and get some answers! I am currently a sophomore in college and starting my first internship in a couple weeks. I've been lurking on this subreddit for about a month now trying to pick up whats good to wear and what goes well with what. I've thoroughly read every guide on the side bar, but I still have some questions about my summer style. 

I would like to say that I'm hoping that purchasing clothes for this internship propels me into refining my style into the fall, winter and so forth. Essentially this isn't just me trying to find what works for the summer and going back to regular college wear but starting to build a great foundation in style.

This internship is a business casual environment. After reviewing the company's Instagram it seems that they let their employees wear ss button down shirts, jeans, chinos, oxfords, etc. Shorts and graphic t-shirts seem to be absolutely off limits though.

My question is this: How much of each item should I buy? I think I want my style to be ss button down shirt, kahkis/jeans, Clark's desert shoes, belt, and watch. Also, where is the best place to start looking for all this? I've always gravitated towards Zumiez, Target, and Kohls. 

Should I purchase 5-7 shirts, 3 pairs of pants, and 1 pair of shoes? 

Guys, help me out, please?

TL;DR: New internship, business casual, need clothes, how much of each?

He found a deal with a college that said they'll take all 72 of his units if he accepts a major in 'Application Development'. He's excited because this means saving 20,000 in tuition to make up the lost units.

23fcwm,8,2014-04-19,How can I [26/m] tell my parents I don't want to finish grad school?,singerinasmokyroom,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/23fcwm/how_can_i_26m_tell_my_parents_i_dont_want_to/,"Hey, guys and girls. So I'm a 26-year-old guy and I graduated from college in December 2009 with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering. My GPA was below 3.0 (2.9, to be precise) because, admittedly, I slacked off, so I had trouble finding a job. It didn't help that the economy was in the toilet at the time, either. 

Fortunately, I had interned at a company in the summer of 2009 and was able to continue as a contract worker for all of 2010. After that, however, I was on my own. All throughout 2010, my parents had bugged me to get a Master's, so I decided to take the GRE and ended up doing very well. I was able to get a few letters of recommendation and ended up getting into a pretty good program. I was set to start in September 2011. In April 2011, I started a job as a contract worker at my uncle's company but, because I behaved irresponsibly, I ended up getting fired. This was a pretty low point in my life, but I knew there was still hope because I was about to start my MS program.  

However, as my MS program progressed, I knew more and more that it wasn't for me. Somehow, I managed to drag myself through the coursework, barely managing a 3.0. I was able to get an internship at a large tech company (well, let's just say it's a fruit company) through my grad program in 2012. But I think it's safe to say that I was miserable the whole time. My parents kept telling me that it'll help me find a job and it'll lead to a higher salary, but I kept wondering if it was worth it. At this point, I should mention that I paid every last penny of my tuition, housing, and living expenses out of my own pocket. Every. Last. Penny.

Anyway, my coursework is done and I've been a full-time employee at a large company for 5 months now, but my thesis still needs to be done. My employment at my current company does not depend on me finishing my thesis (at least, I'm quite sure of that but I'll definitely check, but even if I'm wrong, I'll still transfer to another non-thesis program). And I have zero interest or enthusiasm or desire to do my thesis. But my parents have sort of...bullied me into it. Every time I tried to raise this issue with them, I'd sort of get shouted down, but I think I've had enough. I have a stable, well-paying job. It's my education. It's my money. It's my choice. And I want to tell them. I might still get my MS. But it will be at a time of my choosing. I might do a thesis. I might transfer to another school that doesn't require one. But it's my choice.

But I'm scared. I still live with my parents and I'm afraid they might kick me out. I'm especially afraid of what my dad will do. After I got fired in 2011, my parents and I sat down with a social worker to iron out some mental health/emotional issues that at least partially contributed to my getting fired (these same issues have been dogging me to this day). I see that social worker regularly these days and I talked with her about maybe bringing my mom in to discuss this with her (I'm way closer to my mom than I am to my dad). I don't know what to do or say. I mean, I want to put my foot down, but I'm afraid of the backlash.  

What really sucks about the whole thing is how my mom tries to emotionally manipulate me into staying on. She keeps saying ""I need you to get this. I need you to finish. If you don't get a MS, it'll really cause me a lot of pain."" I kind of want to say ""Bitch, it's my money, my life, my education, my choice.""  

I feel like I shouldn't be so scared. I mean, it's not like I've killed somebody or like I'm going to jail or something. I still have a BS from a prestigious university, an internship at one of the biggest companies in the world on my resume, tons of skills, and 5 months and counting at another respectable company on my resume. And my current job is going quite well. Just today, my boss told me that he showed some of my work to some of the marketing people and they really liked it. I have to be honest with myself. It's my life, my choice, my money, and I can't force myself to do something I don't want to do just because my parents want me to do it. If I didn't have a job, it'd be a different issue. But I can't live a lie. Not anymore. It's been eating me up.  

But I'm just so scared of my parents, especially my dad.


tl;dr: I want to drop out of my graduate program, and it really is no one's choice but mine since I've paid every penny for it. My parents have bullied me into staying on, but I've had enough and I want to put my foot down and assert myself, but I'm afraid of the possible backlash."

I am regretting every decision I made over the course of the last 1.5 yrs and can't stop thinking about this**



*I posted this before in an askreddit thread, and was kind of hoping for some more reactions. I guess I really need to get this off my chest.. I would really appreciate some of your thoughts, thanks for taking the time if you will read. Here's my story:*




I have just fallen deeply in love with one of my best friends whom I met during my ERASMUS year studying abroad. I liked her from the moment I met her but was in a romantic relationship with someone back home. Me and this girl from ERASMUS flirted all the time and became very good friends, we were so much alike, we had the same sense of dirty humor and had shared interests, both studying architecture and design. We had the best time ever being the best of buddies and hanging out almost every day of a very special year.



It culminated in one of the most romantic nights of my life ever. After a party at my place, once everyone had left or gone to bed, she stayed over for the night since she was too tired to go back to her place. She was lying next to me in my bed slightly touching my sides and running her fingers over my lower back, which at that time seemed to be my most erogenous zone ever, and we talked a whole lot about life and everything. Nothing sexual ever happened and it was clear she was being respectful and holding back.



This night forever being in my memory, I showed refrain from seeing her a lot and taking her to see my country when she came for an internship after the ERASMUS year, being afraid of what might happen and still being in love with my girlfriend from before ERASMUS. This hurt her a lot, she has now told me: all she wanted was to see her good friend and all I did was hang out with her a couple of times and leave her to her own devices for most of the time, being completely alone in a foreign country.



Not until after she left I started to realize what I had let pass by me, and in tandem with my own relationship deteriorating I started to realize I had let a very important person in my life slip through my fingers. We kept in touch and talked a lot on Facebook, still being flirty and big on the sexual innuendo's we usually laced through our conversations (which I never saw as a sign of her affection). So I always kept her in mind as someone who I will someday look up again.



Now fast forward about 4 months of regular contact and just talking, still OBLIVIOUS of our now mutual feelings for each other. Out of the blue, I get the opportunity to visit her in her country on a very short notice, and we are both really psyched! I suddenly get a surge of happiness and feel like this is the opportunity I have been waiting for, she clearly loved me and I certainly as hell like her, so this surely will at least be a very nice trip no? Perhaps I set my expectations too high..



My stay there was great, just having a nice time enjoying the great weather and scenery and enoying seeing each other again. But during my time there I got this weird vibe coming from her and was too afraid to pull through on finally discussing our feelings for each other. Her affection for me was so obvious before, and I didn't see anything now, I thought to myself that I must have misinterpreted it all this time, or maybe, that she was seeing someone else, all of the worst possible outcomes came to mind..



Once this feeling crept up on me, I started feeling insecure and shutting down as I usually do, we still had a great time but there was a storm brewing in my head.. I did not know what to think of this or what to do, so I just played it out passively until I went back home, having fun as the friends we are, nothing romantic happened.



Not until I am home the next day does this idiot realize that the insecurity and the shitty feeling that came from the fact that she showed not the same affection as before, came from the fact that - I - in fact was the one very much in love with - HER - and that I was an idiot for not simply discussing this with her at that time to clear up the air of 1 year of sexual tension.. she was after all (and luckily still is), such a good friend.



So with the tiny balls I have hanging between my legs i gather enough courage to write her a fucking message on Facebook telling her that I think I love her and feel very bad for leaving her and not acting on that feeling and only then do I finally hear her side of the story which she kept to herself for all this time..



She was in love with me from the moment she met me and was constantly fighting the feeling as I was unavailable. I hurt her a lot in a way that is indescribable, it is the most unfair emotional pain that one can ever endure, being unable to love the person you truly love and having to hold that inside of you living next to that person for almost a year.. After she had endured all of this pain and had finally come at peace with it after all that time, she decided it was just not to be this way and had moved on, settling for our friendship.



So just as I realize I am head over heels for her, she just got over it. I feel so stupid for never having acted on the tiniest of feelings for her which were there from that first night we slept together. I feel so stupid for being such a pussy and not having acted in the whole week I was lying next to her every night when I went and visited. I feel so sorry for having let her down when she was in my country. I feel like the universe is playing a cruel joke on us, torturing us individually by letting our feelings just be one year apart like this.



At the moment I am still very much in love, and maybe naively hope that she might turn around and realize she hasn't completely buried her feelings for me, but I cannot expect her to do this since we are now back to living apart from each other for another few months. I feel like I should just take a plane back and make up for every promise I failed to fulfill but I am too scared and, most of all, regular day life such as work and school are holding me back. This is probably my biggest heartache, I have all these strong feelings for her but these fucking rational things are holding me back from the only thing I really want.. And I then realize that that is probably how she must have felt all this time..



We still talk, and are now very honest about our feelings towards each other and I try to keep it cool, but deep down inside I know I will have to get over her in the next months and it will never be the same. I will either see her finding a nice guy where she lives, slowly see our relationship fade and/or have to surgically remove her from my life before I can truly cope with this, which will be a very hard band-aid to pull off. 


Right now I am completely unable to do anything work-related, I have a storm brewing in my head and can't possibly focus on anything serious I actually am supposed to be doing, the emotions are just too strong. I constantly overthink everything I did in the past, and I know I cant change them but I feel very stupid for fucking up three times by being a passive scared-y-pants. I just want to go back, take a plane and go see her, but I feel like I truly missed my opportunity and can't just show up again and demand that we now both can be in love and be happy, since I will have to get back within a few days anyways and she has just done coping with her feelings.



My idea is that I will just continue regular life until the summer and then go and surprise her, being the most romantic motherfucker ever, showing up with all the flowers and chocolates I jokingly promised her all the time we were still flirty-friends. I will either get shot down right then and there or I will get my feelings answered, that's all I kind of want right now, closure.. Right now all I do is sit on facebook and reddit and wait for her to tell me about her day as we usually do, make some stupid jokes on how I love her and then both go our own way again. 


At this point I would like to thank you for reading and I would like to ask you what you think of all this and what you would do. Next to that I wonder how you guys here cope with doing work (school/uni/job) while you have such strong emotions which you just cant ignore..

I'm majoring in computer science and have worked in the technology department of a large retail chain. I've done computer repairs, onsite jobs, tutorials, etc. I also work as an assistant research coordinator for drug studies at a hospital. That also opened the door to me to have an internship in the IS/IT department at the hospital over the coming summer.

I'm obviously aware of jobs like working in the kitchen or being a tour guide, but are there any kind of jobs (such as one in the OIT) that I could pursue (eventually, if not freshman year) that could boost my resume and give me more valuable work experience than cooking food or showing applicants dorm rooms?"

They may act like the friendliest, warmest people when you first meet them, but it's a facade. (If you're alert, you'll notice the first questions they ask you are your background in Christ, whether you read the Bible daily, whether your family is Christian.) One of the **PRIMARY MESSAGES** they emphasize is ""bring more people to God."" So I feel like everyone is just being fake and trying to bring as many people to God as they can through fake, half-hearted friendships. That's not what friendship is about.

For the first 2 years, naive me thought it was real friendship. These people always post encouraging Bible verses on Facebook and express how religious they are in church. But then I noticed as soon as we're outside church walls, these same people begin gossipping (about OTHER members of the church, even), backstabbing, and trash-talking. When I'm actually sick or going through tough problems, none of them bother to follow up. But when I don't show up to church one week, they ask me judgmentally why I was so busy to as to miss church. (""Did you have a lot of work? Were you busy?"")

I should probably mention how last summer, none of them congratulated me about a research internship I got with a large-name university. If anything, the people whom I thought were my friends got sour looks on their faces, and when I returned this semester, one of them completely started ignoring me. 

(And in case you're wondering, I never brag or boast about any of my achievements. One of them asked what I was doing that summer and I mentioned the internship, and got an, ""Oh"" in reply. Huh.)

But that last part's another story. Anyway, this semester I met some people from a non-religious organization (just a regular college club), and I have to say *these* people were some of the most honest, open-minded people I've seen. But I'm entering my senior year of college and I feel I've just wasted 3 years and unnecessary emotional distress because of my church group. Plus I don't even have any real friendships to show from it. F my life? What am I supposed to do?

23g5h4,3,2014-04-19,Possible Future Student,prospiethrowaway,utdallas,https://www.reddit.com/r/utdallas/comments/23g5h4/possible_future_student/,"I'm probably going to UTD this fall, but not 100% sure. I am torn between it and another school. It's definitely more affordable than the other school I'm looking at. (I have the free tuition+fees AES scholarship.) After Financial Aid, it should be even more affordable.

So I have a few questions.

1. For those of you majoring in natural sciences, how are the classes? How are the teachers? This is the absolute most important thing to me. I'm not looking for easy classes, I'm looking for opportunities to further my experience and intelligence. I don't know if I want to major in Environmental Science, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, or whatever, I just know that I really like science. Advice from any of you majoring in any of those would be greatly appreciated. I looked through the subreddit for advice about that, but I found very little (most of it pertained to Computer Science, which I know is a big thing at UTD, but I don't think I'll be taking it.)

2. How closely do you work with professors? How willing are they to help you and get you internships or research? This is another big one for me. I personally believe that working closely with professors and other students is a big part of learning.

3. Are any of you in Collegium V? I got accepted into it. How are the classes? They're supposed to be smaller and more personal, from what I can tell. If Collegium V is as good as they say it is, then that will play a big part as well.

4. How easy is it for students to get internships? Again, I'm thinking mostly lab or field work with natural sciences, but even if it's for an unrelated major, it's still good to hear.

I'm not worried about extra-curriculars or anything, because I am sure that clubs and organizations at UTD are great, from what I can tell. I don't think I would have a problem finding my niche at the school.

I have less than two weeks to decide, and this whole process is really quite stressful. Any help from any of you is greatly appreciated! Thank you!"
23gevj,14,2014-04-19,Thank y'all for this subreddit! Things are going right for this college student.,Yourenotthe1,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/23gevj/thank_yall_for_this_subreddit_things_are_going/,"I got some good advice here to just go out and apply for jobs even though I'm only in my second CS class. Well I did, and I got a web dev job on campus!

But it gets better. I was worried about quitting my current campus job because I really love it. When I told my boss I got another job, she told me that our department was creating a new website and I was such a good employee, so couldn't I stay on and be transitioned to a web dev role? I pretty much said ""heck yes!"" So for the next year I'm going to have two software jobs which I think will help so much when I look for an internship next summer, especially because I'm aiming for Facebook. 


Anyway, this sub is great and helpful! You are all awesome!"
23gftj,0,2014-04-19,"IamA successful at every job and interview I've ever had (Big Tech, Big 3 Consulting), and I want to help you! AMA!",[deleted],IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gftj/iama_successful_at_every_job_and_interview_ive/,"Hey Reddit,

I've been along time subscriber to r/jobs and r/AMA and wanted to contribute some of my knowledge on interviewing, securing a job and how to be your company's rising star. The following advice will follow this outline: 1. How to make yourself a top candidate, 2. how to outperform all other candidates during the interview process, 3. How to be the rising star in any organization you join. Please ask me any questions you may have and I will try to help as much as possible! 

1.0 How to make yourself a top candidates

* Resume: Easy enough to find good resources
* Stay busy: Whether it is part time jobs, internships, temp work, or just picking a talent that you have and teach others, be the person who doesn't take no for an answer and gets things done. In my case, while studying and preparing for interviews, I taught my hobby full-time to people around the city. No company I interviewed look down on this because of below:
* Become PROCESS-Oriented: I cannot emphasize this enough. Process oriented can be explained simply as following some sort of flow that others can follow on with. This is why methods like STAR and the 5Cs or 4Ps were invented. They are a process to follow to make sure you hit every item. More on the actual process later. But a process-oriented person shines through their resume, their cover letter, their email communication, and in their networking ability. There is no job that a process-oriented person cannot handle. These are the candidates the top firms go after.

2.0 How to outperform

* Preparation: Obvious enough, if you expect to get at a top company, how much time would you expect to spend preparing? 1 hour on your resume and cover letter? Try more like 150-200 hours. This is how much time me and all the people I practiced with spent on preparing for ONE company, let alone others. The good thing is that the preparation for the one, will help with all your others
* Preparation: This one is about how you think. As stated above, you want to be process-oriented. This means that from every word uttered out of your mouth is easy to follow. You want it to be so easy that the person sitting with you can guess the ending. This is the mark of an excellent process-oriented individual. We know how they think and that, given enough time, they will get to the answer no matter what. This is the type of individual ALL firms love to hire. Leader material
* Preparation: Confidence is key. For those who are shy, the above two preparation steps will help you be more confident so that you can rely on your process to explain all questions and answers carefully and clearly. This will allow them to be confident in YOUR ability to do the job even though you may seem nervous at the interview (which is normal for anyone, even myself, even though people say I'm good at interviewing but am actually incredibly nervous

2.1 Process-oriented thinking example: Below is the example about a question I got at my current company, yes it may seem dumb, but this one question and one answer set me apart from every single individual in my current company. I became immediately known before I came in for how I answered this question. It has made me the rising star from the get go. (Caveat, I joined a smaller tech company of less than 500 because I wanted to be a big fish)

* Question: How do you make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Here are two answers:

A. Uh, you get some breaded, put some PB&amp;J on, spread it around and put them together?

B. (My answers) I would divide the task into three parts:1. Preparation, 2. Executing, 3. Review. The preparation would consist of planning out what type of pb&amp;j we're going to make, such as:

3. What type of bread
4. What design?
5. What about the peanut butter,
6. what type of Jelly
7. Materials need?
8. others etc.

Now let me go a bit deeper to show what I would need to do within each of those categories

1. What type of bread -- White, Wheat or other? -- Bagel, or other bread types?
2. What design? -- PB on both sides or one? -- Inside or outside jelly? Jelly on the side?
3. Nutello and others added?
4. What about the peanut butter, -- How much PB? - Lot, little, how many spoonfuls? -- What type? - Chunky, Smooth, mix? -- Use a spoon or knive to spread?
5. what type of Jelly -- Repeat of PB
6. Materials need? -- Knives? How many, what type, etc. -- Fork? How many, what type, etc -- Plate, Paper towel? Round or square, paper, plastic or ceramic, etc.
7. others etc.

Next I'd go into the actual making of the PB&amp;J Sandwich: ( This part i did quicker as I demonstrated above that I can go several levels into each step, and can continue on as necessary. I'm showing my thought process vs answering the literal question.)

1. Cutting style -- Several layers of detail underneath
2. Layering the PB -- Several layers of detail underneath
3. Layering the Jelly -- Several layers of detail underneath
4. Placing and decorations -- Several layers of detail underneath
5. Cleanup -- Several layers of detail underneath

Lastly I'd enter the review step: (I've gone into a little more detail here as we didn't have much time at the end and I couldn't exactly remember what I said here as by that point, it didn't matter anymore as I had nailed the interview)

1. Quality/Quantity -- Costs -- What does the market want -- How much of x to produce y
2. Requirements document -- Step by step instructions on how to repeat -- Simple language for future users -- etc
3. Future iterations / improvements -- How to cut done preparation -- Minimize execution time -- Market analysis -- Customer survey
So planning, executing, and reviewing main areas I would focus on when making a PB&amp;J sandwich.

* As you can see, this type of question can have quite a lot of depth. I can't tell you how much this has helped me at this company and will continue to help me as I progress.

3.0 How to be the rising star: 

1. If you prepare with the above two points, you will come into the organization ahead. This is one key point to being the rising star
2. Be eager: Be the person who wants to be promoted: Can't tell you how many people I've passed up because I sought that promotion from day one even though I was definitely not qualified yet. But you know what? I got the chance to interview for a position I'm probably 3-4 years away from qualifying from because they knew I was A. Eager. B. Ready to take on any challenge. Now this 3-4 year requirement has changed to 1 year and I'm looking for that promotion in 2-4 months.
3. Process-oriented in all that you do. Whether it's writing an email, drafting a training guide, or creating a requirements document, write everything following a process. This WILL make your work stand out from all others, you will succeed because of it.

A little about myself so that you have a reason to believe the above advice is valid. 

* Careerwise

1. I secured an internship at a top 3 management consulting firm at age 21 in a foreign country (didn't speak the language well, didn't know what I did below)
2. Failed to secure a full-time job after internship due to be unprepared and unready
3. Decided to work at another consulting company in the above foreign country
4. After 3 years, I decided to make myself ready to join a Big 3 consulting firm after finishing my MBA and scoured the internet for resources to make myself ready. 
I ended up finding two important resources that turned me around as a candidate: A. Victor Cheng's www.caseinterview.com and B. Case study partners (or interview practice buddies)
After that, I was able to secure an offer from any company I applied to, whether a top tech company or a top consulting company. Since joining my current software company, I've been able to secure a promotion within 4 months and on track for #2, a management promotion, in 2 months.

How I know my advice is valid:

1. Personally tutored 10 people while interviewing and helped 7 of those people get a job at Mckinsey, Bain, or BCG. That is a 70% hire rate in an industry with traditionally 5% or lower. 
2. Promotions stated above with a fast track to upper management from all executives in the company (3 promotions in 2 years)
3. Offers from top consulting companies mentioned above

Job Opportunity: I hope this was helpful to you all. I've come a long way myself and would be more than happy to coach anyone who is willing to learn. Also, the software company I'm working for is hiring heavily for all functions, both entry-level and management. Feel free to PM me and I'll give you our website and can recommend you to HR. We generally only hire a few months out and will only sponsor HB5 for developers. "

23gnnh,37,2014-04-19,First software job and struggling. Any advice to recover?,jacobsboy3,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/23gnnh/first_software_job_and_struggling_any_advice_to/,"Hey guys so I work for a really big and fast moving company. It's my first job after I graduated and I feel a little bit over my head. I've had one other internship at a smaller company but everything seemed a lot simpler.

I recently got a subpar performance review (I've been working for about 7 months) and the comments were mostly centered on being more independent and confident in making my own decisions. I do agree with the comments as no one should be hand held for their career. 

To me the biggest thing holding me back is learning all the tools of the trade. There are a lot of internal tools and configuration files, etc that trip me up. Coding wise I am quite confident and have no problem but obviously there's a lot more to software development than just the code. Unfortunately in school we never really learned stuff like configuring load balancers and spring mvc, etc and I just can't get the hang of it. 

I know the tools and software should be similar to programming. Once you learn the concepts you should be able to pick up new tools a lot easier, so do you guys have any advice or reading I could do, besides just more practice? And as for the independence thing I know I need to start looking deeper into things and figuring things out on my own, even if it take a lot longer.

The review kind of shot me down and I've been feeling pretty bad as this is my first job and I'm already not performing up to my peers. There's such a steep ramp up and I didn't intern here over the summer like everyone else so I feel way overwhelmed with the amount of technology I have to learn and so quickly. I want to keep working here but I'm starting to feel like maybe I don't in the big leagues.

Thanks guys!"

I'm sure that a few of you might have had the same problem I am having, so I would like some feedback. Since I got into Seddit, I have gained a ton of confidence, am able to talk to anyone easily (girls compliment my intelligence and wit all the time), and I have become a leader (e.g., people sit me at the end of tables for projects, and I give people orders and they follow them and seek my validation). However, my dating life has not improved much. 

I have friends whom are about as equally as intelligent and attractive as I, BUT they are the most beta people I have ever met, and yet they get more girls than I. They exchange at least 50 texts per day with HBs and they ask girls out in the most wishy-washy ways (e.g., ""when will you be free?... ok, what do you want to do?"" or ""we should hang out sometime""). They send the girls the stupidest messages ever. Yesterday, my friend showed me he sent a girl a picture of himself shirtless. And on top of that they talk about the most meaningless shit ever. And despite that, the girls actually go out with them. I actually third wheeled my friend on a date, and it was incessantly painful for me. My friends was constantly supplicating her — my friend was really nervous the whole time and trying to endlessly please her and do things for her even if she didn't care. The girl told me she loved him a lot, but it honestly seemed like she didn't give two shits about him, and if I didn't know any better, I would've thought she was coming on to me (but that's besides the point).

On the other hand, I ask girls out in person before I have their phone number. I'm not too invested in them and I don't supplicate them. After they have shown enough interest, I'll ask them out on a date, and explicitly say DATE. Usually, that's where I lose a lot of girls. They'll turn me down, and say we could still be friends. 

One of my hypothesis is that it could be because I pursue women that have a lot of things going on (a lot of them have internships and jobs, at the same time), and my friends pursue girls that don't have a lot of things going on. 

I don't know though, what does Seddit think? "

23hbe2,2,2014-04-19,What's the point?,[deleted],SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/23hbe2/whats_the_point/,"I'm about to turn 23, and I swear every year I get older, I get the same sick feeling that I'm wasting my life. The only thing that's different now, is that I'm more mature and self-aware, and I realize that I've made the worst possible choices which is why I'm where I am now. For starters, I still live with my mom, go to college, and don't have a job. I feel like I have a low IQ  because I do so poorly in school due to my inability to focus on anything. That inability has caused me to waste my days in front of the computer. Every opportunity that I've had, I've said goodbye to due to lack of focus. I had an internship this semester at a public radio station where I could have shined, but instead I half-assed everything. This seems to be the only way I go about doing anything, even though in my heart, I know I want to work hard and make something of myself someday. As time goes on, I keep thinking that I will always lack the skills to be a successful journalist, always lack the skills to support myself, because I didn't learn them while growing up. I always took the easy way out in middle school and high school, and for that reason I suffer now. I don't know what to do because growing old without a purpose is terrifying me, and maybe this post comes off confusing but it's just because I don't know what's wrong with me. So I'm seeking help and advice because maybe you understand. I feel lost, and I don't want to be anymore. I don't want to waste my life in my room, my early 20s out the window, when I could be happy and exploring. I don't want to be lonely anymore. To make matters worse, I have a distant relationship with my family, and feel bad for being closer with them. So there's a lot that's wrong, and I just feel like even if these are considered petty problems compared to people who are starving, I don't want to feel this way anymore. Maybe the only way to stop suffering is to just end my life, then I won't have another birthday where I'm disappointed in myself. "
23heg3,2,2014-04-19,Jerry's Blog,[deleted],randomsuperpowers,https://www.reddit.com/r/randomsuperpowers/comments/23heg3/jerrys_blog/,"Hey Guys

It's me, Jerry, presidential intern, as you know, I've had it a bit interesting since I've got here. My local pharmacy loves me, I'll tell you that. My therapist, Dr.Mustacheck, he has me on three different anti-psychotics, I think they are helping, but it's hard to tell. I can't tell if I'm going bonkers, or if the whole world is. I mean, I keep having these really vivid dreams, where the whole world is being destroyed, or taken over or something, and there is this massive war. Someone died, and now someone is getting revenge. It's really hard to remember, I just took like, four pills.

Also, update since last time, the ghost in the New White House is real, I'm not just going nuts. Apparently he is real, and is also former President Sonic Star. He is really annoying, and won't leave me alone. I really don't like him, but at least President Lilly helps me out, she is really nice at times to me. She is a bit of a slave driver, but, it's not always bad. Plus, I can't lose this job, or I lose my scholarship, and then I can't go to school anymore. I already have another job, since my girlfriend kicked me out, to pay for an apartment.

Also, it gets old having the Devil zip in once a week, to complain about some show, and it seems that President Lilly has started watching it as well, so, it's just gotten worse. Also, she and the first lady are so loud, just all the time. It's ridiculous, I have to play my music so loud to ignore them.

It isn't all bad, I've met the King of Mars, he seemed nice, and his father, who seemed not dead. I don't mean weekend at Bernie's, I mean, like, back from the dead. I've met a few others, but I'll tell you about them next time.

:--|:--
[My husband was fired over 4 years ago and is still trying to get his struggling business off the ground.  I cannot look at him. Hearing his voice makes my chest tight. He is the source of my stress. I am carrying the financial burden. My teenage daughter does not want us to divorce.  Can you give me any words of wisdom, comfort and a separation plan?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gkcw/im_a_legit_licensed_marriage_counselor_and/cgwrwui?context=5)|Hi, you've already determined part of the problem: he's a dreamer and you're a realist? You've always known and maybe you used to like that about him? There are many couples with this dynamic, and sometimes they clash and sometimes they balance each other out. If you still love him, then I'd work on it.  There's no reason he cannot find or try to find another job while building his business.  People do that all the time.  I'd take care of yourself, as you seem burnt-out from all of the responsibilities. I would be as well.  I'd give you advice on relaxation strategies and healing (meditation, journaling, and creative arts), along with encouraging you to eat well and exercise.  Stop thinking about him for a bit.  Have you sat down with him to discuss how you're now physically showing signs of anxiety and feel overwhelmed?  You probably have, but I'd attach a strong urgency that you will not be able to do so any longer.  His other dream aside from his business, may have been to have a family. I'd remind him of his initial dream.  And the one you shared together.
 |As a last resort, a separation plan would be prepared by the realist (you).  He needs an time-specific action plan to help out financially and/or get help so he's able to do so.  Based on his response, then you'd know what planning to further pursue.  Good luck. 
[ of all, it takes a special person to do what you do, and for that I thank you. My curiosity lies in what you do when the therapy is over. How do you unwind? Is it hard to leave work at work? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gkcw/im_a_legit_licensed_marriage_counselor_and/cgwwu0f?context=5)|Thanks very much:) They did not have a class on the realities of being a therapist, and I wish they had better training on it.  I've followed from the guidance of my former supervisors and mentors in how to handle it.  I supervise new license interns now too.
 |The first two or three years of work was very hard on me, and I struggled with leaving it at work. I'd cry. Heartwrenching, not just how it affected someone's life and family, but how they were treated in our system and society. In the recent few years, I mostly leave it at work, except in extreme cases of abuse or when I'm closely working with someone who is suicidal with intent.  I'm on call.
 |I'm very involved in session, but have learned to hold back some of me in self-preservation.  I'm an introvert, an INFJ, but I function as an extrovert at work.  So, I have to rest and be quiet for an hour or so after work.  I ease up on my schedule, if I feel drained.  I add sessions when restored. I know myself quite well.
 |I unwind with writing, art, music, books, exercise, family, and meditation.  I do case consultations and attend therapy a few times a year to take care of myself, so I can continue to help others. 
[What is your favorite book?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gkcw/im_a_legit_licensed_marriage_counselor_and/cgxgoza?context=5)|I devour books and barely remember the titles, to be honest. My fave book from the past is, Man's Search for Meaning, by Frankl.
 |I like to read all types of books, from Sex at Dawn, A Brief History of Time, to The Great Gatsby. 
[At what point does a waiting list get so long that moral prudence has you pass on the new business so the couple can get needed help sooner?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gkcw/im_a_legit_licensed_marriage_counselor_and/cgx9su1?context=5)|I give some names of other therapists when new clients call, if I can. Urgent appts are seen or referred back to the referral source. It's their choice to wait or not. Current or former clients aren't on a list. 
[Is marriage just not for some people? Or perhaps more accurately is monogamy just not for some people?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gkcw/im_a_legit_licensed_marriage_counselor_and/cgwrvsj?context=5)|Yes, some people do not thrive in a marriage and tend to become depressed, cheat, self-medicate with alcohol or drugs, remarry frequently, or just stay single.  Depends a lot of the personality and life history, including personal belief systems.
 |I do encounter people who are nonmonogamous and polyamorous, and I'm listed in a directory that caters to this lifestyle as well.
 |Choose your theory, but some people are happy being monogamous and some are happier in a nonmonogamy situation.
[I might be to late to the game for an answer but I'll ask anyways...](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gkcw/im_a_legit_licensed_marriage_counselor_and/cgx4f16?context=5)|The highest divorce rate is during the first two years of marriage and then declines, this is when the newness wears off and people really see who they're married to. Often people are disappointed that they no longer feel butterflies for their partner all of the time, but this is completely normal and biological in nature. Shift from dopamine to oxytocin brain chemicals.  People wait too long to get help, so by the time they might get help, too much damage is done. There are less people willing to endure years of unhappiness in hopes of improvement, solely for the sanctity of staying married. In the past, people were more likely to battle out the rough years.
[Why do you think divorce has become such a common occurance in America? Yes, domestic violence etc, has empowered individuals to leave abuse situations but that cannot account for a (roughly\) 50% divorce rate, can it?  Is there any volatility to the idea that gay marriage is harming straight marriages (in your opinion\)?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gkcw/im_a_legit_licensed_marriage_counselor_and/cgx4f16?context=5)|It's a transgenerational process now, so if your parents divorced, then you're more likely to see divorce as a feasible option. It's an option and has become socially acceptable, yet in the past it was not.  With the feminist movement and more women entering the workforce, the divorce rate increased during this time, but has evened out and slightly declined. Women no longer need to be married to have credit or own property.  Our society has become more disposable, entitled, and wanting immediate gratification, so people are less patient and tolerant of the ups and downs in a marriage. And people can be unwilling to yield or give in on anything, so a marriage is impossible. As a good marriage includes a series of compromises and understanding/respect for someone else.  I don't think gay marriage has much of an impact on the divorce rate, however, I've had a few divorces due to a partner coming out that he/she was gay.  Societal impact is speculative. I'd say that people are waiting until they're older and putting off marriage until they are more independent. Some are deciding not to marry at all, which is a change from the past. This has also made the divorce rate even out.
[If you agree with idea that marriage is being redefined, what do you think the social implications will be?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gkcw/im_a_legit_licensed_marriage_counselor_and/cgx4f16?context=5)|Children and young adults do not have enough positive role models of a healthy intact marriage, so they may not know how to work well at keeping one. And they have no one to speak with about it and give guidance. And there's a delusion of what a marriage really is.
[My husband and I did pre-marriage counseling with a professional counselor (rather than a church program\) before getting engaged and found it extremely useful. We had a great relationship before but it gave us some good strategies for working through disagreements! Thanks for your work as a counselor.  Here's my question for you: How would you counsel a married couple that came in and was trying to decide if they want to have kids? 30 years old, very stable, both just totally 50/50 on if they want them or not. No pressure from either side. What exercises would you take them through or questions would you ask to help them delve into that topic more? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gkcw/im_a_legit_licensed_marriage_counselor_and/cgwyx8v?context=5)|You're welcome, I'm glad that it was useful for you.
 |What percentage would you need to be to decide? 80%? 100%?  What if one of you was 50% and the other became 100%? What would you do?  Are you familiar with what it would be like to have children?  Are you willing to commit yourself and be responsible for the safety and well-being of a child for many years?
[Edit- To clarify, my mom and dad are both in their early 50's. I believe this could be a midlife crisis, as well as underlying psychological issues on my dad's part. My mom isn't guiltless, but she hasn't done anything to merit his cold demeanor and anger as of late.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gkcw/im_a_legit_licensed_marriage_counselor_and/cgwrsem?context=5)|He seems pretty unhappy and people often show depression and sadness through anger. I'm sorry he assaulted you, and I don't think you or your mother should tolerate that anymore.  And since he attacked you, then you definitely have the right to say something before it gets worse.  
[What is the most screwed up/ interesting thing a couple has ever come to you with?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gkcw/im_a_legit_licensed_marriage_counselor_and/cgwsb3e?context=5)|How do I choose? The most screwed up would be a woman hiring a professional and plotting to kill her husband.  The most interesting would be a man who took care of his bedridden wife who had MS for 20 years and battled his guilt about his affairs.
 |The most screwed up thing I encounter is what people do to their kids.  And then they want to drop them off (""you fix them"") and say they're the ones with the problem. Usually, they are just the symptom bearer.
[So basically... You see everything. So with the person trying to kill her husband, do you have to like report that to the police? Seems like you'd have to.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gkcw/im_a_legit_licensed_marriage_counselor_and/cgwumlr?context=5)|Yes, I always disclose what remains confidential and what is not, during the first session. That warrants breaking confidentiality and is required by law to notify police and her husband.  If she already killed him, then no.
[So... If she already killed him. You wouldn't have to report it??? what kind of logic is that?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gkcw/im_a_legit_licensed_marriage_counselor_and/cgwwiqq?context=5)|Same logic that applies to clergy, attorneys, and medical personnel. Therapist-patient legally privileged communication. 
[I once had a counsellor reveal that he had taken 5 years off work when he started to feel burnt out at his job. I found it interesting to learn something personal about this person and I was wondering if it is common to reveal something about yourself during sessions or do most counsellors try to keep their privacy guarded?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gkcw/im_a_legit_licensed_marriage_counselor_and/cgwylpy?context=5)|I was trained to not reveal too much about me personally, as it's distracting, shifts focus, tends to create too much transference, and would interfere with the process.  Plus, it's your time, not mine. I don't want the person to alter who they are or what they'll share based upon who I am.  That's the beauty of it, can just be yourself.  I do sometimes use my reaction of feelings based upon what the person says, to help them understand how others may feel with that same type of interaction from them.  That's very helpful to them.  I do share when someone is going through bereavement, as they do like to know that I've been there.  And people who have kids often want to know if I have kids, so I tell them if asked.  If it's helpful for them and would make counseling better for them, then I can briefly share general info.
[I'm 22 and I've been very depressed for as long as I can remember, and in the past 5 years or so it's led to complete social withdrawal and a disability for really doing anything. I have tried on many occasions to get help. I've always been wary of mood medication so I chose to try and see psychologists and therapists especially after being referred to a hospital by my old school counselor.  I've spent more than those five years now just bouncing between counselor to counselor and now I've given up altogether. Maybe it's just luck but I can never find someone I'm comfortable talking to or someone who seems willing to address what I want to talk about. A lot of my early experiences with counselors were the same in that they'd narrow in very quickly on things I just wasn't there to talk about, a common one was my apparent ""cyber"" addiction (computers, internet, games\). Was referred to addiction clinics a few times for that and never showed up for the appointments.  Anyway, sorry for the TLDR, but basically I know I need help but whenever I have tried to get it shit just seems to not work. It's getting harder and harder to convince myself to even try. Any advice on staying the course, and more importantly, any advice on trying to find someone that might actually be helpful for me? Maybe it's just me, and maybe I've just been going about the whole thing wrong. I have no idea.  Additional question, I assume that people like me who have misgivings about mood medication for depression and such are pretty common. That in addition to previous negative experiences with psychiatrists have kind of made me want to avoid medication altogether. I know this isn't exactly your boat, but is there anything you can point me at to ease my doubts?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gkcw/im_a_legit_licensed_marriage_counselor_and/cgwuu9q?context=5)|Are you an introvert? Seems so. They'd often rather interact with electronics than people. Can get out of hand. Although, if you're depressed enough to get a hospital referral and it's progressively gotten worse (withdrawal from society) and have suffered for five years with no results, then I'd wonder why you haven't tried an antidepressant? Are you worried about the side effects, pride, religious/cultural reasons, stigma, or is it weak to take it or something? I'd want to know.
 |That's tough, I'm sorry. I talk about medications a lot with my clients. It's personal choice. I'm required to have continuing education on psychotropic medications. I don't suggest it unless the person is truly suicidal or hasn't seen any improvement within 6-8 sessions. I usually see good improvement within 3 visits with active CBT. A lot of work is done out of session as well.  You never said what you really wanted to work on, so I'm guessing something happened when you were a teenager? The best treatment for severe depression is antidepressants plus therapy (CBT or DBT is preferred). Mild to moderate depression is highly responsive to just therapy. From my experience, 20% of people who have depression do not respond to just therapy, as they truly have a chemical balance. I go through the physiology and genetics of all of that.  It's approached like any other medical condition to me.
[How successful are marriages after counseling? What is the most common reason couples cite for going to counseling?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gkcw/im_a_legit_licensed_marriage_counselor_and/cgwrtuy?context=5)|It usually depends on the treatment methods and on how long the couple waited to come in for counseling.  If you're going to a LMFT (Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist), then you're going to have a different experience than with a psychologist or another therapist who works with couples.  LMFTs treat the system as a unit and follow a different set of theories.  Both therapy types can be effective in reducing problems within a couple.  Standard therapy has an average 30-45% success rate, but it's really inaccurate on determining that. It's why I switched from providing standard couples therapy to following the Gottman method, as it's based on research and is not just sitting around and determining who is right or wrong (that doesn't work).  When the system or interactional patterns are not analyzed and treated, then the couple is likely to need help again (just received a temporary band-aid for the immediate problem) or give up.
 |Most of the couples I see are there due to a cheating incident or a divorce threat.  They're already at the end.  It's kind of like driving a car without maintaining it at all, hoping for the best, and then completely burning it out and wanting me to repair it.  I'm often the last one in the room to give up on a marriage.
[Is it normal to go through phases of being unhappy in a marriage? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gkcw/im_a_legit_licensed_marriage_counselor_and/cgwts7t?context=5)|Definitely, being happily married is hard work.  There's often more work put into finding a partner and planning a wedding, then making a marriage work well.  It's often neglected and that's typical.  Most long-term marriages have ups and downs. It's also one reason why people have affairs and get divorced, they compare the feelings of new relationship to a long-term one.
[I appreciate the response!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gkcw/im_a_legit_licensed_marriage_counselor_and/cgwvpo0?context=5)|My pleasure.
[I'm graduating with my psych B.A. in December and am going to try to get into a grad program starting the following September.  The problem I'm running into right now is officially deciding what kind of program I want to go into.  What led you to focusing on marriage/families instead of something like school counseling?  Further, what made you decide on being an LMHC rather than going for your PhD, PsyD, or a masters?  Last question (I think...\) as an ""insider"" I guess, what can you tell me about loan repayment/forgiveness programs available?  Specifically, through the NHSC or through the government/military?  Okay, these are the last questions:  What is the most rewarding part of your job?  What was the most interesting research you've seen or possibly conducted over the course of your career?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gkcw/im_a_legit_licensed_marriage_counselor_and/cgx18yc?context=5)|I have a Master's in Clinical Psychology, because I was fascinated about tests, measurements, research, clinical psychopathology, and statistics. And none of the other programs course schedules were as interesting to me.  I didn't want to invest the money or time into a PhD or PsyD, as I could do similar work without it.  I'd read all of the course descriptions on selecting a program.  Why I chose this over social work as well.  Just was a good fit, and I wanted to be sure I'd enjoy what I was learning.  I'd apply to several schools, as the competition is tight.  I'd do the NHSC or similar program, why not? I'm not an expert on the details of them, but have known people who did it.  I kind of did a small version of it by getting all of my weekly supervision hours for free, while working at a community health center in an impoverished area.  Most interesting? I've always been fascinated by twin studies in the battle of nature vs. nurture. I'm impressed by the research of Gottman in marriage counseling and how he predicts divorce.  My thesis was based on interpersonal trust, a great deal of relationship problems surround this.
[Thanks for the reply!  I really appreciate it!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gkcw/im_a_legit_licensed_marriage_counselor_and/cgx388c?context=5)|My school had two sections, one at night and one during the day. I worked during the day and went to school at night. I started at 21, but no one asked how old I was.  There were five women around my age and everyone else was older.  Several of them already had a Master's degree in another field.
[As a somewhat random follow up, about how old would you say the average age was in your Master's program?  I'll be turning 21 a few days before commencement and am hoping that being so young (and female?\) won't work against me because I'll be lacking the experience that comes with age.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gkcw/im_a_legit_licensed_marriage_counselor_and/cgx388c?context=5)|They did not care how old I was, at all.
[Have fights broken out that you had to stop?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gkcw/im_a_legit_licensed_marriage_counselor_and/cgwrvcq?context=5)|That's a good question. Mostly when I was working at the inpatient psychiatric unit for thought disorders. I was almost attacked twice there, but it was mostly because someone thought I was someone else and trying to hurt them.  Understandable.  Verbal methods and relaxation strategies greatly reduced amounts of fights.
 |I was trained on recognizing possible signs of an escalation and how to verbally reduce the likelihood of a fight.  And we're trained on physical maneuvers and how to reduce physical risk of harm.  Once it got physical, I'd follow protocol, which includes getting help from the other staff and security.  If that didn't work, then chemical or physical restraints were utilized.  That is the last resort.
 |I've had a few fights in outpatient settings as well.  I typically know who is at risk for getting angry and catch that early if possible, to prevent a problem.  I watch for it and give breaks or split up the couple.  And refer to individual counseling for help with anger, as needed.  Sometimes, there's no warning though.  And domestic violence is a different story.
[Was there anything that your patients told you that made you scared?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gkcw/im_a_legit_licensed_marriage_counselor_and/cgwru8k?context=5)|Absolutely, for me, it's rare to have a murderer come see me with no empathy, but I've met a few.  They don't tend to come to therapy on their own.  The people who I see are usually upset about what they've done and cannot tell anyone else.  I feel if the person is there seeking help, then I'll do my best to help them.  They often fear making me afraid by what they've done or fear me judging them.  I work very hard to stay calm and focus on what they need.
 |I've heard many gruesome accounts, but typically the person suffers with the knowledge of it.  Often, they want clarity on what happened and why they did it.  And they want peace.  And I help them reframe their thoughts about it and learn ways to not act on impulses.  I encounter clients who exhibit antisocial behaviors, but have no problem referring to an expert when I'm uncomfortable.
 |I take precautions to protect my safety.  I try not to show fear and with experience, I use statistics to help determine who is a dangerous person to me or society and who is not.
[I'm not officially diagnosed with anything, but I'm pretty sure I have some form of depression/dysthymia. My question is - how does a person deal with life (getting a job, feeling useful, etc\) when they have no passions, no skills, no motivation, and not enough money to just go back to school or try out different things until something clicks?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gkcw/im_a_legit_licensed_marriage_counselor_and/cgwrxrn?context=5)|They find meaning in their life.  A person is lost until they find a purpose or meaning. It can be anything at all at first, even caring for a pet or cleaning up a house.  You could try a few things out that work for someone in your family or one of your friends (I didn't know cooking would make me happy, until I cooked like my grandmother did).  And try to focus outward versus inward.  What can I do make the world a better place?
 |Sounds like some type of dysthymia- I'd recommend a physical to rule out any medical problems, as sometimes it's something physical.  Usually a person does have some skills, but he cannot seem them when so dark.  And everything has a gray outlook.  I'd also try to remember a time when you used to be happier and do what you did then (if it's healthy).  And what did you used to dream about doing with your life? Go do it:)
 |Clients who are in a similar situation start with the job and career or educational aspect.  They go to the career center at the community college and ask for help or visit the unemployment office and check out training programs of interest.  They make do with what they can until they find the motivation and money to do what they really want.
[I do plan to try things like a temp agency, but I don't have high hopes. I want a 9-5  schedule, and those normally require skills I don't have.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gkcw/im_a_legit_licensed_marriage_counselor_and/cgwxwqh?context=5)|Who crushed your dream? Some teacher complaining about lesson plans and bad parents? Is that when you started getting depressed? My mom and my sister are both teachers and love it, and yes, they complain about lesson plans and bad parents sometimes.  But after the first year or so, most teachers typically use the same lesson plans and know how to deal with annoying parents.  They focus on why they wanted to become a teacher, to educate the children and inspire them.  Weighs out the negative.  There's cons of every job, one must look at the pros.  Like working half a year and having a pension is one.
[I don't know if I missed the boat on this AMA, but I'm on my last year of grad school for my Master's in mental health counseling, and I plan to become licensed as well as obtain certification as an addiction professional.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gkcw/im_a_legit_licensed_marriage_counselor_and/cgwwwm5?context=5)|I'm full-time in private practice and had to learn the business side, in order to build and maintain it. Just like any other business owner, you may have talent, but without business sense, then the business will fail.  So, I read everything under the sun and spoke with people who were in private practice.  There's a good training manual from Bob Walsh via the ACA on starting a mental health private practice, but there are also several podcasts and manuals on how to do it.  Check out the AMHCA as well.
[I'm wondering what kind of advice you have for an emerging professional, and what tips you might have for building a private practice? Also, how do you think the Affordable Care Act will impact the profession in the coming years?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gkcw/im_a_legit_licensed_marriage_counselor_and/cgwwwm5?context=5)|I wouldn't expect to enter private practice successfully until you have enough experience, so based on what you're focusing on, then I'd work at a detox or rehab center to start.  Most insurance panels require at least five years of experience post-license, plus other requirements.  It's doable, but I'd just rent office space from an existing practice until you have enough of a client base to afford to go full-time on it.  Many therapists have a full-time job at a facility and work part-time in private practice.  I think the Affordable Care Act will encourage people to get help in all avenues. I do have a few slots in my schedule pro bono work though.
[Can somebody acquire a mental illness after a breakup? My friend was dating somebody for about 10 years, they were on the verge of getting married, and he left her out of nowhere with only an email.  Recently it seems like her personality has changed. She seems moody and can become very accusatory with me in that ""I don't care about her"" and some other things that are obviously not true. There have been moments where she starts crying randomly over issues that happened months ago as well.  I've spent a great deal of time figuring out if I'm actually as uncaring as she thinks I am but none of my friends agree or to feel that way. Would I be wrong to suggest to her counseling and, if so, how would I go about doing it given her instability on occasion?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gkcw/im_a_legit_licensed_marriage_counselor_and/cgwxpi2?context=5)|Yes, people can have biological predispositions to certain mental illnesses, that are triggered by a traumatic event or stressor.  Some bounce back, and some do not and are forever dealing with it.  That's a horrible way to break up with someone.  I'd start with her feelings and empathize with her. I'd suggest that she speak with someone, because you're worried about her and care about her.
[Do you think people with PhDs or PsyDs should be permitted to prescribe psychiatric medications?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gkcw/im_a_legit_licensed_marriage_counselor_and/cgwrt35?context=5)|Yes, if they obtain acceptable education and training.  There's a shortage of qualified, competent psychiatrists in my area, and there's not enough primary care doctors who are comfortable and/or competent to handle the overflow.
[What steps did you have to take to get to where you are? And do you feel content with them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gkcw/im_a_legit_licensed_marriage_counselor_and/cgwsgjq?context=5)|I like to learn, so always am learning how to do my job better. So, overall I'm content, but there's always something to discover.  New research comes out all of the time.  And if I get fatigued in one area, then I switch every couple of years.
 |Bachelor's to Master's in Clinical Psychology-worked in the field throughout school, so I'd know what I'd want to do at first.
 |3,000 supervised hours providing counseling.
 |Preparing for and passing licensing exams.
 |Gathered enough varied experience, yet with some specialties, to provide full-range of care for clients on my own (without dealing with too much bureaucracy). 
 |Extensive continuing education.
 |I call the shots most times, and I'm happy about that.
[I may have missed this AMA, but I've heard it said that every person could benefit from seeing a therapist.  Do you agree or disagree with this statement?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gkcw/im_a_legit_licensed_marriage_counselor_and/cgwyk1b?context=5)|My stance is that I get a physical every year, why not get a check-up on my mind as well? For many people, it's a nice treat to go to a safe place to open up their thoughts and express them.
[What do you consider to be the boundary between therapist and client?   Has there ever been times where clients or patients have formed a bond stronger than normal, due to being so comfortable and trusting in baring their soul to you?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gkcw/im_a_legit_licensed_marriage_counselor_and/cgy1hbm?context=5)|Hi, we take courses in ethics and boundaries, plus required continuing education on it every license renewal period. There are accounts of boundary violations. The regulatory board can make sanctions and impose fines or you could lose your practice license, when violations occur.
 |I do work hard to establish a good working relationship, where the person doesn't grow abnormally attached to me. The rules and therapy relationship are discussed in the beginning. But yes, I've had some who do anyways and that is discussed. It's the therapist's job to handle it accordingly and establish or maintain boundaries. I purposely do not maintain an excessively long duration of treatment episode, and I space out sessions to discourage an abnormal dependence from occurring.
 |Typically, I'm temporarily more flexible with a child, elderly person, or someone who is suicidal, but coordinate with community resources, family, or friends as much as possible.
 |Often there's transference and countertransference, which is normal. I've had a few clients ask me out on dates, so that's addressed and usually they're referred to another therapist. We're supposed to be trained on how to handle that when it occurs. Often, it's useful information to discuss in session. If I've done my job well, then the person doesn't ""need"" me.
 |Therapists aren't supposed to form dual relationships, in order to protect clients, as they're in a vulnerable position. We don't do anything with clients outside of work. There's a whole list of rules. We try avoid it as much as possible. In small towns and rural areas, it's challenging.
 |The boundary is that I only enter a client's world when in my office, unless extreme emergency or crisis, and my clients don't enter my personal world. I tell my clients that if I run into them in the real world, which has happened, that I don't know them. They can come up to me and say hello, but that's their choice. I'll not violate their privacy. 
[While she is extremely warm and friendly, I do also have insight that it is for my benefit.  However I was wondering how you personally would react to a gift from a patient or client?  She is from South Africa so I was thinking of painting or drawing something from her region in SA and presenting it as a thank you gift for helping me get my life back.  Would that be bridging the border for you personally? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gkcw/im_a_legit_licensed_marriage_counselor_and/cgyx13o?context=5)|Hi, you're welcome. I'm glad to hear that you're feeling better. Every therapist has their own application of how to manage the boundaries and tries to adhere to the rules for that area. I don't know how she'd react.  I think I'd love a handmade drawing or painting from a client, but it'd be best if presented when therapy has discontinued. I've received a few. It couldn't be something of much value, in order to be ok. Some people work around my rules and send things anonymously though. Enjoy:)
[How does one know when they're done with therapy?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gkcw/im_a_legit_licensed_marriage_counselor_and/cgwv5hg?context=5)|It takes time to realize whether therapy has been effective long-term or not. I have clients contact me years later who have revelations about what went on in there.
 |And it's a bit complicated. I'd say you're done when you take a break, spread out your appointments, and apply what you've learned. And you're done when you've got nothing left to say or nothing else to talk about, but just need to take action.
 |I end counseling once the goals have been met. I don't want to create a dependency on being in therapy. It is supposed to be a practice ground for application in real life.
 |It depends on why you're there too. I track depressive and anxiety symptoms at admission and at regular intervals. So, once it's mild, then it's definitely time to end. Or if the treatment was ineffective, then it's revamped or consider referral. I space out appointments to check for readiness and adjust as needed. 
[A man married for 40 years once told me never text your spouse. He counsels newly weds for his church and says it breaks down communication between couples. Any truth to that? (I thought what he said made sense\).](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gkcw/im_a_legit_licensed_marriage_counselor_and/cgwyo5u?context=5)|There's truth to that, but I should clarify.  There's hardly any emotion at all in a text, but some people express themselves best in a written format.  Never hash out an argument or have a deep discussion over a text.  Many, many, many clients bring in texts, cite them, and have had miscommunications this way.
 |I'd not solely rely upon a text to tell someone you loved them, but sometimes it's necessary when someone is busy or not able to speak verbally.  And a cute text or a simple thinking of you, etc., goes a long way.
 |I think your partner deserves a real phone call or talk in person:)
[Thanks for the response! I can see how text messages have the potential to be misinterpreted due to the complexity of language being conveyed through verbal and physical emotion. I never actually gave much thought about it until this guy mentioned it to me. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gkcw/im_a_legit_licensed_marriage_counselor_and/cgx32s9?context=5)|You can often get good advice from someone who is in a long-term relatively happy marriage:) And he knows from speaking with lots of people too. :) It's true that 70% of communication is nonverbal. 
[I used to see a therapist before I got married. He always discussed his other clients with me. Is that weird?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gkcw/im_a_legit_licensed_marriage_counselor_and/cgx6ztl?context=5)|Yep, that's weird and illegal. 
[I am very interested in getting into the field of marital and family counseling. I am currently in the process of getting my Bachelor's in Psychology, and I would like to focus in on gender studies, or maybe minor in gender studies, so my question is: am I following the correct path for this field? and is the gender studies path a good idea, or is there another minor I should be looking at? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23gkcw/im_a_legit_licensed_marriage_counselor_and/cgwx7c9?context=5)|Best of luck with your studies.
 |I think gender studies is an important aspect of Psychology, so yes, it would be beneficial. Especially if it interests you, only do what you enjoy.  I believe you'd narrow it down in your Master's program and determine your specialty even further from there.

23hl57,4,2014-04-20,I [22 F] am terrified of going to work at the same place as my ex [25 M] of 10 months when I graduate college in May.,underth3radar,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/23hl57/i_22_f_am_terrified_of_going_to_work_at_the_same/,"I interned at a company last summer and met him on my first day of work. Within 2 weeks we were dating and started basically living together (even though I still had my own apartment) a couple months later. Things got very serious very fast, and when I got the offer to come back after graduation for a full-time position we started making long term plans for getting a place together, meeting parents etc. During this time I also discovered he is bisexual, and eventually came to the painful realization that he was never going to be happy being in a monogamous relationship with just me (he never cheated, just talked about threesome, swinging, etc. very often).


I broke up with him a couple of months ago and it was the hardest thing I've ever had to do because he was my first love. Everyday I wish there was some other option because I want to be with him. 


I'm terrified of having to see him when I start back at work in May. We will be working very close to eachother on the same floor, and are also both on the same team so I will see him in meetings etc. 


I don't know how I will handle this. We were pretty much together for the entirety of my internship last summer, so I cant imagine not walking in to work each morning with him, or hanging out with him when I get bored, or practicing presentations with him, or going to him when I need help with something. It's going to be a slap in the face when I realize I'm completely alone at work and he's not going to pop his head in and joke around with me when he gets a free minute. 


If anyone has experience with this, please please help me figure out how to handle this. I'm terrified of how my body will respond the first time I see him in the hall or in a meeting. 


I thought I was slowly getting over him over the past couple of months, but as graduation gets closer and I realize I'm going to be face to face with him in a month I'm completely breaking down and losing it. My stomach is in knots and I'm having a hot flash just thinking about it. 



TL;DR Terrified of having to see my ex at work every day after I graduate."

Yeah so, basically, I'm a brown belt from Scandinavia. I won gold in Rome IO in my (rather tough) division. Then I cut some weight, felt tired and only placed second in the No-Gi Europeans the day after. Ugh!

Well, in any case, I'd like to compete in the international scene a lot more. But I have no money! GAAH! It's driving me insane. I'm a student, and I'd love to partake in all (or at least one or two?!) the big international tournaments, because I know I'd do well -- for example, my division in Rome IO had a 2013 brown belt no-gi world champion, so I'm pretty confident that I know at least a bit of jiu jitsu. In any case, so expensive. Mad! And gis are expensive, too. And apparently, if you're not from the US or from the UK, no one really has any interest in you, even if you do really well and have a lot of potential...?

So like, how do other people do it? The more-or-less professional fighters? Do you guys know any? They're being sponsored by gi companies and such, I presume? Aaaand I suppose they get money teaching jiu jitsu? Well, here you don't. And I'm currently studying 5 days a week, which includes working as an intern, and then training every day for as much as I can. It's exhausting, and doesn't really feel worthwhile all the time, as I still can't participate in international tournaments.

So uh, yeah. Got that off my chest, at least.

23ietg,1,2014-04-20,Backpack for working 8 months in Paris (x-post from /r/minimalist),thatslexi,travel,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/23ietg/backpack_for_working_8_months_in_paris_xpost_from/,"Hi! 

I'm French and moving to Paris for 8 months, including 6 during which I'll be doing an internship in the luxury business (which is why I need to wear casual but elegant clothing at work). As a personal challenge, I have chosen to only take a (big) backpack with me, and a handbag (big enough for carrying my computer).

Here is my packing list. Do you think I've forgotten some important stuff, or there are some things that I absolutely don't need? (For the first few weeks I'll be staying at friends' or couchsurfing, until I find a small flat to move in.)




BACKPACK

-A handbag (which I both use for work and for going out – it’s too small for carrying my computer, which is why I’ll just fold it and put into my backpack instead of using it as my smaller travel bag, which I’ll show you under this list)

-Some plastic glasses; they will let me live without having to buy glassware immediately after moving, and when put inside a big sock, they also provide small storage inside the backpack.

-A Thermos food container (I’ll have to check if it also keeps liquids – if it doesn’t, I’ll carry a 50cL water bottle in the train). The best part about this container is that there’s a spoon inside the cap! My mom bought it for me a couple of years ago, and it proved really useful.

-Cloths; since my mom has a lot, I wouldn’t want to have to spend money on lower-quality ones. Plus, since I might be staying in pretty filthy places in the beginning since I don’t want to spend much, I’d rather be able to wash the floor a little!

-A towel, because being clean is cool and being dry is even cooler.

-A toiletries purse, including makeup and jewelry

-A pair of sunglasses

-One large T-Shirt to sleep in

-Underwear, consisting of: 15 panties, 6 bras and 15 pairs of socks if I’m lucky (which I am not, so I’ll take whatever I can find)

-One pair of high-heeled work shoes, which I would DEFINITELY not bring if I wasn’t forced to wear them at work. They take lots of space and they hurt my feet.

-One pair of casual shoes, which are extremely light and don’t take lots of space, but could be more comfortable. Guess you can’t have everything.

-2 trousers that I can wear for work

-2 skirts: one I can wear for work, one casual

-1 pair of casual shorts and the appropriate leggings (which will also do for wearing under a skirt or a dress, or as comfy clothing for home; multi-purpose is the key word here)

-1 pair of casual jeans, as light as possible

-Sports clothes: one tank top, one pair of running pants.

-2 pull-overs for work

-2 tank tops

-4 tops which I can wear at work

-1 casual T-Shirt

-1 formal work outfit

-1 little black dress; that stuff really goes with everything formal or dressy casual.

-1 raincoat (or, more specifically, light coat that also incidentally happens to be waterproof)

-My tea collection, if there's a bit of extra space





IN MY SMALLER BAG

This bag has a shoulder strap. I will put my fragile and important stuff, and the things I might need to use often.


-A pen and a notebook

-A pair of scissors: I do not want scissors in the same bag as my clothes.

-My computer, its charger, my earphones, the mouse and the mousepad; the mouse and mousepad may go in the big bag if there is still space.

-A folder for all my printed documents (I’ll scan most of them, but keep the insurance and the mandatory papers to get an apartment), including all my TIME covers, which make fantastic decoration for an apartment wall, aren’t heavy and barely use up any space

-A stick of deodorant

-My wallet

-My phone and its charger




WHAT I'LL BE WEARING DURING THE MOVE

For maximum space gain, I’ll be wearing my heaviest gear:

-A scarf

-Sports shoes

-Jeans

-A warm pullover, fit for work

-A top that’s fit for work

-A warm jacket (which I’ll probably carry in my hand because it might be pretty warm in May)

-My glasses







So, any advice? =)

When contacted for comment on this situation jshrlzwrld had this response, ""Well... you see... what had happened was I dropped my controller and apparently some paperwork may or may not have been sent over to accept one of these offers.

i was in a relationship at age 14, that i held on to after the expiration date in 2003.
i was hospitalized once for depression in 2005. 

i broke up with my girlfriend in january 2006. i had hope for the future, i was happy to be a free man to do what i wished. i drank for the first time in february 2006 - age 20- and i smoked for the first time in may 2006. i went to la for a research program that summer, and loved it.  i smoked once more in 2006.  my life was going great! i was finishing three bachelors degrees and headed to grad school.

i smoked once in 2007, at the end of my senior year of college. i was doing well, starting grad school. i became really depressed. was put on medication for bipolar disorder.

i started 2008 with some hope: i'd have an internship at microsoft games this summer. a lot of interns at msft smoked.  i smoked ~ 30 times that summer. i was happy. i had practice thinking about why i could be happy, what that felt like and why i should do more of that.  the internship ended, i started working full time in fall 2008. i started dating a wonderful, beautiful girl named christine.  i was happy, but something was still missing. i was still sad inside. christine and i broke up in october.  i smoked again in december.


i came back from visting my family for christmas and felt really depressed. i wanted to get high. i found a dealer in town, and i smoked ~ 100 times in 2009.  i'd come home from work, get high, and work on a game that i hoped i could sell. i started thinking about the future being unstable, and told myself i could save the world. in the spring, i told myself  i should quit. i tried; it didn't stick. 


i smoked ~ 200 times in 2010. i was miserable. i changed girlfriends a few times, put one game 'on hold' and started another, put that 'on hold' and started another. i changed jobs. moved to san francisco, as if that would help me. i was obsessed with zen buddishm and thought weed would help me reach enlightenment. i was obsessed with the singularity and thought weed could help me start it. i tried to quit multiple times; i'd smash my piece, give away my stash, and each time i'd relapse a few days later. the first time i'd ever carried a balance on my credit card was march 2010. it gradually grew bigger and bigger. i took out a loan against my 401k to try to help pay the card down. it didn't work.

i smoked ~ 300 times in 2011. i changed jobs twice more. i was an early employee (#11 or so) at uber - which is now a $3bn comapny. i was the CTO of game company. i spent two months in ukraine, and was sober the whole time as well as another month afterwards. the first time in years i felt this good. i was working hard, exercising - even eating vegetables. i moved out of SF and was away from drugs all the time - but also away form my friends. i relapsed in fall 2011 and started having intense hallucinations.   i felt like the whole world was based on lies, emotional games and manipulation that nobody talked about. i was angry at the world.  i took on more credit card debt and spent 20k on therapy.

i smoked ~ 400 times in 2012. i spent another 10k on therapy. i hallucinated all the time, thought 2012 was it, and that the whole world depended on me. that i was dead and in purgatory. that i was in the matrix. that i was in a false reality and could peel away the veneer if i got high enough. that i could talk with animals and that i was prometheus and mercury, the jesus of computers and a techno-buddhist hacker warrior monk, alan turing reincarnated, an alien lizard who had learned empathy and wanted to communicate it to the new world order financial elite who were also lizard people trying guard the multiverse. they saw empathy as a weakness and i wanted to communicate to them that it's a strength. they laughed at me with sharp teeth, flicked their tongues. i had broken ancient laws to keep the world safe, and tried to invoke ancient powers to destroy it. i wanted humans to travel to the stars, and i wanted civilization to crumble before we got out there to pollute them, too. i was hospitalized in january, again in august, again in december after a serious breakdown. my car was stolen, my house was broken into, the rental car i'd been driving was smashed in a hit an run, my uncle had brain cancer and my grandma was developing dementia. i existed in all universes at once, the bodhisattva sent to enlighten the world by being high all the time. my ex girlfriend christine moved across the country and moved in as a roommate, a friend. she had no idea how bad things were, and she took care of me when i had the breakdown.

i smoked ~ 40 times in 2013. i was hospitalized twice in january, with no job. my family and friends told me to throw in the towel as a functional adult and to go on social security. i kept going. i got a job at google. i was terrified to fall asleep every night. the dreams were weird and unstable. i was always in a computed reality, punished for my sins, but my kindly captors who wanted me to learn the error of my ways. i was still hallucinating regularly, but i kept the hallucinations inside and didn't tell anyone about them. i still smoked about once a week or so at first. i started dating christine again, with the agreement that once i paid off my credit card debts - which i'd accumulated over the past few years - we'd get engaged.  i worked at google, i tutored for extra money, and i completed a small mobile app early in the year. christine and i fought every time i smoked, which i did less and less often. each time it was intense, i felt powerful and terrified and confused and certain. i couldn't sleep for a day or two and felt depressed for three or four. i smoked every week or so at first. every month or so after that.  things gradually got better. i went from having no car to driving a 15-year old toyota to a 3 year old mazda that my fiance took the risk of cosigning on for me. i exercised more. all year long, week by week, things got a little better. the last time i smoked was late october 2013.


since then, i have received two awards at work. a product i created is now in beta, i've written a manuscript for a novel. i'm healthier; i run several times a week, faster and with better form than ever. i paid off all my credit card debt. my finance christine - who believed in me when no one else did - are engaged and planning our wedding. i have vivid dreams. i accept my weaknesses. i spend less than i earn. i plan for things. i have a todo list. i eat vegetables. i believe in myself, and i see my mistakes now as chances to learn instead of indicators that the world is broken.

you can do this, guys. just don't give up. keep going. "

I am a computer engineering student so I have some programming under my belt, Java, C, python, Django, Ruby. Since my background and interests are in cyber security, that is where my work and internships have been in so I do not believe I have too strong of a webdev/web design background--albeit I could pick something up relatively quickly. 



What I want to do is to make a personal website where I can introduce myself, have a user send an email, post my twitter/linkedin/etc, post my resume.



Ideally the pages would probably be something like:    
   
* Home/About
* Link/Page to Twitter/Facebook/LinkedIn 
* Link to my resume
* Send Email to me



My friend has told me the easiest way would probably be to modify one of the templates at: [http://html5up.net/](http://html5up.net/) or use Twitter Bootstrap.



Anyone have other ideas? 



I believe this: [Astral](http://html5up.net/uploads/demos/astral/) template is pretty good and all I would have to do would be to modify the files for myself (and probably have to learn some HTML and CSS to format it the way I like)

Two schools in mind:
Direct admitted into Indiana University's Kelley Biz school
Kentucky with more scholarships and cheaper costs

IU would cost me about 130k-140k in loans while Kentucky would cost me about 40k.

Parents will be providing little to no money unless they still stick with their plan to downsize their home (which doesn't sound brilliant to me). I have about $5k in savings myself and I'm making a couple of thousand over the internet so far.

Majors in mind: Finance/Accouting however I am taking interest into Econ and Stats as well.

What do you guys think is my best plan of action? Thanks for any advice.

Also a follow up question that was on my mind is whether or not IU would be worth the extra money because of its higher rankings.

I plan on busting my ass to get internships or to pick up a minor as well, so would those rankings not even matter when I could go the cheaper route to Kentucky?"

I've always been a sting bean my whole life and I'm really hoping to bulk up this summer. Problem is I got a internship which requires me to work **8am-5pm monday-friday** every week of the summer. 


However, I have an hour lunch break! There is a nice gym 5 minutes away so I've decided to commit **every single** one of my lunches to going to the gym and trying to bulk up. Problem is whenever I'm at the gym I never know what to do, I have **no routine or schedule** when I'm there.


I was hoping all you smart people of r/Fitness can help me get a routine I can follow every week to bulk up! I will be getting food on my way back to work and most likely eat it at my desk. It will probably consist of yaya's chicken pitas (because they are deliciousss!) and a pro-crunch bar/protein shake drink for that **extra protein**. 


As for my routine, I've heard **bench press**, **squats**, and **deadlifts** are the necessary trio to bulk up at the gym. I really want to get a bigger upper body so I was thinking of doing bench press monday, wednesday, and friday, and then on tuesday and thurday I would do one squat day and one dead-lift day. 


On top of these exercises, I would like to do other exercises for my other muscles, probably for my biceps, triceps, shoulders, and back but I'm uneducated in what would help me get bigger in the best way. Also, I want to make sure my muscles won't be unbalanced. 


I would love to hear some of your routines or recommendations for what I should do. I'll probably only have a **maximum of 45-50 minutes** to workout but I will stick to the schedule **5 days a week religiously**. Once Fall hits, I will go back to my college, and hopefully I can bring my workout to a gym near my college.


Also, if people were interested in progress pics, I might do a couple pics before the summer starts and then pics after the summer is over, but that's only if people are really interested. 


I hope I'm not violating any rules, but I would appreciate anyone's input! Thanks everybody!!"

And just multiple times today even. I thought if I waited a bit more, answers would come to me. Sooo, I am here on this subreddit because they haven't. I have looked at other subreddits ( http://metareddit.com/r/jobs http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/ http://www.reddit.com/r/Employment/ http://www.reddit.com/r/resumes ), but have not found help that may help me in my specific situation. Maybe I just haven't looked hard enough, or maybe because of my tendency to procrastinate (that I AM trying to break myself of) I didn't think it applicable, or some other reason. I haven't posted on any of those sub reddits because, again, I hoped answers would come to me. Any and all help will be appreciated...

Okay, so here is my situation (I will try to make it a list of points for easy reading): 

* I went to college for Genetics. I've wanted to work in it since I was ~ 10-12 years old. My degree is a Bachelor's of Science with a major in Biology: Recombinant Gene Technology, and Minors in Chemistry and Philosophy. I want to use my degree to get a job as a sort of lab tech which, at least time I did any research, earn a livable wage of between $10 and $15 an hour. I hope to then use such work experience to help me get into a grad school. (Other life goals would be Visiting Australia, but I'm sure that can come much later... )
* I completed it in 4 years (8 semesters) with a 2.36 GPA. (I thought that was my GPA... And it may be for just my program, but I have since rechecked my transcript and my overall GPA is 2.92.) I graduated in 2010. 
* Since then I have moved with my parents as my father has had to move for jobs. I come from North Eastern Ohio, where I still have a friend, and from college I know someone near WVU in Morgantown in West Virginia. My brother moved to Central Wisconsin when myself and my parents were up there. Now I currently live in northern Indiana. (I mention all this because I mean to say that for an interview, I would have a place to stay to drive there the night before, stay the night, and be fresh for an interview the next day. I'm trying to keep my options open so that I'm not looking for a job in just a ~50 mile radius of where I live, but also a ~50 mile radius of family/friends.)
* Since graduating I have only had one job for 2.25 years in a factory. Aluminum Extrusion. I've been unemployed for a year and 7 months, now, living with my parents where they move to.
* I have no research experience because while I got a scholarship to attend the college, I had to pay for transportation, books, and etc. I ended up often unable to accept ""Unpaid Internships"" or other internships that would leave me with no or not enough net gain in income. 
* I have paid off all student loans I had. I also have no want to get MORE student loans to take more classes that may or may not help my degree or GPA. So I have thought about going back to school, but it does not seem a viable option.
* I do not have interview appropriate wear, so if I could get some sort of 'fashion advice' too on what is acceptable wear...?
* I do have a working vehicle, and I do have resources that I could make a 7-8 hour drive, and back, from Northern Indiana.
* I have a rather poor looking resume because I have no pertinent work experience and it's been 4 years since I graduated.
* I haven't kept in contact with professors so I would need to know how to approach then or if I should even worry about asking them for or listing them as potential work references.

What I need to know is: what is my first step? Do I fix my resume and curriculum vitae? Make a cover letter? Research potential places of employment? Are there any good resources for looking up such a specific job? Contact past professors? Etc. I feel lost, and because I feel lost I've kept putting things off, and because I have a close friend with things I'm involved in there, I thought I could just keep helping her and working with her, and it would, I dunno, 'Build Momentum' into me getting my life back on track... something. I repeat, I feel lost, and don't know what my first step is. I just know I need to get my life moving **SOMEWHERE**...

Soo, Thank you for reading, I hope it wasn't too much a chore, and I have now delayed my family from eating long enough, I guess, to write this. I will try to be back to this in a few hours. I thank anyone who offers advice."
23jp57,8,2014-04-20,Calling all Clemson computer scientists,ZonkedKamikaze,Clemson,https://www.reddit.com/r/Clemson/comments/23jp57/calling_all_clemson_computer_scientists/,"Hey everyone! I'm having an extremely difficult time with my college decision and I need your help (and fast because it's due in like a week...). I plan on majoring in computer science, but I'm not the stereotypical nerdy computer science student. I played football and lacrosse in high school and I want to join a fraternity in college, hell half the the reason I applied to Clemson is because of how awesome the football culture seems! So I wanted to hear from Clemson computer science students or alumni about the computer science program. It isn't as highly ranked as the other schools I'm considering, but that doesn't really matter to me all that much as long as the opportunities are there. Do you find that there are a lot of options for internships and jobs? I've been trying to find statistics for job placement or average starting salaries and I haven't found much, so that's why I'm coming to you. Tell me a little about your experience with the program!

Like I said I don't really consider myself a nerdy kid, and I really wanted a college town feel with the school I go to, so that's what made me feel like I would fit in at Clemson versus the other schools I am considering, like Georgia Tech. I also wanted to go somewhere warm and in the south with a great football atmosphere which makes Clemson seem way better than the other school I'm considering, Purdue. The only problem is that both of those schools seem to offer so many internship and job opportunities so I'm worried that choosing to go to Clemson just because it's cheaper and seems like way more fun isn't the best idea...(if you could convince me otherwise that would be great!)  

Also, coming from New England, would I fit in? I love college football and everyone says I'm pretty preppy so I thought it would be a great fit, but do people look at you differently if you aren't from the south? It seems like most of the fraternities are primarily South Carolina kids, which I wouldn't really mind, but would they not even consider me because I'm not from the area?

Anyway, thanks in advance for your help. Hopefully I'll be at your school in the fall, and if not I hope you guys can give me some good advice to help me find the right fit no matter where that is!

**TL;DR** How is the computer science program with getting internships and a job after college? Clemson seems like a great fit for me and it's about $10,000/yr cheaper than Georgia Tech or Purdue, the only problem is those schools seem to have much better career opportunities. Is this really the case, or are the opportunities there for you at Clemson if you work hard enough?"
23jqn6,1,2014-04-20,Internship option could lead to family falling apart. Not sure what to do.,[deleted],Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/23jqn6/internship_option_could_lead_to_family_falling/,"I'm 20, living at home, and a junior in computer engineering in college.  I have been applying since November for internships for the summer because my family is moving to another state, and I really don't want to go with them for the summer. 

I finally got an offer for a local telephone company of an internship doing programming and creating a wiki for their customers and its 40 hours a week for the first 6 weeks of summer, and then if they like my work, they will allow me to be a part time employee until I graduate doing management on their systems and helping customers.  I accepted the offer for the internship.

Now a little backstory.  My family is really controlling.  I had to fight them for the longest time to get them to let me get an apartment for the summer and my last school year here because I've never been allowed to do anything on my own.  After a huge argument and a settlement on me staying being the decision, I got a call last week.

It was a call from a government engineering internship in a big city, asking me to do a full time, full summer internship for the summer.  It is also in the city where my boyfriend's (of 3 years) family is, and his dad (who I have a great relationship with) offered to carpool me to work everyday because he works on the same street as where my internship would be.  The pay is at least $5 an hour more and its guaranteed all summer.  

Not to mention, an internship doing actual engineering work for the government would look so much better than programming and creating a wiki for a local telephone company...

I tried to talk to my parents about it, and they flipped out.  They said if I went, I would be going against my word to them about staying here, and that I can't turn back on the internship I already accepted here.  They said if I take it, they wouldn't support me anymore.  

So here's my 2 questions.

1)  Would taking this internship, which is obviously a better deal for me, be a mistake since it could potentially cause a break between me and my family?  Or do I just need to cut my losses and go because I need to show my family I'm making my own decisions...

2) Is it even viable to think I could talk my way out of the first internship I accepted?  I really want this engineering internship, it is such a good opportunity and I really don't want to miss out on this.

Any advice would be appreciated.  Sorry if wordy.  I'm really torn here."
23jt8w,0,2014-04-20,My Google Internship,ITclown,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/23jt8w/my_google_internship/,"A few months ago I had the rare opportunity to work part time as an intern at Google. At first, it was awesome, free food, comfy as fuck chairs and enough weird and wacky people to keep it interesting. My crew and I had a lot of fun working together on new design products that our bosses at the time wanted us to work on. It wasn’t easy but we figured it out, fairly quickly. It was in august, however when things started becoming more and more unusual. My boss had asked me to take part in a seemingly normal activity but I digressed.

""Take these files down the caching room, first door on your left. And Braxton, don't go anywhere but the first door on your left. You got me?"" 

""Yes, sir. I'll be quick about it.""

""Good.""

I did just as I had been asked, and did it just as I said I would; in a timely manner without fraying from the task at hand. Now this is probably the point in other stories like creepy pasta, or Stephen King where I’d say the hallways were dark and depressing and lacking color or whatever but it's not one of those stories, Okay?

I had arrived at the ""caching and stacking"" hallway. The hallway's colors were not absent. The red and white's that covered everywhere else were still present and the rooms were still filled with the normal, half egg chairs and laptops. What did catch my attention though was the first room to my right. The lights were off. Not unusual but we were all on the app creation challenge and everyone else was hard at work but this team's room was entirely vacant. I knew that because they had left their doors open and laptop's running. I ignored it and gave the files to the girl in the caching room. Her name tag read ""Amy"".

She had seemed normal enough. She had long red hair accompanied by many other fantastical features. Before I left, I slipped my cell number under the folder with my name and a semi scribbled sentence saying:

""Text me?""

As I fumbled back up the stair's I noticed a few of my group members huddled around the lounge in red, yellow and blue bean bag chairs. As we were finishing up brainstorming app ideas my phone rang and my ungodly annoying ringtone sounded of bubble's popping. I looked down it read inside of a green text bubble.

""Dinner at the food court?"" I texted back in empathy.

""Yeah, 5 sound okay?"" I was crossing my fingers.

As the clock drew closer and closer to my half-assed dinner reservation I wished my group mates good bye and headed off. I looked around for a moment then I noticed her hair. Her silky red hair flew gorgeously in the wind. She had one had pressed against her cheek. I waved and she waved back. We talked very mundanely until I mentioned the group across the hall. She looked puzzled.

""What's wrong?"" I asked one eye brow raised and my eyes fixated on hers.

""Nothing it’s just, you confused me. That's all."" Her tone was chalking and I could tell she was nervous.

""How so?""

""That room has been vacant forever. No group has been in there since well, I think 3 maybe 4 summers ago. It's just weird that's all nothing more, nothing less.""

""Why not?""

""You sure do ask a lot of questions don't you, Braxton?"" She sounded sarcastic.

""I guess so, Amy."" I replied. I'll admit at this point I was kind of sketched out but more intrigued none the less.

""Just tell me, please?"" I sounded almost beggy, but I had to hear the end of this. 

""Someone went missing here a few summer's ago, Braxton. But once his group mate's found out they went looking for him. And they haven't been seen since."" She seemed shaky and a small tear rolled down her sad red cheek.

Neither of us talked for the rest of the time we were together at that table.

That night, I couldn't sleep. I lied wide awake. In my half egg shaped, chair. I watched the clock ""Tic Tok, Tic Tok, Tic Tok"" back and forth. It was about four a.m. when my longtime friend and group partner; Garrett struggled awake from his dorm and wandered into mine. 

""Hey bro, you up?"" He questions as he slid his group ID card into the scanner to open the door.

""Yeah, I'm awake."" I sputtered, fiddling with a tennis ball in hand. ""You seem lively, what're you up for.""

""Couldn't sleep. Just nervous for the app revealing tomorrow. And you?""

""Let's go for a walk."" I said. Without a word we headed off into the lounge, spotting a few other guy's spread out across the wooden presentation bleachers in the main hallway.

""What're we walking for?"" Garrett questioned, a yawn following his curiosity. 

I didn't answer I was far too busy thinking about the archive room. ""We have to get in there” I said to myself as we entered the “caching and stacking"" hallway. It was beyond eerie. All the lights were off and the vibrant greens’ and blue's, red's and yellow's that used to accommodate the once seemingly exotic hallway. 

I panned across the hallway. All was silent, the only noise was our footstep’s and the muffled talking of the 24/7 Google broadcast. I could practically quote it, I’ve seen it so many time’s. The door on the right was shut.

“Fuck. The door’s locked.” I murmured. Discouraged and slightly pissed off I remembered something Amy had said to me, she had said that there wasn’t a team. That the door was open in case a new team started and needed a place to room. 

“Garret, you remember how to pick locks?” I asked.

“Shit Brax, I was only a locksmith for 8 years. I’m sure this one won’t be any different. Got any gum?” 

“Why?” 

“I need it.” He said holding out his hand motioning for me to spit out the gum I was munching on. 

I spit out my gum into his palm. He carefully slid it over the keycard and opened the lock. I was impressed to say the least but I knew he’d get us in. 

The room looked vacant. No clothes hung in the closet, and the laptops that were on the small table were no longer placed there. The beds were neatly made and no one resided in them. But the smell was awful. The room smelled of a putrid, foul odor that I couldn’t see being at Google. Garrett slid his hand on the wall looking for the light switch. He flicked it and as he did a long “PING” sounded throughout the room.

Garrett crashed to the floor and there in the dully illuminated room stood Amy, wielding a light blue aluminum bat that was dented from where Garrett’s skull had met it.

“I warned you about here didn't I? Even Darek,your boss told you to stay out of here but would you listen? Oh, no you just wouldn't fucking listen!” She swung the bat smashing a lamp of a night stand. Her voice sounded hellish. 

I backed into a corner, my heart racing at million beats per second. She raised the bat ready to swing. A hand reached out grabbing the barrel. Amy fought against Garrett’s hand which was trying to overpower her. She got the better of him. She reared back and for the second time smashed his Head against his head drawing blood which stained the beautiful white furniture.

She swung at me I ducked, kicking her in the knee as I touched the floor. I ran down the hall and hooked around the corner opened the first room to my right by breaking the lock and slammed the door behind me. I was nervous, but I managed to find a light switch. My eyes were stuck open as I took in my surroundings. It was a red room. Undeveloped photo’s hung from strings above the sink. Most of them pictures of me and of my team. I noticed all of them had me in them. I was holding onto the sink, splashing water in my face to calm down, when I heard the crashing of the glass window from the door being broken and clattering onto the floor. I shook; the bat broke into the door viciously swinging. 

“Amy, please! You don’t have to do this it’s okay, really just drop the bat please.” I shouted, trying to sound as stoic as I possibly could.

“You should have listened Braxton, now it’s time you get what you deserve.” She lunged forward and my better instincts kicked in. I rolled out the way. I stood up and grabbed the nearest thing to me. A pen. What the fuck was I going to do with a pen? She swung at me again with the bat and I used my make shift weapon. I blocked with my left arm. She broke it with the force of the bat. I reached around and dug the pen straight through her neck, leaving her bleeding.

I sprinted back to the room where Garrett was. I saw him, motionless on the ground blood leaking from his temple I was almost certain he was dead. I was an EMT for years so I knew what to do. First I checked his pulse. It was there but fading fast. I ripped my shirt sleeve off and wrapped it around his head holding it there. I reached into his suit pocket dialing 911.

“911 what’s your emergency?” A female operator. 

“Yes, my friend has been hit with a bat. He’s bleeding fast” I shouted, shaking whilst I held the cloth against my friend’s temple. 

“Okay, sir do you have any prior medical experience?” The operator seemed calm. Lucky for her I guess.

“Yes, I’m an EMT of four years I’m keeping the blood in but I can’t do this alone.” I was calming down but I felt Garrett’s heart rate lower, still. 

“Okay, help is on the way. What’s the address of which you're located?” 

“1600 Amphitheatre Park way. In the Googleplex sub basement dorm 24c.” 

“Okay sir ambulance and police are dispatched just stay on the line with me okay.”

“Sure.” I felt his pulse. It was still beating but it wouldn’t be for long. 

It took 17 minutes for the police and EMT’s to arrive to get Garrett out and to arrest Amy on assault and battery charges. My boss and I spoke a while whilst the paramedic’s placed my arm in a sling. 

“You’re stupid, Braxton. You disobeyed my direct orders and furthermore have cost us a ton of time and created some unfixable delays.” His voice seemed both scowling and sympathetic a rare combination but his Arabian accent helped pull it off.

“I know I’m sorry I just wanted to learn more about the missing team and snooping around seemed like the best way to go about it.” I spoke ashamed and disappointed. I motioned to remove my lanyard but his arm reached out to stop me. 

“You disobeyed me, sure but we need more people here at Google like you. Welcome aboard team Braxton.” He smiled at us. And wishing Garrett good luck. Amy died from the pen wound. But I still work at Google with team Braxton. Garrett made a full recovery but suffered extreme brain damage as a result. He’s still a wiz at writing code but his speech is slurred now. I guess the reason why I’ve posted this is to share something with you. A memory that I have, that I haven’t told many people in a very long time.

Google on, my friends."

It was a casual hook up but we eventually started to fall for each other. We had great chemistry. She suffers from depression, so I'm assuming this is why she made a post on CL. She kinda fell for me hard in the beginning and the by the time xmas came we both loved each other. She also gave me an STD, chlamydia. I got suspicious of course as we both tested for STDs before we were serious in this relationship. I don’t know if she cheated tbh, because she would always text me or be with me generally.

Once summer time came she did her internship in South America and we did long distance for the whole summer, 5 months or so. We would always contact each other via text and skype when we can. I also visited her there and we had a blast. She came back when school started again. Over the course of the relationship I would help her with her depression (she has to take anti-depressants). She would feel extremely down and I would comfort her all the time, not at her request but because I loved her. She also lived with me and my family for a month because she couldn’t find a place in time once school started. Her father issues were pretty bad and I would comfort her at times of need.

She seemed to be bothered that I lived at home still. I mean I am mid 20s but I have no debt, my school is 15 mins away with my car and I also work (on and off during my relationship with her). I had money saved up from previous jobs as well. We would go on dates and do what other couples would usually do. One time my mother got upset at her because I wasnt invited to her family gathering, even though she was living at our place like she was part of our family. She let her know, to the point where my gf cried and felt terrible. 

After Valentines she told me that we shouldn’t see each other anymore. I was devastated, with everything I sacrificed and have done for her. She said that her feelings changed for me, that she doesn’t know, that she loves me still... all confusing shit. What I'm wondering is how the hell did she stop loving me? I have no closure about this relationship and why she ended it like that. I would text her, or call her asking what happened? Her birthday was also coming up and I had all her gifts. I gave them too her (we both decided to be 'friends'). They were sentimental stuff that I bought before the break up. A few days later she wanted to meet and talk. She said that she knew why she wanted to break it off, its because I live at home. So I told her that Im moving out anyways at the end of the summer. We walk to her place and she grabs me and kisses me. So I guess we were back together. We took it slowly.

After about a week of us being together, she got the stomach flu and I took care of her for 3 days by cleaning her place, making food, bringing food and being there for her emotionally and physically. She doesn’t have family in my city and her close friends dont either. Once she got better she broke it off with me again, so suddenly. I just dont get it, how can someone do that? Did she ever even love me? Was I just used? We planned so much together and she just threw it out. I tried contacting her to get know what happened exactly and how to improve myself in the next relationship, but she won’t answer my questions regarding about the relationship. Im still confused and really hurt by all of this. I think I just needed to vent, or get some inside information….

BTW there was no signals of her breaking up with me. She was a bit needy and still affectionate till the end.

It's a long one, so bare with me.

So I went on my fraternity formal trip to New Orleans with a girl I was set up with, whom I had never met before this. She turned out to be great, attractive, fun, and spontaneous. We hit it off pretty quickly on the bus ride there, she fell asleep on me, all that. I wasn't trying to have sex with her, I was only in it to get to know her (I'm at the point where I'm tired of just one-time hookups). She informed me that she was going to California (we live in Florida) in two weeks for an internship at Imagine Studios, and said that if she liked it, she probably wouldn't stay in Florida for too long and move out there permanently. So... Keep that in mind. 
Saturday was a little nerve-wracking, because the whole day I could tell she was holding back from getting to close to me, but we managed to have fun during the day, walked around the French Quarter together, and she made friends with all the people we hung out with. My friend (also a girl) befriended her and attempted to get her closer to me. She found out that ""she's not one to rush into relationships"" or ""doesn't think she deserves a relationship"", which could mean anything basically. Also, that she's more into the bad boy types, which I am not. 

That night, we went out, got drunk, and she was holding my hand for a majority of the night. Me and her went to the river and ""broke in"" to the ferry dock. She kissed me there, but we left because some security guard caught us, and went back to Bourbon Street. Once we got back to the hotel, we had sex. It wasn't good, I had whiskey dick and for some reason decided a condom was going to improve things. So basically the sex wasn't great, but I enjoyed it and she seemed to. Hell, I even apologized for my limpness, and she said she didn't mind (she might have...I couldn't tell). The bus ride back today was uneventful, because she wanted to sleep in an empty pair of seats, and I ended up sleeping the entire ride and didn't speak to her. Not intentional. And it was an awkward goodbye... We just hugged, said parting words, and that was that. 

But basically I'm at this point where I could try to pursue something with her, but she'll be gone for a whole month soon, and might not even come back. Any advice y'all can give me? I may have already answered my own question, but I would appreciate a third-party perspective. Thanks.

TL;DR We had mediocre drunk sex, she's a great person, but she's leaving soon. What to do..."

(Long)",[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/23jvpc/me_23_mf_with_my_ex_19_mf_15_years_ldr_broke_up/,"Not sure if i'm looking for anything or just want to rant..

Backstory:

We both live on the opposite side of the country and are both still going to school.  During the course of the relationship we have never done short distance and we would visit each other during summer or winter break.  There has never been a day we don't talk to each other.

Before we go into the breakup, please keep in mind that we still talk to each other, we still want to get back together in the future, and we still care about how happy we make each other. 

Breakup

For awhile ago, she has been unsatisfied with me for some time now.  I'm a very laid back person.  In the beginning of the year she has been pushing me to apply for internship around her area for the summer.  I have been holding it off, not realizing how urgent it was for her.  She took it as I'm not serious about her relationship and started doubting our future.  She then told me one day that she wants to start seeing other people too, instead of feeling confined to a relationship that she doesn't see a future with (Even though I promised her that after I graduate I will be moving to her place).  She expressed how unhappy she was about our distance, how I didn't apply for internships earlier, and how laid back I was.  At the same time, she doesn't want to lose me either as our for our relationship we never had serious arguments and we do our best to make each other happy.  A days after we broke up she would ask us to get back together, I declined and told her that we won't lose what we have build so far but she can date other people if she likes.  At this point I thought I have found the perfect solution, she can see other people but it will not affect our relationship.  I was expecting her relationships to be platonic.

Fast forward to her spring break.  On her springbreak, she went rockclimbing with one of her friend.  She knew him from previous semester and he stayed over at her place right after.  She missed me, got high with her friend and made out and also involved some sexual touching.  I was so upset about it that she promised it will never happen again and I shouldn't be holding it against her because she wasn't herself at the time.  It took me a few days to get over it.  I know he stays over at her place and sometimes she would stay over at his, but she doesn't tell me what they do unless I asked or they did anything more.  One day I called her one morning and she told me they had done more than just touching.  She had gotten as far has getting oral sex from him.  It was a little easier for me to accept since I knew she was becoming more sexually active with this guy.  She said she might not do it again because she didn't enjoy it as much as she thought she would and told me they agreed they would never sleep together.  I asked her then that she does not give him a blowjob because I'd feel weird about kissing her, she agreed.  The next week before she had him come over to her place and stayed over, I begged her to try and stay platonic with her friend, I repeated myself and at that point I could see her starting to get annoyed and pissed, so I hung up and went to sleep.  The next day when we talked everything seemed normal until i asked her if anything happened. At first she was trying to avoid telling me what happened.  I mistakenly took it for that they had sex and cried.  She then told that they did not have sex and admitted to giving him a blowjob.  Yesterday, I was told that she is going to get high and I should be anticipating that they will have sex.  I talked to her for a bit to express how upset i was feeling.  She got angry, upset, and sad about the whole situation and told me she isn't going to sleep with him if it makes me so upset.  She doesn't understand why having sex with another person is making me so upset.

Since the breakup, I've been more involved into talking to her. Checking up on her more frequently, be aware of when she is out of class.  I've been pushing her to tell me if anything non-platonic when she is alone with her friend.  I can see that sometimes she doesn't want to tell me but feels obligated to.

This is my first serious relationship so I know I can sound whiny, but any real advice would be appreciated. 

Am I just overreacting to the whole situation, confront her about how i'm feeling, or just cut off all contact with her (difficult because i don't know how i'm going to just cut off contact with the person i've been talking to everyday for the past 1.5years and been so close with)


---   
**tl;dr**: I really love this girl and we both want to hang on to what we have built.  I am WILLING to change for her.  But with all the promises that she has broken, and telling me she is going to sex with the guy after knowing how upset I will be is really pushing me to the limit.  I don't think it's the idea that having sex with another guy that's really bothering me, but the idea that she claims she wants me to be happy yet she thinks it's okay to be non-platonic with another guy while i'm emotionally attached.

23k0ne,13,2014-04-20,Any other graduating AE's having trouble finding a job?,[deleted],EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/23k0ne/any_other_graduating_aes_having_trouble_finding_a/,"Hey y'all,

So I'm graduating in a few weeks and have not had any job offers. In fact, I haven't had any interview offers either. I have only had two on-campus interviews and both were from talking to recruiters in person, yet I never heard back from either company afterwards. This whole situation has made me do a lot of introspection and has led me into several depressive episodes during the year. According to my peers I should have no trouble finding a job, yet not even getting a call for a phone interview has taken a huge blow to my self confidence.

Just to dispell some common responses to threads like this, I would like to state the following:

* I'll be graduating with a 3.60+ overall and major GPA from Georgia Tech.
* I've had my resume critiqued by friends, family, recruiters, professors, career services, you name it. Most have told me it's good and that I shouldn't be having any problems getting my foot in the door. I customize my resume based on the application, making sure I drop in key words (such as languages, related projects, etc...) from the job description.
* I have research experience relevant to aerospace.
* I TA mathematics classes and am comfortable talking with people and explaining things. From reviews I get from students at the end of the semester, a large majority leave positive comments saying that I'm friendly, approachable, helpful, etc...(several even saying I'm the best TA they've ever had). Because of this, I don't think my personality is the reason I'm not getting calls (although I did think this for a while).
* Googling my name comes up clean. Top result is my LinkedIn account and most links after that are mentions of me from activities at school and clubs.


I had the same problem finding an internship (which I never got) which I feel like is probably a big part of me not getting any calls. The whole ""experience for experience"" continuum has made me really jaded when I apply to jobs. So is there anything else I should be doing to better my chances at securing a job?"

23kdxy,74,2014-04-21,Found You,Daveswaffles,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/23kdxy/found_you/,"I don't know what's happening, and I would appreciate your help.

Over the last month, I've been suffering from a recurring nightmare that I've mostly attributed to stress. In my nightmare I see a man's face, with dark hair and blue eyes. The man looks happy at first, and he starts laughing. His laughing is weird though, it sounds more like a small child's laughter than a grown man's, as if a six year old were wearing the face of a middle-aged man. Anyway, he laughs for what seems like hours, but who knows how long it actually happens. Then his face becomes angry, and I can hear the same voice telling me over and over ""don't be alone, I can find you then. Don't be alone.""

As I said, these dreams had been happening for the last month, but over the last week they've been worse. Before, I would have the dream, wake up scared, and then fall back to sleep with no problem. It was scary, but I had been able to deal with it. Lately though, I see the face whenever I fall asleep, instead of just when I first fall asleep at night. 

Over Easter weekend, my roommates all left to visit their families, but because I am totally swamped with college projects and looking for an internship, I decided to stay in my dorm for the weekend. Big mistake. Last night, I was on the computer in my bedroom when I heard what sounded like someone running their palms along the outside of my bedroom door. I knew this couldn't be possible because I had locked the door to our dorm and deadbolted it, there was no way a stranger could have gotten in, and my roommates weren't due back until the next day. Being the coward that I am, I ignored the sound and hoped it would go away on its own. 

The noise stopped after about fifteen minutes, and after I had convinced myself that my imagination was playing tricks on me, I heard another sound. It was as if someone was using their fingernails to scratch at the drywall between my room and my roommate's bedroom. My bed is up against that wall, and it sounded as though the scratching was coming from the space right next to my bed. I turned around, so that my feet were up by my headboard, but the scratching followed me. Unnerved, I stood up and moved to my desk, which was backed up to the opposite wall, the wall between my dorm and the next dorm over. 

The scratching continued for another few seconds, but then stopped again. This time I didn't hear anything for nearly three hours, and deciding that at 4 am I should probably get some sleep I climbed back into bed. Except now instead of hearing scratching through the wall, I could hear tapping outside my window. Now, I live up on the fourth floor, with nothing outside my window but a sheer drop to the courtyard, there is no way anything living could be making that repeated tapping noise on my window. Terrified, I turned away from the window and attempted to ignore the noise, knowing my window was locked, but both the outside door and my roommate's bedroom door had also been locked and something had still managed to make its way in there.

Eventually, even with the tapping, I fell asleep. For the first time in weeks, I didn't have the dream with the dark-haired man, and when I awoke, I awoke to silence in my room. I pulled on a sweatshirt and stepped outside, checking to make sure that both my roommate's door and the outside door were still locked, and they were. Now convinced that I had made the whole episode up to myself, I stepped into the shower and turned the heat up to near-scalding temperatures, which is the only way to take a good shower.

I nearly slipped and fell when I came out of the shower though, traced in the fogged-up mirror were the words ""I found you."""

I am going to be applying for an internship for next summer with Boeing in St. Louis. This is my top choice for an internship. 

The reasons I think I will not be at the top of their list:

- I have an arrest on my record for criminal trespassing (stupid mistake 4 years ago)    This is my main concern
 - SIUE is not a top ranking school
 - My GPA is 3.7 - plenty of applicants will have higher
 - I have no other internship experience 

I feel these are legitimate concerns, especially the arrest. Are these deal breakers? Is there anything I can do in the next 5 months to enhance my resume? 

Also, will the arrest destroy my chances of any job in the defense industry?

You comments are greatly appreciated. 

EDIT: I'm definitely going to apply these are just concerns I've been thinking about for awhile.

23kfm7,1,2014-04-21,"I thought I was supposed to make the college decision, not my parents.",[deleted],rant,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/23kfm7/i_thought_i_was_supposed_to_make_the_college/,"Alrighty, as the title states I am in a bit of a dilemma of which college to choose for the next four years. The problem is that my parents and I don't see eye to eye on which college I want to go to. I have been accepted into Virgina Tech, University of Maryland College Park, and Grove City College. The first two are large public institutions and the last one is a small Christian college. We can't afford VT since it's out of state so I'm left with College Park and Grove City.

Now, my parents break down their opinion on which college I should choose based on mainly the education quality and the morals of the campus.

College Park: They feel that, even though the school has a high ranking engineering program, they feel that the school won’t help me out at all and will only treat me like a number. They don’t want a school that focus’s on its pride over academics. My mom also believes/feels “that the school itself is evil.” Pretty much she feels that it a moral wrecking ball waiting to happen.

Grove City: Despite its location and size, it has a great engineering program, and since it’s a Christian, conservative, 99% white school, it can do no wrong.

My opinion is as follows:

College Park: I wasn’t initially accepted into the engineering program or honors and it was probably due to the fact that they look for diversity and not hard work. I do want that college experience of school pride and meeting new people. I also have a lot of friends attending this school in the same major field.

Grove City: While it prides itself in (almost to) rigorous academics, conservative values, and Christian belief code, I really don’t want to deal with a strict and stingy campus. While I may get a chance to participate in sports here, they are a small school still. They are also highly ranked for internships and jobs right out of college.

Start Rant

Now I understand that college is first and foremost for an education to eventually prepare you for a job, but what I can’t quite comprehend is that my parents keep trying to push me into what they want me to do. I have always though of myself as a pretty devout Christian who sought to serve God, my parents, and others. To make a long story short I really felt that I haven’t had much of a say in my life from the sports I play to things I by. While this may be an over-exaggeration, I feel that I have built up a dependency complex where I always want to please my parents by just saying yes and not putting up an argument. Recently I’ve been trying to break this mold and choosing a college is one of these “slight pushes” against my parents. However, they still believe that they have to keep steering my on “their path” towards what they want. Because of this, and other clashes I have with my parents, I have generally distanced myself from interacting with my parents and I feel that my parents actions have made me question whether or not I believe the same as them.
To convince me not to go to College Park my mother brought up how several of her friend’s children hated attending CP, and wanted nothing to do with it, how since I waited so long to pick I will get a cruddy dorm, and how their internship program is a hassle. She also follows that with saying how every college has its share of parties and shenanigans. However, my father also tried to reaffirm the last point by sayings a friend’s son dropped out of GCC because he was partying, but how is that possible if it’s one of the driest campus and top non-party school in the U.S.. I don’t get why my parent’s feel that I’m going to be this frat party animal, because that’s not me. I feel that they assume I’m going to get shitfaced and make other “bad decisions” whilst at CP (maybe GCC idk). If I do party a little, so be it, but I highly doubt that I will do something stupid. And it all comes back to how controlling they are of my life, protecting me from the “evils of the world.” I just don’t understand that I’m not some sheltered homeschooler but I have been in a public school for the past 5 years. I can’t hide from the problems of the world just by going to a “safe” college. If there is a problem, I will deal with it, and I’m tired of always feeling that I need to depend on you for every freaking thing I do in my life! I don’t care if GCC is a conservative safe haven where “faith and freedom matter” where it seems that only white conservative Presbyterians fit in while any other belief is ignored. Is there a reason why GCC has been called “God’s Concentration Camp?” How come every student review is either they love it to no end or hate it with all their guts. (This may be true for all colleges)  And then you tell me to pray about which college to choose while you’re clearly telling me that if I don’t go to GCC and go to CP, I will be some alcoholic, heathenistic, drop out bum who will struggle every step of the way. I thought this was supposed to be my choice, literally I just pick one or the other, not have some huge ordeal where I need to be sat down and spoken to about MY FUTURE. If I’m going to be an adult, let me be an adult to make my own decision please. Instead of demonizing a school, try and look for some positives.

End Rant

	While I find both school are both good, I am between a rock and a hard place. Going to CP would make me happen, but it would disappoint my parents, while GCC is the opposite. I know studying wont be an issue hopefully seeing that I am still a hardworking senior with a high GPA, but I am a little concerned with the overall workload at both institutions. CP is secular school I most definitely will be a part of some Christian ministry (despite what my parents believe I will do), even if it is going to church on Sunday, however, I want to have the choice to go to church, not be forced to attend mandatory chapels at GCC and go to a school where a good amount of people are snotty Christians who think they are “holier than thou.” (This it what I have gathered from some, but not all, student reviews) 
	I am constantly told that I don’t understand yet because I’m not an adult with experience, but I keep feeling like I’m still trying to be sheltered. I feel that both schools can offer me a rewarding future, but I feel that the experience will greatly differ.

Grove City: Despite its location and size, it has a great engineering program, and since it’s a Christian, conservative, 99% white school, it can do no wrong.

My opinion is as follows:

College Park: I wasn’t initially accepted into the engineering program or honors and it was probably due to the fact that they look for diversity and not hard work. I do want that college experience of school pride and meeting new people. I also have a lot of friends attending this school in the same major field.

Grove City: While it prides itself in (almost to) rigorous academics, conservative values, and Christian belief code, I really don’t want to deal with a strict and stingy campus. While I may get a chance to participate in sports here, they are a small school still. They are also highly ranked for internships and jobs right out of college.

Now I understand that college is first and foremost for an education to eventually prepare you for a job, but what I can’t quite comprehend is that my parents keep trying to push me into what they want me to do. I have always though of myself as a pretty devout Christian who sought to serve God, my parents, and others. To make a long story short I really felt that I haven’t had much of a say in my life from the sports I play to things I by. While this may be an over-exaggeration, I feel that I have built up a dependency complex where I always want to please my parents by just saying yes and not putting up an argument. Recently I’ve been trying to break this mold and choosing a college is one of these “slight pushes” against my parents. However, they still believe that they have to keep steering my on “their path” towards what they want. Because of this, and other clashes I have with my parents, I have generally distanced myself from interacting with my parents and I feel that my parents actions have made me question whether or not I believe the same as them.

To convince me not to go to College Park my mother brought up how several of her friend’s children hated attending CP, and wanted nothing to do with it, how since I waited so long to pick I will get a cruddy dorm, and how their internship program is a hassle. She also follows that with saying how every college has its share of parties and shenanigans. However, my father also tried to reaffirm the last point by sayings a friend’s son dropped out of GCC because he was partying, but how is that possible if it’s one of the driest campus and top non-party school in the U.S.. I don’t get why my parent’s feel that I’m going to be this frat party animal, because that’s not me. I feel that they assume I’m going to get shitfaced and make other “bad decisions” whilst at CP (maybe GCC idk). If I do party a little, so be it, but I highly doubt that I will do something stupid. And it all comes back to how controlling they are of my life, protecting me from the “evils of the world.” I just don’t understand that I’m not some sheltered homeschooler but I have been in a public school for the past 5 years. I can’t hide from the problems of the world just by going to a “safe” college. If there is a problem, I will deal with it, and I’m tired of always feeling that I need to depend on you for every freaking thing I do in my life! I don’t care if GCC is a conservative safe haven where “faith and freedom matter” where it seems that only white conservative Presbyterians fit in while any other belief is ignored. Is there a reason why GCC has been called “God’s Concentration Camp?” How come every student review is either they love it to no end or hate it with all their guts. (This may be true for all colleges)  And then you tell me to pray about which college to choose while you’re clearly telling me that if I don’t go to GCC and go to CP, I will be some alcoholic, heathenistic, drop out bum who will struggle every step of the way. I thought this was supposed to be my choice, literally I just pick one or the other, not have some huge ordeal where I need to be sat down and spoken to about MY FUTURE. If I’m going to be an adult, let me be an adult to make my own decision please. Instead of demonizing a school, try and look for some positives.

While I find both school are both good, I am between a rock and a hard place. Going to CP would make me happen, but it would disappoint my parents, while GCC is the opposite. I know studying wont be an issue hopefully seeing that I am still a hardworking senior with a high GPA, but I am a little concerned with the overall workload at both institutions. CP is secular school I most definitely will be a part of some Christian ministry (despite what my parents believe I will do), even if it is going to church on Sunday, however, I want to have the choice to go to church, not be forced to attend mandatory chapels at GCC and go to a school where a good amount of people are snotty Christians who think they are “holier than thou.” (This it what I have gathered from some, but not all, student reviews) 

I am constantly told that I don’t understand yet because I’m not an adult with experience, but I keep feeling like I’m still trying to be sheltered. I feel that both schools can offer me a rewarding future, but I feel that the experience will greatly differ. Should I stick with what I want or what my parents want?


TL;DR: Parents want me to go to a Christian school that keeps me in their bubble of protection, I want to have my own opinion and go to a school that I choose."

The problem is that my parents and I don't see eye to eye on which college I want to go to. I have been accepted into Virgina Tech, University of Maryland College Park, and Grove City College. The first two are large public institutions and the last one is a small Christian college. We can't afford VT since it's out of state so I'm left with College Park and Grove City.

Now, my parents break down their opinion on which college I should choose based on mainly the education quality and the morals of the campus.

College Park: They feel that, even though the school has a high ranking engineering program, they feel that the school won’t help me out at all and will only treat me like a number.

23kp97,5,2014-04-21,Dad went off on me today about my lack of belief in God and my progress with college and work at Easter Dinner.,[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/23kp97/dad_went_off_on_me_today_about_my_lack_of_belief/,"So I guess this is more to get some perspective from different people, and partly to vent, but during Easter dinner today out of nowhere my dad started harping on me about stuff. 

I was sitting there looking at my phone after everyone was done eating, and he asked what I did to celebrate Easter. I said nothing much, since I was asleep all day since I don't get off until 6am from work, and then slept till the afternoon and went to the parents. He then started saying how he doesn't understand why I think I don't need god and stuff and some other things I just pretty much tried to ignore and not respond to. He's pretty hardcore catholic, and I was raised catholic, but he's never really said anything like this before and it kind of took me surprise. I figure maybe he's just worried about my ""soul"" or something but I dunno. I don't even think he knows i'm more or less atheist, since we never talk about the subject. 

After that he then started harping on me about my college issues, which is not being able to find a place to internship, which would then allow me to finish my BA in criminal justice, which seems to be a pretty useless degree in and of itself. I used to want to be a cop, but I'm not so sure if I want to do that anymore, and my weight and pot use is def going to be an issue with doing that. 

He also stated I was going to be 30 soon (i'm only 26 atm) and that I can't keep working my crappy security guard job forever. I mean he's not exactly wrong about the college and work stuff but all of it all at once and on Easter no less just kind of threw me for a loop and upset me a lot. We don't have a great relationship as it is and never talk about anything ever, so i'm having trouble digesting all this. 

Thanks for letting me rant and any thoughts or tips on any of this is appreciated! Hope you all had a great Easter or whatever it is you did on 4/20. "
23kphy,2,2014-04-21,"A story of excitement, adventure, space, great sorrow, and heroism....",Cat_Mulder,KerbalSpaceProgram,https://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/23kphy/a_story_of_excitement_adventure_space_great/,"  It is an exciting time to be a member of KASE (Kerbal Aeronautics and Space Endeavors).

  Jebediah Kerman has just done a high-altitude flyby and orbit of the Mün, and the scientific discoveries that have resulted have given rise to gossip about a landing-preformed by none other than Jebediah himself, of course.

  The rumors are true! KASE scientists have created a new rocket, not special in and of itself, but because of its launcher- the asparagus setup is able to lift more weight more easily, and a small intermediary stage for orbital maneuvers to propel the lander to one of the moons of Kerbin. The short range capability ears it the moniker ""Puddlejumper"".

  It is finally launch day, and all the KASE staff are watching eagerly as Jebediah preforms his final checks before liftoff. No one sees anything amiss with the ship, all is perfect.  With a massive sound, 9 engines fire and Jebediah lifts off!

 After an admittedly boring descent involving waiting, decoupling, turning, and a bit of snoozing on Jeb's part, the ship orbits, its intermediary stage just below maximum fuel.

  Jebediah glances at the display, his brilliant piloting mind instantly seeing what must be done to move his orbit from Kerbin to the Mün. In less than a full orbit of Kerbin, he fires the engines again. An encounter. Burn. Orbit!

 Jebediah glances over the crude and un-detailed map of the Mün he  has been provided. Nowhere specific pops into his mind. Jebediah absentmindedly maneuvers the ship around and fires retrograde, paying attention only to the beautiful spectacle outside his window, the spectacle that is space.

 Now for the tricky bit. Firing softy, waiting. Firing softly, waiting.

 Back at the KSC, mission control receives a radio transmission from the great kerbonaut.

  ""Guys? Uh, guys, you do realize there is no landing gear on this thing, right?""

  Panic ensues. A massive problem, yet no one on Kerbin can do anything, so they mostly bump about while some engineers surreptitiously add landing gear to the design and low ranking kerbonauts fetch popkorn for the old guard in the astronaut complex.

 ""Jebediah, can you try to set down without landing gear? The engine is pretty flat and the ship is fairly balanced. You should be able to do *something*...""

  ""I'll do what I can, but I don't know about how flat that ground is...""

  No luck. When the lander finally reaches the ground, it is on a slope, and tips right over!

  ""Jebediah, try and preform your scientific duties as you would, then when you're done, get back in and use the RCS to get yourself upright and lift off; the gravity is low enough that you should be able to do it.""

...

  ""Alright KSC, the science is done, but we got another problem; no RCS.""

  Everyone stares at the engineers, huddled in a corner playing kribbage. The bravest of them speaks up.

  ""Well, uh,    y'see,          we never really use it, y'see,      and, uh,    notice how, err,    nobody's really wanted it 'till now...""

  ""A rescue mission then,"" an intern suggests, ""We can fly out there and pick him up.""

  A scientist shakes his head sadly. ""We don't have the capability; all of our ships have to have pilots, and all of our capsules only have a capacity of one...""

  The room is filled with baleful silence as all ponder what comes next....

23ld4w,77,2014-04-21,"NEWS FLASH: Other people don't drink nearly as much as I do, nor do they care about what I'm drinking!",psycook,stopdrinking,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/23ld4w/news_flash_other_people_dont_drink_nearly_as_much/,"I had a lot of reminders over the past two days about just how unhealthy my relationship with alcohol is and how different that relationship is for me compared with other people! This past weekend I had three guests visit from out of town. These are friends that I met about two years ago while living out of state for a year-long internship program. During that year, my drinking (which was already pretty bad before I moved out of state) totally and completely spiraled out of control. By the end of that year I hit what should have been my ""bottom"", but unfortunately I kept right on going for another 8 months after that internship year ended :-/

So these particular friends have ONLY known me when I was at my absolute worst when it came to alcohol. We had a lot of hard core drinking nights together during that year so I was definitely nervous about their visit and expected them to drink a lot and for them to insist that I drink with them. Part of me was also afraid that they might look at me differently, or not like me any more if I wasn't that same hard-core drinking girl that they came to know during internship. I shared about it at meetings, spoke to my sponsor about it, and came up with a game plan with my husband so that I'd be prepared to handle all of their drinking while keeping myself sober. I didn't want to make a big melodramatic announcement to them about my sobriety, so I didn't mention it to them at all in advance. Just planned to be the driver all weekend so I could use that as a reason not to drink. I was ready.

Well...turns out that apparently I'm the only one who was prepared for a weekend of wild drinking! There were many situations over the past two days that would have served as obvious reasons/excuses to drink for me if I was still drinking, but apparently this was not the case for other people:

- Friday night we went to a tapas restaurant. Who in their right mind eats tapas without a big glass of red wine (or two...or three...) to wash them down?? Well, apparently everybody else does. None of my friends drank with dinner.

- After dinner, what should we do? Hit up one of the 8 bars within walking distance? NOPE. Friends were in the mood for ice cream so we went for gelato and headed back to my place without anybody having a single drink.

- We get home, and (although I definitely wouldn't recommend this to others), my husband and I had a few options available for those who wanted to relax for the evening with a couple drinks. Nobody accepted our beverage offers as they all wanted to ""take it easy"" (on a FRIDAY?? Are these people insane?)

- Went site seeing all day Saturday and had some down time in the mid-afternoon between scheduled activities. Anybody want to go hit a bar? NOPE. FroYo all the way.

- After dinner, waiting to meet up with another friend. Want to check out that cocktail bar down the street while we wait? NOPE, time for an after-dinner coffee.

- Get home again...no more driving around to do so my ""excuse"" to decline drinks is out the window. Friends decide to have a drink or two and offer me one. I decline casually. Do they twist my arm...call me lame...insist that I do shots with them? NOPE. One friend says, ""oh, you just don't feel like it tonight?"", and I say ""yup"" and that's the end of it.

If I had been drinking, I probably would have gotten drunk at least twice, if not three times over the past two days while nobody else would have, and I would not have noticed that I was pretty much drinking alone even though I was surrounded by friends. I would have only vague, foggy memories of their visit. I might have even said or done something obnoxious or offensive. Luckily, I have solid memories of a fabulous weekend with friends who love me, regardless of if I drink or not. 

It might seem obvious to others, but it was a real epiphany for me that I'm the only one among this group of friends who thinks/cares about alcohol as much as I do. What a relief to know that I can stay sober and other people, people who care about me and who have a healthy relationship with alcohol themselves, will hardly know the difference."

I'm not sure if this is the right place for this question, but here it goes.

I'm going to be starting an internship soon at a startup. My first task, as I chatted with my supervisor would be to propose a system design/architecture for the upcoming products. 

The company builds mobile apps (ios and android) and require me to propose a backend system that the clients can use to login and update the contents of their app. For example, one client may have a gallery in the app they would like to update weekly, or their product stocks.

The problem is there would be a lot of clients and for each of them the kind of content they would update will be different. Is this where a CMS comes into play? How can I integrate all these customised backends into one system? Is it possible at all? 

My initial thought was to have custom solutions for them all, like individual vps-es for each app, but thats not viable in terms of maintenance. 

Please guide me in right direction on system integration. Thanks a lot."

23lxpz,126,2014-04-21,Derpy the Dell,rawrbunnyhop,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/23lxpz/derpy_the_dell/,"I work as an IT Intern at a small company. Most interns have someone above them that they can learn from, but not me. My company hired an intern because they wanted a systems engineer, network engineer, and general pc support person, but they didn't want to pay for it.

This is the tale of my dear old laptop. I named him Derpy. Derpy was a high school graduation present from my parents, 4 years ago. When I started at this company, I didn't bring Derpy with me the first few days, as I assumed that they would provide a work computer for me, as all my jobs in the past had done. This was not the case. I brought my dear Derpy into work, but I was not very pleased about it.

Derpy was a broken laptop. One day my father got mad at me for leaving my backpack in my bedroom, so he kicked it across the floor, which broke the hinge on one side of the screen. I had burnt out the memory by falling asleep with it in bed, so it overheated. I had gone through 2 fans, destroyed 2 hard drives, and ultimately upgraded it from 3 GB of RAM to 8 GB and installed a SSD in it. After these upgrades, it was fast! But still had a broken hinge. I loved that messed up computer.

Then December happened. I had left Derpy at work over the weekend, as moving him made me extremely nervous, due to the broken hinge. Someone broke into our building and stole 5 company laptops and Derpy off my desk. I was devastated. My dear old friend was stolen right off my desk. I felt violated and sick. I contacted Dell support and got a copy of my original receipt. Then logged into Newegg and pulled copies of my invoices for the replacement RAM and SSD I had installed. Then I turned it into my boss to file the insurance claim and waited.  
Then I waited some more...  
Then I kept waiting... 

In the meantime, I had to have a laptop to work on. The company wasn't going to buy one for me, so I borrowed a netbook to get through until I got the insurance money. It was several years old and could barely run windows, so I installed Ubuntu on it. It had a very tiny screen, which made most of my tasks tedious at best.

In March, my boss told me we were getting the check for the stolen property, and the insurance company had decided that Derpy was worth $380. My initial reaction was ""I guess I can buy new tires now."" I told my boss that wasn't enough money to get any kind of decent computer, and that the company should provide a laptop for IT to use. Her reaction was ""We've never had to invest in a computer for IT to use before, and we aren't going to start now. Deal with it."" I didn't know what to do. I was using an old, outdated machine with no hopes of getting anything decent.

Then something awesome happened. My boss went to the CEO to get my insurance check for me, and he asked if that was enough for me to replace my computer. The answer was obviously no. So he decided to give me $900 instead to replace the computer. I put that towards a MacBook Pro Retina 13"" that I purchased that Thursday and I couldn't be happier. I'm planning on leaving the company as soon as I possibly can, so I made sure the computer is 100% my property.

TL;DR IT doesn't get provided computers. Decent CEO saves the day.

Edit: I also named my new mac ""Pineapple"" It's fitting."

6 months ago I have moved to London. Originally I am from Poland where I have graduated from a Technical school as an IT – I have received an international certificate that proves skills(that’s worth jack squat tbh). Poland is also where I worked for 3 months as junior web-builder/webmaster for a SEO company. I know quite a lot of coding languages and I have quite a lot of experience, but unfortunately, not commercial, and more importantly, not UK commercial. 
My CV is really well done, in my opinion, at least, hence I get emails/phone calls from recruitment agencies on a weekly basis. Only after the conversation they realize that I have basically none commercial experience(they apparently don’t read CVs too thoroughly). That’s when I learn that, yet again, I am too junior for a certain position(which I am sure I would be a good match for). 
The question is how do I get even lower than a junior position? 
I can’t really freelance, as I have a full time job as a bartender to pay my rent. The same applies to internship.  

Tl;dr: Can’t even get a junior web developer/designer job. Can’t freelance since I am full-time pouring beers. What do?

I've also been applying for summer internships despite not having sat for any exams yet.  Nothing actuarial has fallen through, but a company hiring an HR intern has shown interest.  Obviously, I'll be at greater risk of failing P on my first attempt if I'm also interning.  I have a 3.9 GPA, all the standard entry-level software skills, some scholarships, some economics-related research experience, a bit of RA experience, and zero actuarial (or even ""office setting"") work experience.

So, should I intern at this company, or should I just designate all my time to passing exams on first attempts?  Below is the job description:

23m8co,3,2014-04-21,How can I stand out from other interns?,keep_on_keeping_on,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/23m8co/how_can_i_stand_out_from_other_interns/,"Hey, I'm writing this post because I have been accepted into a competitive internship that could potentially lead to a job after graduation. I would love some advice!


Anyway, here's the setup, 8 weeks of travel to teach week-long summer camp programs to high school students. There will be a supervisor along with around 7 interns at each camp. Each intern will get around 5 kids at each camp to lead directly and watch to make sure everyone's safe. Students will be staying in what are essentially dorms as well as the interns. But there will essentially be 24/7 interaction while at the camps.

Here are the potential problems:

1. Everyone in the program is going to be competing for a job with this company and while I want to maintain friendly and working relations with everyone, I also need to standout from pack. I also want to avoid being sucked into potential drama of the other interns.

2. I'm not entirely sure how to interact with who will be my boss. The boss is the person I want to impress but I want to make sure that my interactions with him come off as genuine as opposed to simply wanting a job. How do I work on building a relationship while performing my responsibilities to the best of my ability?

3. Are there any other points I should go into further detail on?

I'm open to other suggestions and ideas but the two points I listed are what I'm most curious about. Thanks in advanced for the feedback"

Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using. 

* The biggest strain will probably come from Battlefield 4 on Ultra, as well as PlanetSide 2 on Ultra settings. I'm not entirely sure if I'll be doing a 3 monitor set-up as of now, but I definitely want to max out settings on Ultra using one monitor. Other uses include heavy MATLAB usage, streaming while playing, video rendering, CAD work, various other engineering work, etc.

* What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes? 

* $1700 USD. This is solely on the PC itself and not the peripherals.

* When do you plan on building/buying the PC? 

* Late May 2014. Will have a hefty sum of cash after my internship starts.

* What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc) 

* Definitely the case. 

* Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location? 

* I live in CT, USA. I'll most likely be ordering online from Newegg, etc.

* If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated. 

* Asus gaming laptop, that's about it. And my Logitech G930s. 

* Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU? 

* Yes, I'm interested in overclocking from the get go. May not be extreme overclocking, just small tweaks to squeeze more performance out without straining my things too much

* Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc) 

* Definitely will be placing a Samsung EVO for my primary SSD. Not too sure if I should go AMD or nVIDIA, as mining could be nice when I'm not gaming.

* Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components? 

* I would prefer something like a Mid-Tower or smaller, as I'll be transporting it to college for a round trip. I'd also prefer a black case with blue LEDs for fans, and of course a window. I would like to keep the case quite cool, and noise is not a problem to me as I usually wear a headset while gaming.

* Do you need a copy of Windows 7 or 8.1 included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference for one or the other?  

* No, my school provides me with Windows 8.1.

23mbg6,3,2014-04-21,Interview with with a senior PM at a major mutual fund firm: HELP!,[deleted],FinancialCareers,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinancialCareers/comments/23mbg6/interview_with_with_a_senior_pm_at_a_major_mutual/,"I've managed to wrangle an interview with the lead PM at a large mutual fund firm and he will be evaluating my skills and considering me for an analyst role. I'd love to get some advice on how to prepare for this as I have never before worked in investment management.

My Background:

Through internships and early grad roles I've had exposure on institutional sales and trading desks as well as working in operational roles at another major AM firm. Since that time I have earned my MSc in management from a very well respected university, have level 1 of CFA under my belt (and am studying for level II this June), and I am currently working in wealth management.

While I am very confident in my Excel skills, am comfortable with Bloomberg and Reuters, and am getting pretty comfortable with financial statement analysis and equity valuations, I have no practical experience in research or valuations.

My question: What skills are most important to a value focused equity manager and how can I prepare? 

Is my understanding of the investment process, as follows, correct? I assume that these teams create rules to screen stocks, and then apply more and more screening metrics until only a small number of ideas remain. A thorough analysis of these ideas will involve looking at their statements and earnings over the past 2-3 years, reading sell-side coverage, looking at management, and applying a number of valuation models to see if it is priced well (probably making pro forma statements based on revenue estimates... maybe some simple DDM too), and then either buying, monitoring, or discarding. 

Any insight is very much appreciated -this is an incredible opportunity for me.

23mf1o,4,2014-04-21,I [20 M] was cheated on by my [22 F] girlfriend and I don't know how to tell people without slandering.,seekingadvices,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/23mf1o/i_20_m_was_cheated_on_by_my_22_f_girlfriend_and_i/,"Hello /r/relationships I'm afraid I have a bit of a long one for you today. Writing this out proved to be therapeutic and I got a bit carried away!

I recently (beginning of the month) broke up with my girlfriend of one year because she had recently confessed to cheating on me.  I will use different names of course.  Let's call her Lisa, and guy she cheated with Craig.  Here is what happened:

The two of us began dating in April last year.  She graduated a few months later, and I would still be returning to school.  Over the summer we were going to have to be apart because of different internships, jobs, etc and likely afterwards as well.  Fine.  We decided to do long distance because she would be in a large city near where the college is.

Fast forward to early August and I'm back in town where the college is.  We have a fantastic month together.  As people start returning to school in September she decides she wants to go out with two friends: Craig and another girl (they were not dating).  I was not thrilled because Craig would always be very flirtatious with Lisa.  I told her this.  I could not go with them because I am under 21 and they are all of legal age.  I suggested hanging out at someone's house so that I could join.  They really wanted to go to bars.  Before Lisa left she told me she wanted to be back at around 1am because that way she could get some sleep before getting up at 8 for work.  I said that sounded fine and to please send me the occasional text and not to hesitate to call if they needed anything.

For the first several hours she sent the occasional text about a bouncer that didn't believe the other girl's ID was legit, etc.  Around 12 I told her I was going to sleep, but to please call if she needed anything.  i was woken up around 2am by her drunkenly stumbling up the stairs.  She stumbled into my room, said she was super sorry for waking me up.  I asked if she was going to come join me in bed.  Lisa said that no, she was just back to grab a lighter because they were going to go smoke weed.  I know that weed has never sat well with her (makes her feel sick, etc).  I then reminded her that she wanted to be back around 1 because she had work the next morning.  She then screamed out ""Fuck work, fuck EVERYTHING"" before walking out and leaving me very confused.  I had never seen her act this way before.  She ended up returning at around 4 am.  When she slipped into bed with me she kept repeating ""you know I love you right?""  This really confused me and was a red flag.

The next day we talked and I told her that her actions the previous night had confused me and scared me.  She said she was sorry, and that it would not happen again.  I asked her if anything had happened that night she wanted to tell me about.  She said no.  I asked if anything had ever happened between her and Craig (they had known each other longer than I knew her).  She said no.  After that night things seemed off.  The relationship had lost its magical spark.  I did still love her, and enjoy time with her though.  We continued to hang out with friends, and occasionally went to house parties I could join her at instead of bars.  Whenever Craig was around though it bothered me how she always wanted to do whatever he wanted to do.  She would ignore me and fawn over him.  I told her this, and she claimed that I was being jealous and reading too much into things.  I thought that she was right and that I needed to take a step back.  

After all of the events described above it was time for her to move to the city near the town where my college is.  We continued dating and visited every couple of weeks or so.  At the end of my winter break I spent two weeks with her in her apartment. On night she was going to have a friend over to dinner who she had met recently on the bus.  He was in graduate school and sounded like a cool guy.  I was excited to meet him, and to help Lisa make new friends (she had been lonely since moving to the city).  However, something seemed off and I questioned Lisa about whether this guy knew he was not coming over on a date.  She said to look at her phone and to read their texts myself.  I did.  In her texts she referred to me, her boyfriend, as ""a friend"" several times.  Additionally, her wording implied that her housemate (a girl) and I were a couple.  I told her this.  She said she was sorry, and that I was totally right and that she ""just had not thought things through well"".  The dinner, went well, but the guy did seemed surprised when Lisa introduced me as her boyfriend as opposed to ""her friend"".

Fast forward to a month ago and she told me about EVERYTHING that had actually happened.  Apparently that night she and Craig kissed.  She said she did it because she was feeling competitive with the other girl and wanted to ""beat her at getting Craig"".  She also said that she kissed Craig because she didn't feel that she was good enough for me and that in the moment she felt good enough for him.  So, apparently after kissing him she then lied to my face and continued to flirt with him while denying her flirtatious actions.  I talked to one of our mutual friends about this because I didn't know what to do.  I was glad she had told me, but I felt betrayed.  The mutual friend told me that Lisa had told her over the summer that she (Lisa) was dating me, but keeping her options open with Craig while I was away.  Additionally, Lisa had always had a crush on Craig and considered him ""quite a catch"".  Once I learned that the kissing was not just a drunken mistake I broke up with her.  She had lied to me about Craig, pretended I was not her boyfriend with another guy, and I was done.

The complication arises because Craig still interacts with me and a lot of my friends on a regular basis.  A lot of us compete in the same sport, and therefore practice together, and hang out a lot.  Obviously, it can be difficult to be near him.



So, here is where my questions are.  Whenever anyone asks me why we broke up I'm not sure what to say.  The easy answer would be to say that ""Lisa was not ready for a relationship"".  However, I do not feel like I should be protecting or enabling Lisa and Craig's behavior.  Currently, I have been avoiding situations with my teammates and friends when I know Craig will be there.  It seems ridiculous that I am the one having to pay the price of exclusion when I have not done anything wrong.  Part of me wants to tell everyone, but I don't want to slander anyone.

**tl;dr**: Don't know whether its appropriate to tell others that I have been cheated on."
23mnkh,4,2014-04-21,"Tough situation in college, looking for advice",mermaidman42,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/23mnkh/tough_situation_in_college_looking_for_advice/,"Hi everyone. Sorry if you've seen this type of post a lot. I did do a few searches and looked through the results but I was hoping to get advice for my personal situation.

I go to a top school and have had a tough time academically - both with classes and figuring out what I want to do. I'm finishing up my junior year and will finish my CS lower divs by this summer, but am on the verge of failing my current CS course (already emailed the professor asking to meet). I really enjoy CS and know that I want to get into the industry (preferrably something graphics/CGI related).

The issue is that there has recently been a huge influx of intended CS majors so the school has put a GPA cap which is pretty difficult to meet. I knew I wouldn't be able to meet it (my GPA is garbage) so I decided to declare a film major (I really enjoy movie making) and go for a minor in CS. Now they've decided to put the GPA cap on the minor as well. I'm interested in CS but the classes are very theoretical so I lose interest in them quickly. 

Right now, my two options seem to be: stick with a film major and just take CS courses as if I was a minor although I wouldn't be a minor I would just be taking those courses. The second option is to double in math with a CS concentration but this would mean staying an extra year rather than extra semester and would have a more cramped schedule than I currently do. However, I do plan on working during my 5th year if that is an option (even part time CS stuff if possible).

What would you guys recommend?

Edit: Thanks for the advice everyone. To answer a few questions: No, there are no MIS/CIS or any related majors available. To my knowledge you either do CS major or minor, or do a physical science (math, stats, ieor, etc.) with a concentration in CS. I have taken some online programming classes (coursera, codeacademy, etc.) and I absolutely loved them. I love the coding aspect to my CS courses and don't really mind the theory but I don't like the way that it is presented - theory theory theory, huge project where we finally code. But from what I've heard, upper division courses are less theoretical. After this semester I'll be one course away from finishing my lower div CS courses (2 if I fail one CS course this semester). I'm in the process of finding out the new restrictions for the CS minor but I believe right now it is a GPA cap that I won't meet (although nor will plenty of other students unfortunately). The biggest reason behind me doubling is that I want to graduate with a technical degree. After looking at internship and job qualifications online, most companies ask for a BS in CS or similar degree so Math seems to fit that qualification. 

I've had trouble in my CS courses initially due to not realizing how demanding they were and this semester dealing with a number of issues like overloading my course schedule since I was so behind, again not realizing how difficult the CS classes were this semester (at least 2x as hard as last semester's) and having bad project partners.

23mon1,4,2014-04-21,"A Chemical Engineer, 27, that can't even get a half-decent entry-level job to earn a living, even in Texas. Losing faith in the ""system"". HELP :(",The_Broken_Engineer,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/23mon1/a_chemical_engineer_27_that_cant_even_get_a/,"A little back story. I am a US Citizen but I literally come from nothing and was brought up in a third-world country for most of my life until I somehow managed to get into a reputable (top 40) private engineering university (at the age of 20) up in the North-East and graduated (albeit a year late) back in 2012. The culture shock was astounding, to say the least. But I managed to master English and the American accent to the point where you could never tell that I never grew up in the USA.

Adjusting to America all on my own, with next to nothing (came here with less than $500 for text books/food/etc, with no support from my parents since they were too poor), took a serious toll on my academics and I ended up with a GPA of 2.76 when all was said and done and graduated a year late. However, while in college, I did manage to get into a competitive Co-Op program (with a GPA of 2.87 at the time where the ""lower limit"" was a 3.0 for the program AND in the middle of the Great Recession no less!) and had two rotations at a consulting firm that totaled to almost a year of work experience. 

After making it out alive from college, I got thrown into the world with less than $150 to my name and no 6-month grace period for my student loans as I had lost all my financial aid for the last semester (since I fell under part-time). After 3 months of hearing nothing back from all the jobs that I applied to, I was getting desperate. Desperate to the point where I took the first thing that came my way, which happened to be an ""under-the-table"" paid internship at an iffy  manufacturing company in the middle of nowhere in up-state New York in the hopes of breaking into the whole Marcellus Shale gas ""boom"" since said company catered to the Oil &amp; Gas industry. 

Turns out, it was all rumors by the time I got there since all the Oil and Gas companies had capped their wells 2 years prior to me getting there and moved out to Ohio before the EPA could really get their hands on them. 

**So there I am, a broke and somewhat duped 25 year old ChemE with a quarter-of-a-million dollar education in the middle-of-no-where, the only colored guy in the county(s) (their words, not mine)** and I try to make the best of the situation and toil away at that ""internship"" for the next 6 months and cut scrap metal at a scrap yard on the side and keep on applying around for work in the meantime. I got an errant interview or two at some more legitimate companies but it never panned out. 

Depression starts setting in and the people that I'm working with start to sense that I'm about to break so they end up bribing me by hiring me full-time with a bit more money of $32k/yr (still half of what a ChemE makes). I get excited but that wears off after a few weeks when I realize that I end up where I started with my finances after taxes, health insurance, etc. And so, I keep on chugging along, getting probably 1 or 2 interviews for that year until I get laid off a few days before New Years 2014. 

I take all my belongings and ""get the hell out of Dodge"", as the saying goes, and wander around the country for the next few months until I make it into Texas under the pretense that ""hey, I'm a ChemE that's NOT in Houston"" and I have nothing else to lose.

Now I've been in Texas for over a month and a half and still having no luck. All the positions seem to be either looking for anything but a Chemical Engineer or I don't have enough experience. My GPA may be a factor too, since I vividly recall how every single time I went to a career fair and approached the big companies like Exxon and DuPont, I'd get shunned away, quite rudely, when the found I was below a 3.0 (heck later on DuPont brought the cut-off upto 3.3?!?)

At this point, I'm out of almost all my money, hope and dignity and I just don't even know why I even bother getting up anymore in the morning. I get hounded at by everyone I've ever known or loved for ""why I don't have a job yet?"" or I should ""get my act together"".
 
I know that the world owes me nothing and I am more than grateful for all the opportunities that have even bothered to present themselves to me and I am also grateful for the fact that I've managed to make it even this far in life. But I can't help but feel betrayed at the same time by the system. All the people I know that I went to college with are doing great in life and I'm only getting older, broke-er (i know, its not a word), and slipping away physically and mentally. 

If ANYONE can give me any guidance as to what the hell I should do or where even to start, I would greatly appreciate it.


**TL;DR:** A US citizen who grew up with nothing in a 3rd world country, managed to get into a ""top 40"" US engineering college, somehow got a Bachelors of Science in Chemical Engineering but can't for the life of him find a half decent job and has been spiraling down into oblivion, hitting every damn branch on the way down the tree and now resides in Texas and needs help and advice.

We're hoping to find a great place on or around May 1st in a central area of the City. We want to add a third roommate to our lives to extend our search parameters and to widen our network of amazing-ass people we know in SF! 

In terms of budget, mine is around $1100/month, and Emily's is between $1500-$2000. We're looking to combine powers with a roommate who can afford between $1500-$2000 to find a really nice place we can wholeheartedly enjoy. Our preferred neighborhoods are the Mission, Castro, Nopa, Haight, and Cole Valley but overall, we're pretty flexible as long as the place is nice and feels like home!

Here's what else we're thinking:

We are envisioning a comfortable, fun, and relaxing space to call home. Emily and I have talked about how we would like to share some pantry staples (like baking ingredients) and definitely a CSA. We're both relatively clean people who like to have tidy common spaces but won’t have a cow if dishes don’t get done right away. I'm a vegetarian and Emily cooks meat occasionally, so wherever you fall on the eating spectrum is just fine although Emily did live with a fruitatarian once and found it more challenging than expected so she's on the fence about that..  But I digress.

I'm 28 and am nearly finished with a graduate degree in Counseling Therapy. I'm just about to wrap up my first clinical internship and dive into the wonderful world of job-searching (my student loans and driving for Lyft keep me financially stable). YAY. I'm training to run 100 miles in a week with my brother for fun, I want to bake a fancy cake from scratch once a month from now until next year, I love the smells of Golden Gate Park, I do a lot of yoga, I have a fire escape garden, etc. etc. etc. I'm pretty great to live with because I love to laugh and giggle with my roommates just as much as I love to wash dishes and take out the trash. I PROMISE.

Emily is a 28 y/o queer woman relocating to SF after spending 3 years in Wisconsin. She’ll be working for a tech company in the Mission, which she's super excited about! She loves cooking, being active, being inactive (ie Netflix binging) farmers’ markets, silly themed dinner parties, and experimenting with nail polish colors.  Emily and I have been friends since high school and we've never lived together (officially – we’ve crashed on each other’s couches many many times) but we are similar minded about the kind of housing situation we want to create. 

Let me know if this sounds appealing to you and we'll go from there!"

Comrade soldiers! The question of the state system is now on the order of the day. The capitalists, in whose hands the state power now rests, desire a parliamentary bourgeois republic, that is, a state system where there is no czar, but where power remains in the hands of the capitalists who govern the country by means of the old institutions, namely: the police, the bureaucracy, and the standing army.

We desire a different republic! One Union more in keeping with the interests of the people, more democratic. The revolutionary workers and soldiers of Moscow have overthrown czarism, and have cleaned out all the police from the capital. 

The workers of the world feel that the cause of the Second Russian Revolution is their own cause no matter how great the obstacles in our way, no matter how many tens of millions in money are lavished in all countries to disseminate lies and slander about this Russian revolution. Parallel with the war between the two groups of imperialists, another war is beginning everywhere, the war which the working class, inspired by the example of the Russian revolution, is declaring against its own bourgeoisie. All the signs go to show that India and Italy are on the verge of a great socialist revolution. 

But I am not here today to reminisce on the politics and glory of the Union I once knew and loved, a little over 100 years ago. The world today has changed. Our technological advances match no other country's most superior equipment. But it is our day, the Soviet Union's day, to take back its former glory, fix what has been broken, and amend the policies of the past. This is not a step backwards for Mother Russia, this is a step forward into a direction that promotes peace, unity and prosperity for all Russians and Boshleviks. I, Vladimir Lenin once again am given the opportunity to take back Russia from the capitalists and crooks who morally corrupted our nation and begin a new revolution. One that will not fall and what that shall not wither.

As I stand here today, unbalmed and unchained from the mausoleum I slept in, in the year 2019, there are greater conflicts around the world that threaten our global prosperity and peace. In 2 months I will make my first address to the nation and republics, and will begin a new era of policy that drives the Soviet Union ahead once again. 

For the rest of the world watching, fear not, as I along with my intern cabinet still hold the territories and claims made under Czar Doky and hope to keep the alliances and friendship the questionable government before us had. 

Now it is apparent to everyone that either victorious imperialism or Soviet power can exist-there’s no middle way.

Just a bit of background: I built my first mini-itx about 2.5 years ago with a Lian Li PC-Q08 due to moving around university and internships, and loved it. Use it to watch videos, and play PC games (of course).

Now I'm considering my 2nd mini-itx since I love the portability factor, and in recent times more SFF-friendly parts have become available. I already bring my PC-Q08 as a carry-on when I travel on an airplane, but I been wanting to try a SG-05 case for maximum portability (and reduced weight). My old machine is going to be donated to my parents in the meantime.

Here's what I picked out so far:

I have about a $1000 budget, and I'm bringing over my SSD from my previous build to this one. I have the option to bring my CPU cooler also, but I never did get around to overclocking my first m-itx, and still debating if I want to, since I know I can save about $75, but I'm not too stingy on it. Ditching an optical drive also this time around, as I almost never use discs anymore.

The must-haves are the SG05 so I can bring it on the plane (in a carry-on bag), and the GTX 760 since it's SFF, giving more breathing room inside the case.
So folks, thoughts? Hoping to purchase everything by the end of mid-week."
23nc4a,23,2014-04-21,"Being in the closet is killing me, but I have no choice. Need some help.",[deleted],askgaybros,https://www.reddit.com/r/askgaybros/comments/23nc4a/being_in_the_closet_is_killing_me_but_i_have_no/,"I apologize in advance for the length of this post, but it's taken me a long time to work up the guys to do this. I'm a closeted 18 year old living outside the US, in what is usually described as the most homophobic  region/country in the world. Nobody knows except me. Being anything but straight here gets you jailed. It's been horrible because I knew I liked guys long before I could put a name to those feelings, let alone spell homosexual. I knew before they told me in church that it was an abomination to have those feelings and have been dancing  dangerously close to suicide (much more recently) because of it.

The one thing that keeps me going is my  starting college this fall. I just got accepted to one of the best colleges in the US, (sounds like ardvark). Holy Shit. Finally! So many years of hard work and self deprivation paying off! And a place where I can be out and be happy! But the more I think about it, the more I dread it. Why? Because I don't think I can be out there either. From my experience, even the most trustworthy tolerant people will let my secret slip to their friends eventually and kids from the same country/family/family social circles as me go there so I know the news would make it back to my family somehow. It happened to a friend of mine going to school abroad from home and it wrecked him. 

Also my dad is a big member of the national religious community here.  It would definitely make a  news story or two if word got out that he has a  gay son. And bad news here travels fast. It would also no doubt  discredit him and his work. His views about 'my kind' aren't great, but the humanitarian work he does is so critical that I'd hate myself if I ruined that somehow. 

Also, there's the issue of paying for this expensive private college I'm about to start. My parents are proud of me, but there's no way in hell they'd fund the education of someone they consider to be an abomination, and I can't afford to not have them help me out, unless I'm willing to take on 240k in student loans. 

The worst part is that my parents are depending on me for a lot of stuff too. I'm 18 now and a dual us citizen. They plan on buying a house in my name wherever I plan on going to grad school and they want to eventually emigrate to the States to retire. Right now, I'm the only person who can help them with that by doing some visa application shit.  I feel like I owe them too much to just run away from that responsibility if/when I do come out, and would feel horrible if I used that as leverage for their 'acceptance'.

So the current solution involves me being in the closet the next four years. even longer than that if I want their help with graduate school. 

Reading this now it sounds like I'm being so entitled. Am I being entitled? I've been working for this college for as long as I can remember. Internships, academics, denying myself a social life just so I could get into this school, only to realize that nothing's going to change.
Never more  have I felt like a useless slave to my ambition.

Is it worth to be more open and happy if I lose the opportunity of a lifetime in the process? Can I just abandon my family after they've invested so much into who I am today? I really just need someone to talk to because right now, nothing makes sense.

23nd4l,2,2014-04-21,I [f/24] planned on moving this spring but bf [m/25] stopped communicating.,fallingbetwwen,LongDistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/23nd4l/i_f24_planned_on_moving_this_spring_but_bf_m25/,"Its a long one... om my phone so im so sorry for the wall &gt;_&lt;



My boyfriend and I have been in a LDR for a bit over 4 years.
its had its up and down, but I have never questioned the relationship before.  


He have gone through a handful of restaurant jobs in his country under these years. As well as a shorter prestigious restaurant education in London.


Myself I spent the last three years getting an education within a profession that would be fairly easy to find a job for in his country and something ive grown to love doing. Gardening  
During these three years Ive always had the emigration as a goal after graduating.   
We have talked about it a lot under the years, so ive always seen us on the same page in this matter.


During these years ive taken most my holidays as well as two month during every summer to visit him. He has also taken a handful of trips to me when his work schedule has allowed it.  
Last summer we spent over 3 month living together in London while he went to school and i was able to take  my school internship at a fantastic company there.


When we are together it works well, we communicate and work well as a couple.  
I am quite cynical, introvert and a very straight forward in my approach to problems, while he is calm and likes to hold his feelings and thoughts close and rather avoid arguments.  
Ive had some problems with my libido being low to nonexistent due to medicine, birth control and emotional block, but this is something I have worked on and I now see myself as a working human again. This have caused problems during the years due to me finding it hard to sexually just open up and be into it for the week im visiting and then go back to being alone again..


While not together we have almost always talked daily, or at least sent some messages back and forth. We have always had, made, time for each other.


last year we got to a milestone towards the goal of living together, when he bought an apartment, i was very much involved in the decision and the place have some key features i know he doesnt care about more than that i wanted them.  
We have also hinted about engagement, and he was fully on board for the future, talking about not wanting a ring but a fancy clock instead. Tho he is old fashioned and wants to do the proposing, so ive left that trail of thought until he feel ready.


I finished my education at Christmas and felt so happy, all the talk would finally culminate into something graspable, and all my friends, classmates and family were ready for me to leave and giving me best wishes. After all, this has been on the wall for 3 years.


But i dont know what happened, he started a new job in January. Working 6 days a week. And all the sudden he had no free time anymore. No time to write with me or skype about the practicalities about how to handle the move or setting a date for my move. 


After a month i cracked and booked a trip to see him for a week. 
The apartment was amazing and i could easily see myself living there. But every time I brought up the move he created and built new obstacles. Such as i needed to get my driver licence first to the statement that it was maybe best to wait and see what happened when his one year contract with work expired.  
I do agree on the driver licence even tho i know it would be fully possible to get around without one and that i wouldnt be able to buy a car instantly anyway. ive grown up in the middle of a city and never had any need to get a licence nor anyone to practice with, but sure, if thats what it takes..


During one car ride, while we were in a traffic jam I did corner him and asked how he actually felt. After me talking and explaining what i felt i did get a ""You are an amazing girl and i want to settle down with someone like you""  
my reaction was to feel really hurt ""someone like me"" what does that even mean? I asked him and got the ""yes with you"" instead of someone this time.  
To this day im still not sure if he  just said it to please me or because he formulated it wrong the first time...


After that trip we did decide that i was to get my driver licence fixed and then ill move. But since i left our communication been utterly shit. 
he hardly no longer writes, and when i feel down or wanting to know how he feel or just want comfort im lucky to get a ""today i did -insert random work task- but i need to sleep, need to be up early""  
He blatantly ignores when i write about my feelings or the one time he did acknowledge it i got a ""that sucks"" and then onto what he was watching on tv..


I get that he has no time to be on skype, but phone messages, hell everyone got time for a phone message, when on the toilet, when leaving work walking to the car, at breakfast, before sleep and so on.


Im trying to confront him about how its making me feel, as well as asking if he is having cold feet or doubts. I keep getting nothing back. The one time i got a response he said he felt that he didnt want to burden someone with being with him since he does work so much and likes it that way and that he feels like he is doing me a disservice.
i dont know what to do. Told him he needs to talk about it, if not with me then with his best mate, to that i got an ""i will""  
that was almost two month ago..


Ive always been very clear on that i know that he works a lot and that its nothing that scares me. I dont see it as a problem to be honest. Im introvert enough to enjoy my alone time..  
Im not scared to moving to a country where i dont speak the language, i will learn. Nothing about the move really scares me. I rather give it a try and have it blow up in my face than not try it and regret it for the rest of my life..


He now doesnt take any time to write with me nor respond to anything other than answering to the question of when he got an off-day, where he still dodges my skypecalls by not being available..


the problem now is that i cant just sit around and wait, its gone over 4 month since i graduated.  
I need to know if i am to move or not. If im not moving then i need to find a job and the summer season is coming closer.. and if i wait any longer (already too late for any good ones) i will miss my shot at getting any kind of gardening work during the high season...  
And as soon as i decide to get a job here ill be stuck here for even longer..


I am really lost, i dont know how to get my point across. I dont know what he is thinking or how to make him feel any easier about it all. 
Im constantly feeling sad and scared that i might loose someone that has grown to be a part of me.  
Right now i feel in limbo, waiting on him to get his thoughts sorted.
Im already embarrassed because i already proclaimed to my friends and family that i will be moving. I dont want to be a failure and unloved.  


**TL:DR I am willing to leave behind friends and family for a country where i dont speak the language to move to the guy i love while he thinks he is doing me an disservice by being with him. Im having my life on hold while waiting on him to make up his mind**"
23ndu3,7,2014-04-21,Concerned about side project relevancy,[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/23ndu3/concerned_about_side_project_relevancy/,"Hey guys!

I am currently a student who is trying to prepare for next summer so that I can land an internship. My main question is: 

How relevant do your side projects need to be to the internship position you are applying for? For example, I really enjoy mobile development, and would love to have an internship in this field. However, when it comes to looking for other internship opportunities, I don't want to just limit myself to mobile internships. I want to cast my net as wide as possible to increase my chances of getting an internship.

If I was applying to internships at other companies for software development intern positions that are not related to mobile (for example maybe something related to back-end work, games, R&amp;D, or generic business application development), would it reflect negatively on me if 3/4 of my projects were iOS apps? Or does this even matter? 

I of course would not try to apply for internships that I am unqualified for (for example, web development which is a field I know relatively little about, or ones that use technologies I am clueless about).

I'm concerned that if I focus mainly on mobile development that I will not be a good fit for other types of software development internship roles. On the other hand I do not want to make my projects too broad because I'm afraid that this will make it seem like I am a jack of all trades who isn't really a good fit anywhere.

Also, does the company size play into this at all? For example, do start ups care more about this than larger companies like Google or Amazon?

I'm just trying to find the right balance. Is this something I should be concerned about or am I making this project relevancy issue a bigger deal than it really is?"

I'm going to be starting an internship soon at a startup. My first task, as I chatted with my supervisor would be to propose a system design/architecture for the upcoming products.

The company builds mobile apps (ios and android) and require me to propose a backend system that the clients can use to login and update the contents of their app. For example, one client may have a gallery in the app they would like to update weekly, or their product stocks.

The problem is there would be a lot of clients and for each of them the kind of content they would update will be different. Is this where a CMS comes into play? How can I integrate all these customised backends into one system? Is it possible at all?

My initial thought was to have custom solutions for them all, like individual vps-es for each app, but thats not viable in terms of maintenance.

Please guide me in right direction on system integration. Thanks a lot.

23nh9n,15,2014-04-21,My parents are hindering my chances of getting a college education?,DestinyCrusader,exmuslim,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/23nh9n/my_parents_are_hindering_my_chances_of_getting_a/,"Hi guys. So a lot has been going on in my life, and I've been lurking here for a while with different issues on my mind. Right now, though, this is the most urgent issue I can think of and I'd love some outside advice to help with the situation.

For those of you who don't know me or don't remember me, I'm a high school senior who will be going to college next year. My dad is ridiculously restrictive, and I've never been allowed to leave the house alone, go to the movies with friends, or really anywhere without my Mom, and even then he has made things difficult (a while back he made the biggest deal out of my Mom and sisters going to watch *Frozen*. Don't get me started.)

Ever since I started the college application process, my Dad stressed that I apply to the closest college to us. In fact, he told me that he ""didn't care even if it was a bad college"" because I ""absolutely would not be dorming."" Now, the closest college to my house is actually a community college. Luckily, the one farther than that is a better college, and has a nice writing program too. However, it is really easy to get into. So I got accepted into it, but it isn't providing nearly as much financial aid as I would like. My mom, who may be more open to me dorming in-state and coming home every weekend or something but is too tired to deal with my dad, says that she doesn't care how much loan she may have to help pay. The thing is though, my parents have a really bad credit score and I'm not even sure if I'll qualify for Direct PLUS loans. And even if I do, they are in no shape to help me pay when they're already scraping money alongside my brother to pay for HIS college. And then I have three younger siblings still in school, and their needs, and things like food and clothes.

I applied to a lot of colleges. For some, I even had to send writing portfolios and I actually received notable scholarships from a few. Even more so, for some my student loans add up to less than that of the nearest college, and they are higher, better ones too.

I am so tired. I am so tired of being yelled at because the school play I went to watch ended a little later than I expected, or spending extra hours with the school literary art magazine. I am tired of having to look after my siblings day after day alongside homework from regular and AP classes both. I am tired of never being able to go to Panera or Starbucks with my friends, of trying to scroll quickly through pictures of them smiling and laughing and just being kids. Day after day I feel more and more depressed and stressed out and scared for my future and I really just need to get away. I don't even want that much, one of my most-liked college is less than 2 hours away and I'd be able to come back fairly easily. But my Dad won't hear of it. In fact, after I got the acceptance from the college HE liked, he completely disregarded any other acceptance letters I got, no matter how amazing they were. If I try to bring up college with my dad, he will just shake his head and say he doesn't like the idea of me and ""boys"" living together (even though I assured him it would be a non-coed dorm) and then yells at my mom for giving me too much freedom. My mom tells me not to argue with him, to come to her for any issues, be she herself has assumed I'm going to the close college and didn't even let me decide. Today I started crying in front of her because everything has been too much and I told her I was under too much stress, and she couldn't understand why even though she is LIMITING any chances of me doing what I might want to do.

I really want to be able to dorm and have a complete and meaningful college education. I don't know where my future is headed, and there's a chance I'll get stuck in an arranged marriage that I may not be able to get out of. And I really don't think I can handle driving 40 minutes or more back and forth every day, along with taking care of my siblings AND college work AND working all in one (and I'll have to work to help pay for tuition, in that college anyway). Work is a whole new issue altogether, because even though they are incapable of helping me pay for college they have not let me work, at all. Almost all my friends have been working since junior year to save up for college and I haven't been allowed to, and now the only way I'll be able to is an internship or a part-time job. I'm sick of having a million things on my plate and I just want to be able to dorm in a nearby college. I even gave up dreams of going to Pratt Institute in New York (a very big art/writing school that gave me much financial aid and a 17000 scholarship) and Emerson in Boston, which I also got accepted into. And still they won't relent. I just don't know what to do. I need them for an enrollment deposit and possible financial help no matter where I go, at least for a little while until I get a job. Additionally, ever since I took my scarf off my Dad has threatened multiple times to ""send me to Pakistan"" because I ""don't really need or deserve a college education"" or doing the same to my siblings. I'm so worried about everything and I really want to be able to settle this somewhat peacefully with my parents.

Sorry for the very long rant. May 1st draws nearer and nearer and I need to make a college decision as well as turn in enrollment/housing deposits. There's also other small details, like wanting to save up so that my brother and I may be able to take our siblings from our parents' custody. My mother has become old and frustrated and she can be both verbally and rarely physically abusive, and even more so she will most likely put them in arranged marriages as well. My father has been very harsh on my siblings when it comes to reciting the Quran, and my 9-year-old sister has stress and anger-management issues because of all the work she gets from school (she's in some special classes) and at home with the qari and quran. And before I can help any of them I need to figure out my own life, and before I can do that I need to stop feeling like I'm being suffocated,

**TL;DR,**

My father is very unrelenting about allowing me to dorm and instead insists and I drive back and forth 40 minutes to a college that isn't giving me as much scholarship or financial aid money as other, better colleges slightly farther away. I'll also have to juggle a job and looking after brother and sisters as well as studies. My mom won't do anything about it. I worry for my siblings. My parents won't be able to pay loans and I'll have to burden all that myself. May 1st is the last day to decide on a college.

Help. Any comments, concerns, advice, motivational speeches are welcome.

23nisg,1,2014-04-22,My story...,A444444,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/23nisg/my_story/,"So it's been a bad year. I'm 26 and last year I moved out of my parents place for the first time. I'd had some issues prior to that, school didn't pan out how I'd planned and some layoffs led to me not being in a good place financially. Even before that however I had some huge issues. Since about 14 I've felt miserable. 

So this idea of death has been in the back of my mind for a long time. I've coped. Last year I learned my dad was a meth addict. I knew he was on something but I tried to avoid learning what. I was interning at a place with the plan of going full time there. At that point I'd be able to support myself. At the time I was also working part time at a call center. When I learned what was really going on with my dad, shit got a lot worse. I decided to quit my internship to go full time at the call center as it would be quicker. I was able to move out within a couple of months at that point.

People had told me it would help to be away... It hasn't helped.

I have a roommate who was one of my better friends in highschool. Now all he does is smoke weed. I don't necessarily think weed is horrible, but it is all he does. He had been living in another state and hated it, so I helped get him here and got him a job at the call center I work at. In a year I went from being an agent to being a lead to being a coordinator. Things were going well, but I never stopped being miserable. Meanwhile my roommate started spending all of his money on weed. He still manages to pay rent but I know he borrows money here and there all the time. It's a big source of concern for me.

So this stress starts adding up, but this story has good news too.

During this year, my dad had gone to rehab. Things seemed to be going better... but about 2 months ago, I found alcohol at my parent's place. My dad had started drinking again. I started looking and I found some suspicious things. I don't know that he's using meth again, but I believe it is simply a matter of time.

So I quit talking to my family....

This led to me not being around people for the most part. I don't have much for friends. The people I know bother me as everyone seems to be about getting high all of the time. It made me miss my family... so I decide to go to my parents place for Easter. It was a horrible experience. I realized I hate being around my family... I can't stand anyone. 

So, this time when the idea of killing myself comes up, it doesn't seem so bad... It's all I've been able to think of for the last 24 hours. I actually went to /r/suicide hoping to find advice on how to do it. There are definitely subs for illegal things, so I thought maybe... well I found SW and figured it couldn't hurt to post something."

I'm a recent uni graduate with a business degree in marketing and advertising. I've had 5 internships, 3 being marketing related and 2 being advertising, one of which with a well known agency in accounts (GPY&amp;R). 

Yet since finishing that agency internship in October last year, I just can't seem to get my foot in anywhere since. It's really starting to make me lose my motivation to keep looking for work and also question myself. (what am I doing wrong? what is wrong with me? what do others have that I don't?).

It's coming up to second semester, and I feel that going back to uni and adding something to my current degree could help, maybe open some new doors and get me a little more motivated. If I did, I believe Graphic Design is what I would want to do as I have always had the interest for it. 

I want to be in creative, I have the ideas but I feel it's the execution that lets me down (We never used editing programs such as InDesign or Photoshop during my degree, and usually in group work there was always 1 guy that was a pro and would take that part of the assessment upon himself to complete for the team)

How do you feel GD could help me? It's an interest of mine, would it really stand out on a CV as opposed to someone without it going for the same creative job? Do most creatives have some sort of Graphic Design background? 

I don't hand draw too well, yet as I am pretty computer savvy I believe I would be a fast learner with editing programs. "

23nooi,1,2014-04-22,Completely lost and unsure of what I want and what to do after I graduate college,iJamJL,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/23nooi/completely_lost_and_unsure_of_what_i_want_and/,"Hello there,


As stated in the title, I'm about to graduate college soon with a degree in Economics. The tl;dr for choosing econ is basically to have a degree. I changed majors so many times that I wasn't getting anywhere, and econ was the quickest way to graduation. To explain a bit more, I've tried the following majors: math teacher (twice - tried it, dropped the course, tried again two years later, quit again), math, accounting, attempted a pre-engineering route, and occupational therapy (actually worked as an aide for both physical therapists AND occupational therapists, and took anatomy and physiology i &amp; ii). In the end, none of them really seemed to interest me enough for me to stay put. Therefore, I bounced back onto economics because I took the intro courses when attempting to major in accounting, and somewhat enjoyed econ at that time.


Now that I'm majoring in econ, I'm bored half the time during my lectures. It's not the professors because they're great people and are decently engaging. I think it's my lack of care or interest in the subject.


Due to my constant change in majors, I haven't had any internships or work experience that can lead me to a career. The last job I had was working for those therapists, and it was for two years. I finally got a new job because I was so bored, and now I'm working as a bank teller because it pays better. I don't necessarily hate it, but I don't enjoy it either. Work is work, right? The thing is that I've only been working there for three months now, but I'm already wanting to change jobs.


So to recap:

-I'm majoring in a major that I have little care for

-I'm working in a job that I don't care for

-I have pretty much zero work experience directly related to any careers


Usually at this point, anyone I ask for advice would ask me what do I want to do with my life, what are my hobbies/interests/passions, or where do I see myself in the future (3 or 5 years is the usual length of time). What's my honest answer? I have no fucking clue. What do I want to do with my life? Obviously make a decent amount of money so I can live comfortably and have a family in the future. What are my hobbies? Well, I like music, am really crappy at guitar but do love playing it, table tennis, and just play League of Legends with friends in our spare time. A couple of friends have told me to pursue music because they see my ""passion"" for it, but that industry is way too risky for my taste. Those hobbies are mine should remain hobbies because I don't think I would ever go pro in any of them. Lastly, where do I see myself in a few years from now? I see myself miserable in an office job, working in a cubicle; kind of like what was portrayed in Office Space.


I've greatly considered joining the military because they have a structured system, and it would sort of give me time to figure out what I want to do in life; however, I have a few friends that are in the military, and they've told me that they suggest I don't join. They're completely suggesting though, and wouldn't stop me if I did join. It's just that they don't think it'll help me with my situation, and I'll just be miserable in a bad environment.


Another friend suggested that I do something like join the Peace Corps, or something along the lines of volunteer work. Maybe it's something to look into, but I feel as though I'm going to eventually chase money. Knowing that, I don't think I'll last in the Peace Corps long.


Therefore, I seek advice on what actions I should take to help myself. I don't even know where to start. I encourage any questions, especially if I was unclear due to my poor writing skills. All and any comments are appreciated."

I understand that this is possible if one uses the front page only specific subreddits are in the mix. But I am talking about a person who is signed into their account being able to specifically delete certain subreddits from their view, and maybe having a block list type of idea in case the use wanted to add it back into the mix.
Another topic I would like to bring to the lime light is down votes. I feel that a lot but not all people who do serial down voting do so for a purpose of disagreeing with ones point. Which I feel it is almost a way of disliking a person from what is said. Anyhow I feel is the wrong way to go about it. When a down vote is cast, a comment bar should pop up asking why this dislike this post. This could intern add great feed back to the original poster. I understand people are going to disagree with this is the annoying box that pops up. The reason I feel this should be a future idea, because if one doesn't like a post they shouldn't do anything about it besides ignore it. Down votes could hide a post that is really interesting to some people, and it can become undiscovered by downvotes.
Let me know what you think.
Thanks!"

I am a current freshman (intended L&amp;S CS major). I don't have any internship or research opportunities lined up, so I was thinking of taking either CS 70 or Math 54 this summer. So far, I've heard conflicting advice from my friends. Some are suggesting I take CS 70 so that I don't take it with Sahai in the fall and can avoid the notorious amount of work he gives. Others suggest I do the opposite and take it with Sahai. I personally see the merits to both arguments, but I figure any CS upper div is gonna be a lot of work anyway, so why avoid it now? I do want to take math 54 and get that out of the way (I really did not like 1A and 1B) but it looks like I'll be on the waitlist for the summer sessions. For fall, the only class I know for sure I'll be taking is CS61C, and I'll find something to satisfy my AC requirement. 

What have your experiences been taking either of these classes over the summer? Any advice?

Thank you very much! :D

No fights, we would do everything to make the other happy, and we tried to see each other as often as we could (we live in different cities, 5 hours apart). 


Some details about us: my GF has been unemployed for a year at this point, and has quit her education, planning to start again in september. I'm almost done with my education and I'm looking around for internships. 
The fact that she doesn't have much to do for work/school is a serious problem for her and I try to help her with that, pointing out possible job opportunities etc. 


Since the last couple two months my GF and I are having some serious problems. More arguments, some of which resulted in serious fights. After we cooled down, we'd make up and continued spending time with each other. 
Most of the time, it boils down to the fact that we might be seeing each other too much, she is getting frustrated about having no job/education and that I am under a lot of pressure to finish my education in time. 


It all came to an end last tuesday. First she was distant, while I tried to hug/kiss, and she avoided talking with me. After a while she just broke off with me, saying that it wouldn't work anymore. And then she sent me home. 


On wednesday I sent her a text she could collect her stuff on Friday, because I would be gone for Easter. I already collected her stuff then so she could leave early. We didn't have much communication during the following days. When she came by on Friday she said how much she loved me and that she really wanted the relationship to work again. After a long conversation we both agreed to continue, but that we both have to work on ourselves and for the relationship in general.


So far so good right? Well, one of her ideas was that she should blow of some steam during a party in two weeks. Not a problem for me, we both go out apart from each other, so it shouldn't be. But then shey tells me she want to use XTC during the party. Usage of which I'm not against, but while I am in a relationship I'd like to use it together (she already knows this). So I'm rather confused about wether I should agree with this or not. 


Also, she said that we shouldn't see each other for the next three weeks. She thinks it would help us get our priorities straight. I agree with this, but I think it is too long and combined with her previous idea, I'm just really confused.


Would it be selfish/wrong of me to disagree with this? I really want this relationship to work and her to be happy, but something tells me this isn't right.




---   
**tl;dr**: GF broke up, we came back together, now she wants to use XTC without me at a party and see me only after three weeks."

Firstly, a little bit about me: I'm a second year Australian University student. I have an internship under my belt, a solid GPA and I've been nominated for a couple of design awards (although I haven't won anything thus far). 

At the moment, I have a part time internship lined up that goes for three months starting from June. After I finish this one, I'd like to move up the ladder to global ad agencies and studios like Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, IDEO or Pentagram to attain some global experience within an international environment during the period from November 2014 to February 2015. 

I understand the demand for positions at the top end is extremely high so the question I'd like to pose is how I should go about applying. I'm confident in preening my portfolio, what I'm more concerned about is the networking and the logistics of everything. Where should I start looking for positions? How should I approach each studio? etc. 

Next up: Asia vs Europe vs The States; which would be the best place to begin? I'm thinking I'd like to start in a place like Singapore or Hong Kong but before I make any decisions, I'd like to know what the differences are in design culture between each region. 

Finally, would studios consider taking on students from overseas? Obviously, I would prefer for the internship to include accommodation arrangements etc but if absolutely necessary, I can organise that for myself. From a purely business point of perspective, it would seem like a hassle to hire a student from overseas over someobody local, but then again, these programmes exist for a reason, right? 

Any insight is greatly appreciated. 

Cheers

My whole offer meeting was 3 mins. 

Said well you need to go back to school so we aren't going to make an offer maybe you can get more internships under your belt we just don't have capacity. And that was it. 

Looks like only 4 people out of I think 21 got offers and those were people in grad school or done with grad school. 



I honestly didn't like it there as my boss was super put off by asking questions and would ignore questions if they weren't exchanged verbally. And would have turned down the offer anyways probably.

23p7t5,1,2014-04-22,Lost community college student seeking advice about furthering education.,wz_I68,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/23p7t5/lost_community_college_student_seeking_advice/,"My life is about to fork off into one of two directions and I'm not sure which way to go. As it stands now, I'm a community college student majoring in Business Administration (my school offers an AS in Accounting but actively discourages that if you want to pursue accountancy at a higher level, recommending the Bus.Ad. route instead). I have the vast majority of my credits completed, and am looking at finishing this semester with something in the range of 3.2-3.4 GPA. The community college is a school in the SUNY system in New York. I'm planning on this being my last semester here, though I would be finishing likely this December if I stayed. I moved to this town three years ago to be with my girlfriend, who graduates this semester from private school. She'll be living in NYC as that's the best thing for her career at the time. There's nothing keeping me in this town after this semester aside from the community college, and I feel it's time for me to move forward as well. 

My initial plan was to try and get into University at Albany's Accounting program. They offer a BS in Accounting and MS degrees in Taxation, Professional Accounting, and Forensic Accounting. The eventual goal is to get my CPA. I support myself financially and my tuition has been about 50/50 out of pocket/financial aid. Were I to go to Albany, finishing the BS would likely take two to three more years based on the number of classes I've so far been able to take at CC while working full time (those classes have been easy, practically high school easy, so I'm trying to factor in the increased course load when I determine how full a credit load I can manage at a tougher school. The ease of this school is also why I want to leave now, and get more of my education from a tougher level). The graduate degree would likely take another 2 years at least on top of that. Everything I've heard and everyone I've talked to says Albany is a great school for Accounting, but four-plus more years of my girlfriend and I being apart is scary. I have no doubt we'll make it just fine, we've made it four years already. The thought of being apart that long just sucks.

The other option is to move with her to New York and go to school there. Baruch and NYU have both caught my eye, but admittedly I have only begun to do research as we came up with this idea last night and I'm open to school suggestions for NYC. Baruch offers a BBA and an MS in Accounting, as well as an integrated program of both at once. NYU offers a BS, an MS, an MBA, and a PhD all in Accounting. 

I'm feeling overwhelmed. I've heard so far that the CPA is all that matters, it's not important whether you get an MS or an MBA. I've also heard that you need an MBA and that the MS is worthless. And I've also heard the opposite of that. I know Big 4 recruits heavily out of Albany, but I also know that going to school in NYC will offer so much more in terms of networking and internships, as well as just plain life experience. I'm trying to make the best decision for my career, but I'd be lying if I said the fact that my girlfriend will be living in one of the two option cities isn't a heavily weighing factor (and I feel it should be). 

I'm sorry for the wall of text, I just wanted to get as much relevant information up front to start with. Most of the advice threads I've seen on here start with responders asking for more information, so I wanted to be as forthright as possible. I guess the big deciding factor is which graduate degree should I be looking into? What about the PhD? I've rarely even heard of a PhD in Accounting outside of careers in higher education, is it a logical option for someone who is looking at a CPA? Are the networking and internship opportunities of NYC that much better? Any advice, words of wisdom, or anecdotes are all very much appreciated!"

I'm not sure how I feel and I can tell you now that I don't like that.  I'm going to give you bits and pieces of my story so hopefully it'll help yall understand without getting too lost in my muddled thoughts haha.


My life has been a bit hard.  I've been to 3X as many funerals as I have been to weddings.  My life has been surrounded by death.  Hell I've been going to funerals since I was in utero.  My dad shot himself when I was 7.  My grandparents who I was exceedingly close to died in a car accident when I was 13.  My best friend died my first year of college at 18.  I could go on but those were pretty notable.  I can't help but feel as if I've been depressed forever.  My dad used to tell me and my sister how he wanted to drive us all off a bridge so we could go to heaven and be together forever and mommy could never take us away from him.  He almost threw me through a tv when I was 3 (which was the early 90s so they were those huge boxy tvs that for sure would've killed me had he done so.)


After my grandparents were killed I knew it was the beginning of my downward spiral.  I asked my mother if I could go see a therapist because I needed someone to talk to.  She told me I was a horrible daughter for basically telling her I'd rather talk to a stranger than her.  Finally she agreed and took me to a therapist.  The twist here is when we went I told her and the doctor that I wanted to speak with him alone, and I did want my mother to leave the room.  She said nonsense and stayed and I couldn't open up with her standing behind me breathing down my neck.  It was as if she couldn't help herself, she had to witness this session and know what I said to this stranger and make sure she still looked like the good mother who was just trying to find help for her adolescent daughter.


The doctor didn't make her leave the room and I did my best to talk to him about the stuff I knew were considered safe areas if you will.  I told him about my dad, about how I was having a hard time dealing with my grandparent's deaths, and I how scared I was of my cancer.  My mother chimed in with ""oh she doesn't have cancer, it's just a stupid wart,"" and completely downplayed it.  Now I'll tell yall I had a cancerous growth in my eye that required me to regularly see a specialist optometrist from the age of 6.  By the age of 15 I had to undergo surgery to get it removed from both the inside and outside of my eyeball.  He said it was benign but with the very rapid growth, he worried it wouldn't actually stay that way.  He believed that if we left it in my eye, it would grow so much that eventually I would go blind in one eye.  I wouldn't be able to drive, and it would disfigure my eye so I would probably only feel comfortable wearing something that covered it.  I overheard her and the therapist before we left though.  He wanted me to come back and talk to him one on one.  He was worried about me because he could see and feel the emotional distress I was under.  She went on to explain my mood swings (which she downplayed) and he said he believed I might actually be exhibiting signs of being bipolar.  On the drive home she yelled at me for wasting her time and money on something so stupid. She never took me back to see him again.


I've been worried ever since I heard that over a decade ago that maybe he was right, maybe I am bipolar.  It could very well be true.  My father had all kinds of mental issues as did his mother who I have no contact with.  She's a freakin loon too!  It isn't her fault though, she underwent a forced lobotomy at the age of 18 and had never been the same since from what I'm told.  I've always thought there was something wrong with my head but never got the opportunity to get the help I wanted.


I have a daughter who just turned 3, who is the product of an abusive relationship.  My ex got me pregnant on purpose one night when I was exceedingly drunk and needed a safe ride home and because of the abuse, I had no friends and no one else to call but him.  I stayed with him while I was pregnant because I was in my final year of college and knew I needed the help.  He used all my doctors appointments as excuses to get out of work because after all he had to take his poor pregnant girlfriend to the doctor and she's just too helpless to drive herself.  Whatever.  I worked my butt off to finish college which included an internship with a catering company.  I was determined though.  I worked up until the Friday before I had my daughter, had her on a Wednesday and was back to work on Monday.  I managed to get all my required hours in within 2 days of the deadline.  I had her in April, graduated college in May and left him in June.  It was the best decision I've ever made and I knew it.  When she was 8 months old, I met the one :)  She just turned 3 on the 6th.  We've been in a relationship for 2 years.  And last October I decided to throw caution to the wind, listen to my gut and do what I knew was right for myself and my daughter, we moved 5,000 miles away.  Her birthfather hasn't seen her since she was I think 4 months old or so if I recall correctly and that's exactly how I want it.  We moved to a different continent, to Ireland and have enjoyed living here since we got here.  I've finally started settling in, making friends and what not.


As I already stated, we moved over in October.  I didn't tell a soul with the exception of my best friend since I was 2 that we were planning on leaving and she didn't say a word.  I worked 2 jobs and went against every instinct I had and left my daughter with my parents/family for the summer.  I saved up like crazy, shipped over as much as I could, got on a plane and left it all behind without saying so much as a word to my family.  The reason being I had already told them of my intentions and they told me I was stupid and crazy and my guy was using me and probably with another woman I didn't know about and basically just threw every stupid excuse they could think of at me so I wouldn't go.  Thing is I know they don't give a shit about me, my mother has told me so, but they do love my daughter.  I don't want them to have anything to do with how she is raised at all.  So we left October, and suddenly in November we had an unexpected visitor.  My mother who had never once in her life even left the states had flown to Ireland with no warning whatsoever.  One of the first things she said when I did let her into my apartment and asked what the hell she was doing there instead of just calling (since she does have my guy's number and could have easily called) and she said ""I came to take her home to her family where she belongs.""  I was flabbergasted, completely.  I couldn't believe what I'd just heard.  So I took a second and said to her ""actually, she belongs here, with her parents.""  And she just kinda stuck her nose up in the air at me and just kinda made one of those huffy ""hm"" noises that I'm sure yall have heard before.  She spent the week trying to convince me to let her take my daughter back to the states with her and how ""if you just let me take her, you won't even have to hear from us ever again, we'll be out of your life for good which is apparently what you want since you moved so far away.""  I guarded my daughter like a hawk.  And trying to seem like the ""good guy"" in the scenario she said oh let's go shopping so I took her into the city.  She bought me a dress (which albeit was very nice of her!) but it's a cocktail dress.  I'm a stay at home mom in a new country where I didn't know anyone.  Where the fuck would I wear a cocktail dress that's actually a freakin prom dress for high school girls!!!  Don't get me wrong, it's lovely, except it minimizes my bust and accentuates my stomach and looks freakin terrible on me.  She didn't leave the receipt so I could get something I could actually wear though so now I have this dress in my wardrobe that I'm never going to wear.  It's silly!


My parents are very well off.  She sent over this HUGE box of stuff for my daughter for her birthday and ""oh there's something in there for you too.""  At first I didn't believe this since she hasn't given me a birthday present in a few years.  Turns out she sent me two boxed cake mixes (admittedly, thoughtful since I like baking and can't get this kind of cake over here unless I make it from scratch but I just can't seem to get it juuuust right to get the flavor I'm looking for) along with a black sweater....which I left behind and coincidentally she gave it to me about 5 years ago for Christmas.  Along with a birthday card.  In the birthday card was a cashiers check for $500.  An unsigned cashiers check for $500.  Yep.  But funny enough because of a banking error we still managed to put the money into our account so I guess that was a nice big fuck you right back in her face since I'm sure she 100% didn't sign it on purpose just to torment me.


This is the reason I'm so confused emotionally though since I opened that card a couple weeks ago and already brushed it off.  Yesterday was my 25th birthday.  I really don't give a shit about my birthdays and neither did my family after my grandparents died.  My entire family (2 big sisters, 2 little brothers and parents) all forgot about my 15th birthday entirely.  They told me happy birthday the next day not realizing it was a day late.  That doesn't change the fact that I still like it when they do acknowledge it though (at least on my dad and brothers' parts.)  I've told my new friends over here that my birthday was coming up though and they got me kind of excited about it since it's supposed to be another big one (25, quarter of a century, woohoo, etc).  So because of that I started kind of thinking about it again.  Well I spent the day exactly the way I wanted.  I got to spend it with my daughter and my guy, in my sweatpants just finishing up the 2nd season of The Newsroom just the way I wanted.  We made snickerdoodle cookies and just kind of hung out.  Then we went for a walk through the city and it was perfect for me, except we missed ordering our pizza by 3 minutes so no dinner, that part sucked but oh well.  Today I decided to go ahead and check out facebook (which I abhor at birthday times.)  I got a bunch of false birthday wishes comments and what not, including one from my mother, one from my sister on our extended family page since she's blocked from my fb, and one from my aunt who has turned into a total bitch in the last year.  My father and neither of my brothers told me happy birthday for my 25th.  I'll admit it, it hurt.  I've been trying not to stew on it all day but apparently I have been.


I just don't know how I feel.  My head feels so screwed up.  It's as if I don't know up from down right now.  I'm still exceedingly glad I made the move because I know it was the best move for my daughter and myself (versus bringing my guy over stateside.)  She'll get a better education, hopefully her view of the world won't be as narrow as it was in my home town growing up, she'll be around my guy's family which is just an awesome family by the way, etc.  She'll get to see these places and experience so many things that I dreamed about doing when I was growing up.  Hell when I was a child I used to pray that I was secretly adopted and my real parents would come and take me away from all of it one day.  I feel muddled.  I feel like I should be on a damn pill to straighten out my head because it's as if I can't even think anymore.  I'm an emotional shipwreck (ironic since I'm listening to Titanic while writing this out.)  I'm still glad we moved and I'm still as in love with my guy as I've ever been.  I've got friends, I've got a new family, and yet there's still something nagging.  I'm not sure if I just haven't accepted how shit my family is.  I'm not sure if I'm worried that I do actually have some kind of something wrong with my brain that we could actually put a label on.  I've been crying as much as ever even with me being happier on the whole about my life.  I cry while watching any happy moment on tv, during happy romantic comedy movies even, etc.  I just don't know what's going on with me.  I treat my daughter right, I treat my guy right, my in-laws all like me (which I hear is rare for families with all boys, my guy is one of four boys actually.)  So what the heck?  I'm a mess and I don't know why and I think that's what frustrates me the most.  I have no idea why my emotions are so topsy-turvy and because of that so are my thoughts.  I'm not worried about being a danger to my child or myself.  I still take good care of the house and I cook her round meals every day instead of just giving her crap food all the time.  I know I'm still managing to be a good mother through it all but I just don't know about the other areas of my life.  I don't know what's going on in my own head and it's unnerving.  I contemplated posting this in /r/offmychest but I felt it required too much background and I knew yall would understand more.


I don't have medical insurance just yet so going to a head doctor is out of the question until I do, which will be in the very near future since we have to have insurance to get our required visa anyway.  I'm not sure if I was just looking to vent/rant or what since I didn't actually ask a question.  I just don't want to feel as if I'm going crazy like my dad did.  I'm done though, thanks for reading if you made it through all of this, sorry for wasting your time if you did read it all though haha.  Thanks everyone, yall are all awesome and I wish every one of you the best."

-------------------------

&gt;**Today**

The medical college stands off in the distance, the structure peering over the rest of campus. A dry fog curls along the ground as birds chirp and chatter. It's a colder day, 40F, but at least it's not too windy. Pure Michigan, as the phrase goes for the state.

Today was a slow day, our queue sleeping in a temporary hibernation state. Boss walked into the office, his coffee in hand. He seemed to have relapsed, as he had always talked us up about quitting coffee.

&gt;Boss: You said you wanted to talk about something?

&gt;Me: Do you still have [PM]'s resume by any chance?

&gt;Boss: Not sure, I think it's somewhere, why do you ask?

&gt;Me: Well, you know how [PM] said he had all those certifications?

&gt;Boss: Sorta, why?

&gt;Me: You might want to see if they're legit.

&gt;Boss: I suppose so... I gave him the benefit of the doubt he because didn't have hardly any work experience. Certs can be dumped and passed, been there before.

Boss stood up and took his coffee back to his office, and I could hear RC in the hallway yelling about NOAH on the clinical laptops that were botched last Friday. RC was a cool electronics tech, always talking to me about his RC airplanes, but he was very strict about the clinical process (I mean, you have to be, it's fucking HIPAA), and he'd skewer you if you gave him a machine and said it was done when it wasn't. I mean, I don't fucking do that, I'd rather not get our university sued.

CM arrives at 9, which is a bit odd since he only comes in early on my shift when something is up.

&gt;CM: Hey, we'll need to pull an image and snapshots of NOAH from the VMWare 7 machine for a new lab image. I left the instructions in the ticket, but we'll let the new guys take care of it. You literally have to be braindead to fuck this up.

Knowing how it's better not to curse oneself before setting a goal, I just sigh and slide back into the captain's chair at the command quad. PM walks in talking on the phone, and it always makes me wish I had a Babel Fish nearby so I could understand what he's talking about. He takes a seat at his dying machine, the dull whisper of a fan who found out too late that, no, dust bunnies were not your friends. He opens our tech page and... does something, or really anything at this point is fine by me.

CM heads out to the student gym facility across campus, figuring that PM would read the ticket that specifically stated it wasn't for him or I to do. 30 minutes pass, and PM is lollygagging around the endless depths that is the web.

&gt;*I lean around the command quad*

&gt;Me: So how's that image capture going bud, she ready to roll?

&gt;PM: It's a ticket for the new guys, correct? The ones we just hired?

&gt;Me: Well yes, of course. It says that right in the ticket, did you read it?

&gt;PM: Ya, I'm not the new guys.

&gt;Me: Bud, we hired you 6 months ago, get to work.

A knock on the door of our staging area leads me out into the main room, Reeses, the MCT's manager, had called me to work on his machine. I leave the room and nod my heads towards the VM at CM's command center, and PM slowly slid his chair over there.

I had only started working on Reeses's machine when my phone chirps away in my pocket.

&gt;*PM: Help. What is password?*

Jesus dude, this guy really can't do anything without you holding his fucking hand.

&gt;*Me: It's Administrator's*

I go back to work and fix Reeses's machine. Apparently upgrades over Office 2010 to 2013 don't play nice with regards to Outlook, thanks Obama!

I Fob into the staging area and I find PM looking down at his phone, leg crossed, doing nothing.

&gt;Me: Uh, what are you doing dude? Are you capturing that image?

&gt;PM: The password was wrong.

&gt;Me: What the fuck, no it's not, what did you type?

&gt;PM: ""Administrator's""

*Holy fucking shit*

I walk over and hammer the password into the VM and it greets me with that soothing Windows 7 Logon tone. *""This is how stress kills people""*, I thought.

CM arrives back from the athletic center.

&gt;CM: Holy god how can people not open stuff to check if it works before saying it's broken?

Dunno bud, I'm dealing with a Layer 8 issue here myself and he's getting paid to be stupid.

The delivery guy drops us off from boxes from CDW, Boss decided on [Surface Pros](http://i.imgur.com/lZc0WUh.png), [Surface 2's](http://i.imgur.com/iyHqMVo.jpg), and getting those damn [touch cover 2's. (Those suck even more than the Type Cover 2's)](http://i.imgur.com/FKLcli6.png)

Noon time rolls around and my phone rings with some asshole recruiter from Indiana wanting me to work for HP for like $12.00/hr. I politely tell him I'm not interested and to remove me from his recruitment database. Listen shit head, if I wanted to work for a company I'll directly talk to them, you're not getting a cut of my salary for placement, you ""Talent Acquisition Specialist"" piece of shit. JT1 and Boss walk in to the office, and asks us if we'd like to go to lunch. We all decide to go to a pizza pub literally 100 yards away from the building. PM, not really a pizza guy, decides to stay behind and ""work on the capture"".

An hour passes and we all arrive back with our leftovers in tow. I throw PM the scraps from my mozarella sticks, pizza, and breadsticks, because I figured he was hungry.

&gt;Me: How's the capture going?

&gt;PM: Good, almost done.

That's weird, image capture doesn't take an hour at the most for a clean image. It was 1, so I didn't give a fuck, I had to look after these new Surface tablets with CM and asked JT1 to assist PM if he requests it. Oddly enough our ticket queue wasn't updating CM's ticket, because generally if you're a good person you update what you've been doing to your job you're working on, sounds great in theory but horrendously awful in practice, kind of like comments in programming source code because everyone knows what you're thinking when you wrote that sloppy ass if-tree that's like 5 levels deep.

3pm rolls around and I start leaving for my class on scripting with Ruby, Python, and Perl (fuck Perl).

&gt;Me: [PM], update the ticket it's been dead all day.

&gt;PM: Fine, it's updated now.

I walk along the office corridor and see my boss reading my going-away card I got him (It said ""You're the best boss I've ever had... so far!) and pop in for a chat.

&gt;Me: We're making progress on that VM, but I guess only PM's worked on it.

Boss [twirls open the ticket](http://i.imgur.com/tUZGrPN.png) and takes a sip of his coffee. He lets out a deep sigh.

&gt;Me: Do you know who's going to work here this summer since I'm gone and CM has an internship?

&gt;Boss: The newer guys.

&gt;Me: You think [PM] is gonna come back this fall?

&gt;Boss: I make my hiring decisions in early August, not sure yet though. Seems to be better that way. Have fun at class.

I exit out the corridor door to slip into the stream of students leaving class and heading into campus. The clocktower rings and the chimes are heard throughout the campus, as my eyes move from one face to another. They don't know who I am, or what I do, or what I have to deal with. I guess you could sum it up in a cliche phrase.

&gt;*I'm the one who rocks*

23q30t,1,2014-04-22,"I'm rather flustered with this economical ""gap"" conversation if no one wants to protest or make their voices heard. As well as keeping my hopes up for a happy life.",Bashship,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/23q30t/im_rather_flustered_with_this_economical_gap/,"I have two problems. One personal and one more shared with others.

So today we had another [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/23obyo/american_middle_class_no_longer_richest_in_world/) about the economical gap in the United States and again we have people talking about issues and how more problematic it is.

Great that we know how bad this situation is.

Would you like to do something about it?

Protest? Contact your representative? 

Oh, you're busy? Too much to lose? Just want to talk about it?

We have fantastic information given to us by several redditors.

But I stand here at a loss why we just talk?

I mean we protested the Vietnam War, Occupy Wall Street, Iraq War, Civil Rights and several others.

We have nothing to lose, only to gain. And it seems that since the Wall Street movement failed, we should all just gibber about it while laws keep getting manhandled.

One argument I've heard is that we have too much to lose.

Maybe because I'm sort of at the bottom I don't understand.

We already protested once. It failed, ok that happened. We protested the Iraq War, Vietnam War. We protested Civil right inequality. Abortion clinics, court cases and several other things.

I'm not understanding how we can have so much disdain but not publicly show it. Sure organizing a protest isn't an easy thing to do but its not hard to do either.

* Reason why you're protesting
* A map to show what direction you're going to be demonstrating
* Financial assistance for food and drinks
* Information to give bypassers or new comers some understanding why this protesting is occurring.

You can just get a picket sign and sit in front of a popular area or city hall and just start that way.

---

The second issue is that its hard for me to have hope when we talk about high student debt. a building gap, inability to follow dreams and everything else.

I wanna go to a four year university for either MIT or software development and own a nice home. Drive a Dodge Ram with cowboy boots and jeans. Have someone to give my heart all the care it wants to give.

Its hard to keep hope up when all I read and see is discontent. When there is a picture showing students with their accumulated debt on top of their cabs.

When we talk about how banks play with the economy and how you can have a bill of over $50,000.00 for giving birth at a hospital.

I get the discontent, and I get why protests aren't really happening.

You can't just drop your job, school, kids and just protest. 

Yet at the same time you can't do anything when you know there is a lot of wrong and barely anyone is raising their voice.

I'm actually am thinking of going to the side walk in front of city hall and just have a picket sign and just silently protest.

Sadly I do need a tiny bit of cash but I am thinking about actually saying something. It's absurd, we knot it's absurd. Yet, here we ~~stand~~ sleep being trampled by powerful corruptionists.

Do I genuinely believe going to protest will make me happy? No, it won't.

But how exactly are people going to have a chance when their chances are consumed like it was a joint before they get a chance to even graduate from High School?

I've seen a lot of people join the Military JUST to have an opportunity. Myself included. That shouldn't be the society we should live in. 

We shouldn't be in a society where to just have a stable good paying job you must already have thousands of dollars in debt. Where you must have over 10 years of experience for an entry level position or have to settle for internship or part time.

Where it is much easier to steal a gun and take down a opposing gang member than it is to stay in a school to learn Geometry, Calculus, Chemisty, Biology and then some.

This is the society You, them, us, I and many others are given birth in or must attempt to flourish in.

Standing here and just talking about it with friends, redditors and random people isn't going to solve it.

It'll get the problem to the light but standing in the light will just burn it.

It has to grow, move and strengthen.

We shouldn't live in a society where ending your life is easier than walking another step. 

I have no idea where my rant is going but what I want is just to be in a happy place. Protesting may not change it for me, but it may change it for the babies in the hospital that are being given birth to at this very moment. For that girl in Afghanistan that must hear the sounds of clashing metal and clay. For the Chinese adolescent that is making whatever gadget the western world wants. 

Again, no idea where I'm going with this or anything but I'd like to have a bridge that I can at least see, whether or not I take it is up to myself. But everyone deserves a bridge. A walk way. A stairway. A ladder. A road. A dream that can happen. A life that can be felt. A smile that isn't a faux. 

And here I sit, writing this. I'm genuinely willing to protest - NSA, calm down - my hours are nice enough where I can actually have a bit of the day time to protest. Starting it though would be a hell of a trip though.

23q950,4,2014-04-22,Never believe what a recruiter tells you until it is written on paper...,outsidesmoke,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/23q950/never_believe_what_a_recruiter_tells_you_until_it/,"Hey everyone.  I see a lot of questions from college students here and I would like to share a story with so you can avoid the mistake I made.

Back when I was in school I was being recruited by the Big 4 firm I work at now.  My chances of getting an offer at a big market was fairly low but I could easily get an offer out West.  I took and internship out there, liked it well enough, and got a full-time offer.  My salary was a little lower than I expected especially because the cost of living is so high.

I spoke to my recruiter several times over the phone but this particular firm has a standard starting salary.  He did tell me, however, that we would be given a bonus of 6-12% of our salary during end of the year reviews.

I did the math. Assuming I ranked fairly well among my peers, I'd be earning an additional 5k+/year because of that bonus.  After factoring in the cost of living and the bonus, I barely accepted the offer.  I would have absolutely declined the offer if I didn't think I would receive a bonus.  My school publishes all the starting salaries for people in your major so you know if you are getting a good offer or not.

I was just told, after working for 6 months, that these bonuses are not given to first year associates.  In fact, you do not get a bonus if you are being promoted for senior and you don't get the bonus your first year as a senior.  Esentially, I will not get a bonus for the first three years with the firm. I've already moved accross the country and I don't have any proof of what the recruiter told me over the phone.

Long Story Short - Don't be an idiot and get burned like me.  Make sure you get whatever your recruiter says in writing before accepting your offer."

I *hate* my job.  I told the manager at the time what I wanted to do, he told me they do that all the time, they almost never deal with what it is I wanted to do.  I have been at this company for a little over 2.5 years, I have been sending out my resume for over 2 years.  I have a few big problems though:

1) I have no internship because I got my degree in 4 years when everyone else took 4.5+.  
2) I graduated over 3 years ago so my classes are not worth much and I slacked off so my GPA was less than amazing anyway.  
3) I did not actually plan to get an engineering degree.

In regards to #3, I was originally a Physics major, but I decided I did not want to need a Doctorate before getting a job so I just picked a random degree until I figured out what I wanted to do with my life.  I will point out I did not have a fun college life, I lived at home with my parents and went to a grand total of maybe 2 parties for those 4 years, neither of which involved any alcohol or drugs.  I just showed up to class everyday and stupidly expected something else to fall into my lap like it always did.

So now I am stuck in a job I hate, with a degree which I honestly never wanted, and after 2 years of sending out my resume to any posting which looked interesting almost nobody even replies.

Other random info: I passed the F.E. exam (first of 2 tests to become a licensed engineer similar to the Bar for lawyers) on the first try while still in my senior year at college.  I have lots of little random skills such as some amount of programming skill but no classes to back it up and no serious projects to show off.  I suck at selling myself, and at this point it really is becoming a problem with my self-esteem, but it is hard to think well of myself given how stuck I feel.

The first step clearly is to determine *what* I want to do...  How do I even figure this out?"

I wish I could honestly say that it was hard work and dedication, but nope.  I throw up almost everything I eat and I feel like binging and purging has consumed my entire life.  I spend tons of money on buying junk food that I can binge on and then purge later.  I used to want to be a chef, and now I can't enjoy food because I'm so scared of being fat.

Dad, I love you so much, but you would look at women who weighed less than I used to and joke about how fat they were.  Someone told you she had lost 40lbs and you said ""Wow, she used to be fat."" When I said I didn't think 40lbs would have made her fat, you got angry at me and said ""Anyone who needs to lose 40lbs was FAT before!""  Well, now I've lost 75lbs.  And you seem so proud of me.  It's all you talk about, when you're not yelling at me about how I'm lazy and how I do nothing but eat all day(I guess it's good you got the shitty hearing that seems to populate your whole family, because you don't hear me throwing up right after).  I feel like I can't eat anything around you because it's all you seem to care about.  You're overweight, for god's sake, but if I ever mentioned it I know you'd lose your mind.  

Mum... I'm so sorry.  I know this would break your heart.  You're such a great mom.  You deserve a perfect daughter, and I've never been that.  I've never been pretty and I was certainly never thin.  Even now I'm only average.  You've always been gorgeous and effortlessly thin, and I have been so jealous my entire life.  I love you so much, you don't deserve this.

Being an only child has ruined me.  My entire life I wanted nothing more than to be the perfect daughter to give you guys what you deserved, but I've always been a failure.  In elementary and middle school I would study nonstop and do well enough, but I could never be one of those kids who got good grades without trying, and it was so discouraging especially because I wanted to be good so badly.  I was always bullied badly and would fight through it by thinking that one day I'd grow up to be beautiful and smart and everything would finally be like I dreamed.  I applied for a prestigious internship program in 8th grade, it was everything I dreamed of at that age, and I put my entire heart and soul into that application and studied like crazy to get the grades I needed.  I didn't get in and it broke my little heart.  I cried myself to sleep for weeks.  

I wanted to go to a performing arts high school so I could get away from my bullies and be around kids who were more like me, and like before, I worked SO HARD on my audition.  I wore myself to the bone to be perfect and would lie awake at night dreaming about what it would be like to fit in.  The day that tiny envelope that delivered bad news arrived in the mail was probably the first time I ever really hated myself.  I cried myself to sleep in my mom's arms.  Not getting in meant I would go to the local high school with the same people who had bullied me since first grade.

High school was hell.  I tried to kill myself twice, but both times I would wake up on the bathroom floor in pools of vomit, furious that I couldn't even kill myself properly and simultaneously ashamed that I had even tried.  The bullying got worse and worse.  I was so depressed and angry because I felt like no matter what, nothing was getting better.  I wished for my first kiss on every birthday from 9-22.  I skipped so much class to avoid my bullies that I almost didn't graduate.  Summer school was the only reason I did.  I never studied, I failed tons of classes, I was so depressed.

I gained a ton of weight.  I was 5'10 and 242 at my heaviest.  I wanted to be pretty so badly, but all I saw in the mirror was an ugly, awkward monster.  I couldn't even imagine what it would be like to hold someone's hand or be kissed.  I felt so ugly, so sad all the time, but I was always way too embarrassed to tell you guys how I felt because as your only child, I feel like I'm your only chance to have what you deserve. 

So I started purging.  It was slow at first, once a month maybe.  Now it's every day, usually 4 or 5 times.  Now I've lost 75lbs and for the first time in my life... I'm kind of pretty.  I started dating a wonderful man 5 months ago, for the first time at 25.  He's sweet, and he looks at me like I waited so many years for.  And I can't stop hurting myself.  I'm in debt from college because you never told me I didn't have even a penny in my college fund, even after I asked.  I can't find a job in my field so I work retail, but hours are scarce and I don't make enough money.  I can't move out, even though I desperately want to, and we fight like animals about it.  I never leave my bedroom because I am so depressed, and I just don't want to talk about it with you.  My weight is the only thing I can control, and the only way I feel like I can control it is to keep doing this. 

I hate this.  I'm stuck in this cycle and I love you guys too much to tell you and break your hearts.  Now I look in the mirror and see a pretty girl sometimes, but mostly I just see a failure.  And I won't fail you again, because you deserve a better daughter than that.

I love you guys.  I love you so much.  "

I'm in definite need of life advice. The super short and simple version of my problem is that I am disillusioned with the working world and with my chosen career, only a year after graduating from an elite university with a masters degree.

Here's the whole story:

I've spent the last 5 years of my life building up to the career I have now -- 1 year at the end of college figuring out my ""life calling"", 2 years doing internships, and 2 years in graduate school. But now that I'm actually ""doing it"" (i.e., working in what I thought would be my dream job), I couldn't care less. Before graduating, I had ambitions of having daily goals, keeping a log of things I'd learned, and wisdom gleaned from my senior colleagues. Now I barely use more brain power than is necessary to complete my tasks. Furthermore, even loftier goals that I've had for years now seem like horrible ideas. For instance, I used to want to do a PhD, get a prestigious postdoc, and then acquire a leadership position for a certain organization. Now, I don't want to do any of those things! They all seem like massive wastes of time: doing a PhD and gaining theoretical knowledge that has minimal application in a very political, top-heavy, and interpersonal environment when I could just be gaining work experience; being underpaid and overworked in a postdoc position as more senior employees leverage my cheap labor; having a leadership position in this certain organization that I now see as inefficient, stagnating, and with very little room for creative input and career growth (not to mention the way my superiors are pulled in 10 directions with dozens upon dozens of unread emails, working 10 hour days). 

Anyway, I just used to be so confident in where I was going, and now I just have no idea. Maybe other organizations have better cultures and more stimulating work to offer, but I don't even know where to begin gauging that. And I increasingly feel like just an average joe, after living most of my life under the impression that I was special, uncommonly intelligent, and had a brighter future than 90% of the populace. I just didn't realize the working world was so imperfect. As I ponder this existential crisis, I keep thinking that the working world in general just isn't for me, but that isn't exactly a viable solution. So when it comes right down to it, I don't have a plan; I'm just treading water. 

As you might suspect, with this total change in my life, I'm getting depressed. I just feel like I'm on a hampster wheel. By the time Friday comes around, I'm exhausted, and two days never seems like enough to revitalize me and fix my burn out. Meanwhile, I have 7 years left of loan payments. I just don't know how sustainable this process is, and I just want to be happy again and enjoy my day-to-day life. 


So I guess my question is how do you find happiness (or at least ward off crippling depression) while dealing with an existential crisis such as mine? I know things aren't hopeless, but they sure feel that way sometimes.

All comparable personal experiences are welcome; I'd love to hear how some of you overcame a similar situation. Sorry for the disjointed post.

I'm graduating in June, and I still don't really have any idea of what I want to do, and nor have I gotten any offers, other than the one I mention [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/20vmnb/new_grad_informally_accepted_offer_but_having/). 

I'm currently developing a local company's iOS application, and developing a few iOS applications on the side. I really do enjoy it for the most part, more so than I have other parts of programming. However, part of me is really concerned that I should really be learning Javascript and an associated framework and make web applications. I've been dabbling with Backbone.js and Angular, and, while I can't say that I love javascript, the stuff you can do with them is pretty neat. I'd also hate to take a job as an iOS developer to only be phased out as web apps continue to become popular. 

I've been continuing interviewing, but I'm still pretty busy with my internship and courses, that I'm not getting to the next rounds because I don't have enough time to study up for them. I feel like I'm already late enough in the job application status for new grads that the ""sooner-the-better"" mentality isn't holding up, and I should just focus on making applications and studying up for interviews with time over the summer.

So I guess my questions are:

* What technologies should I be learning given I have both an interest in iOS and web application development, and is there any overlap so I could transition between them if need be?

* Should I push aside any more interviews until Summer when I have time to brush up on fundamentals?"

23qx38,1,2014-04-23,Me [20 M] with my friend (interest?) [20 F] - conservative immigrant parents and first relationships,plaidpajama,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/23qx38/me_20_m_with_my_friend_interest_20_f_conservative/,"TL;DR: Two friends from a similar cultural/religious background with conservative arranged-marriage parents trying to feel out dating and romance. Three months ago we expressed mutual interest, but I'm shying away from that and will be back in town in another three. What do?

I've known this girl for the past eight years through school and the temple (weekly); we became close friends in college. Our mutual friends have always suggested it's something more, but only recently (last fall) did we begin flirting in earnest (or at least, that's when I picked up on it). I started hanging out alone with her on Fridays so I could feel things out for myself. I deliberately avoided using the word date, but yea. Finally, we went to an event on campus which we called a date afterwards. While texting, we expressed mutual interest and decided to see where the next nine months would take us. Why that long?

I received my dream internship offer on the other side of the country, so I'm sitting here on the opposite coast. In September I'll be back for school, and while we've been Skyping somewhat frequently, I'm honestly back to not being sure how I feel about dating her.

My parents come from a conservative South Asian background. They support my decision to not pursue an arranged marriage, but are adamant I only start dating after college. I love my parents, but that's one part of my life they have zero authority over, and I'm respectfully declining to follow their wishes in that respect.

They know this girl and they like her; they also know her parents and are pretty neutral with them. The point is, if I try to strike up a relationship with this girl, I honestly know it'll become a lightning rod for drama in the temple community (hooray for close-knit immigrant communities!). When I brought up the possibility of dating herwith my parents, there was much shouting of ""too soon!"", tears, and thoughts of marriage on their end (which is absurd in my opinion, but perfectly normal in their cultural sense). 

**tl;dr**:   
1) Is it bad this is a major sticking point for me? I don't want my first relationship to have this much tension on both ends.  
2) Do I have my priorities completely misplaced? I've never really dated or been in a relationship, though I think I finally want one.  
3) How do I communicate this to her?  "

**I found a partner for this.** Not looking for others right now, but I'll leave this up in case anyone wants to use it as a starting point for your own RP, or whatever. (This is not permission to repost it as your own...)

--------------------- 


It's 9:45pm when I park and get out of my car. After triple-checking the address against my emailed invitation, I toss my phone into the center console. Sliding my keys into the pocket of my slacks and hefting my toy bag over my shoulder, I walk up to the house. The party started at 7, but it goes all night and I never like to be there too early. I ring the bell, and the door swings open to reveal Trista, the door bunny, wearing her trademark top hat.

After some small talk with her, I walk into the house to check out the party. Most people are hanging out in the back yard, escaping the late-summer Vegas heat by swimming, or just socializing on the deck around the pool. There's some socializing in the kitchen, as always, but I'm more interested in the play spaces. I head down the hall towards the bedrooms to check out what's going on.

The first room has a plastic drop cloth covering the carpet, and is set up as a body painting area. I say hello to a few acquaintances from the group, but quickly move on to the next room. Here I find a couple I don't recognize in the middle of a scene. A tall, red-haired woman is using a Violet Wand on a small Asian man laying on a massage table. A few people are watching, probably interested in the relatively novel toy.

I head on to the third room, and here I find what I've been looking for -- two large [crosses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Andrew's_Cross_\(BDSM\)) dominate the room. A tiny woman -- who I know only by her Fetlife screenname, ""SexyInPink"" (with some numbers, which I never remember) -- is strapped to one of them, and blindfolded. Her Domme and partner, Carrie, is instructing another woman on the finer points of breast flogging. The short, red, leather flogger she's holding seems to be doing a fine job. Again, a few people are in the room watching. I spot my friend Steve as I set down my toy bag and ask him if anyone's using the other cross. He lets me know that a few people have used it tonight, but nobody's waiting right now. ""Perfect..."", I think to myself, ""now I just need to find someone to play with."" Grinning, I head out to the kitchen, grab a beer, and head out to the back.

Sipping on my bottle of Dos Equis, I start working the crowd. I meet a few new faces: George, a 60-ish Marine vet (with a remarkably loud laugh), wearing only a pink collar around his neck and a speedo; Joel, a young guy dressed in casual clothes who says he isn't really sure what he's into yet; a cute black-haired woman who introduces herself as ""Sky""... she turns out to be a masochist, but not a sub. I'm about to ask if she wants to play when she turns around to show off her new bruises, already forming from her session with Steve -- he really covered her entire back, ass, and most of her legs. Obviously she's played enough for tonight.

Mostly it's the same old people, though. I wave to some of my friends swimming in the pool before I ease my way into conversation with my buddies Julie &amp; Matt - making sure that I have a clear view of the door. Julie, naked and dripping wet from swimming, teases me about being so dressed up. I look down at my dark red, long-sleeved, button up shirt, gold silk tie, and gray slacks, and shrug. ""This isn't really dressed up for me..."" I left my jacket at the office, even.

Matt, also naked and just out of the pool, continues his story about the new paddle he's working on making. I half listen, still scanning the crowd and keeping an eye on the door -- and then I see ....... ?

------

I have a couple ideas for who you could be: A complete neophyte, attending your first party? A seasoned sub, new to town and checking out the local scene? A coworker (temp? intern? Maybe even boss?) from the accounting firm, just as shocked to find out about me as I am about you? I'd love to hear about your ideas, too! :)"

I loved reading through the comments and whatnot; the advice was not for me, but I always felt like there was something to learn.

Finally, I have been able to apply what I believe to be the right course of action to my own relationship.  My boyfriend and I shared the most amazing relationship that I've ever had.  I learned the value of communicating effectively, being patient, and trust (long distance relationships..can't constantly worry).  However, our future would be difficult.  It did not line up.  

He has an unpredictable future with a PhD in progress, and I am so stubbornly set on getting into medical school.  He told me early on that he wouldn't be able to handle the distance for too long, and I could not tell him for sure that I would be willing to drop my future for a few years to move to be with him.  He was also worried about finding someone..at 28, I guess he feels that his time is running out in finding a stable partner.  I could not commit to a future with him, although I would have loved getting married to him, starting a life and family together, traveling the world..  I have to do what is right for me, and he has to do what is right for him.

We'll be seeing each other in May for the last time.  We'll have a week together, and then we will end it.  I will leave for my summer internship, and that will probably be the last time I see him.  We may be friends in the future, but we both will need a lot of time to heal.  

I have nothing left but love for him.  It is a love that we will ride out for as long as we can, and then we'll remember fondly as life goes on.  

Thank you all for helping me be courageous enough to end things, instead of pretending like everything would be okay.  I know this is the right thing to do.  I am so excited for the future.. For me and him both.  I am going to be an awesome doctor and he is going to be an awesome scientist, and maybe we'll be great friends someday.  It hurts now, but it will be okay, won't it? 

Goodnight everyone :)

**tl;dr**: Finally decided that this relationship will have to end.  Told the boyfriend, will be seeing him for a final visit, and we will be ending things mutually and respectfully.  Thank you all for teaching me to be  a good person. "

I am a software engineer, recently out of school. I am now working at a game company. Outside of an internship at Microsoft this is my first industry job. 

I chose to work at a game company because I enjoy the work, but it came at the cost of *significantly* less competitive pay than a bigger company (MS, Amazon) would probably provide. I am good at what I do, and very passionate about it; I feel like getting a job at a bigger company wouldn't be much of a problem. But I found working at MS to be pretty boring, so I decided to give this a shot.

I was started at 65k/year in November. I figured this was alright because of my lack of professional experience. I could have probably gone to MS for ~90 starting, like several friends of mine. I assumed I'd be able to 'work my way up' at this job. During the hiring process the producer had mentioned raises and bonuses. No bonuses have happened yet. No mention of them either.

I should also probably mention that this company is growing, a lot, and isn't hurting for money in any way. So the low raise (which I'm getting to) isn't out of lack of resources.

Anyhow, I've been there for ~6 months. I work long hours, put in more effort than I should, and I'm doing good work. In the process of trying to 'work my way up', I have voluntarily taken on a larger workload than most members of the team. I don't mind this terribly, and assumed it would pay off eventually. I'm even tenatively scheduled to give a talk on some new tech I'm working on for them at an internal conference. I am the **sole owner** of several critical chunks of our project. 

The company does reviews and raises this time of year. I received a positive review.

So I got called in to this guy's office today to talk about raises. He said ""Unfortunately you haven't been here long enough to qualify for the full (1 year) raise. You started at 65 and the formula says you should get 65,800 now."" So, roughly a 1.2% raise. This is less than a cost of living raise (3-5%). It didn't really sink in, the lowness of this offer, until 10 minutes after I left his office.

Here's where I'm really confused: I don't qualify for another raise until next March. Why are they basing my raise off of how long I've been there? I'd be fine with this if I were up for another review in 6 or 9 months. If my quality of work was only 30% of what they expected, I guess I would understand. I'm not sure if they are just seeing what they can get away with, or what. But it definitely didn't make me feel very valued as an employee. Or am I just blowing it out of proportion?

There are a few things I feel pretty certain about:

* I am a valuable member of the team and they know that
* If I approach the situation properly, I can probably get them to 'raise' my raise.
* If I wanted to move to a job that I enjoyed less which would make me a lot more money, I probably could
* I would probably have less responsibility/stress at a higher paying job than the load I've taken on at my current job

So I guess my question is: does this raise seem low to you? How should I respond to the situation, if at all? Should I stay at this company when I potentially have more lucrative, less-stressful options? There is definitely something to be said for doing work you enjoy; but if you are paid less and working harder doing it, at what point does that nullify the argument?

Sorry for the wall of text."
23rczd,1,2014-04-23,My depression has taken a lot from me and I just need to sort this out. It's taking too long to come back.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/23rczd/my_depression_has_taken_a_lot_from_me_and_i_just/,"For the last year and a half, I've struggled with depression. There are good days and bad days. Some days I manage productivity, and that is nice. Other days I'm damn catatonic - I'll spend the entire day in bed, lie to others about why I can't come out or call in sick to school, *maybe* shower. It's a mindfuck and if I feel any emotion at all, it's anger with myself. 

But maybe that's improving. I can't quite tell. I know that last time I was drunk it didn't change my mood - perhaps that's the last month of antidepressants finally kicking in and medicating? Depression has taken so much, I'm not sure how well I can save what is left. I'm trying with counseling, meetings, medications, trying to follow advice, but it seems so far gone and so slow to return.

Much is lost. I'm not sure what to do about it. I seem to have misplaced:

My mind. 

- I can't manage my time. It's 5:00am and why the fuck am I not sleeping? School starts at 8:30. I won't be going until maybe 12:30 because the writeup I should have done already is due then with an hour of face to face. There's no way I'll be functional if I don't sleep through morning lectures.
- I can't concentrate. Nothing comes as easily as it used to. My memory faults on such simple things... I even half heartedly worry about brain degeneration. 
- Nothing is enjoyable. Why spend time with friends? Why care about my upcoming marriage (that I am doing most of the work for)? Why learn at school? Why play a video game or read a book? I still do these things... but it's path of least resistance far too often.

My body.

- I'm up 30 pounds. Tone is lost to me. I used to be a national athlete... suppose you can only coast on past fitness for a year or so. But how can I get that back when I can barely get to my car? It's just not a priority compared to so much else but I know it would help everything else flow easier.
- Sleep is so elusive. Losing it on the night side and the morning side, no semblance of a cycle sometimes. 

My spirit.

- Who am I and why have I changed?
- I've lied to those who care about me because I don't want them to worry. I've told the therapist about this and some know, and I won't change this habit.
- I used to enjoy my education so much. My career is still one of the few things I have love for but it's fading. I'm in a professional school at the moment, and for the first time failed a test. It was bound to happen eventually with no studying and missing so many lectures, but if I can't do what I love then what will I do? They've offered my test deferral, maybe a leave of absence. It'll decimate my professional career if I take a leave but unless I can improve, I'll have to.
- How many relationships have I soured? I haven't talked to my best man in over a month. I know he's wondering why I even asked him to do that by this point. I've gone weeks without talking to other friends and at least I live in the same city as them.
- My fiancee lives overseas on a internship for a while. Sometimes it hurts that she can't be here to support. Other times I'm incredibly glad she is gone, because she would see me like this. She might not still be with me if she really understood.

So, it is what it is. I've taken all the appropriate steps that someone is supposed to take. I have had a counselor for a few months. I've started medication this month - perhaps helped increase my baseline mood, but I'm not quite there with motivation to improve other habits. I've tried modifying my habits where I can. Mobile apps and calendars, checklists and reminders, accountability phone calls and rewards. 

So, it seems to be getting better very slowly in the last month. It's not quick enough. I've got finals in May, sensitive work in July, and a wedding at the end of August. 

I just needed to get that off my chest. Everyone is a fountain of hopefulness, and it just irritates me. Nobody in my real life understands this process, and I'm tired of catering to their feelings but know I need to if I want them around when I finally pull out of this. I do know I'll pull out of it, eventually, because the alternative is unacceptable."
23rlyb,1,2014-04-23,Second Interview. Tips?,[deleted],ITCareerQuestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/ITCareerQuestions/comments/23rlyb/second_interview_tips/,"I was recently called in for a business intelligence internship at a large company (my first internship ever). The job is a very general IT internship (based on the description) and the person I would be reporting to seems to be dealing with data warehousing and teradata based off of a little LinkedIn scouting. The first interview was a little shaky for me. I got my talking points across for the main behavioral questions but fumbled with a few things as I was quite nervous about getting interviewed by 3 people at once (2 IT managers and 1 HR).


Low and behold I got a call back and I'm not sure what to expect now. During my first interview, they inquired about my technical skills to which I only said I know how to use SQL and basic excel. Anything I can do to better prep for the second interview? (will be with one of IT managers from the first interview and another guy who works with teradata). I expect this will be a technical interview as my work, school and volunteer experience were highlighted in the first interview. However, given that this is my first technical interview, what should I expect? 

Thanks in advance!

EDIT: For anyone wondering or searching for future reference, the second interview was just to see if I knew my shit in SQL and what other technologies I knew. I got the internship :D"

It's paramount that I learn it for the work that I want to do. Anyway, it's not my first exposure to the program. I had limited experience with it when I was in film school and much more recently had a bit of practice with it during the internship I had this past fall. So, I guess my question is, coming from a guy that is fairly competent in FCP 7 and Adobe Premiere CC, what kind of learning curve can I expect for Avid MC 7? I heard it's much easier to learn Avid first then something like Premiere versus the other way around."

It's what I call non-incremental scrolling - that is, two-finger scrolling works on a pixel-per-pixel basis, instead of one mouse-wheel tick at a time.

I know the feature is implementable in principle, because I see it in certain controls in Ubuntu already. But it appears that only Mac OS X actually has it implemented in any way, shape, or form.

I've been meaning to submit this feature request directly to Mozilla (and I'd gladly spend a term at an internship trying to implement this very thing), but I have no idea where to put it."

23sbme,1,2014-04-23,[Personal/long] I need some help and perspective on transferring,[deleted],college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/23sbme/personallong_i_need_some_help_and_perspective_on/,"Hey guys. I'm having some trouble deciding my transfer path. Currently I'm a freshman in my spring quarter in a Top 50 school. I'm miserable here; the school is just a horrible fit for me. I won't get into details because they aren't very important but just understand that I'm not exaggerating when I say I'm miserable. I never wanted to go to this school in the first place, but I received a full scholarship and couldn't pass it up for my parents' financial sake. But since attending, I've spiraled into unbearable depression. It's pathetic really; I've attempted suicide once and was taken into psychiatric care. All of this made me feel crazy because everyone else in the school seems so happy. Although my personal problems definitely played a major part, I've concluded it's the environment that really triggers all my mental problems. (When I went away off campus during breaks, I was happy) I need to get out of here.

Anyway, all of these factors led to me staying in bed all day and missing a lot of class. My classes were not very difficult, but with my crippling depression I couldn't get myself to focus or study. I even ended up skipping a couple of my midterms because I couldn't gather the confidence to leave my dorm. My fall quarter I somehow managed to pull of a 3.6 but my condition exacerbated in Winter quarter where I got a 2.6. Now I'm standing at a horrible (for my standards) GPA of 3.1.

The only thing keeping me going is the idea that I won't be trapped here for long if I can transfer out, but my GPA is really beginning to destroy that hope. It doesn't seem like I can transfer into a university I'd be happy at anymore. I guess what is so frustrating is that I know my current GPA doesn't reflect my true capabilities, but there isn't much I can do to change it. 

Here is some background information.

High School:  
* 3.9 GPA  
* Graduated in the top 10  
* Fantastic EC's  
* Accepted to UC Berkeley, UCLA, UMichigan, Dartmouth, American University (the school I'm currently attending is not listed)  

College:  
* 3.1 GPA  
* Very minor EC's  
* Congressional internship at Capitol Hill (Probably the only thing I have going for me)  

I made the wrong choice with selecting the current school I'm attending, but at this point what can I do? Now, I wouldn't be accepted into any of the colleges I got into out of high school. Some other schools I'd (ideally) like to transfer to are USC, NYU, and Georgetown. 

Should I not even bother applying to schools of that caliber? 

Any type of honest advice is welcome, no matter how pessimistic it may sound. I'm completely lost. I had such high hopes for myself in high school and now it seems like I'll never be able to accomplish those dreams. The futility of becoming the person I dreamed to be is probably the strongest impetus of my suicidal thoughts. I guess I can't seem to find the point in living if I can't be happy with myself and proud of what I accomplished. I've considered taking a year off, but I think that will make me feel even worse about myself. Suicide just seems inevitable for me, but I really don't want it to be.

I'm sorry for posting such a heavy message, but I really don't know where else to go with this. Thanks everyone."

At my current job I was brought on as an intern  a year and a half ago and was paid $10/hr, not bad for an intern!

Then I graduated and they gave me many more responsibilities and had me doing sales work as well as support, while as an intern I only did blog posts and routine content creation for the company website.  As months passed I asked for a raise and was told no repeatedly, even though they changed my job title and bumped me to 40hrs/week and had me doing the same job as someone they fired who was making 50k/yr.

I was fed up and started searching for a job and got a great offer for a position at a great medical office.  I came in yesterday and told my boss of my offer and gave my 2 weeks notice.  He asked ""what can we do to make you to stay?"" ""you can't leave us!"" and I reiterated that I had accepted the  job offer and that it was an opportunity I could not pass up.

He then FLIPPED OUT!

He said ""so you are leaving us for some *doctor's office*?  He then told me I had ""wasted a shitload of his time"" and that he ""didn't respect me anymore"" and that this ""is not the way you leave a job"".  He told me he hoped I would learn how to leave a job with class in the future and that I should have given him a heads up months ago instead of ""being dishonest"" and applying for jobs behind his back.  He then told me that I would not be needed passed this Friday and is giving me the cold shoulder.

I am SHOCKED and am disappointed as I feel I was disrespected and that I DID do things the right way.  I have never heard of anyone ""giving their boss a heads up"" that they were looking for another job!

The problem is that next summer will then be the soonest I can get one. Will I be significantly further behind others in the field?

Nope.

My (employed) friends looked over my resume and said it looked fine. The lack of personal projects might be hurting me, even though I listed 2 big projects that are currently in progress.

I constantly hear about CS majors, especially in the Bay, being in such huge demand that you'll get a job no matter what. And there are so many people at my school who are getting internships left and right. But I think that's a load of bullshit, because there's so many of us who apply and either get rejected or never heard back from the company.

Anyway, I'm just ranting. I have 4 months of summer break, not taking any classes. I plan to code every day, all day, come up with some killer side projects that companies can't ignore, then try again in the Fall."

I have to choose on of these by next week:

-PHP developer in news analytics company, would pay pretty well but would require me to lease a car to get to work from where I'd be living

-Software Dev at nanotech startup, would pay pretty well and would probably involve creating databases and automation for the tests the engineers are running

-Part-time web application developer, pay is not very good and I would probably have time to take some classes at the same time

I'm conflicted. From a monetary standpoint, the part-time position seems like a terrible candidate, but at this point I'm much more concerned with building my skillset and resume in anticipation of the hunt for full-time employment next year, and a job where I am the lead developer on a project and can sink my teeth into angularjs or ruby on rails seems to be much more relevant than doing more PHP work or wrangling this weird science software. At the same time, the people from the nanotech startup seemed pretty cool and fun to work with. The PHP job would probably be the only place where I would be working collaboratively with other developers, but the hassle of needing a car is a major drawback.

First time poster here with another typical face-palm story. This is more programming support related than IT support, but hopefully it is still relevant for this sub.

I work for an engineering consulting company and we hire an intern every semester to help us with R&amp;D work. This means they're typically using Matlab to crunch numbers on some large datasets. We had one particular student who has never used Matlab before, but did take a C++ course. Since Matlab is essentially the bastard child of C++ and a calculator, we had faith that he could learn it.

Unfortunately for me, this meant I was the go-to person whenever the bad errors wouldn't go away. I try and practice the ""teach a man to fish"" philosophy, so when I was asked about one particular error, I sat down with him and went through it line-by-line.

Me: ""See here, this shows you which function called the error and it even tells you the exact line and a description of the problem.""

Him: ""Yeah, but I didn't make any mistakes so there shouldn't be an error.""

Me: ""Hmmm... it says here you have a 'Matrix Dimension Mismatch', that means you're operating on two matrices of different sizes. Let's take a look.""

I then proceed to click on the error itself, which brings me directly to the offending line of code.

Him: ""See, this matrix contains X data and this matrix contains Y data and I'm trying to compare them to each other.""

Me: ""Well, I'll show you the way I would troubleshoot this. First, let's to check the size of each of your matrices right before you do the comparison. This should give us an indication as to why they're different sizes.""

I proceed to insert a ""size(X)"" and a ""size(Y)"" before the offending line, run the code again, and get results: 14000x1 and 14000x0.

Me: ""It looks like you haven't actually assigned any values to Y, so that's why you can't compare it to something.""

23srad,6,2014-04-23,Delay graduation by a semester for a Fall or Spring internship? Or just finish out and graduate next May?,MrGorillaNoodles,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/23srad/delay_graduation_by_a_semester_for_a_fall_or/,"I'm set to graduate by May 2015, but I'm feeling like I might need some work experience to put myself in a better position.

This summer I'll be finishing up my ""junior"" year at a community college in a 3+1 program and in the fall I'll be entering the +1 portion. This fall semester will be the first iteration of the +1 portion of this program ever. While this local private university has produced CS graduates before, I'll be among only a handful or two of students that will be the first to graduate from their 3+1 program. It's an excellent way to save money on an education, as I'll have minimal debt, but I'm a little worried about the merit of a program that hasn't been done before. I can't be sure of job placement stats, if we'll have recruitment services, job fairs, etc.

I'm also a bit uneasy about how much I'll have accomplished by graduation. I just received my first exposure to programming last semester in a C++ course, and each semester here on out will be a crash course in CS and programming since I finished the brunt of my general education a couple years ago at a university I previously attended. For instance, this semester I'm taking 18 credit hours with Assembly, C#, Advanced C++, and a Windows Networking course. This summer I'll be taking Calculus, another Advanced C++ course, and a Data Structures/System Design course to finish out my ""junior"" year. It feels like it's all coming so fast that I don't know if I'll find a suitable niche in CS and be able to produce from that niche by graduation.

I've got some school projects from this semester that I could polish up and put on GitHub, and I'm either going to teach myself Objective-C and code an application/game or find an interesting implementation for C++ or C# that I'll enjoy coding into a project over the summer. However, I feel like I could use some mentoring since all but one of my CC professors are pretty out of touch outside academia. As a result, all of the programs I've coded, except a couple games, have been problems out of a text book.

With that said, would I benefit from delaying graduation by a semester for a Fall internship? Or should I just finish out school and rely on my school projects, prospective side projects, and whatever the level of merit a 3+1 program will provide?

Thank you guys for your time

**TL;DR:** Worried my 3+1 program won't hold much merit. Cramming all CS coursework into 2.5 years of school, little time has been available for side projects, only 2 semesters of programming experience including this spring."

23t7f4,2,2014-04-23,[Hiring] Sales Intern- Work Remotely,upperdaddy,internships,https://www.reddit.com/r/internships/comments/23t7f4/hiring_sales_intern_work_remotely/,"Have ever wondered what it would be like to own your own start-up tech company, or work with a start-up tech company? Here is a unique opportunity for you to see what working with a start-up software company is like. You will get a taste of the most important part of start-up life: sales.
 
You will learn a ton. You will be guided by an experienced sales manager who will coach you on best practices for generating software sales. You will use a combination of contacting targeted companies through phone, email and LinkedIn to reach decision makers. You will also directly witness how sales are closed and participate in closing sales calls with your manager. You may also have the opportunity to work on some media relations with your city's local newspapers and attend some local trade shows.

This is an incredible opportunity to learn about the specifics of sales within a start-up company without having to take substantial risk. The experience will also look excellent on a resume since you will be able to list the results of the work that you've performed. For example, ""Worked with potential clients through the entire sales cycle to close 18 deals, each worth at least $3,000 annually.""

There is no hourly or salary rate for this internship, but whenever allowed by Colleges and Universities, you will be paid a 10-20% commission on deals for which you are the primary contact. Your sales manager will help you close deals, and you will still receive the full 10% commission. Commissions are paid once the clients pay on a monthly basis at the 10% rate for up to 12 months as long as the client remains a customer.  (An example of a 10% commission on a 50-user license at $15/user:  50 x $15 x 10% commission = $75 paid to you per month as long as they're a paying customer up to 12 months. ($75/month x 12 months = $900 total at month 12.) As you can see from a typical deal size, there is significant potential for strong performers.

Here is our website:
www.BreadCrumbTracking.com

We provide software that allows managers of mobile work-forces (e.g. lawn cutters, personal support workers, air conditioner repair companies, etc.) to manage their mobile workers better. For example, at the start of the day a mobile worker can ""clock in"" to an app on his or her phone. When a new job comes up ""on the fly"" the job can be sent out from the manager's computer to the mobile worker's app, complete with all the job details. The mobile worker can then update the status of the job, communicate through notes with manager and send the manager or customer date and time-stamped pictures. At the end of the day, the mobile worker ""clocks out"" of the app for easy timekeeping. The manager no longer needs paper-based time sheets and can easily create hours worked reports for payroll. The manager can also see where the mobile worker has been throughout the day at-a-glance using our patent-pending communication tools. When mobile workers are ""clocked in"", a manager can view who is closest to enable better dispatching, saving time, gas and money.

Backstory: I have a bach in CS from a college so out-of-the-way some employers have actually thought I made it up. I graduated feeling weak in all aspects of software dev. GPA was just shy of 3.0, for those curious. 

My resume didn't look so great, either, because I (a) have no internships or other forms of experience and (b) no GitHub projects because I recently took down inferior code. Which was all of it.

So I've been working for the past 3/4 months to shore up weak spots and also submitting resumes just so I can gage my progress. I never expected to get the amount of responses I have (about 1 for every 12 apps, which isn't bad for a weak candidate), nor did I expect I'd do as decently as I have on interviews. In tech interviews, I have rarely solved a problem on my own, but often get it with a few hints from the interviewer and am at least able to communicate that there's *some* thought process going on. 

All this in consideration, you can imagine how gobsmacked I was when I got an offer for employment as a junior (0 - 2 yrs exp) RoR dev at a good-sized company. It's a decent offer for my area: 55K/yr, good health benefits, opportunities to work from home 1 - 3 times a week, etc. I'm not even sure how I got past my tech interview, because I did terribly on the brainteaser/logic puzzle stuff. The interviewer was able to talk me through the puzzles, but I didn't get the answers to any of them except one. I didn't do so great on the tech questions, either. I froze up on the BST questions and had to be walked through one of the linked list challenges. Did OK on most of the Ruby or RoR type questions. 

On the one hand, I really, really, *really* want this job. I feel like I could do it, so long as I keep studying during my free time.

On the other hand, I'm not sure I'm ready. It's easy to talk game. It's easy when somebody's there to hold your hand. It's not so easy when you're on your own.

I'm beginning to panic so hard I can't look at this objectively anymore. What do you guys think? Pass it up and do shitwork for a little while longer, take the risk, or what?"

It's been great, the work environment is fantastic and I've learned so much. I don't have a university degree, so I'm hoping I can use experience in lieu of credentials in the workforce, which is quite common and even preferred by some small business employers where I am (Canada).


I'm quite experienced with web development and programming in general, having worked with REST APIs, Unix, Front end development, databases, shell scripting, QA, writing page scrapers, agile processes, software/hardware integration, etc. Basically a well rounded intermediate level of knowledge, and I'm coding for 10+ hours daily, working on side projects on github, am working on open source projects and constantly gaining experience.

The issue is, I still live with my parents and they pay for almost everything of mine. I hate the dependance, living with them is making my life miserable, and I need to start earning my own money to move out, but it's difficult in my current situation.

Bottom line is I need to know how much experience I should have before looking into a paid full time job, and how much I should expect to make without a degree.

23tgxe,1,2014-04-23,I lied about my education and now everything is horrible.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/23tgxe/i_lied_about_my_education_and_now_everything_is/,"TL;DR
I lied about my education for a really long time, and now I want to come clean, but in the process I'll embarrass the CEO of the company and the entire team.

Senior year of college was rough for me. After returning from five moths abroad, I hit a bad spot and fell into a deep depression. I lost a lot of my friends, slacked off in classes, and smoked too much weed. My motivation for learning left and with it, any care for my future. I failed my senior capstone class. 

Second semester was no better. I called out sick to my internship a lot more than in the fall, skipped classes more than i should have, and never found the willpower to make up the work that my capstone professor was nice enough to let me do. I still walked at graduation, thinking that with all my free time over the summer, I could (with my professor's blessing) get my thesis done and still earn my diploma. 

Summer came and went. No one in my life knew that I hadn't graduated. My parents had bought me graduation gifts, my friends and I shot the shit about wanting to be back in school instead of looking for jobs, and I even dated girls with them thinking that I was a college grad. Meanwhile, I was working at the local hospital doing janitorial work to pass the time while I ""figured things out."" 

A friend of mine mentioned that there was an opening at her pr firm for an intern so I jumped on it. It was a small shop, so I knew there wouldn't be a background check. I was hired and I've been there for almost five months. I was offered a full time position with a competitive salary last week. I didn't know what else to do so I accepted.

Now, as part of the legal process, there is a background check. I'm fucked, quite clearly, as they use a company to do it for them. I'll be found out, fired, and ruined. 

I've been dating a girl for three months who I've really come to admire and care about. I'm going to tell her tomorrow morning. Hopefully I'll have the courage to tell my boss as well. It's better to hear it from me than someone else.

The crazy part is, on the bus ride home I was jotting down notes on my phone for a letter I'd write to my CEO tonight. It would be more or less a ""here is the truth, do what you may"" letter. When I got home, I checked my email and found an email from the CEO of the company congratulating me on my promotion *to the entire executive staff of the corporation.* Now I'm getting congratulatory emails from executive VPs and presidents of our sister companies (we share space so I see them all the time) on my progress. 

Do I tell the CEO anyway? She'll obviously be pissed, but I don't see any other way to salvage any shred of self respect other than this."

I would love some advice!

Anyway, here's the setup, 8 weeks of travel to teach week-long summer camp programs to high school students. There will be a supervisor along with around 7 interns at each camp. Each intern will get around 5 kids at each camp to lead directly and watch to make sure everyone's safe. Students will be staying in what are essentially dorms as well as the interns. But there will essentially be 24/7 interaction while at the camps.

Here are the potential problems:

1. Everyone in the program is going to be competing for a job with this company and while I want to maintain friendly and working relations with everyone, I also need to standout from pack. I also want to avoid being sucked into potential drama of the other interns.

2. I'm not entirely sure how to interact with who will be my boss. The boss is the person I want to impress but I want to make sure that my interactions with him come off as genuine as opposed to simply wanting a job. How do I work on building a relationship while performing my responsibilities to the best of my ability?

Are there any other points I should go into further detail on?

I'm open to other suggestions and ideas but the two points I listed are what I'm most curious about. Thanks in advanced for the feedback"

I studied my ass of in high school and I got into UC Berkeley.  I was so happy with the way it turned out that I thought I'd study something I loved: Political Science.

While I was a student, I got a job working for the university since I didn't qualify for financial aid.  It didn't pay great, but it was enough to reduce my debt.

During the summers, I lived at home and worked for three different internships that were related to my field.  During my time at Cal, I learned Spanish, joined a fraternity, and wrote a few online blogs. 

Now, I'm about to graduate.  And I can't get a fucking job.

I went to one of the best goddamn schools in the country, I'm bilingual, I've worked three internships and nobody will even give my resume a second glance.  

On top of that, I go to fucking Berkeley, so I'm surrounded by computer engineers who are about to make six figures out of college.  

Meanwhile, I'm five figures in debt, without a safety net or a job. 

Now I'm probably gonna end up as a goddamn waiter, surrounded by people who are going to assume I'm some big fuck up when I busted my ass to get a degree.  

I can't BELIEVE how i can't get an employer to take even a second glance at my resume.  If I had sat in my room and smoked weed for four years, I'd still have the same fucking career prospects before me. 

It occurs to me that, of all the people who told me to study something I cared about, none of them had gone to college in the last ten years.  

So if you're about to start school...

Study something impossibly hard like computer science.  Don't take an easy major no matter how much you care about it.  

If you flunk out of the impossibly tough major....

Don't get a job in college.  Get an unpaid internship in your related field.  You'll work fewer hours and employers will actually give a shit about it come job interview time.  My GPA was a 3.5 because I worked full time as a student and now I have to compete with people with 4.0s.  Just take the debt and worry about it later.

TL;DR: What the fuck did I just spend the last four years of my life doing?  All I have is debt, a fancy degree from UC Berkeley, and no fucking job."

Although I look into studying computer science, I actually didn't grow up having this vision, and thus am very limited in my knowledge about the usual paths for kids that have always been interested in CS.

As of now, I thought it would be nice if I learn how to code a whole website by myself. I know that there are tons of materials out there online on HTML/CSS; however, I thought it would be nice if I can actually take a class on such topic, being supervised by someone. (Yep, I procrastinate a ton if I'm left to work by myself.) 

But apparently learning HTML/CSS isn't in the usual curriculum at engineering schools/for CS majors? For my school, all engineers start off the first year with an intro programming class; then CS people move on to higher level Data Structure stuff, and then onto all the branches of CS. I do not believe HTML/CSS fit in anywhere.

So I was wondering if CS people actually ever learn HTML/CSS? If you guys do, how? 

And just as a side note, what would be a useful summer activity for me? Some other class? Internship?"

[Do your parents just basically up and say, ""Hey kids we're going to ___ next year!"" or is there some kind of communal decision process? Also how far in advance are these trips planned?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23t20n/iama_seventeenyearold_who_has_been_to_every/ch0b23o?context=5)|Here's a couple of examples: -3 months ago ""Hey shutterpunts, we're going to the southern coast of Spain in July!"" ""But dad, I wanted to get a summer job."" ""Oh, that reminds me, I tried to get you a summer job in China, and I was going to ship you off to a city where you are going to have to learn Chinese quickly or get fired. Unfortunately, China passed a new law saying I can't. Bummer, right?"" ""yeah...""
 |Or another example: ""Okay, it's official! We're going to Rwanda next summer to track Gorillas! We have to go soon, there's only about a thousand of these suckers left!"" ""But dad, isn't Rwanda dangerous?"" ""Yeah, that's why they wouldn't let me book it until you were eighteen!""
 |Edit: just in case it wasn't clear, we are tracking down gorillas to take pictures of them, not hunt them. I am very much against hunting endangered species, and against sport hunting in general.
[So what is your parent's fascination with traveling to different continents? And do you enjoy it doing it so often.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23t20n/iama_seventeenyearold_who_has_been_to_every/ch0b8nl?context=5)|Well for my mom, she has always been dead-set on making sure her children were very open-minded and cultured. Always showed us how the other side lives, and where we regularly saw practicing Muslims, Buddhists, Jews, Catholics, you name it. As for my dad, he's always been young at heart. He wants to go everywhere and do everything, probably so he can brag about it on his epitaph. Just the other day he said, ""You know what? I was talking to [insert business friend] the other day and he said Cambodia is beautiful in spring, and Angkor Wat is on my bucket-list!""
 |Edit: forgot it was a two-part question. While I certainly do love having traveled to all these places, nowadays I would like to spend my college summers either at a job or studying abroad, which is a different type of travelling altogether.
[*mom, she has always been dead-set on making sure her children were very open-minded and cultured.

[That's amazing, I'm about the same age, and the only other country I've been to is Canada (I live in America\). So you're still in high school; how does all the traveling affect you? Do you take classes in other countries when not at home? Online classes? Homeschooled? Or...? Also, have you ever gotten lost from your tour guide or whatever?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23t20n/iama_seventeenyearold_who_has_been_to_every/ch0b7ik?context=5)|The traveling doesn't affect my schoolwork, all this traveling is done on summer breaks, Christmases, Thanksgivings, and New Years. I go to school just like your average teenager. It has affected my cultural outlook, and my interest in languages. Also, I have been distracted by some shiny objects at a Turkish Bazaar once. This was not long after the US Embassy bombings in Istanbul, so my parents had a heart-attack for about a minute or two.

My parents have never wanted my sister nor I to know much at all of what any of these trips cost or how much of a dent it put in their finances, but I could only guess. Great parenting, if you ask me. I'm always very grateful to have done the things I have.
[What are their occupations?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23t20n/iama_seventeenyearold_who_has_been_to_every/ch0atly?context=5)|My mom is a farmer, and my dad is an engineer.

Mostly mushrooms, also some fruit trees. Not really anything big, just a lovely little place for my mom to practice her values of being eco-friendly. She got a degree in sustainable architecture and believes everything should be natural and organic. Not my cup of tea, but it makes her happy.

[Why do u think their lying though.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23t20n/iama_seventeenyearold_who_has_been_to_every/ch0lssf?context=5)|But here's the thing: if they are lying, then perhaps they learn a lesson in humility. If they aren't lying, then we just bonded over a shared, unique interest. So if someone claims to have been to, say, Positano (my favorite italian city), I might as well ask them if they won a prize at the shooting stall in the city (trick question, no matter what you do the nice old man will give you a stuffed animal and a cheap bottle of limoncello).

All I can say is this: I wasn't standing on Antarctica for more than a few hours before returning to the boat.
[So you peed on antarctica? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23t20n/iama_seventeenyearold_who_has_been_to_every/ch0b5pd?context=5)|Nah, I had to hold it in. Antarctica actually has very strict bio-security measures. Had to wash all our clothing before getting on and off the ship. Not allowed to track foreign seeds or microbes on your boots or clothes, blah blah blah.
[That's pretty amazing.  The tempting question for most will probably be to ask is how did you afford to accomplish this, but frankly, I don't care.  I am more interested in what you have learned on your travels?  What have you taken away from seeing the world at such a young age?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23t20n/iama_seventeenyearold_who_has_been_to_every/ch0aqvv?context=5)|Well, one thing I've learned that a lot of people may say about a child's innocence being shattered by the cruelty of reality, especially in third-world countries where you'll get mugged and kidnapped right off the bat. But really, I think that's hogwash. A lot of times, some Turkish dude just genuinely wants to help the lost little white child find his parents.
[Anything else?  I'd like to hear what makes your experience unique from other rich kids (no offense meant, just being honest\).  Edit: wording, not here to offend OP.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23t20n/iama_seventeenyearold_who_has_been_to_every/ch0b31a?context=5)|Well, I know of some spoiled brats who are whisked off to Peru on daddy's private jet (I'm fine with flying coach, help my parents out however I can), only to sit in their hotel room, and watch 16 and pregnant. But of course, since we are in the sacred valley of Peru, they had to bring their own flat screen, satellite uplink, and DirecTV box with them. I mean, are you serious?! Get out there, the museums are incredible, the history is breathtaking, and you find some of the best food in these hole-in-the-wall cafes while running around town from monument to monument.
[I came to ask how Antarctica was, but you were there too. Damn.  I'll ask anyway, how was Antarctica? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23t20n/iama_seventeenyearold_who_has_been_to_every/ch0aos4?context=5)|Well even in summer it was cold (I had to take that picture quick), and one thing they don't tell you in Frozen Planet is that the whole continent smells absolutely awful. You can smell the penguin and seal dung from a mile away. But other than that, it was breathtakingly beautiful.
[Why so much hate for this kid? I don't understand.  Are you going to try to visit every country eventually? a week or so in each seems to be a very limited amount of time, even for a city with lots of history.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23t20n/iama_seventeenyearold_who_has_been_to_every/ch0lbnf?context=5)|Well like I said in another comment, I want to study abroad in college, the only reason I haven't spent more than a week or so in these destinations is because of my age and because they're usually during school holidays. And I think visiting every country is a tall order. I know someone who has done it, and it didn't seem easy. I think I'll just keep travelling to places I haven't been, and maybe someday I will have been to every country.
[How long do your trips usually last and what kinds of things have you been able to do?  Do you keep a travel blog?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23t20n/iama_seventeenyearold_who_has_been_to_every/ch0bckz?context=5)|The trips are usually a week to ten days, sometimes two weeks. I have done quite a lot of museum tours, and that's the bulk of it. However, I have gone parasailing in Bora Bora and Mexico, and Jet-skiing in Costa Rica. Unfortunately, I do not keep a travel blog.
[*The trips are usually a week to ten days, sometimes two weeks.*  That barely qualifies as traveling. It's really more like a vacation.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23t20n/iama_seventeenyearold_who_has_been_to_every/ch0cqxa?context=5)|Basically, these are vacations. When I no longer have obligations for school or a summer job, then I will travel for longer or study abroad, I guarantee it.
[Do you believe it put you on the fast track through that rough patch that holds onto your early life?

I still have that same old, ""With these grades you're never going to college"" talk with my dad, after which I rub my acceptance letter in his face. But I've actually never been a douchey teenager. I know a lot of kids that pick on foreign exchange students and get into shenanigans with the local police. I'm not one of them.

No, my dad has a firm resolution to let me pass or fail on my own merits. I've waded through my fair share of rejection letters.

[Ugh, pure jealousy on this thread. It's not an attractive trait people. What was your favourite country OP? What did you think of Ireland and where abouts did you go there?

Everything there is ridiculously cool, from the museums to the vending machines. I thought Ireland was very beautiful and deserving of the title ""Emerald Isle,"" but I also wish I could have toured more castles. I guess I'd have to say my weirdest experience in any country would have to be when I was in Japan, I went to a flea market, and this really old man with barely any teeth (and didn't understand a word of English) poked my shoulder, pointed at a penis statue for sale, and then started laughing uncontrollably. I laughed with him. I guess penis sculpture is the universal symbol for humor?
[Why did you go to Antarctica twice in two months?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23t20n/iama_seventeenyearold_who_has_been_to_every/ch0fwrd?context=5)|Actually, it was right before and right after new years.
 |Edit: I'm sorry, someone pointed out that I didn't really answer the question: The ship I was on stopped in Antarctica right before New Years, then went to the Island of South Georgia (which has the largest King Penguin colony), then went to the Antarctic Peninsula again after New Years before heading back to Argentina.
[This is one interesting AMA. Thanks for sharing your travels with us. With all the travels you have made, are you willing, if ever, to travel to space?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23t20n/iama_seventeenyearold_who_has_been_to_every/ch0e2qy?context=5)|Actually, I'm glad you mentioned it. My mom told me that apparently she was trying to convince my dad to buy me a ticket to space for my 25th birthday. Why my 25th? According to her, ""Because 25 is an age at which, should something go horribly wrong, you still lived a full life before dying horrifically.""

 |Africa: We met a friend in Kenya named Taul. I hope he's doing well. Big sweetheart.
 |Asia: My friend Riku. Extremely creative, really funny.

However, if I had to pick a place to retire, there's a small town called Positano on italy's Amalfi coast that would gain one more resident. The place that I most want to go right now is Japan. I've been there before, and I love it. Plus, I have a close friend who lives there, and I'd like to see him more often.
[As an avid photographer, I'd kill for those opportunities. Were you inspired in any artistic/spiritual way at any or all of these trips to influence your career choices?

However, a lot of these trips did become inspirations for some of my poetry. I'm awaiting response from a publisher. And as for career choice, I had a summer job at SpaceX and I loved it. I definitely want to work in the Aerospace Industry.

Can you explain a bit about it?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23t20n/iama_seventeenyearold_who_has_been_to_every/ch1b9uk?context=5)|Well my dad asked his friend at SpaceX to give me a job, and his friend said absolutely not, they don't hire highschoolers. My dad asked if I could at least be given a chance, and he said fine, we'll put him through the same interview as everyone else. No promises. So I went through the phone screening and the technical interview, which was perhaps the hardest thing in my life, and three weeks later I got a call with an official offer. I'm glad I aced AP Computer Science, otherwise I never would have made it through the interview. 
[Wow. Thats super cool. I am 16, so just under you. That is such an amazing experience! May I ask where you actually worked?

Also, what did you think of Europe?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23t20n/iama_seventeenyearold_who_has_been_to_every/ch15vue?context=5)|As far as different goes, definitely Asia. Particularly in Japan, which I find the most interesting, everything is VERY different. For example, in Japan it is impolite to show your teeth, and that includes while laughing. So people generally don't laugh out loud, they just do a close-mouthed chuckle. As for Europe, I want to retire in Italy someday. The entire continent is absolutely beautiful, and the food is divine.
[Have you been to Brazil yet? If not, I highly recommend it.

[What's it like being that privileged? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23t20n/iama_seventeenyearold_who_has_been_to_every/ch0k6fg?context=5)|For the most part, I feel an overwhelming sense of gratitude for my dad's hard work. When I was little, we were just a middle-class family. All of this was the result of my dad working hard and getting the promotion he deserved. On the other hand, I feel out of touch with a lot of people, and I find myself frequently wishing that many others have seen the amazing things that I have.

23u9a9,18,2014-04-24,My true ghost story,tharr7,Paranormal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/23u9a9/my_true_ghost_story/,"This my ghost story – this happened to me in 2001.

I was an intern for a theatre in Glendale that used to be a mason temple, it was 7 stories, with a lower level that used to be a restaurant night club in the 1930’s. It had gutted restaurant seats. The second floor used to be an old movie room.  On the bottom level, was a prop cage that the theatre had built, that contained thousands of props – like tea sets, spoons, and stuff since a classical theatre company ran the theatre and they performed Shakespeare, Moliere, and Dickens. 

One night I was working late with the tech director, in a room adjacent to the prop cage, right by the staircase that led up to the main room of the theatre. I heard props moving. It sounded like cups were knocking each other, or clinking, like they were rolling on the floor. The tech director went to investigate and saw nothing – when he left the room, I heard footsteps coming down the stairs, although the theatre was empty. 

The tech director returned, and we checked the stairs but nobody was there. I told him I thought it was a ghost, and he laughed, and said, there was no such thing as ghosts – when suddenly we both heard LOUD footsteps stomping down the stairs – crazy loud, and very threatening. We looked at each other in the eyes, and then something truly weird happened, that I will never forget, someone stomped on the floor above us, and scratched the side of the walls, but inside of the walls, as if they were scratching the pipes, and then we heard a long bong noise, as if someone had flicked a door stopper, almost cartoon like – BONG, all at the same time. The tech director and I stared at each other, in shock, and then we got the fuck out.

We couldn't believe what happened, we'd heard stories about footsteps, and other actors seeing ghosts, but this was truly bizarre. What kind of ghost stomps on the ceiling, scratches the pipe in the walls, and makes a loud bong noise? The bong noise sounded like a rubber stopper being flicked - like a sound effect you might hear in a cartoon. 

We had to return a few days later to finish working, and the moment we were alone in there, it started stomping in the room above, but more like someone was walking around, although the theatre was empty again, since it was Christmas break, and no one was in the theatre, we used keys to let ourselves inside. And then, the tech director called to it again, making fun of it, like he had done before, when suddenly I felt fear- from the ghost, or whatever that thing was that was in the room with us – it was afraid. I don't know why I felt that it was afraid, but somehow I knew that it was. I smelled fear coming from it, as if it was scared of us! It scratched the walls again, but I knew that it was the one, scared. We left again, because even though I knew it was scared, I was terrified and didn’t want to hang around in a haunted old mason church. 

Months later, a group of us closed the theatre after a show on the third floor. We turned off all the lights, and locked the doors. We stood outside talking about our show, when we heard books dropping on the second floor. We were standing under the window of the second floor, and we ALL heard large books being dropped – an entire group of people of heard it. 

That was my last encounter with the ghosts in that building, although I heard other stories from the actors there. 

One actress told me that she locked up one night and heard a bell ringing in another room, and she quietly walked down the stairs from the third floor to the main floor, with the bell noise getting louder and louder, until it was ringing right behind her ear- but no one was there. She turned around and yelled at the ghost to stop scaring her on the main floor and ran out. She won't be alone in the building ever and told us that she had seen hangers fly across the room in the middle of stage performance, and that two other actors were standing with her, in the wings waiting to go on, when they all saw hangers from the costume rack fly across the room.

She and another actor claimed to have seen an old man ghost during stage performances, suddenly materialize on stage, or in the wings – but no one in the audience could see him. An actor said he exited a scene, and had to walk through this ghost, and when he returned to the stage, he was white, cause he was terrified.

Well, I never saw a ghost, but I heard one. When my internship was over, I never returned to the theatre, but I saw the technical director many years later, who eventually quit. He said that when he worked late building sets, he would hear his tools moving, or if he was sawing wood, he would hear something moving in another room, and when he would inspect, nothing would be there. He quit eventually. I don't blame him.

I’m not sure if I believe in ‘ghosts’ but I still can't explain what happened to the technical director and me that night. No one was in the building. And if there was, how could one person stomp down the stairs, then stomp on the ceiling, scratch the pipes alongside the walls, the side walls, mind you, and make a large spring go, BONG?


Super weird stuff. I dunno.

23uf3y,11,2014-04-24,Want to make the most of your summer? Try MOOCs.,Ktk_,EngineeringStudents,https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringStudents/comments/23uf3y/want_to_make_the_most_of_your_summer_try_moocs/,"MOOC: Massively Open Online Course. These have been getting popular these days. KhanAcademy and MIT OCW might be good examples. But for structured courses, check out Coursera and EDX. 

Like MIT OCW, we get professors from top universities giving video lectures for free. The courses are fairly widespread too. We aren't talking Algebra I here, we're looking at ALGORITHMS, OCHEM, SIGNAL PROCESSING, you get the idea. Serious business courses from big name schools.
https://www.coursera.org/courses
https://www.edx.org/course-list

While these are unreasonable to handle on a full engineering + work + EC + research load (Been there, it sucks)... Summer is the perfect time to try one of these out. Maybe you couldn't take that one class because of a conflict. 

For most courses, you get the same passing certificate whether you get a 70% or a 90%, so no stress either, really. Pass/Fail for most of these, though some provide distinguishments, and some have ""verified certification"" which means you pay, but by no means is that required. I mean there's no Coursera-GPA that I know of. 

On your resume, taking MOOC courses can show that you have a real interest in the field. If you have an internship, great. That's from 9-5. These courses take from 5 to 10 hours a week... But you're an engineering student, so let's shave that by 15% or so, shall we? ;)

I don't see either of those listed as RESOURCES on the sidebar on this forum. Probably because the most of the courses are actually based on a timeline, though some are reference courses (Coursera has a Database course by Stanford that's self-study material, no certification - I still found it tremendously helpful)

Ofc, I'm sure many people in engineering have heard of MOOCs recently, but for those who don't... Now you know. Go and learn stuff!"

2. BVerfG: Keine Hausdurchsuchung beim Justitiar mit Prokura, der seinen Job macht

 

Das Bundesverfassungsgericht (BVerfG) hat entschieden, dass die Hausdurchsuchung bei einem Justitiar rechtswidrig ist. Der Justitiar hatte aus der Presse von staatsanwaltlichen Ermittlungen im Umfeld seines Unternehmens erfahren und die Fälle intern aufgearbeitet sowie „Vorzeigefälle für die Staatsanwaltschaft“ vorbereitet. Das Gericht betonte, dass der Verdacht einer Straftat weder aus der Stellung eines Justitiars als Prokurist folge noch daraus, dass er an der unternehmensinternen Aufklärung einer Straftat mitgewirkt habe. Die Durchsuchung setze einen Verdacht bereits voraus und dürfe nicht erst der Ermittlung verdachtsbegründender Tatsachen dienen. Das Anwaltsblatt veröffentlicht die Entscheidung im Mai-Heft (AnwBl 2014, 446).

3. EU-Grundrechtecharta: Europäische „Bill of Rights“?

 

Eines Tages sollen sich alle EU-Bürger direkt auf die EU-Grundrechtecharta berufen können – auch wenn der derzeit nach Art. 51 der Charta noch erforderliche Bezug zum Unionsrecht fehlt. Dies sind die Vorstellungen von Justizkommissarin Reding, die am 14. April 2014 den Bericht 2013 über die Anwendung der Grundrechtecharta der EU COM(2014) 224 vorstellte. Das EuGH-Urteil C-617/10 in der Sache „Fransson“ (s. EiÜ 09/2013) sowie das Urteil des österreichischen Verfassungsgerichtshofs aus dem Jahr 2012, das den Verfassungsrang der Charta feststellt, seien bereits gute Entwicklungen auf dem Weg zu einer europäischen „Bill of Rights“. Laut Bericht stützt der EuGH Entscheidungen zunehmend auf die Charta, nationale Gerichte ersuchen zunehmend um ihre Auslegung. Die Kommission berücksichtigt die Charta bei der Erarbeitung von Legislativvorschlägen unter Anwendung einer „Grundrechts-Checkliste“ – als Beispiel nennt der Bericht den vom DAV ausdrücklich begrüßten Schutz des Anwaltsgeheimnisses in der 4. Geldwäscherichtlinie (vgl. DAV‑Stellungnahme Nr. 57/2013).

Questions|Answers
:--|:--
[What's the most dangerous situation you've been in while working?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0i1pr?context=5)|Almost got used as a getaway driver, at 5 AM. Dude was approaching my car which was occupied with a large kitchen knife hidden behind his back. I saw the knife (got pretty frightened), made a left at a red light and saw about 10 squad cars parked on that block with their lights on. Scariest thing I've experienced. 
[Now that NYC cabs accept credit/debt card, which form of payment is better for the driver? Should I pay my fare by credit card and leave a cash tip or also add the tip the card charge. What would be a good tip?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0ijwc?context=5)|To me it doesn't matter because I drive a garage car and I just get all my money at the end of the day. However, I think people who own and operate a weekly medallion prefer cash because they don't get their credit card balance till the end of the week. Just ask the cabbie, we all have our preferences. I prefer credit.
[Ever drive any celebrities? Accept any crazy forms of payment? (Cash or stash, bjs etc? \)](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0hvck?context=5)|I once dropped off an academy award winning director on the upper east side. Didn't even know who he was until the next passenger told me so (who was apparently the directors architect). Sorry, but I forgot his name, the dude looked like he was in his late 70's or 80's.
[Answer his other question too haha.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0k60h?context=5)|Haha, sorry but I can't be answering questions that might get me in trouble. 
[What do you think about McDonald's changing the numbers of their food? Ive been in the same situation 3 different times where I try to order mcnuggets and I get some kind of ground beef sandwich. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0ibsr?context=5)|Haha, I don't go to McDonalds enough to notice a difference. I don't recommend you do either!
[Any weird passenger stories?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0jlez?context=5)|Not weird, but this dude pissed me off so I'l tell this story. Basically I just started my shift and I see a lot of cabbies passing by this black guy. So I'm like, you know what, I'm not gonna be like a typical cabbie and not pick a black guy (I'm all for equality). So I stopped by to pick him up. The dude wants to go to Brooklyn, so I'm omw. So he starts to tell me that he had to call his uncle who will meet me there to help pay his fare. He wanted to use my phone. I felt a little sketchy but I let hi use it and tells me his uncle will be there when I arrive and will pay me and gives my phone back... I get to the destination and his uncle is nowhere to be seen.  He uses my phone and calls his uncle again and again and it's the same story, he'll be here any minute now. So About 45 mins. pass and I'm just annoyed so I tell the dude to leave after he calls his uncle for like the 5th time. So I'm like alirght, you don't gotta pay me just leave. So he's sitting in my back seat holding onto my phone looking at it all thugish with his doo-rag and all, looking like he's thinking about stealing my phone. So I'm like, hey man gimmie my phone, don't even think about it. He's just setting there looking at it... After a minute or two, he hands me my phone says ""aight"" and leaves. I was pretty new during that time, but I was pretty let down by that. And I kind of understand why a lot of black  people are not picked up by cabbies. But I kind of understood the cabbie mentality that night.
[Damn that sucks. What do you do now when you see similar guys looking for a ride? Wouldn't blame you if you decided to avoid sketchy looking people.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0z86e?context=5)|I'd ask what's up before I unlock my door.
[How do you feel about Uber's services, including UberX and other ridesharing companies in NYC and beyond? Or is that not of your concern since you are young and a student and you probably are not going to be a career cabbie?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0iq2p?context=5)|I'm actually an uber driver as well. I like uber, it helps me make extra money. I think it's useful and safe as well as forward thinking. Why not utilize technology that makes our lives easier? It doesn't hurt the cabbie, if anything it helps us. I feel like drivers who use uber make more a little more money, especially at down time. Every driver should have uber but being that cabbies are mostly foreign, I feel like a lot of them don't know about it or don't want to learn about it. Uber doesn't really change the game too much, basically instead of calling a car service, you're just tapping one on your smart phone.
[Do you have a phd? I read that a portion of taxi men in NYC have them.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0i2g7?context=5)|No, I'm an undergrad student working on a computer science degree. I do meet a of cabbies who have lots of degrees but drive cab because of circumstantial situations in their life.
[In NYC you can make better money working part time as a Software Engineer intern -- if you are any good at programming.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch1bs31?context=5)|Not at that level yet.
[You'd be surprised how little you need to know to get a job in software that pays better than a cab driver. I am not saying 6 figures, but in the 40's or 50's possibly. Getting that experience early is what will help propel you into the 6 figure job offer after graduation.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch2mger?context=5)|Do you any suggestions as to paces I can look for work?
[Have you ever been in a cabbie battle?  I was an 18 year old student in DC heading to Georgetown on a quiet weeknight around 10pm.  All of a sudden my cab, that I am a paying customer in, doesn't like the other cab that just passes by.  We are driving through fairly residential areas but down a main street.  They decide to do, what I can only describe as ""battle dancing"" with their Detroit's finest high mileage former police cars.  It was pure insanity. He was swearing in some foreign tongue and driving as close as he could on the other guys ass and then getting even more pissed when the guy in front slams on his breaks.  They kept swerving faster and pretending they were going to hit each other.  They kept speeding up to 50 mph and then slamming hard, almost hitting each other at least three times. I nearly wet myself and barely had enough lung capacity to yell at him as it was hard to take in a deep breath. It eventually ended with a good flip of the bird and the other guy turning left quickly.  Why?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0kb1p?context=5)|Hahahaha, sounds epic! I have no idea why though. 
[How hard is it to become a driver, and what is the pay like?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0ibc5?context=5)|It's not very hard if you know the city well, city as in Manhattan. It's a basic 50 question multiple choice test. The pay is about $200 per shift, but it varies a lot, more or less.
[Do a portion of your earnings go to the cab company, or do you pay some sort of daily/weekly/monthly fee for using the car?  Who pays for the gas?  What if you were to be involved in an accident?  Do you have a ""favorite"" NYC location ie a club, bar, or restaurant that generates more profit than other locations?  Who's the weirdest, strangest, or funniest passenger you've experienced?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0jwmd?context=5)|I pay a daily lease fee every time I do shift. It's about 120$ but can be more depending on the day/shift. I pay for the gas as well. I am responsible for any accidents or damages. I like to work on the lower west side the most. And Williamsburg if I'm outside of Manhattan. I've had lots of passengers that are memorable, read through the AMA, I shared some stories.
[The end. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0jwmd?context=5)|EDIT: I forgot to add that you can also lease it weekly and it costs less but you are always responsible for that amount regardless of whether you work or not.
[Real question. Whats the craziest shit out of any cab driver story that you've heard?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0jaz7?context=5)|Cabbies dying in accidents. This one guy in my garage got into an accident and refused to go to the hospital to get checked cuz he felt fine. Next day, he collapsed on the train and died (internal bleeding). Crazy stuff!
[Why did you decide to become a taxi driver? Were you inspired by R. De Niro?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0i3kg?context=5)|I just wanted to learn the city and earn a little extra cash to support myself. Ironically, I've never even seen that movie. Maybe one of these days. Also, as a college student I make a lot more than my friends who are working retail for much longer hours. 
[You should watch it sometime. Even if just for the view of 1970s NYC. Great movie.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0xkvh?context=5)|Watched it last night, awesome movie. On my favorites list.
[Have people actually had sex in the cab, or have you heard of stories? I've heard several times of people doing it in a cab but never et understood how the driver would let thay fly. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0izea?context=5)|Haha, I've heard other cabbies tell lots of stories about that kinda stuff. Yeah it does happen. I've never had that happen in my cab, though people probably have come close. I've definitely heard some moans here and there.
[Most tips u got? how good are ur driving skills? how to become a cab driver in nyc?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0hrw1?context=5)|Ahh, the most tips total for a day: $120. for a single trip: 18.
 |But percentage wise, I once got a 15 dollar tip on a 6 dollar fare, which is almost 300%. So technically that's the most.
 |Also, I think my driving skills are excellent. I get the ""good driver"" compliment all the time. :]
[How the fuck? The guy was like ""oh my fare is $6? Well I only have a twenty one dollar bill keep the change""?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0uxn4?context=5)|Yup, it was a tourist. Just gave me a 20 and hopped out, haha.
[Whoa, that doesn't sound at all right. How long are your shifts? I made 400 dollars once after gas and lease and I live in a shitty little town in the middle of no where.  EDIT: I can't read apparently.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0lnpj?context=5)|The question asked for tips.
[Have you ever attempted to flirt with/date one of your passengers? And if so, did it work?  That's how my husband and I met.. He was my cab driver. Still not sure how he pulled that one off, but I'm glad he did!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0ru79?context=5)|I do get a lot of super-pretty passengers. I try to keep it professional though. Sometimes girls will flirt but I keep it casual and don't try to escalate it. I just turn it into chit-chat. Never tried to date one of my passengers before, though I've been very tempted to ask a few times, haha.
[How is the pay? also, have you ever gotten into a serious fight with a customer? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0icb1?context=5)|Nothing super serious, in my time so far, I've only had one passenger who didn't pay me (long story).
[What do you feel about all the tourists in NYC? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0j2bl?context=5)|Well, I love nyc, I believe it's the greatest city in the world. So of course we'll have tourist, it's expected. I love showing tourist some new things or telling them facts they never knew. I like adding to their ny experience. Though a lot of tourist don't know that it's polite to tip cabbies in NYC. I learn some things from them as well, about where they are from and stuff.
[Thanks. We definitely tipped when I was there :\) I did have a really bad experience with a cabbie who seemed to be drunk/high and kept mumbling to himself and driving rather recklessly, and we were too afraid to say anything about it. He also dropped us at a random spot and told us to get out. Are these cabbies common?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0j9vd?context=5)|A lot of drivers are on their bluetooth, so he may have been on the phone (that's illegal). Don't be afraid to say anything. If you feel uncomfortable, chances are the cabbie is not doing a god job.
[What was the most meaningful conversation you had with a customer?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0o4v5?context=5)|I had a conversation about love with this passenger once. We shared similar views, and being that I'm young, he gave me some good advice. For example, to be patient with it.
[Where do you usually pick up people? Where are the crowded places usually? - What's the best thing about your job and what's the worst? - Do you make enough to support yourself?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0oy8p?context=5)|95% of passengers I pick up are within Manhattan, rest are mostly in Brooklyn, sometimes queens and of course airports. I like to roam mid-town and the lower west side a lot.
 |Best thing is the freedom and flexible schedule, worst thing is sitting in traffic, especially on a hot day.
 |Yes, I make more than enough to support myself.
[Do you enjoy making small talk with your passengers? Or would you prefer for them to keep quiet so you can just drive?  I've found that some cab drivers like to talk and others will be completely silent.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0rnvd?context=5)|Yes, I usually try to gauge it out. If a passenger seems to be trying to spark a convo, I will go with it. After all, it's a 12 hour shift, some socializing is needed. Plus, that usually helps me get a better tip. I think a lot of cabbies don't like to talk because of the language barrier. I met a lot of cabbies who barely speak English. They can answer basic questions, but not have full casual conversations. 
[In your opinion, what is the best thing about working at NYC?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0kk5e?context=5)|I love the view when the sun is rising from the Brooklyn bridge. The tall buildings in Manhattan. The the hipsters and Williamsburg. The little traffic in Queens. The food all over the city from all over the world. The interesting people. Those are just some of my favorite things.
[Aren't NYC taxi medallions crazy expensive?  How did you afford one at age 22?  Or are they a thing of the past?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0kt3y?context=5)|I just lease one every time I drive, from the garage I work at. Yes they are worth close to a million dollars.
[*I just lease one every time I drive, from the garage I work at. Yes they are worth close to a million dollars.*  I understand that these medallions are precious, so if you were to lease it a day/night shift, and you earn an average $160 after your shift(s\) on a day, then how much did you pay for the lease?  In short: How much do you pay for each lease?  Do you pay for the gas after a shift?  Edit: $160 a day, how many leases? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0uvws?context=5)|Lease a day ranges from 115-140 a day, depending on the shift (ex. Sat. night is the busiest). Yes, I pay for my own gas as well. Basically the way I usually look at it is, anything above $200 I make, is mine to keep.
[How long did it take you to learn the ins and outs of the city? You are incredibly young for a cabbie-- speaking as guy that starting cabbing himself at 23.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0smzt?context=5)|Took me about 5 or 6 months to really get the hang of it. Yes, I do get the ""young for a cabbie"" comment a lot, but I love driving. I think it's fun, it's a like a video game to me. Google maps helps a lot, not only with navigation but with traffic as well. And WAZE app.
[What do you think about NYC bike messengers?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0nll1?context=5)|Sorry late response but I missed this. I've had a couple of run ins with bikers. They usually know what they're doing though so it rarely interferes with my driving. What's a lot worse along the same lines is the trike tourist rikshaws. Those guys are sooo annoying. They take up a whole lane and cause so much traffic. A lot of them are always on their phones too, so dangerous.
[Does it pay well? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0k503?context=5)|It pays decent, but I wouldn't recommend it as a career (most cabbies won't).
[Ever had a drunk girl in your cab who didn't have any cash at the end of the ride? Did she offer anything, and if yes/no, how do you handle a situation where a client doesn't have the money with him?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0vp43?context=5)|Been driving for a year and half, only had one passenger who didn't pay me (I posted the story on another question). Usually if passengers don't have money, they let me know how much they have before I start the ride or will negotiate with me before they get in the cab. I've taken people to LI before who didn't have enough money, because I felt bad they would be drunk and stranded in NYC. Especially if they seem like they're my age.
[Do you like the way NYC does it where you are required to drive a yellow cab with the same markings as every other cab in the city, or would you prefer to work somewhere like Chicago where can drivers get more freedom to drive for different cab companies and have different cars?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0szh0?context=5)|NYC also has different companies and freedom of choice. Driving a yellow cab is one of those choices. There a lot of other companies you can drive for with a TLC license. A lot of them are geared towards certain groups of people, races, class, etc.
[Do you ignore traffic laws like every New Yorker would prefer you to do? If not, why not?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0mujw?context=5)|I follow all traffic laws to the best of my abilities. If i don't, I can get a ticket with a fine equivalent to what I make in a day. If a passenger says they are in a rush, I do drive more aggressive though, still within the rules.
[What's the worst road-rage incident you had? ](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0vm88?context=5)|Haha, there is a funny story with this. I seen this one dudette on the highway who was trying to get ahead of the car in front of her, who had a much bigger car. She was tailgating the guy and the guy in front of her had to brake aggressively at one point. The little car front ended the car in front of her. Ironically, the guy with the bigger car didn't feel a thing. He just drove off. However, the little car had a bent hood. So she put on her four way flashers and pulled over on the highway and got out of her car looking like all ""wtf"". The car she hit had minor damage, but he drove off without even notice. I was behind watching the whole thing and the funny thing is I could see the whole thing coming from a mile away, haha. In a way it was a hit and run, but the car that got hit is the one that run. She is lucky he didn't notice, because she would have had to pay for his damages. 
[What is the weirdest thing someone has left in a cab?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0iqv6?context=5)|Nothing too unusual, mostly just cell phones and perfume. 
[What do you do with cell phones and other expensive electronics? Do they go to some sort of lost and found? Is it pretty common for cabbies to just take them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0v1b3?context=5)|A lot of cabbies do just take them, yes. The law is to bring it to the nearest police precinct to where it was found.
[Do you charge people fares to return their phone to them?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0v4ir?context=5)|I've returned a few phones. I wish people were more thankful. A lot of them don't even say thank you. -__- So from now on, I will bring it to the nearest police station like I'm supposed to.  
[Perfume seems a bit unusual. How many women are just walking around w/ a bottle of the stuff?! I just have a small rollerball in my purse.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch1dep5?context=5)|No idea, I found 2 bottles!
[How much to take me from DUMBO to that night club no one has heard about yet?](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/23tqgq/iama_22_year_old_nyc_yellow_cab_driver_ask_me/ch0jhvl?context=5)|No idea, but if the club is in the city, more than $10!

HL 37, LL 35",[deleted],DeadBedrooms,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/23urnr/what_do_you_think_of_this_situation_hl_37_ll_35/,"I don't know why it never occurred to me, but my best friend is in a DB!  His situation is that he's 37, very good looking/in shape (ran a marathon last year), advanced degree, 6 figure job, really funny and awesome guy.  (OK, he's my BFF, so I'm biased.)  He is a true HL - he would like sex every day if he could get it.

His relationship with his spouse started out great.  His spouse is a couple years younger and was in med school when they met.  They moved in together after a year or so, he helped out financially while his SO was an intern.  Sex was OK to good for the first couple of years.  My BFF is more dominant in bed and the SO is more submissive, so they seemed well matched.

But as the years went on, the sex dwindled to nearly nothing.  The SO starfishes and complains that my BFF isn't finishing fast enough when they do have sex.  SO is a doctor now, makes a quarter mil a year, they own a beautiful house in a fancy neighborhood together, no kids though, thank god.

I have told my BFF to leave for years.  His SO doesn't respect him, and frequently says sarcastic and nasty things to him ( to be fair, they both have sarcastic senses of humor, but I think his SO likes making him feel bad).  Unfortunately, my BFF was a bit of a late bloomer and this is his first really serious relationship, so between that, his insecurity, and financial reasons he doesn't want to leave.  He's couldn't afford the mortgage on his own and the house is worth significantly less than when they bought it.  Their families are quite intertwined too, which is a kind of big deal for my BFF.  His family loves his SO.

I know, I know, it sounds like the typical DB.  What advice would you give my BFF though?  What advice to have for me for supporting my BFF?  It seems like a god damn tragedy that he's wasting the best years of his life with someone who doesn't appreciate him, but I don't want to meddle too much.  I'll be staying with them for a week this summer and am hoping to have concrete advice to give the BFF over beers.

**EDIT: Man I thought this would be more obvious.  My BFF is a gay man.  His SO is a man.  This is your daily reminder to not fall into the trap of assuming all HLs are male and all LLs are female. ;)  But seriously, for those of you who HAVE left, is there something your friends could have said/done to make you feel like it was feasible?**"

Does anyone know of any places that offer extremely short leases (like 4 months/just the summer)? I'm not really picky on the area at all, anywhere from downtown to ~20 minutes from the city.

I was just looking for some feedback on a position I currently hold, and how useful it is/will be for the advancement of my future career in accounting.

To start, I was lucky and had a former Deloitte auditor for a careers teacher in high school. I learned very much from her, and going into university, I understood the importance of getting internship(s).

Enter now: I've almost completed my first year of university, and I secured and have been working at a major Canadian University, in their Financial Services department, in the role of ""Accounting Clerk"". Some of my responsibilities include:

- Journal Entries to the General Ledger (up to $50 000)
- Verification and creation of chargeback reports
- Review ledger reports, ensuring outstanding advances have been repayed
- Training on major financial system
- Analysis of property leases regarding institutional liability (Somewhat odd, yes)

As typical of the position, I am passed on work others don't want to do, but I don't mind. It will be ending in a month or so. Anyway, onto the purpose of this post.

I would like feedback on what my goals should be for second year. I plan on applying for the Big 4 conferences next year, in hopes of securing an internship for Year 3. Depending on exam results, my GPA will be between 3.3-3.5 (although, this is due to one bad non-major course; after completion of second year it will be towards the 3.5-3.6 range, most likely). I have not decided whether to go into public accounting or industry yet, however that's not important at this time.

I know that I'm very lucky to have gotten the job I did. My ultimate question is: Is this job enough for my future goal of securing an internship? Should I be looking for a similar one in year two, or focusing on my GPA, and maybe breaking into my school accounting union? I'd like to note that I work another non-career related job, and will do so in the future.

Thanks very much for any feedback."

* Gift my brother 12.5k in cash, he pays off the debt himself
* Gift my dad 12.k in cash, he pays off the debt himself
* Contact the lending institution, I pay off 12.5k debt myself

With any of the cases above, are there tax benefits to any of us? Are there other reasons one plan is better than another?

23vc0h,7,2014-04-24,[Help] A lot of anxiety about all the alone time I'll have this summer.,ThePantslessWanderer,Anxiety,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/23vc0h/help_a_lot_of_anxiety_about_all_the_alone_time/,"I'm very happy in college and I have great friends and an awesome situation here. This summer I'm going on a school trip to India and then I have an internship for 6 weeks afterwards. Then, I have to go home from mid-July through August before returning to college.

The thing is, ever since I started college, I have a lot of anxiety surrounding home. My family sort of blew up (divorce) during high school, but I really love spending time with my family and I'm so happy when I'm at home with them. Though I had a really solid group of friends throughout high school, I went to one of those schools when everything was a competition--school, popularity, how many guys like you, etc. Now, whenever I think of my friends from home I feel empty and anxious. Either way, most of them will be in other cities this summer, but even if they were home at the same time as me, I know it'll be really difficult to see them. I just feel like I've grown really far away from the person I was in high school and I can't handle being around them, I don't feel like I can be myself and I'm not happy.

So, I think I'll be spending a lot of time alone this summer. I know it's a chance to chill out, start therapy, do yoga, read, paint, etc., but my birthday is in August. The idea of my birthday coming and going and no one cares except my mom and close family members makes me so anxious. I feel like these big dates really reflect where you are in life, and if I'm alone on that day (meaning, not celebrating with friends), I know I'll feel like I don't matter and I'm easily forgettable.


My heart is clenched I'm so anxious I feel like I can't function. I don't know what to do. /r/anxiety, if you have advice for anything, like summer activities, solutions to my issues, or how to deal with these underlying anxiety issues, please let me know

23voqb,10,2014-04-24,I don't know what to do,stdiodot,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/23voqb/i_dont_know_what_to_do/,"Hi, I'm a last year Computer Science student (5 years degree). I'm 24 years old, by the way.

I'm going to introduce my situation before my question.

I'm very interested in Theoretical Computer Science (Computabiliy and Complexity, and more things).

I would like to do a doctorate to be a college professor. I love it.

To do a doctorate degree, there are two things I've to have:

- Bachelor's degree
- Master's degree

Next year, I'll do a Master's degree about TCS. It seems awesome!

I've to present my Final Degree Project this year (june), and one or two presentations, and I would like to research more about my field.

I've been three years in a department as intern (I think it's not the same here than in others countries, I'm not paid, and it's not for an specific time)

To here, all is ok.

Here's the but:

I'm doing an internship (I don't know if it's a internship. Here, is called ""beca"". It's like ""prácticas en empresas"" (""company practices""), but remunerated, not so much. Please, tell me how it's called). The internship is about programming protocols, a little of SE...

The internship finishes at the end of this month. But I think they're going to hire me, so this would be a real job.

The job is full-time, can't be partial, and I come home too late, so I can't do so much about my project or about research...

So, here's the question: do I apply to the job? Or leave it and finish my degree and get free time to study more about my field?

Thank you very much.

I am 22 years old and I have a BA in Economics.  
I have been working as an accountant for a year now... and I hate it.  

I have found a passion in CS and I was wondering if I should go back to a Uni and go for a BA in CS or if I should just keep studying at home...  

If I do just study from home and get pretty good at coding, how would I find a job?  

Is it common to get a CS related job at a big company if you don't have internships/ a CS degree?  

Is the cost of Uni worth it? I would hope to take several internships if I do return...   

I appreciate any input! Thanks!"

* Discover Card - $450      // Used for gas for cashback
* Chase Card - $30       // Used for amazon purchases for cashback
* Barclay - $1000    // Bought macbook for school when my other laptop died, planned on paying off this summer
* Auto Loan - $7000

* $50 / week, extra help from dad

What should I do? Approach my mom for a Direct Plus Loan from the Government? Sell my desktop to have enough to spend until my new job starts in June? I am unsure. 

Have I been spending too much at college? I have not been worried about my expenses and debt because I have good prospects with a computer science degree for a job. This current internship is wanting to keep me on for the last two years of school and I assume offer me a position before graduating so I have not been too concerned about debt knowing I'll be able to pay it off when I graduate.

23wcz9,1,2014-04-24,How did my interview go?,[deleted],jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/23wcz9/how_did_my_interview_go/,"I just had an interview for dream internship, literally. I've been working towards working for this company since I was 13 years old (23 now). I've moved countries just so I could work there and have carefully fashioned my education and work experience to meet their every need. 

It was a phone interview as I currently live about 1,000 miles away. But, here's the thing — it was pretty short. 

Here are the pros and cons I could pick out:

CONS: They asked me questions for maybe about 13 minutes before asking if I had any questions for them, which I did
- They did ask my availability after I asked when the internship would start, but it seemed like an afterthought 
-They didn't really talk too much about the position until I asked at the end
- Mostly just asked me questions based on my resume (what was your favorite part of that job, what did you do, what are your goals this summer) 
- I had references listed on my resume but wanted to add a few cell phones. They didn't ask about references (maybe just because I had them listed) but when I offered up cell numbers they didn't seemed pretty neutral about writing them down, not ""oh that's great. thanks, we'll be in touch."" 

PROS:
- They said I had all the qualifications for the position
- Went on for a few minutes about how impressed they were that I was able to track down the lead interviewers email since it's not listed anywhere and doesn't follow the usual format of the company (this is for an editorial research position, so it's exactly the kind of stuff you have to do). 
- They seemed to like my answers and laughed a bit. 
- Found common ground over some mutual interests in the industry
- Said they'd be letting candidates know in the next few days after I asked, but it kind of a neutral tone I guess? 
- They asked if I had applied for any other internships at the company, and i said not yet because they hadn't been posted. 

I guess overall my feeling was that it felt like a formality. I just can't decide if it's because they want to offer it to me, or because they've chosen someone else. The company is known a little bit for its nepotism for internships, so that concerns me. Otherwise I feel like I do have all the qualifications needed for the position. 

Thoughts?"
23we75,2,2014-04-24,"Me [21 F] with my fiancee [21M] of a little over a year, I don't know how to deal with my parents and my fiancee's Navy status",sadpandathrowawayyy,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/23we75/me_21_f_with_my_fiancee_21m_of_a_little_over_a/,"Hello! My fiance and I are very happy and are living together. He's about to graduate university and I've only got a few more classes left (and a paid internship this summer with a job with the same company to follow the internship) before I'm out as well. My problem is more related to my parents' opinions.

Ever since the first time I brought my fiancee (then boyfriend) home (about 3-4 months into the relationship. Early, but I just ... felt right. Prior to him I dated someone for 3 1/2 years and with this one I just knew), my parents adored him. He had a lot of drive, ambition, and a lot in common with my parents. One thing that they loved was the fact that he was Navy bound. Both of his parents were in the Navy and his father was an officer. My fiancee aspired to be the same thing. He worked so hard this past year to get all of the paperwork in and to go through all of the tests to qualify. He passed the ASTB with flying colors. 

The problems began to come up whenever he had to begin the medical check. We are from Florida, where the Baker Act is present. A few months before I met my fiancee, he had attempted suicide by swallowing bleach. Many things had gone very wrong that year and he had lost control. As soon as he swallowed the bleach, he had immediately regretted it, and began contacting his friends asking for help. They called the Baker Act on him, which is Florida's involuntary psychiatric commitment. He was released early (the normal time span is 72 hours of evaluation) after they deemed he was not a threat to himself or others. After being Baker Acted, the medical record is sealed and cannot be seen. He visited a counselor at our university's health center and talked to her for a couple weeks.

When he began visiting his recruiter to begin the Officer application process, he was very honest and up-front about the incident and asked if it would affect his chances. The recruiter falsely said that it wouldn't be a problem. So he went through the entire process this year, and once he got to medical, things slowed down. The Navy wanted the notes from his counseling sessions at the university, and the university refused because they won't do it without a court order. Instead, they wrote a note to the Navy saying that my fiancee was psychologically okay and that he no longer needed counseling. Obviously the Navy wanted the ugly truth. Our university still would not forfeit the notes. Currently, this is the step my fiancee is stuck at in the process and we are waiting on baited breath for either a miracle or a disqualification letter.

My fiancee has backups, such as a secured teaching job (his passion -where the county is paying for 100% of his master's) as well as a few other offers for decently-salaried jobs throughout the state. We are both very sad about the Navy problems, but we are not completely SOL. His parents (who know about the suicide attempt) are sad but are happy that he is pushing forward with a career instead of giving up, just as I am.

Whenever I communicate with my dad about even minor things like my car's mileage, he will bring up ""seeing [fiancee's name] in Pensacola while he's in flight school"" or ""You'll have to figure out when [fiancee's name] is on leave so that you can have room for the honeymoon post-wedding"". The bad Navy news came about a week ago, and it's been stewing in my head. I CANNOT tell my parents about the suicide attempt, and I feel that it is something personal and that no one NEEDS to know that. My parents are very judgemental about suicide and self-harm. I'm preparing to tell them that he will be medically DQ'd, but I will give other medical problems (his vision and hearing may not qualify for the standard either). I don't know how they'll take it. It seems that they are hellbent that he's ""going to the Navy"" and it would hurt me so much if they based their entire opinions of him on the fact that he was Navy-bound.

I don't know how to talk to them about it. It seems like my parents are slightly elitist and see teaching as an ""easy way out career."" They have always been tough on me about careers and about the careers of the people I date. My fiancee is already hurt enough and he's upset with himself that the suicide attempt harmed his ability to go Navy, and it would break his heart if he lost my parents' affection over something like this. 

Obviously I can't hide the Navy thing from them (despite the fact that I refuse to tell them about the suicide attempt) but I really don't know how to go about this conversation.

---   
**tl;dr**: My fiance is disqualified from Naval Officer Candidate School for a suicide attempt a while back. Though upset, he is still very motivated and has good career backups. HOWEVER, my parents seem to obsess over the fact he's going to the Navy. I'm not sure how to talk to them."

Mind you this guy looks like he's making 400k+ and I'm a college kid on his first interview. He doesn't know me from Adam, but we talk like we've been friends for a long time. We talked about sports. We talked about his kids and their careers. We talked about his 30+ year career in computer technology. We talked about life in general and career paths.

I probably shouldn't be allowed on r/Frugal with how terrible with money I am. 

So a couple weeks ago my last car broke down and was going to cost me $1,500 to fix at the lowest, and possibly $2,500 to put an engine in it. Well the car is only worth $700 to $1,000 so I've come to the conclusion that it's time to find a new(er) car. Well, has it been hard. Tonight was the hardest night I've had. I found a 2008 Mazda 3, with 106,000 miles on it, for $8,500. So I called my uncle who is willing to help cosign for the loan if I'm able to show him my finances and how I'm going to pay for it. That got me thinking, I had originally planned on putting about $750 down and than when it's summer working 40 hours with my internship pay that months worth of car payments. Than when it was August I would take my left over school money (I get extra money from grants) and pay for my car payments up front. Than I got to thinking that it's a bad idea to pay for something mentally with money you don't have. And now I'm really stressed because I'm giving up pretty much a dream car right..Now, I know this is a long story for almost no reason other than I need to vent. And explain a few things my uncle said to me. 

-If you can't pay for it before you buy it, than you can't afford to pay for it after you buy it.
-Even if you get your payments lowered by stretching them out you'll end up paying in the long run and you should not expect to pay more when you think you're going to have it.
-You need to show your self, and than me that you can afford something before you buy it. 

So, while these are all common themes when buying big purchases I thought I could express some of the million things running through my head. Now to find a 3k to 4k car. Any one have any good suggestions for a good gas mileage car in that price range? 

TL;DR My car's broken, almost payed $8,500 for a car I probably can afford without stretching my self way to much. And I need to learn to budget and find resources on it.

Along with this, I also have ADD and ADHD. i never told anyone because he said he would rape my sister and kill my dog. i should have told from the first touch, but i know now that my 17 year old mind wasnt the same as my 8, 9, 10, and 11 year old mind.

during (9 years old was the beginning of it) and after that i suffered sexual, physical, and verbal abuse from my racist, alcoholic, and overly old fashioned father (he is 60 years old as of January) and from my alcoholic narcissistic super religious mother. When i would try to vent to my sister, she said that since she never got any of that, that i must be doing something awful to them to deserve it. *i was being fucking raped to protect you, and oh how badly i wanted to tell you so you would help me, but instead you told me to stop complaining about abused* 

i dont have the will to go into details about how much my sister was preferred over me, but i will give a glimpse of it. my parents took money from me to give to her when i was younger, she always got new clothes, and anything she asked for, she got. my parents paid for her college and her sorority stuff, along with her *house* in her college town. she didnt get a job in college, but out of fucking nowhere now works for a very esteemed place in nashville, where they illegally hired her. something about not being able to have an intern after they graduate college and keeping her anyway, then eventually she was hired because they were warned of what they were doing. she also has a fiance that is loaded. even before that, she babysat for some very famous people and made about a $800 a week, which didnt include the free trips to new york, hawaii, and a few other places, just to babysit. she was paid during the trips, too. they give her shoes that cost over a thousand fucking dollars in the amount that requires a ***garbage bag to carry them***. she has so much money it is almost funny. almost. meanwhile my parents still pay for her new iphone every year, her phone bill, her car insurance, BOUGHT her a new car for a second time, and constantly pay for her car to be fixed after frequent car accidents. my family spends money on her that we dont fucking have, and meanwhile, i ask for $10 to buy a pair of headphones, and they tell me that i ask for too much and that they dont think they should be funding things related to computers, since ""technology will all fail someday"". they constantly guilt me for paying for the electricity and water bill to me saying that i am making it go up with my tv going and my computer on and showering too long (my showers take about 6-8 minutes, 10 tops, 15 if I am crying, but that is when they arent home). I forgot to throw this in, but my parents paid for my sisters private school education and I went to public school and have to pay for my own college. my parents treat me like shit and they will never in their life admit it.

I did end up going to private school in 5th and 6th grade, because my dad thought there were ""too many niggers now at that damn new public school!"". I was bullied furiously, and eventually tried to hang myself. I was in 6th grade. I tied a backpack through the hinges on my closet door and looped around the other strap and... hung there. i kicked and tried to use my feet, but i just couldnt move, and it hurt so much, i wanted it to stop. I was eventually caught in the midst of it by my parents and the rest was sort of a blur. no hugging and saying they are sorry, just sobs of ""how can you do this to me"" and such. I started therapy the following months. During the first few sessions, i talked about my molestation and eventually, the therapist only wanted to talk about my sister. not in a therapeutic way, but in a normal type of conversation. even a therapist wouldnt listen and didnt care about me. I eventually stopped going because it was making it worse. I told my parents i was better and since my dad thinks therapy is liberal propaganda (i shit you not), so i eventually fell into a deeper depression. people at my school said i was gay, made fun of me for being raped, told people i worshiped the devil (this started when i wore a guns n roses tshoirt that had their heads on the cross. they had never heard of GNR so they assumed the worst they could) and eventually, the teachers started hating me, since they all thought that i was a gay satanist, *in 6th fucking grade*. I left for public school the next year. i became a huge bully because i was starting my reputation over. i was a swimmer, a golfer, and was pretty good at soccer, plus i would occasionally wear nice clothes that i would beg my parents for. I didnt care if they guilted me, i couldnt go back to being bulllied. I was a selfish fuck and i hate my 7th and 8th grade self. 

going into freshman year, i became addicted to k2, a synthetic form of weed. i smoked all day and it really fucked me up, but drugs made me feel better so i decided to keep doing them. i was beginning to lose my religion. that also really fucked with my head. i was still very suicidal, but i was starting to gain a real sense of my real self once i realized that being racist is wrong, that my religion was a lie, and that being a radical conservative didnt give me any type of moral high-ground over anyone. well, later into the year, i was getting close to going to state for swimming. i already went as an 8th grader and was killing it as a freshman. if you swim, i was doing a 23.6 in my 50 free as a freshman and murdering in the 200 IM. i was busted for selling spice about 2 weeks before regionals and expelled from school, and sent to alternative schooling for 14 weeks. i was heavily dependent on my current girlfriend who also treated me pretty terribly, but i took it because i was desperate. anyway, a few days after my arrest, my parents found out that i knew where the gun was in my house and planned on using it within the week. they sent me to a mental health center for drug addicts and people who are suicidal. i spent a week there, since i am manipulative and, like i said, smart. I hated it there, but the food was good i guess. i got out to find that i was now single. my world was turned upside down. i didnt know what to do. i was banned from the internet since i mentioned visiting 4chan frequently and reddit occasionally to my therapist in there, and unfortunately enough for me, she got on 4chan, and went to /b/, which is what i told her i usually go on to vent about suicide and whatnot. she thought it was a nice little internet chat group i assume, but instead found pretty much everything you would expect. so, now that my mind number was gone, i was completely out of ideas, and back to being as suicidal as ever. I secretly dated the girl for about a year and eventually, her parents said i could date her again. shortly after, her feminist friends said that i control her by not letting her go to parties with guys she flirts with. They spun it as ""HE TELLS HER SHE ISNT ALLOWED TO HAVE ANY FRIENDS AND ALWAYS YELLS AT HER AND I THINK HE HIT HER TOO!!!"" I wake up one morning to the sound of my mother calling me in. she said ""that was Mr. ____, he said you put his daughter on pills?"" i had NO fucking idea what she was talking about. apparently, his daughters friends spun it that she needed sleeping pills because i stress her out too much. that was not the case at all, but she lied because she was caught in a lie with her friends. I tried to overdose, but just seized up and vomited until the morning. that was my second suicide attempt, and that was as a sophomore.

I cant take much more typing... ive been typing this for about an hour and a half, with crying and smoke breaks here and there. I am going to summarize quickly on what has happened recently, and if someone needs me to elaborate further then i will. I eventually couldnt stand people and my disorders had gotten worse exponentially, making normal school nearly impossible. i applied for another form of schooling where i could be alone and work at my own pace, and was told that worst case scenario, i will be gone by the middle of the third 9 weeks, this was said to me at the end of the 2nd 9 weeks. I am now told, at the beginning of the 4th 9 weeks, that i will not go this year. i am failing all of my classes besides histoy. I lost my car due to awful grades. i had awful grades because i was told im in a ""transitional period between this school and the self paced school"" and that my classes would start over. I now have about 400 missing assignments that i simply cannot make up. i now will have to go to summer school, and will not get my car back until december. the school ***fucking LIED TO ME AND FUCKED ME OVER***. The only thing i was fucking looking forward to was having a summer free of school stress and people constantly bothering my disorders. here is the thing though, i was put as a low priority because i am smart, and they wanted people at the school who were stupid to get in first due to them being a higher threat of dropping out. 

________________________________________________________

At this point, i am willing to commit suicide because i know it will not hurt. I will not go to hell, i will just feel the way i did before i was born, nothing. I only started feeling this way once i realized how little goes right in my life. people keep telling me that it only goes up from here, and then my life proves them wrong. I dont want to feel pain anymore. i dont deserve it. i knew i would probably die from suicide, but... i didnt think this early. im not ready yet, but i am getting more comfortable with the idea with every day i have to endure. I not only have the means to do it, but now i have the will. i am waiting this week out and will go back to the mental place to try and get through it, but i doubt it will work. if it doesnt work (although i will give it an honest shot) then i will do it, and i wont hurt anymore... Sorry for the wall of text... It has over 11600 characters, so its okay if you didnt read it all. soon i will be dead, and nobody will have to read another wall of text of my life again. "

Is this like a restaurant or something?""",wit3tyg3r,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/23xfbf/menu_is_this_like_a_restaurant_or_something/,"Hello TFTS! I've been a long time lurker of this sub, but I wanted to share an experience I've had from long ago. This will be a long one.
***
  
**A Bit of Background**  
  
Many years ago, while I was in high school, I had the opportunity of having an internship with a private web development company (We'll call them SomeWebDesignCo) that did web design and development for small/private businesses and some personal sites as well. In fact, they have a group of high school interns that sort of run a small company of their own under the supervision of SomeWebDesignCo.  
  
The opportunity is great because high school students get to build skills and experiences with real-world clients. I was brought onto the team about a year after SomeWebDesignCo started the high school internships. I was the lead web designer for the high school group because of my experience with PhotoShop and frontend development (in fact, my digital art teacher was the one who referred me).  
  
As the web designer, my primary task was obviously doing web design. My secondary task was to be the main contact for the clients. Most of our clients were very tech illiterate so it was my job to ensure that the client got a site that looked like what they wanted and to ensure that the developers developed a site that functioned like the client wanted. I was, in other words, the middle man when it came to communicating the clients' needs to the developers.
***
  
*(Remember that everyone involved in this story is a high school student, except for the clients. Also, I will occasionally refer to myself as either Me or $OP throughout the story's dialog)*  
  
I sat at my desk staring anxiously at the clock.  
  
My Physics teacher was lecturing about centripetal force, but I was ready to leave. I had an important kickoff meeting that day. I would be meeting with a new client, which meant a new site to design.  
  
I always enjoyed getting a new project at work.  
  
This one in particular was going to be a site for an African orphanage and adoption center. I was pretty excited with the idea that I would be involved with something that promoted such a noble cause. This was probably going to be our biggest project yet!
  
*BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP*  
  
My school's digital alternative to a bell finally 'rang'. School was over. I buttoned the top button of my dress shirt, tightened my necktie, said my goodbyes to my friends, and walked at a brisk pace to my car.  
  
~ ~ ~  
  
I arrived at work, thankful that there was no traffic on the way. SomeWebDesignCo was located in a busy part of town due to the high number of business buildings, community colleges, restaurants, hospitals, and shopping centers. I was the third of about nine interns to make it, so at least I was relatively early.  
  
I stopped by the Keurig hot beverage maker to prepare myself a cup of Earl Grey tea.  
  
**Me**  
&gt; Tea. Earl Grey. Hot.  
  
Nothing happened.  
  
I sighed as I remembered that I didn't live in the future. I inserted a single-use Earl Grey pack into the machine, placed a large mug under the dispenser, and pushed a button. The steaming hot liquid poured into my cup and I inhaled deeply as the steam reached my nose. It smelled wonderful. Well... only as wonderful as pre-packaged, instant Earl Grey could smell.  
  
I took a sip, relished in the fact that I had at least some type of tea warming my winter-struck body, and headed towards my desk to start the day.  
  
~ ~ ~  
  
A few minutes after 4:30pm, a woman who looked to be in her late 40s (we'll call her $MotherClient) and another younger lady (we'll call her $DaughterClient) walked through the door. These must be the clients for the orphanage and adoption center because that organization was a mother-daughter operation.  
  
The project manager (we'll call her $PM), the president (we'll call him $Pres), and I walked over to introduce ourselves. Upon arriving at the guests, the first thing I noticed was the sheer size of $MotherClient's purse. It could almost have been considered a duffel bag.  
  
**$Pres**  
&gt; Hello! My name is $Pres. Welcome to SomeWebDesignCo. This is $OP our designer and $PM our project manager.  
  
**$MotherClient**
&gt; Hi! I'm $MotherClient$ and this is my daught--  
  
At this point, $MotherClient's purse started making some high-pitched sounds and was wriggling. $Pres, $PM, and I looked at each other in confusion. $MotherClient started opening her duffel purse.  
  
**$MotherClient** *In a tone as if she were talking to a baby*  
&gt; Oh, I know, baby. You've been trapped inside this bag for so long. I'll let you get some air for a bit.  
  
Confusion turned into concern. Was this woman, the owner of an adoption agency, cruelly treating an infant?!?  
  
$MotherClient opened her duffel purse and out popped the head of a tiny dachshund puppy.  
  
Concern slowly drifted back to confusion.  
  
**$DaughterClient**  
&gt; She'll be fine. She's really a sweet puppy, I promise!  
  
**$MotherClient** *Still in her baby tone*  
&gt; Who's a good girl? That's right! You're a good girl!  
  
Still trying to mask our confusion, we led the clients to the conference room to begin our kickoff meeting.  
  
~ ~ ~  
  
**$MotherClient**  
&gt; ...And we think that our mission statement should be the first thing our visitors see. Also, I think it would be a good idea to put some pictures of African quilts as the background. What do you think, $DaughterClient?  
  
**$DaughterClient**  
&gt; Definitely! I think that's a great idea!  
  
**Me**  
&gt; We can absolutely look into doing that as long as all of the text is legible. But, the most important factor is to ensure that you have a website with a good layout. Visitors should be able to navigate the site with as few problems as possible and have easy access to the content that they want. Have you had a chance to make a list of some existing sites that you like?  
  
**$MotherClient**  
&gt; Oh, no not yet. I'm actually not sure what I want.  
  
I felt a small part of my soul die, and I'm sure $PM and $Pres could tell. We were going to have to go through some extensive wireframing. This meeting was going to take longer than anticipated.  
  
**Me**  
&gt; Okay, no problem. We can start off with some sketching.  
  
I got up and picked up a dry-erase marker. The walls in the conference room were coated with whiteboard paint, so every inch of wall space was effectively a whiteboard.  
  
I have an undying love for whiteboards.  
  
**Me**  
&gt; The best place to start is by looking at some sites of competitors or other organizations that are similar to yours. Do you have any in mind that we could look at?  
  
**$MotherClient**  
&gt; Umm... I haven't actually researched many orphanage or adoption agencies. We are actually just getting started.  
  
Another part of my soul withered away.  
  
**Me**  
&gt; Alright...  
  
I stayed silent for a brief moment, trying to think of the best way to proceed.  
  
**$PM**  
&gt; I will start pulling up some adoption agency sites. That will probably be our best course of action.  
  
**$DaughterClient**  
&gt; Okay. We really don't need anything complicated. Just a place for information. We plan to do all of the adoption services in person or on the phone.  
  
**Me**  
&gt; Okay. We'll start with a couple sketches and go from there.  
  
I began drawing a few quick examples of common layouts on the whiteboard wall. I drew one with the navigation bar on top, one with the navigation on the left. I drew a single-column layout, a 2-column layout, and contact form.  
  
**Me**  
&gt; The best way for your visitors to have access to various pages of your site is by the use of a navigation bar. Most commonly, you'll find sites with the navigation bar horizontally along the top. There are also many sites that have the navigational along--  
  
**$MotherClient**  
&gt; Navigation? Like that screen in the car that shows the map?  
  
I looked over to $Pres. He was typing frantically on his laptop. Then $PM started typing. Then $Pres again. They must have been talking to each other via our company's messaging service of choice... most likely making fun of the clients in secret. I desperately wanted to join them.  
  
**Me**  
&gt; Not quite. For websites, the navigation is kind of like a menu that you use on your computer. It allows you to access different parts of the site and keep everything organized. For example, you can have a contact info page, a mission statement page, you could even have a page where you talk a little about yourselves. All of these pages will be links in the menu so that visitors can go to those pages. Most sites have the menu along the top, some have the menu along the left side.  
  
**$MotherClient**  
&gt; I'm really not understanding this 'menu' thing. Is this like a restaurant or something? We aren't a restaurant!  
  
**Me**  
&gt; I understand that. I'm trying to think of the best way to explain. Have you used Microsoft Word? You know how it says 'File', 'Edit', 'Tools', 'Help', etc. along the top? Those are menus. They allow you to access different options and--  
  
$MotherClient starts to look really frustrated. She turns to her daughter.  
  
**$MotherClient**  
&gt; Do you know what he's talking about? I don't understand any of this computer lingo.  
  
She then turned to her puppy.  
  
**$MotherClient** *In her baby tone*  
&gt; Do you understand, babycakes? I didn't think so. I think we should try some other company.  
  
$MotherClient 'packed' her puppy in her duffel purse and walked out of the conference room.  
  
**$MotherClient**  
&gt; Come on, $DaughterClient. Let's go.  
  
$DaughterClient got up, apologized, and followed her mother out of the building.  
  
$Pres, $PM, and I sat in the conference room for a while in utter confusion.  
  
~ ~ ~  
  
A week later, we receive a check from them of the non-refundable up-front payment (a portion of the full estimate) that they were contractually obliged to pay.  
  
We never heard from them again."

I work retail to pay bills, i'm on foodstamps and everyday try get better at my craft and apply to places all at the same time. I moved to LA to try and improve my chances at getting a job about 10 months ago but nothing.

I've also been getting seizures lately which I'm thinking may be somewhat related to the major stress I've been going through and lack of sleep as well.

I'm being laid off my job soon because they're closing and have started looking for jobs and forgot how hard it is to even get a minimum wage job with just an art degree.

Although I'd love to continue trying to reach my dreams, I have to start paying school loans soon and my bills are going to start stacking up soon especially with losing this job and only having two months emergency saved up.

My life has been pretty shit for a while now and I want to try for a job where I can buy food, pay my rent, and maybe even be able to eat out every once in a while.

I want to know what jobs are good for this? I'm actually a hard worker, but I guess I just suck at art and all the hours I've put in to this have been lost because no one wants to hire me. I always got a's and b's in class, maybe some c's in senior year because senioritis, i was an ap/ib student and did always kinda liked fiddling with computers, so I was thinking maybe something in programming?


Anyway, thank you for any help- really I need help and have no idea who to even turn to as I literally have no one that can help me. Thank you reddit."

23xlsl,14,2014-04-25,"Questions about graduate school, post-graduate school, etc",firelitdrgn,AskAnthropology,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnthropology/comments/23xlsl/questions_about_graduate_school_postgraduate/,"Hi r/AskAnthropology! 

I've lurked around here and posted a few times, but something's been on my mind lately and I wanted to see what the people of the world wide web has to say. I'll try to keep it short :) 

I'm currently in my last quarter as a college undergraduate in the anthropology department, focusing primarily on physical/biological (but I've taken some archaeology classes before as well). Due to the fact that I've been volunteering in my university department's lab for the last year, I have plenty of lab experience under my belt when it comes to data entry, cataloging, archival work, dissection, wet lab/cleaning animal bones, and I'm starting to dabble a bit in 3D scanning. 

I'm also volunteering for an internship through my university department (it's an internship but I'm not getting credits for it like everyone else is) where we're working on a project that will eventually go to the Smithsonian. I also have an excellent report with the lab manager in my department as well as many of the professors in the department (in both the physical and archaeological anthropology) because I've been volunteering so much in such a short time (I changed my major at the end of my sophomore year). 

My initial plan was to go into forensic anthropology, but after talking to a few people in the field as well as going to talks hosted by the professors in my department I realized it is not a feasible goal because of:

* job prospective; there's literally no jobs for anyone just under the title of ""forensic anthropology""
* over-saturation of the field due to recently popular television shows
* too broad. Wayyy too broad. 

I thought about it for a long while but I knew I still wanted to work with bones to a certain degree (I'm interested in both bones and decomp remains, so I can do both). I've been very interested lately about working at the Smithsonian under their forensic anthropology department, but I have also heard through the grapevine that this is ALSO not a smart idea. 

I also want to just throw it out there that I am not opposed to eventually working in the academia if I do end up doing something forensic related (because I know that happens a lot of the times when one goes into forensics). Neither am I opposed to doing other sorts of work, no matter how back-breaking or difficult it is; all I know is I just want to be able to work with bones, skeletons, and the human body in general. 

And of course, as a senior I'm looking towards my future in terms of paying off my student loans, putting my degree to good use, graduate school, etc etc. 

SO my questions are:

1. What is the prospective, or the possibility/chance, of working in a museum society such as what I've described? Is this more or less difficult than say going into bioarchaeology and doing something forensic related?

2. I had changed my major to anthropology during the end of my sophomore year. My GPA in the anthropology major is **wayyyyy** better than the GPA in my previous major. For graduate schools, especially if you're focusing on anthropology, do they look at the overall GPA or just your major GPA? (I've always wondered about this but can't seem to find the right answer...)

3. I have no fieldwork experience under my belt (bad I know) due to either financial, familial, or school conflicts. I have heard from a few people that if finance is an issue (cause I'd really like to not take out more loans for field school), volunteering is the next best thing. What are your thoughts on this? What happens if I want to volunteer but have no hands-on experience in the field? What are your thoughts on taking out loans for field-school **period**?

4. In-state verses abroad for graduate school? I have heard that studying abroad for graduate school actually makes it harder for you to find a job back in the US. 

5. Jobs straight out of college? Any ideas of what field I can go into, and where to start in general in terms of job search? 

Anyway, all and any feedback are more than welcome. Many thanks in advance!"

23y5gk,8,2014-04-25,My [25 F] Mirena insertion experience (Canada),thedogsbreakfast,birthcontrol,https://www.reddit.com/r/birthcontrol/comments/23y5gk/my_25_f_mirena_insertion_experience_canada/,"I have wanted an IUD since I was about 19. One of my girlfriends got one and I was unbelievably jealous. I lived in Ontario at the time and my family doctor told me that I was not a candidate for Mirena. She said that I was too immature, and that she would only prescribe and insert for women who have had children previously. I was disappointed, but I let it go. I broke up with my boyfriend not long after that anyway. 

Fast forward to summer of 2012. I moved to Atlantic Canada for a post-grad internship and I fell head-over-heels in love with my now fiancé. I can’t seem to get a family doctor here. Luckily a not-for-profit organization exists in my city. It runs similarly to Planned Parenthood. I sought them out for birth control options that summer. I asked about IUDs, and sure enough, they were only too happy to prescribe and insert. However, the wait list for an appointment was upwards of 4 months!

I got pregnant in the fall of 2012. I was so close to my IUD appointment that it was painful. I waited out the first trimester to decide what to do. Not to mention that in Atlantic Canada you must have a doctors’ referral and there is, yet another, wait list. I ended up terminating the pregnancy around Christmas that year. 

Following my pregnancy I got back on the waitlist for an IUD insertion appointment. My cultures were fine, but my pap smear came back with low-grade changes. I was no longer a candidate for an IUD until I got a colposcopy to rule out a problem with my cervix. It was summer 2013 before I was able to get in for that appointment. I had to wait another 6 months for my next pap to ensure there were no more changes. Luckily everything turned out okay. My pap this past Christmas was okay. 

So, I *finally* got my IUD inserted yesterday. I was prescribed Mirena about 6 weeks ago while at my cultures and pap smear appointment. I recently got a job with unbelievable benefits. My Mirena was completely covered! Even if it hadn’t been, Mirena sells for $350 and change at my local Costco pharmacy. I picked my Mirena this past week. The pharmacist was very discreet about packing up this rather large, and awkward box. I got a little note at my prescription appointment that reminded me to take 600 mg of ibuprofen about an hour prior to my appointment. All I needed on arrival was my valid provincial health card. 

The doctor was running about 45 minutes late. She asked if I had any questions for her, and she walked me through what she was going to do. She reminded me that any time I wished her to stop, to let her know. Honestly, I have been excited for this! I had no questions for the doc. I have also been trying my best to avoid online reviews, experiences, and horror stories. I want to be able to form my own opinion. 

Yesterday was day 4 of my cycle, an ideal time for insertion. I undressed from the waist down. The doc did an internal exam of my uterus and ovaries in order to determine whether my uterus was tilted forward or backward. Mirena comes in a rather large, sterile box. The doc was not going to open the box until she knew that she could get the device inserted. No problem. 

Next the doctor inserted the speculum. She then sprayed an antiseptic disinfectant into my vagina. It smelled like cherries! Next was the sounding device (to determine the size of my uterus, and how deep the Mirena would be placed). The sounding device was kind of like a long tube. It had to go through my cervix. The doctor told me it was going to feel like a sharp pinch, and that a big cough will help her get it through. It did pinch. In fact it about 60 seconds of just plain uncomfortable. 

Mirena was next! The insertion technique is similar to placing a tampon in the vagina. Mirena gets inserted through the sounding tube. The doctor pushed Mirena into my uterus, checked it’s position, then removed the tube. This step felt like a painful cramp. It did hurt, and I did say “ouch” out loud. The doc asked if I was okay, and of course I was. All that was left after that was the cutting of the strings. Of course I didn’t feel this. I was just eager to have the speculum out by this point. The doc cut the strings, and voila! All over! 

When I was getting dressed I noticed some blood spots on the pad I was laying on. Being day 4 of my cycle, the bleeding had really tapered off. I had not expected to bleed during insertion. I guess I just never thought about it. Luckily I brought a pad for the way home. That was something that I wish I had known previously. Especially after having asked if there was anything I should bring when I called to confirm my appointment. Oh well. 

The entire appointment took less than 10 minutes. The doc handed me some literature (similar to that included in each box of HBC pills), and a date card to keep until my Mirena’s removal/replacement. On my way out of the office I made a follow up appointment for the first week of June. There was no cost for this, although I did make a modest donation to clinic. 

So far, so good. I had some pretty intense cramping all afternoon. I took ibuprofen at 4 hour intervals to manage the pain. I chose not to have sex with my partner yesterday, although the doc said it would be fine to do so. I slept well last night, and the cramps seem to have tapered off this morning. The bleeding is less intense as well. Everything seems fine! 

I’m happy to share my (Canadian) experience! I’ll do my best to answer any specific questions you might have as well! Good luck on your birth control journey :)

**TL;DR:** I had Mirena inserted yesterday after a very long wait. It was a short appointment, and not too painful. "

23yg43,3,2014-04-25,Can anyone help me tailor my learning to best fit this project I want to implement? Everything from languages to techniques to things I don't even know about.,grokfest,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/23yg43/can_anyone_help_me_tailor_my_learning_to_best_fit/,"So I am barely a beginner and am going to be diving headfirst into learning to code to implement this project, but I think I can do it.  But since I know so little, I am looking for some direction that might help me know what I need to learn to implement it.  I am an intern at a nonprofit with background in stats, GIS, and some experience with scripting in matlab, using complex formulas (but not really macros) in excel, very basic python programming that I'm working on.  No web development experience outside of hosting data for a google map on a google site.

So here's what I want to do:

I am building a database with information on clients for the nonprofit.  It includes demographic info, dates, times, categories, text, and numeric data.  I am using a google spreadsheet that I want to be able to query like a database (have looked into this enough to know it's possible) and that will be continually updated as new clients sign up via a google form that populates another spreadsheet that the database will draw from (reorganizing and changing column titles).  I want to build a GUI that can be searchable and sortable, and display the client's information in a useful, readable way (i.e., not a dense spreadsheet or table).  For instance, the staff could search for all clients available on weekends interested in construction work in order to find people to fill a job opening they've found (availability on weekends and construction category interest would both be discrete fields in the database).  Or the staff could search for a client and view their complete file in a readable way.  I plan on hosting the GUI on Google sites.

From a cursory level of investigation, I figure I'll need to learn some XML, become very familiar with SQL querying in databases, understand how an API works, and get a handle on the unique quirks involved in Google products.  Anything else that would work to accomplish what it sounds like I'm aiming for?  Anywhere that I am leaving a huge gap in the explanation where I'd need to account for a whole other system?  Assume I have no relevant knowledge or vocabulary but am pretty reasonable and analytical.  PS: I don't need examples of coding, just want to know where to start and what I'll need to learn, broadly.  Thank you for any help you can give."
23yhu2,1,2014-04-25,"2(+-) more years at a more prestigious college, or graduate and go to Graduate school?",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/23yhu2/2_more_years_at_a_more_prestigious_college_or/,"So I'm at a bit of a crossroads.
I'm in my third year of undergrad. I'm spending the year in Japan, doing research at a prestigious Japanese laboratory. My home college does not offer a Computer Engineering as a major, but they do offer a dual degree program with the state college. My college is kind of tiny, so my original intent was to transfer to the larger college (with most of my general studies done, thankfully), do maybe some more research, an internship, then bust my hump for the GRE. How long it takes me to complete college isn't important to me, since I maintain the view that you really only do college once, and it's worth it to come out over-prepared than under-prepared. I just wanted to bounce the idea off some other people. Just to re-iterate here's the two opposing scenarios:

1) I graduate tiny college. Loot:

* BA in CS
* BA in Applied Science &amp; Mathematics
* minor in Asian Studies (woohoo!)
* One summer research in Computer vision (small college)
* Year long research experience in Computer Vision and Robotics (Japanese University)

vs.

2) I go to larger university. Loot:

* BS in Computer Engineering from larger college
* BA in Computer Science from tiny college
* BA in AS&amp;M
* minor in Asian Studies
* Summer Research (possibly x2)
* Year-long research in Computer Vision
* Internship

In terms of career goals, I would like to continue to work in Computer Vision/Artificial Intelligence/Robotics. I'm getting great experience with some really new and expensive tech, and would like to keep coming up with cool new ways to utilize it. Thusly I think Computer Engineering is important. Not to mention I would just like more educational experience."

I'm looking to move my career in a more computationally-based direction and was hoping to get some input on how this would be best achieved. I have a B.S in Mechanical Engineering... Unfortunately, the closest my current position gets to any coding is Excel spreadsheets and horizontal movement within the company is limited. I've done programming on-and-off since a young age and even had a summer internship as a developer, so my CS background is stronger than what you'd normally expect out of a non-CS major. As I see it, my possible courses of action can broadly be divided into more education, leveraging my existing degree for a new position closer to where I want to go, doing projects to build a portfolio, or some combination thereof. What does it take for a hiring manager decide I'm worth an interview over some fresh CS grad? 

I've read the FAQ and am aware of Coursea, Udacity, etc. It's very attractive because of the low cost, easier admissions process, etc, but as educational as I'm sure they are, I'm not entirely convinced employers will recognize their value.

I have 1 week left and I have to tell them I won't be returning so they can start looking for a new guy. I feel kind of bad about it but its also around 8 months worth of experience I have here I can put on my resume that I do NOT want to lose. 

I don't want to return because I'm not doing the type of work my major actually entails (Electrical Engineer) I've done almost exclusively programming and I hate it. The company has been great to me! there hasn't been anything wrong but I don't like how far away it is from where I live (I drive an hour one way) and I'm not learning anything anymore. Just a boring desk job etc. 

I have plenty of opportunities to go work other places now most notably a couple of different car manufacturers but like I asked, is there any proper way to go about telling them I won't be returning? I should say that they want me full time when I graduate (I understand that is an awesome deal but I LOATHE working here) I also might do graduate school depending."
23z52d,2,2014-04-25,"Choosing an undergraduate college - Carnegie Mellon SCS, UC Berkeley EECS, other options",deathofthevirgin,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/23z52d/choosing_an_undergraduate_college_carnegie_mellon/,"I'm a senior in a San Diego high school who needs to make a college decision by the end of the month. These are my acceptances:

-Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science ($64k/year)

-UC Berkeley EECS with Regents ($30k/year)

-UC San Diego CS with full ride Jacobs Scholarship ($0k/year)

-UChicago ($50k/year)

My family would *just* be barely able to pay the CMU tuition at minor cost of living sacrifices to my parents with 70-80k in loans in total. However, I still feel like it would be a good decision *if* in the long-term a CMU degree would end up paying more than say a degree at Berkeley, which itself is an especially good offer because of Regents/priority class enrollment, etc. 

My family could easily pay off the Berkeley tuition without loans or debt. Another thing that Berkeley has going for it is the proximity to Silicon Valley, though I assume that after a CMU degree I would go to Silicon Valley anyway after undergrad. But for internships and creating a network during college, I think Berkeley has the advantage possibly. I'm not really considering UCSD or UChicago simply due to the strength of the CS program at the other universities.

SCS employment survey: http://www.cmu.edu/career/salaries-and-destinations/2013-survey/pdfs-one-pagers/SCS%20Post%20Grad%20Handout%202013.pdf

EECS employment survey: https://career.berkeley.edu/Major/EECS.stm

One thing to note above is that Berkeley has a much lower respond rate (43% v 94%) and the average student at Berkeley EECS is probably not as good as the average student at SCS, so the stats at Berkeley might be deflated such that comparison to SCS isn't that viable since there are different students at each program.

I'm more interested in straight CS than EE and I want to work at tech companies like Google, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon, Dropbox, etc. I'm not considering graduate school right now because from my research, it's not necessary for CS unless you're pursuing a career in academia - so the cost of potential graduate school shouldn't really affect my decision.

Any suggestions? Any help would be appreciated. Let me know if you guys need more info."

23zi4b,2,2014-04-25,Not even baby steps,takingaminute,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/23zi4b/not_even_baby_steps/,"I can't afford to move out, I have no income. Even if I did, I've got tons of shit on my head due to studying Physics and Computer Science at the same time and it's gonna stay that way till at least September, October.

Meanwhile situation at home is getting more and more tense. Dad is hitting the bottle pretty hard on weekends, he's got problems at work and his health problems cause him a lot of stress. And he doesn't know to deal with it in any other way. As a result my parents are either not speaking to each other (when dad's sober) or screaming at each other (when dad's drunk). Silly as it sounds, it's still taking its toll on me, even I'm almost 23 years old. It causes me to pretty much shutdown, I can't focus, I can't get anything done.

Lately I've also realized that I'm not over a girl that I thought I was over. I missed my chance with her last year and I thought I've dealt with it, but for some reason a month ago I started thinking about her again. And while I hoped to try it again (even if I'd get a straight 'no' this time, it would be better than this uncertainty), today it turns out that she's moving abroad for summer, so right now chasing this feeling would seem kinda selfish.

Only thing I've got going for me right now are my football practices. Going at it at offensive line helps me with all that stress. But even there it's not what it used to be, cause I've had to step up and take center position, which requires a lot of responsibility. I also still have some problems with snapping the ball (tho I know I just need practice), which doesn't help.

Overall I feel like I'm not moving forward at all. I hope I'll be able to get a summer internship, got an interview on Monday. But, while I'm good, I know that I'm not the best. And I know there's gonna be big competition. But I really hope I'll do well there, I really need it."
23zkt4,39,2014-04-25,"[trigger warning] Why did I need a ""Bad Guy""?",Polenicus,raisedbynarcissists,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/23zkt4/trigger_warning_why_did_i_need_a_bad_guy/,"For whatever reason, checking out the posts on the forum today led my thoughts to drift back to an old argument my parents had.

My Nmom had been going to school to get her Counselling degree. As soon as I turned 13, she had gleefully decided that I did not need as much parenting, and this was her opportunity to better herself by pursuing her dream life. This consisted of professional accolades, a shiny new convertible, and even a brief political career.

As she termed it, it was 'her turn'.

In the meantime, my Dad (The one with a full time job as the General Manager of a brand new printing plant) was tasked with parenting me, as Mom was too busy with her night courses and eventual internship. This put us in the unusual situation of our schedules being out of synch - We were never home when she was, and vice versa.

So, Dad and I started doing things together. We took up night skiing as a way for him and me to exercise, and we also spent time together on the family boat. We experimented with making kites and a remote controlled model boat, and essentially for the first time really spent time together.

This is a good thing, right? Apparently not.

Sometime after her courses finished, my Nmom grew dissatisfied with the situation. I don't know if it was because I brought home a poor test score, or she had audited my bank account and found it wanting, but she decided to rip into my father, with me listening in.

""You aren't willing to be the bad guy!"" She snarled at him. ""You're so proud of him, getting him his first bank account, without ANY limitations on it... he's going to get himself in debt and we're going to have to pay for it!"" (As a note, it was a junior savings account, not a credit card. Managing to accrue debt would be an accomplishment indeed.) ""He's already spending it irresponsibly!"" (I was spending my paper route money on things like a drink to take with me on said paper route, or things that interested me instead of, say, school supplies or new clothes).

She accused him of 'wanting to be my friend', and how he wasn't willing to be the 'bad guy', which meant SHE now had to swoop back in, take back parental control, and be the bad guy herself. She mocked the things we had been doing together and said ""That's not parenting!"" She said that she was going to take back the role of 'bad guy' and we were both going to regret it, because she was NOT happy about having to do it.

I had the thought today, after remembering this. A question I had never asked myself before.

""Why did I need a Bad Guy?""

I was never what you would classify as a 'problem child'. I was quiet, self-sufficient, the most trouble I got into was detention ONCE in my entire high school career, I was on the honor roll every year until graduating. I had a part time job since I was 14. I never threw parties, or even went to them. I never tried drugs or alcohol. I never wrecked the family car. I never spoke back or spoke disrespectfully to ANY of my elders, much less my parents. I didn't get into fights, I did my chores, I did my honest best to be grateful and helpful.

And yet... it was accepted without question that I needed someone in the family designated to hurt me. That me committing a wrong severe enough that I would need to be reduced to tears was a foregone conclusion. There were never any hands raised in my household, I was never hit... And more than once I had wish that I had been. Physical pain would have been easier for me to endure than being emotionally destroyed whenever I had displeased my designated 'Bad Guy'.

After that, my Dad and I still did things, usually on the weekends. I realize now that we never did things as a family. It was Mom and Dad, or me and Dad, but never Mom and me, or the three of us. Dad and I spent time together in the bits where Mom didn't need him. We didn't ski together anymore, even though after a few moves we had gotten a small ski chalet. He and Mom skied a lot, though. I remember when she fell once and broke her shoulder she screamed at him a lot for 'intentionally taking me on a run you knew was above my ability, that you KNEW I was going to fall on!'

There was a lot of that. Dad and I kinda got relegated to the kind of relationship a divorcee Dad has with his kids, only seeing them on the weekends. The rest of the week he was too busy with her needs, and I was too busy hiding from her. We never really evolved beyond that awkwardness; He never really knew what was going on in my life, and I could never trust him enough to tell him anything of substance, knowing that it would immediately go to her, and possibly be used against me.

I realize now, what a wonderful bit of awful, narcissistic brilliance this was on my Nmom's part. She justified her abuse as 'needed', and absolved herself of rancor because she insisted she didn't WANT to do it, but that there must be a 'Bad Guy'. She set my father up to be blamed, because he was unwilling to perpetrate the abuse, and me to be blamed because I was such a rotten kid I needed to have a 'Bad Guy'. And so she was free and clear to rage and scorn and judge all she wished, and then to extract apologies from us for making her do it."

I laid out all my bills and income in Excel from now until the end of summer and by the end of it, it looks like I'll be in a pretty nice position.

My problem is that my first paycheck will not arrive until May 30, but I have quite a few bills in the two weeks leading up to it which I won't be able to pay for myself. I could somewhat easily borrow from family, but I'm wondering whether a credit card would be good for this situation. I figure I could pay for these bills using credit starting on May 14, and be able to pay it off on May 30. Those bills add up to ~$1500.



I've never applied for a credit card before, so here's some info about my situation:

* 21 year old student (Junior)

* No debts or loans

* Held only a near minimum-wage student job for a year



So what do you guys think? Is this a good situation to start a credit card in, or should I rely on some family help?

If a credit card's a good idea, which one would be good for me? Thanks!"

I had a few internship interviews this week and I think I'm likely to be offered the position.

I've never done anything with databases before, but am very interested in learning how. I really want to get a leg up on my SQL knowledge before the internship starts this summer. I asked the interviewer to give me a bit more information on the actual database, but we didn't have time to go into great detail about it. 

Any tips? Thanks!

I'm a student at USF (South Florida, not San Fransico) and my term is coming to an end. I need to get a job or internship to help pay for college or, in the case of unpaid, get real-world experience and open opportunities. Unfortunately, I can't find anything that I qualify for. This is my first semester at USF, but I do have two years of general college under my belt from a high school early college program and I've self taught myself programming for many years; I like to believe I'm quite fluent in C++, C#, and Java and have a pretty fair understanding of what I'm doing in development. 

So far, all I've been applying for are jobs in warehouses and such nearby - good pay and pretty good work, but I'd really love to start working in computer science, or at least learning what real world development is like, as soon as possible. I want to learn and take the next step to being a better developer and do work that I'm passionate about.

However, all of the internships/jbos my college is advertising require applicants be seniors in the computer science department or have previous experience in the field - two things that I lack. Talking to advisors is fairly futile since they just say, ""get your internship the your senior year or the summer before it - it's on your flowchart"".

Do you guys have any advice for me to help find internships or work earlier than in 2-3 years from now?

EDIT: And of course I don't expect to be programming and my first job in the field to be all that important or exciting, but any step in the right direction would get me giddy."

I can't say I'm an expert about SF neighborhoods, but I do know that the Tenderloin has a pretty bad reputation.

240f28,1,2014-04-26,Me [21 M] with my GF [18 F] 6 months: GF is strongly opposed to marijuana; Threatens to break up if I smoke. Need outside input.,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/240f28/me_21_m_with_my_gf_18_f_6_months_gf_is_strongly/,"My girlfriend and I have been dating a short while (6 months), but things have been going well. I told her I loved her, and we have a very strong connection. She has learned a lot about me (childhood abuse, family issues, etc.) and I've seen her as a very very open minded/fairly liberal and accepting person.


She told me in the beginning she wasn't a fan of pot, and didn't care for people who smoked it. I said that's coo. I myself (who has only smoked once) am fine with it, but I don't use it. I told her that her opinion was fine with me, because it's not part of my life. 


Fast forward two months later, and I smoke for the second time in my life with some new friends (I'm interning in a different state for the semester). I reflect on it, and realize I did something that would make my GF uncomfortable with me, so I tell her the next day when I see her in person. I told her I fucked up and apologize. She cries, and tells me how she is now worried that she'll, ""be at school waiting for me to tell her what I've done next."" I feel guilty, apologize again, and we go on just fine. She says maybe one day she'll feel differently. She said she used to avoid dating anyone who drank, and I'm the first one she is comfortable with.


Fast forward, and I'm still living and interning out of state. The people I live with are solid interning dudes, good students, and they smoke pot regularly. They sometimes ask me to smoke with them, and without telling them why (GF), I just say no thanks. I think it over, and I think, ""This is silly. Pot is harmless. I should be able to smoke occasionally if I want.""


I figure my GF has thought it over, so I call her and ask how she feels about it. She says, ""I don't have much respect for people who smoke. I think it's an unintelligent choice, and I don't like it."" I tell her I want to smoke. MELTDOWN ENSUES. We are on the phone for 2 hours. She brings up every classic argument against weed. She tells me 

1. it's addictive 

2. will increase my anxiety (I get it occasionally) 

3. that I risk getting laced weed, because, ""that's what drug dealers do to sell more drugs.""

4. I will support the drug cartel

5. I am increasing the price of medical marijuana for those who need it more than those selling it.

6. It's a gateway drug (exact words), and with my family history (father/relatives drug addicts) I shouldn't. Fair enough, but I have never had issues.

7. Money wasted on pot is money that could be used to visit her (we live

8. Literally, any possible argument against it you can think.


She cries, swears, etc. and I'm proud of myself, because I keep calm and don't raise my voice. I explain to her that I have a great internship, I have 3.8 GPA, don't drink heavily, exercise everyday, and have never so much as gotten a speeding ticket. I counter her points to the best of my ability, and explain I'm not a degenerate. I'm not looking to make this a regular habit, or pour money into it. I simply want to the option to casually smoke if the opportunity arises. Nothing more. 


She says that she doesn't command me to do anything, so why can't I do this one thing. ""I don't dance with guys at parties, because I know it makes you uncomfortable."" I tell her that's completely different, and even she knows that there are plenty of scummy college dudes. A random dude grinding on your GF is very different than smoking, and I trust her completely. I tell her this is a tiny harmless thing, and that's why I do not want to be controlled. That really is the biggest issue. I never want to be TOLD what I can and can't do in a relationship, and obvious things (don't cheat, lie, etc.) don't fall under this category, as they are a given. 


In the end, she says she will break up with me if I can't respect her opposition. I tell her I disagree with her opinion. She asks to talk about something different in the meantime, since we've come to a stalemate. Neither one of us agrees with the other. That was two days ago, and it has not come up since. It's looming over my head, and I don't know what to do, or how to convince her it's harmless and that I'm not at risk. Or am I an asshole like she thinks I will be? 
 

This is completely out of left field, and I had no idea she felt THIS strongly about it. I always thought she was so open minded. Maybe she is just too young for me? I AM GOING TO TALK TO HER SO I KNOW THAT. PLEASE HELP!

***TL;DR: Girlfriend is strongly opposed to marijuana for reasons I believe are invalid; Will break up with me if I smoke. I simply want the FREEDOM to smoke if I choose. "

Worth noting is that I am already an american citizen since birth, but moved from the US shortly after I was born and have been living in Sweden my entire life ever since. It wasn't until last year that I finally got an opportunity to visit my true home again and I absolutely loved it.

I'm currently a second year student studying software development and am in a somewhat unique situation. I am attending school in Boston currently, but will be returning to Kansas City this summer and will be continuing my education at UMKC in the fall. I was hoping to secure an internship for this summer or next school year but, because I am in Boston, I am finding that to be rather difficult. 

Although my degree is in software development, I have aspirations to enter into the security field. Any internship that would give me some experience in this field would be awesome, but I would really like an internship with a smaller, startup company. I would prefer to intern at a small startup because I want to surround myself with like minded, creative, eager, people that share my passion for technology and security. 

One of the driving forces behind my search for an internship is my desire and eagerness to learn as much as I possibly can. Outside of my required coursework I spend a lot of time teaching (or trying to teach) myself various skills. I believe that I would gain a great deal of knowledge and experience through an internship that I am not able to gain in the classroom or at home in my free time so I would gladly accept an unpaid internship if an opportunity arose.

On a side note, I have talked with a handful of people in the security field and have reached out to a few companies already. I do realize that getting an internship in the security field is extremely difficult, or at least to my understanding it is.

I'm open to any guidance, feedback, or opportunities that you might have to offer me!"

I met my boyfriend online when I was 17, around September, and after couple months of courting (Talking all day every day, me skipping school just to talk to him... That kind of thing) we finally told each other how we felt. It was sweet, it was romantic, it was perfect. Ever since we met we were inseperable and we would make plans to meet and eventually, the next year in September, we met up and I was living with him (I was planning on dropping out of school after my fifth year because I couldn't take it anymore and I finally left sometime before Christmas.)

I lived in Scotland and he was going to school in France, I can barely speak a word of French so I somewhat rely on him quite a bit, as well as the fact that I obviously don't have a job so there's that. He told me along time ago that if I was happy with not working and not going to school then he would be fine with that and would take care of me, but he would still enjoy seeing me do something or studying something because he doesn't want me to wake up one night and regret my choice to stay at home and that if there was anything I wanted to do, he would make it happen. He was/is even willing to move to Scotland to work so I could maybe go to school or just so I could be closer to my family.

I feel scared that one day he will resent me for being at home doing what I want to do while he's working for the both of us and at the same time, I'm worried that I will eventually regret doing nothing for my whole life or maybe working as some waitress or a dead-end job because I need to get out or have money of my own. I hate asking people for things too - I rarely ever asked my parent's for anything and I have never to this day asked my boyfriend either - anything I've received from him has been a gift. I feel ashamed that I can't get him anything for birthdays and such and it really pains me.

But the thing is, I have no idea what I want to do! I spent years thinking about what would I could do that would bring me joy or excitement or entertainment and there's nothing. I went from marine biologist, to lawyer, to commercial pilot, to makeup artist... Everything seems mediocre, tedious and boring. I've spent my life hearing things like people should do what they love and that you shouldn't work a job that you hate and I want to stand by those principles but currently, I feel like dead weight and it's bringing me down.

As of a week ago, I had to return home to Scotland so I could renew my passport and because my boyfriend is doing an internship for school and for that he needs to go back to his home oversea. It's tearing me apart but maybe it will give me some time to think about what I want to do with my life. Being with him, he is/was all I ever thought about and I would do anything for him to make his life more comfortable, more enjoyable. I realise that our relationship is potentially very toxic having me rely on him for everything, not to mention the fact that he is pretty much my entire life. I don't talk to anyone else except one other friend but that relationship is toxic too (He likes me a lot, but obviously I have a boyfriend so I try to keep my distance but I'm genuinely afraid of how he would react if I stopped talking to him. He said that I'm the only person he cares about and if I disappeared, he didn't think he would care about anything anymore) and I have one girl friend in my life but we barely ever talked and she pretty much abandoned me when I left, she didn't respond to any text, didn't message me on facebook or whatsapp, just no contact at all.

I don't know what to tell him because I'm afraid that if I explain how I feel he would promote me staying here, as much as it would pain him and not to mention myself, so that I could have the life I want and the life he wants for us both. Writing this last paragraph bring tears to my eyes because he's all I ever wanted and now that we have each other, I don't want to do anything to jeapordise our relationship, but right now my and our future is hard to envision.  I don't know what he sees when he thinks about it because I know he does a lot, and I don't know where I am or what I'm doing in it. I don't want to eventually be something holding him down and the thing that he comes to hate, even if he tells me that's never going to happen.

EDIT: Even if I were to choose to stay behind, I only have 4 out of 5 classes from academy/high school required to go to university without some kind of condition and thinking about having to go to college just for one class supremely depresses me. An extra year spend on one class for the chance to do a 3-4 year course? I would rather throw myself under a bus, to me honest. Even though I know I'm still very young and I have the world at my feet, I just can't bear the thought of it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

TL;DR, I'm at a crossroads in my life where down one road, I have my boyfriend and being with him and doing whatever I want, but also relying on him greatly and being afraid of becoming something he despises, while down another road, I have the long-distance relationship again and all the fears and loneliness that goes along with it but also doing something productive with my life that could not only benefit me but the both of us. I'm feeling terrified and alone and worried about the outcome of whichever decision I choose to make."

I had to send it to my family home though across the country and it took about nearly a month from me ordering the parts until I was able to go home and build it and then bring it up to my house.

2419ht,1,2014-04-26,Tech School or UCF,gamerchick11,college,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/2419ht/tech_school_or_ucf/,"I am at a spot in life where I am trying to figure out what route would be best for me. I am aspiring to be an engineer and even got into the engineering program at FSU. However, I really didn't feel like I was learning and had difficultly obtaining an internship. (I don't have a car so I am limited in my travels) I am currently attending a community college to get my AA (heard it would be easier to transfer with it) and was intending to head to Orlando after getting it. 

My question is should I just look into Tech School or pursue the Co Op program that's at UCF (go for the EE degree)?"
241due,63,2014-04-26,"Thinking about breaking up, don't know if it's the right thing to do.",[deleted],TwoXChromosomes,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/241due/thinking_about_breaking_up_dont_know_if_its_the/,"My (F20) boyfriend (23M) and I have been together nearly 2 years now. We had the most passionately fiery of starts (despite living in Ireland and the UK), which ended up in me moving to the UK for several other reasons as well. I've been here for a year now, and couldn't be happier--except for my relationship. I also have confrontational anixety.

He's wonderful. He's unbelievably intelligent, practical, and determined, just finishing up a masters in engineering. He is caring, cuddly, and we have a great sex life. We have all the same opinions on life and where we are going, and we could really have an amazing future together. We've traveled far and wide, and been through a lot. People say we are meant for each other, and a lot of the time, I believe them.

The thing is we differ on one big thing. I am forgiving and non-confrontational. I try my best to be polite and to phrase things in the least offensive manner. He is petty, argumentative, and downright rude. He also loves to tease and torment and tickle (I hate being tickled, it's a nightmare), and can't stand any twinge of illogical thinking. And he picked it up from his parents, who are the most petty and bickering of people I have ever met (and hate each other--are only together because of him and the farm). I hate going to his house because it means enduring hours of ""nya nya nya nya you did this you said this nya nya"". And he can't deal with my anxiety at all, he just doesn't understand it.

He teases me constantly. I'm self-conscious about my boobs and have asked him not to tease me about them many many times. When rearranging my bra, ""Hey if you look hard enough down there you might find something!"" ""Aww that's sweet you've got an internship that'll pay £180 a week... That's alright you'll be hating me when I'll have a full-time paying job at the time!"" (Though he did at first say that was great and he was really proud of me). After saying I couldn't find something he had anywhere that I wanted ""Duh, it's called amazon?"" --Yeah I tried that... That is just the way he talks. Everything is a competition, everything I am stupid for if I'm not as good as him.

And when I call him out on it, he just says ""I'm only joking, you know that. Somebody can't take a joke..."" And gets annoyed with me.

And god forbid I ever tell him to stop tickling me! ""Oh, yeah, because I'm so horribly abusive aren't I... I'm really hurting you..."" Actually, yeah, I fucking hate it. And if I try to explain that, ""but this is how I've always been with all my friends and exes, and nobody else has ever complained.""

He is really really lovely. We have all the same hobbies, we care about each other immensely, he gives me little gifts, we cuddle for hours on end, he compliments me, he takes me places and vice versa. We agree on most of everything, and we have basically named our kids.

I just don't know if I'll ever be able to get used to it.

So, what do you think? Is it something worth putting up for, or trying to talk to him about? I highly doubt he'll ever change, and like I said most of the time it's absolutely fine, though he is better when it's just the two of us at my house without his parents. As a non-petty person though, I just don't know if this is something I can live with, especially with my anxiety acting up every single time he does something mean-spirited.

Thank you so much for reading!

TL;DR: Boyfriend loves to tease, and is often mean-spirited about perceived illogicality. I hate going to his house because of his parents and how he is around them, and they will be in his life forever. He is absolutely perfect for me otherwise, but I don't think he'll ever change. Is the relationship worth it?


EDIT: oh, and because of the anxiety I've been through, I now have IBS. Probably would have it anyway, but it's fascinating to watch the correlation between him teasing me and my stomach aches."

241m5p,3,2014-04-26,Salary/Career Questions? ~3 yr experience (unique story),zmathoftears,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/241m5p/salarycareer_questions_3_yr_experience_unique/,"In 2011 I was set to graduate with a CS degree. Through my own neglect/incompatibility my GPA was &lt;3.0. Due to a complication (money, not grade wise), my diploma was withheld. It's taken me 2.5 years to sort all that out, and I'll be graduating in about a month.

Before I found out they were going to be withholding my diploma, I had already gotten a job offer from a company. When I broke the news to them, they told me they were desperate enough for people that they would take me on as full time intern. I worked as an intern there for about ~2 years before being converted to full time (I'd been doing 40+ hours during the entire internship). 

Less then 2 months after that I was promoted and given a nice boost in pay. I got a small raise at the start of this year for market inflation. At this point I'm making ~58k a year (NE Ohio area for reference).

I am in no way a bad programmer, college just wasn't my thing. I work closely with another developer that graduated from the same school with a GPA in the 3.5's, and I frequently outperform them in terms of both depth and breadth of knowledge. I've also been awarded by my peers/company several times for my performance and dedication.

So my questions:

* Am I being underpaid given my experience? I've looked around (glassdoor), but I cannot really decide. I just don't know enough about other positions to say for sure. I see plenty of new graduates on here looking for 50-60k on hire.
* If I were to look for another job, will the industry recognize my three years, or treat me as a new graduate?
* If I did find a new job, what should my salary expectations be there?

**TL;DR;** I'm graduating in a month, but I've already been working full time (40+ hours a week) as a developer for 3 years. What should my salary expectations be? Could I be hired as if I had 3 years of experience given my graduation date?"

I've been working as an unpaid intern with a small agency for just over a month now. 

It may sound strange, but I genuinely feel employable. Is it totally unrealistic to think that I could land a junior developer position after 4 months of learning? Is it unheard of? 

There may be a position for me at the end of my internship, but I'm not sure I'd take it  – mostly working with templates, they've never heard of version/source control, lots of bad practices etc.."

I am in a bit of a dilemma as I am a graduating senior from the University of Arizona. I double majored in Accounting and Management Info Systems, and was planning on doing a Masters in MIS at the UofA next year still. 

This upcoming summer I have an internship with PwC in their Risk Assurance branch, in Seattle. When I was interviewing with firms last semester, I picked PwC because of the office visits and such, but I was hoping to be able to get into the Consulting/Advisory side, as I had these offers from other firms.

My recruiter at PwC said it would definitely be possible to shadow members of the Advisory branch and possibly interview for these positions. As of right now, I am thinking about foregoing my Master's, as I am hoping to start my career sooner than later and move to a new city. Does anyone have any experiences with switching from one branch of a firm to another after an internship?

Also does anyone have any ideas of where I could possibly look for off-season recruitment of consulting full time jobs at firms such as KPMG, Deloitte, Accenture, etc.

242t88,0,2014-04-26,How did you choose your grad school?,tootiefruitie,Physics,https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/242t88/how_did_you_choose_your_grad_school/,"I'm in a slight pickle right now and could use some advice.

A little about me: I am an applied physics undergrad at a small university on the East coast.  My school has very little research going on, so I have worked in industry since Freshman year to gain experience.  I am a very good student and have a strong academic record.  I am looking to attend grad school for Mat. Science or Chem. Eng. It sounds like a major swing from applied physics, but I tailored my classes to prep me for those programs.

Long story short, I was rejected from both original grad schools that I applied to. Stupid, I know.  In desperation, I applied to several others and was accepted two 3 of those.  

I am not interested in grad school ""SC"", since they were not very receptive to my application when I submitted it.  I assume they didn't meet their quota this semester.

Grad School ""NC"" is very interesting.  I visited their facilities a couple of weeks ago and was very impressed.  A couple of the faculty had very interesting research, and one offered me to work for her over the summer to get adjusted to the school. Overall, she and the entire department have been very supportive and their offer letter reflects that.  Pros and cons of this school:

&gt; Pros:

&gt; * No worries of funding. Their program has plenty of federal and industry involvement, so funding their labs is not an issue.
&gt; * Plenty of interesting research and inter-department collaboration.
&gt; * Very nice area surrounding the school.
&gt; * Very nice offer letter.
&gt; * Plenty of companies that collaborate with the department.  Job placement looks good.

&gt; Cons:

&gt; * Very large program. Coming from a small program, I am not sure of how the transition will go.

I am visiting grad school ""VA"" next week. Although their offer letter is not as good as ""NC"", one of my undergraduate professors graduated from there and personally knows most of the faculty.  I have some experience with a few of their faculty's research.  From what I understand, funding and facilities are both in plentiful supply.  Job placement is also good.

Recently, however, one of my original grad schools came back with an offer.  The professor that I wanted to research with received NSF funding, and can hire me into their new MS program.  My current boss graduated with a Ph.D. under the above professor.  The work I have been doing at my internship mirrors what his group does very similarly, so it would be a natural transition into his group.  The major benefit of this school is its name and recognition.  It is a very prestigious school and recognizable my most people in the USA.  However, I would be locked into that particular research to keep my funding.  I am not sure if that is what I would want to dedicate my life to in grad school.

I realize this is a very long post, but I honestly have no idea what to do.  With my original grad school coming back to the table, I'm not sure if it is worth it to accept the limited research options to get a name on my CV.

So, my question is ""simple"".  Why did you choose the grad school that you did?"

I'm not completely certain that this is the appropriated subbreddit for this sort of post (if not, can someone point me in the correct location?)

Currently, my life is going quite swiftly. Part-time job (typical evening shifts) and internship during the day. This is fine, but I find myself being a little less social then what I really want to be. I have a couple local friends here and there, and a handful of online buddies, however, I really would like to meet some new acquaintances of varies other hobbies.

This is the tricky part! With my internship and partime job, this barely gives me any time I would like to myself. At most, I get some free time during the evening after the internship, or at night after work. I would love to participate in maybe some local clubs/events, but my time somewhat restricts me.

What i'm looking for are some suggestions for some common, easy to attempt hobbies/clubs that typically reside around a city (my current location is Pittsburgh) and may be around my time criteria. My current hobbies already revolve around my computer, so I would like to look at a more broad range of options :D.

I know I have the correct mindset for attempting new hobbies, I just need a bit of an idea of some options."

* Have you gotten along well with UCR engineering professors? Have your grad classes been useful?
* How are the research facilities? I'm going to be thesis-track, so I'll probably be spending a lot of time in the labs.
* Do I have a realistic chance of getting a TA job my first semester? Or perhaps later? Regarding qualifications, I have three semesters of experience as an undergraduate TA.
* How many quarters do most MS (thesis track) students take to finish the degree? How many publications would they typically have their name on upon graduation?
* What do MS students typically do during the summer quarter? Continue research/classes, or leave for an internship?
* Anything else that you think that I should know? Or in other words, anything that you wish you had known before coming to UCR?

243m3k,32,2014-04-27,Planning a Halo Total Conversion mod,_Nakamura,starcraft,https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/243m3k/planning_a_halo_total_conversion_mod/,"Original topic on Bnet: http://us.battle.net/sc2/en/forum/topic/12675247492

Hello everyone,

I'd like to start off this topic by properly introducing myself, as I intend to lead a project with the goal of creation of a Halo mod for SC2. My name is Nakamura(as you can see), the project leader of the Age of Mythology: The titans Fan Patch, the Complex Enhanced mod for Homeworld 2 (and balancing associate of the Complex mod), and assisting developer of the Sins of the Prophets mod for Sins of a Solar empire. Some of these you may have heard of.

My focus as a mod developer is mainly in the design and balance area, but I'm a quick learner when it comes to programming, too. Currently I don't have much experience with the SC2 editor, but it seems less complicated than the naked code I'm used to working with - by the time the mod is bound to leave concept stages, I will have the necessary skills(and helping hands hopefully) to create the mod.

Recently I've played around with the thought of creating a Halo themed total conversion mod for Starcraft. This would basically create a huge opportunity to undo the damage that Ensemble Studios did to the Halo franchise when they released Halo Wars for the xbox.

Clearly Starcraft 2 is the best modern RTS out there, both when it comes to mechanics, accessibility to modding and the game itself (free arcade is HUGE for modders) along many, many positive features.

What I would like to do here is assembling a team that would be willing to carry through with this immense project.

But before that, I would like to share a list of main concepts that I wish to enforce on the mod in order to make it as professional as possible, and in order to satisfy you, the potential fans.

So the 10 point list is as follows: 

1) The mod will retain the main, non racial mechanics of Starcraft 2. Minerals, vespene gas, supply, main unit commands, unit energy for given abilities will all be in the game, as you are used to them.

2) Asymmetrical design and balance will not be taken to the extremes. All races will be able to deal with what is thrown at them, given proper preparation and execution. The goal is to keep the skill requirement to be near-equal between factions.

3) Units, with the exception of workers will not be able to shift into each other. This design decision provides battles on a larger scale, including multi-pronged skirmishes. It also effectively fights the much complained about ""deathball"" phenomena.

4)Each ability will require a certain type of mechanical skill to be used. Each ability will also have counters, either through moving units away from the effect, or setting up different, specific countermeasures (counter-spells, perhaps).

5) The mod will run on the ""normal"" speed. This will make newer players more easily get into the game, as the timer doesn't appear to be ""off"". The fast pace of SC2 will be achieved through unit stats, not through a time speed manipulation. If my information is correct, this taxes the hardware less, too.

6) The UNSC and Covenant will definitely be featured. Further factions will be up for internal discussion. The multiplayer aspect of the mod is not for storytelling. Sub-factions such as the insurrectionists, Covenant loyalists/separatists would only make the design clumped and overlapping. If we are to build a campaign, things like factions can be featured there, maybe.

7) No copyrighted material will be used - most assets will be created, but hopefully other mod teams will be lending us assets to speed up development.

8) The scale of the mod has no limits. If we can get popular enough, becoming an E-sport would be desirable, if legally applicable (such as DOTA did). Otherwise, community based events can go a long way, too.

9) The development team will consist of 4 departments: Designers/balancers, programmers, artists, and testers, who are going to be interns of the design/balance group mainly. It is recommended for each applicant to stick to only 1 department, as working in multiple can be quite tasking - just like with ""real jobs"".

10) Further into development, donations will be possible. These will be obviously greatly appreciated and spread out evenly for motivating the team. Donations may see use in cash tourneys as well, if legally applicable.

So these are the (very basic) concepts I would want a Starcraft based Halo RTS to have.
Please add me on the sc2 client (Nakamura #474), or join the ""Halo total conversion"" group, which is also on the client. A dedicated forum is in the making, but not completely ready yet.

If you wish to help out, you need to qualify to be in either of the following :
Programmer(works in the editor, codes stuff)
Artist(makes models, etc)
Designer/ Balancer(the creative mind behind the scenes/polishes design and unit stats)

Testers will be only needed when the mod is in alpha.

Share your thoughts on what you think should be in a Halo mod... and some name suggestions would be great, as I haven't managed to come up with any."

I'm an Electrical Engineering student from India. I'm in my pre-final year now, and I recently fell in love with Neuroscience. I started studying Ion-Channels using the Hodgkin-Huxley model, modeled the circuit on Python and had fun with it. I read Phantoms in the Brain by Dr. VS Ramachandran and it made me even more interested in this beautiful field.

But the problem is that I have a very low GPA (2.2 out of 4) and I'm finding it extremely hard to figure out what to do in order to get into research in this field. My college does not have a neuroscience department and I don't think any professor will give me an opportunity to work in their lab, given my lack of projects/experience in the field.

My question is what should I do now to nullify my bad grades? I know I need to start working, but I have no direction, no one to guide me. What should I read? What online courses should I take up? How do I get an internship or a Bachelor's Thesis in a Computational Neuroscience lab?

Can you guys give me some advice?

Thank you.

CUNY or SUNY?,natantantan,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/243xl0/need_help_with_choosing_a_college_cuny_or_suny/,"Hi I am a senior in NYC and want to major in Computer Science. Right now my choice is between CUNY CCNY and SUNY Stony Brook.

CCNY - Great school for CS and ABET credited. Upon graduation I will be completely debt free. Absolutely non- existent social life. Will have to commute 1 hour back and forth everyday between home and the college.

Stony Brook. Also great CS school. It's considered the best CS SUNY school. I will graduate with $40-50k debt after all four years. Will live on campus and in a dorm.

Originally I was considering CCNY because the debt free aspect is extremely appealing. On top of that, for computer science, name of school or even GPA doesn't really matter its all about what you can actually do and your internship. So graduating from both school should net me pretty much similar jobs.

However I am an extremely shy and introverted person and this is something I desperately want to fix. I made some progress in high school but I feel like CCNY would just act as an extenuation of High School. If I went to CCNY i would have to live at home with my parents (which sucks), would lose a lot of social footing/progress, and would generally be unhappy.

If I went to SUNY happiness wouldn't be guaranteed obviously but I would stop being so sheltered by my parents and would be able to finally have some freedom and live like an actually person. I feel like a dorm life would really help me get out of my introverted shell and help me work on my social skills.

Now I am leaning more towards SUNY as I feel this college experience really is worth the $40-50k in debt as it will completely shape me as a person and my future. Social skills are very important in life and if I go to CUNY I feel like I would regress and become even more shy and secluded. Also a lot of people graduate with 200k in debt so 40k isn't that bad. Plus I don't want to be stingy and miss out on a once in a lifetime experience because I was stingy with money.

I have been recently faced with a life dilemma and I would really appreciate some help making a decision of where to go from here. It's kind of a confusing backstory but I'll try to make it as clear as possible.

-I graduated college last year with my BS in Biology, and I want to be a physician assistant. I haven't been successful in getting into school yet, but I don't feel super bad about it because I know it's extremely competitive and I'm short on patient contact hours (so this would be like EMTing, nurses aide, phlebotomy, something of the like)

-I'm from the Northeast but after graduating I moved down to Texas where my dad lives to get into a new environment and take some classes. I got my EMT certification but don't want to work as an EMT down here because I was exposed to some serious sexism and horrible comments in the class and clinicals. I liked it otherwise though.

-I don't like Texas, I've found it really hard to make friends, I'm not a fan of my dad's wife and her kids, and it's just generally a place I wouldn't want to live even if it weren't for those factors. Basically I'm miserable here.

-My boyfriend is back up north, we've been together for 8 years and our relationship has been mostly long distance due to being at different colleges and me being in Texas for the last year. We're sick of seeing each other every couple months and I think we're both ready to take the step to move in together, at least until I go back to school, but figuring out logistics is proving difficult.

-I just finished up a phlebotomy class down in Texas. I still need to do a 2-week clinical portion. However this instructor is horrible and nobody in the class has a clinical placement yet, there is no indication I'll get one any time soon, and even though I need it to finish up the class, I don't want to sit on my ass for the whole summer waiting for one. Basically by the time I submit my applications in August I want to be doing something new for patient contact and I don't think I'll be done with clinicals and working as a phlebotomist by that time no matter where I go.

-If I move in with my boyfriend there is an EMS company that takes volunteers. I've been talking to them and it sounds like it would be a good opportunity with mostly young people doing the same thing I'm trying to do, so in short a much more comfortable environment than doing it down where I am now.

-Problem is it's volunteer, so I'll need a job, and I've been applying to multiple jobs every single day for months only to hear nothing. I got a call from an office that does internships with pre-med students and also has some jobs that might count as patient contact, but they pretty much told me that they're excited to meet me and to call and come in when I move up, which sounds nice but I don't want to depend on it.

-My boyfriend is visiting me in two weeks. If I want to drive up with him from Texas it would be most efficient for him to just not take his return flight and drive up with me, since I can't drive 1400 miles by myself and this would be one of my only opportunities to get up there before he starts classes for the summer and stuff.

-If I go up there without a job and I'm just EMTing until I do get a job, my savings can last me for at least a few months and since my dad knows that I'm trying really hard to do what I need to do, he's offered to help me out a little bit, so I have some time to play with as far as getting employment

So being a very thorough and logistical individual I've come up with the following options, and I'm sure you guys will probably think of others:

-Stay in Texas, wait for my clinical assignment which might take an unknown amount of time, and be somewhere that I really don't like being, away from my boyfriend, but it's free. Get work as phlebotomist in Texas which might be easier to do but I probably won't be able to get a job before I submit applications in August after the process of clinicals, examinations, certification, etc. Not something I want to do but if I need to then whatever.

-Go up with my boyfriend after he visits in 2 weeks, start EMTing to rack up patient contact hours right away, have a small possibility of an internship, but no guarantee of a job and a few months in which I need to get one. Be happy to be out of Texas and finally with my boyfriend, closer to home, friends, family, etc. My dad brought up the possibility of flying down to Texas for two weeks when I finally do get a clinical assignment

-Wait around for clinicals here whilst doing nothing, deal with the pain in the ass process of finding a way to get up to where my boyfriend lives after I'm done, hate being here the whole time for what I really think will be just wasting idle time when I could be doing something else

-Other option as yet unthought of by me or others I've spoken to.

So. Thoughts? Advice? Comments? I am very frustrated and need to make a decision soon. I know there are probably ladies on here that are older, wiser, more experienced, and/or more intelligent than I am so I would LOVE to hear everyone's thoughts. "

This is my first post ever. I have been monitoring and scouring the depths of /r/Relationships for the past 3.5 months for healing. Here's some background first:


**Background**

My ex [26F] and I broke up in December. The relationship lasted a little over 3.5 years. It was a toxic relationship. I have slight codependent tendencies, however her BPD (suspected, however the traits match) made things worse. I was gaslit like no tomorrow. It was absolute hell in the last 1.5 years of the relationship and to this day I have that strange gut feeling that she cheated, and more than once. More often than not the gut is right, but I was caught in her fog and gave her the benefit of the doubt more than I should have. 


There were many occasions where, according to what I've seen in similar posts on reddit, I should have left. But I didn't. The sad thing is, I never thought this would happen to me. Good looking guy, good attitude, street smart, graduate degree etc. Street smarts and a degree isn't enough. This can and WILL happen to anyone if you're not extra careful. Hindsight is 20/20


**Healing Process from Dec '13 - April '14**

I have sought help for the codependency. It really allowed me to gain some perspective and detach myself from my emotions momentarily to take a look at the big picture and understand where they are coming from. 


Don't get me wrong, I'm not a sensitive guy. I just cater to people too much. It also doesn't help that it's a part of my culture to be super accommodating to people, regardless of whether or not they're friends or acquaintances. I've learned to lay off of it and be more selective with who I trust and give my all to. I learned my lesson the hard way, but at least I learned it before it was too late (marriage, kids, divorce, custody battle, split assets etc).


I also started picking up all the old things I used to do before I got into the relationship with my ex. I started reading books again: I've read 5 within the last 2 months. Done a lot of soul searching too in the process. I started skateboarding again, which I set aside 6 years ago. Art was a huge passion of mine during the earlier parts of my life, however I've picked that up again and started doing some sketches. 


I used to be heavy into music production, and just started a DIY project and am currently transforming my room into a recording studio. Things are going pretty great. Oh and also, going to the gym EVERY MORNING which I never did to that extent. Upgraded my wardrobe and going for the smart-casual / semi-casual look. New hair-cut etc etc. Needless to say, people have taken notice and I've made a lot of new friends recently. 


Above all, the thing that ABSOLUTELY CRUSHED ME yet accelerated my healing process was how fast my ex-gf moved on. She started dating her current boyfriend 3 weeks after we broke up. She had the nerve to tell me back in January that she loved me up until the very last day. Also that she wasn't looking for a boyfriend, it just worked out that way. If you ever met my ex, you would think ""okay there buddy we really do believe"". 


Since the break-up, I hear things aren't going super amazing with her new boyfriend. It seems to be a pattern she has in every relationship: instant idolization and then she paints you black when you can't meet one small expectation. I feel she's the common denominator. Either way, her behaviour post-breakup has helped me tremendously. She cut me off of all social media after we broke up. She blocks and unblocks me from FB and Whatsapp a few times a month for whatever twisted reason she has. 


We used to attend a lot of parties together, and I made a lot of friends and acquaintances through her extended network. Some of them I still have contact with. Others that were either her own close female friends, or boyfriends of those girls, have cut me off as well. However I have since become closer to some of the people, girls especially, that I treated as acquaintances and chose to ignore to a certain extent at parties out of respect for my ex-girlfriend.


Funny thing is, I hear my ex is FURIOUS. She is getting people to do investigative work and determine whether or not I'm dating any of these girls I'm talking to. It's really sad and pathetic. She's trying to get her friends to ask them to stop talking to me. They aren't having any of it and told her that they like me and get along with me and they owe her nothing. Clearly, this isn't how a 26 year old should be acting.


**Fast-forward to Today**
*Thank you for being patient up to now*

So as you all can tell from above, I got my swagger back *Jay-Z meme*. I'm confident again, and back to being social. I'm regaining the 15lbs I lost over the course of 3 weeks due to my breakup. I successfully defended my Masters. I'm involved in organizations related to my career. Landed an internship. Doing more research. Things are looking up in my social and professional life. I'm very happy Reddit.


There's a girl [21 F] that I used to see at some of the parties with my ex. In the last 1-2 months, her and I have gotten closer. She's attractive; definitely my type of girl. She seems like a happy person and has a joie de vivre. I saw her again at an event post-breakup, and she added me to all forms of social media. We've been interacting through there. Yea, not as good as in person. That's why I'm here. While I'm over my ex and confident again, I am nervous.


Her and I have the same taste in music. We get along well. She also enjoys reading, and sketches too. She's smart and just finished her undergrad last week. We have this little thing (huge giveaway here goddamnit hoping she isn't on reddit) where we take screenshots of the current song we're listening to and send it to each other with a caption. This has been going on for 2 weeks now. And it's in the middle of the night (11pm-1am zone, sometimes later). Judging by how fast the responses are, I can only assume that she is only talking to me. She seems to be interested in her interactions, sending me songs with ""hinting"" titles (Missing You, All of Me, etc)


So reddit, this is where you come in. Again, I'm nervous. I already told her last week that we should meet up when her exams are done. She said sure thing. Well, her exams are done. I want to take her out. Asking isn't the issue. It's where to take her. How to behave when I'm there. Like I said, I'm cool and level-headed atm but this is my first BIG CRUSH in a LONG TIME. Legit crush here reddit homies. I don't want to fack this up. Need your advices


Thank you for reading through this, I love you all.

SO I WALKED OUTSIDE, AND I FOUND A TIMETRAVELER WHO TOLD ME HE KILLED ARCHDUKE FRANZ FERDINAND AND ABRAHAM LINCOLN, WHICH IS WEIRD BECAUSE WHY WOULD HE DO THAT? SO JUST WALKED ALONG, THINKING THAT EVERYTHING WAS FINE NOW, WHEN THE SKY TURNED RED FOR SOME REASON.

THEN I FOUND A YARD SALE THAT WAS SELLING GAMES. I FOUND A POKEMON ONE THAT WAS JUST A BLANK CARTIRAGE WITH POKEMON WRITTEN ON IT IN MARKER. I SAID ""I'LL TAKE IT."" AND THE YARD SALE GUY WAS LIKE ""DUDE, THAT GAME IS HAUNTED."" AND I WAS LIKE ""BITCH I DON'T CARE."" THEN I PUNCHED HIM IN THE GUT AND LEFT HIM FIVE DOLLARS (WITH THREE DOLLAR TIP, OF COURSE). WHEN I GOT HOME, I STARTED PLAYING THE GAME. THE INTRO WAS HITLER GIVING A SPEECH AND NAZIS GOOSE STEPPING THROUGH A CONCENTRATION CAMP, AND IT WAS ALL HYPER-REALISTIC. WEIRD. AND I HEARD THE LAVENDER TOWN THEME BEING PLAYED ON AN ENDLESS LOOP, AND I THOUGHT ""FUCK."" BUT THEN IT WAS OKAY,

BECAUSE I FOUND A SECRET THAT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO BE IN THE GAME, AND I FELT PROUD. I THEN REMEMBERED THAT BEFORE I LEFT, THE YARD SALE GUY TOLD ME THAT THE KID WHO OWNED THIS GAME PUT SATANIC POWERS IN IT AND COMMITED SUICIDE, BUT THEN I REALIZED THAT I DIDN'T GIVE A SHIT AND KEPT ON PLAYING. THEN HEROBINE CAME ON THE SCREEN FOR SOME REASON AND SAID MY NAME, EVEN THOUGH I DIDN'T TELL THE GAME MY REAL NAME. CREEPY, HUH? SO I KEPT ON PLAYING AS NORMAL. I WAS TRYING TO LIVE CHILDHOOD NOSTALGIA WHEN SOME UNOWN FLASHED ON THE SCREEN, AND WHEN I TRANSLATED IT, IT SAID ""LOOK BEHIND YOU."" SO I DID AND THAT CREEPY GIRL WAS THERE AGAIN, NOT DISEMBOWELED FOR SOME REASON. I PATTED HER ON THE HEAD, THEN WENT BACK TO THE GAME. I DECIDED TO TAKE A BREAK (BUT I COULDN'T TURN THE GAME OFF, WTF?) WHEN I FOUND SOMEONE PM'ED ME THIS THING THAT I COULD HACK THE GAME WITH,

SO I DID WITHOUT QUESTIONING ANYTHING. I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT IT WOULD DO. THEN CHARACTERS STARTED TELLING ME TO TURN BACK, TURN OFF THE GAME, AND TO NOT GO TO LAVENDAR TOWN, BUT I SAID ""FUCK THAT SHIT"" AND WENT THERE ANYWAYS. I WALKED UP TO SOME KID AND TALKED TO HIM. HE SAID ""BEN DROWNED"" I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE FUCK THAT MEANS, BUT WHATEVER. SO I LEFT LAVENDAR TOWN BECAUSE THE MUSIC MADE ME WANT TO COMMIT SUICIDE. SOMEONE SAW ME, THEN I FROZE. HE WALKED UP TO ME AND SAID HE WANTED TO FIGHT. BUT WE DIDN'T FIGHT. THESE WEIRD MUTATED CREATURES DID. MINE ONE, AND HIS SUNK INTO THE GROUND. THEN I STOLE HIS MONEY, AND THEN ROBLOX. THEN THE GAME DELETED ITSELF, AND I COULDN'T GET IT BACK. NOW THAT THAT WAS OVER, I DECIDED TO WATCH TV. BUT BEFORE THAT, I WENT BACK ON THE COMPUTER, AND A FRIEND OF MINE WHO WAS ALSO AN INTERN AT NICKOLODEN LIKE ME HAD SENT ME A WEIRD FILE. IT WAS CALLED ""SUPERSUICIDESPONGEMOUSE.AVI"" USING MY L33T SKILLS AND ""FAGGOT.EXE"", I GOT THE FILE ON MY TV AND WATCHED IT. IT WAS A LOST EPISODE OF SPONGEBOB SQUARPANTS AND IT WAS CALLED ""GOODBYE (INSERT MY NAME) SQUAREPANTS, WHAT THE FUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SO THEN THERE WAS ALL THIS VIOLENCE AND BLOOD AND SHIT, INCLUDING A SOVIET GULAG. THEN THE CREEPY LITTLE GIRL COMMITED SUICIDE, AND I FOUND OUT THAT A LOT OF CHILDREN COMMITED SUICIDE WHEN THEY WATCHED IT. THEN THE SKELTON POPPED OUT AGAIN AND KILLED ME. THE END.

244f9c,3,2014-04-27,"Questions about student internships: Is job shadowing the same thing? Does a combo of volunteering and free-lancing still count as good experience, or are internships necessary?",dragonscampfire,PublicRelations,https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicRelations/comments/244f9c/questions_about_student_internships_is_job/,"I am studying PR and Marketing in Canada.  I am  29, and decided to go back to school for a career change.  I will graduate next April.  The economy is a bit better here, than in the states, but I kind of have a fear of unemployment.  I hope to have an entry level job in my field upon graduation, and then I can use that  experience to obtain a job in Toronto, where all of the PR/Marketing jobs are found.



Do I need an internship after graduation?  My school only offers to set you up with an internship if you have the highest marks in the class.   Is it possible to find one's own internship?  IF so, how exactly?  I don't have classes every single day, so maybe I could do a part time internship during the school year? Is that a thing that people do?   Will I be screwed if I don't have an internship?  What about job shadowing.  Is that the same thing?  




Also, since employers are simply looking for experience (hence internships), can't I replace an internship with a combo of volunteer work?  I already sit on two non-profit boards on a Marketing advisory committee, and a community relations committee.  I also plan to do some free lance work  with a class mate, and to volunteer as much as possible in my field of study throughout the school year.  



Also, I want to start a group on Meetup.com for my own interest, to show that I am a 'self starter', and to get experience in corporate sponsorship (many groups on meetup.com have them).   I will be doing lots and lots of informational interviews with people working in my field of study, as well as going to lots of networking events.  Of course I have a blog and am active on social media.   You would think that after all of that, someone would throw me a job.  Who can tell though ?!  :/



Will all of these things give me enough experience, if I cannot find an internship, or do I NEED an internship?  Of course I would rather be working than interning immediately after I graduate, and am prepared to do the work necessary to reach that goal.  



What do you think? Opinions/advice/comments?"
244nn1,0,2014-04-27,Why UNC is a good school for Hope,musingsontap,PKA,https://www.reddit.com/r/PKA/comments/244nn1/why_unc_is_a_good_school_for_hope/,"First I must admit I have some bias, since I graduated from there. So I will present my case subjectively. Fuck Dook.  

UNC-Chapel Hill is a great school, because it offers a wide array of disciplines, and offers them well. It has a competitive business school, journalism school, nursing school, and other such professional schools. In addition, their Comp-Sci program offers a ton of hands on opportunities..including robotics and an internship class where you work with real businesses.  

Astronomy/Physics is pretty amazing too. In my 101 class I was able to set up telescopes in Chile to take pictures of Saturn's rings. It was crazy. In 102 I learned about dark matter and the different theories of Universal expansion.  

They have a first class study-abroad program that'll open doors to most parts of the world. Live in someone's home in Spain for a semester, or venture out to Australia or Hong Kong.

Their Bio/Chemistry departments are pretty great too and will prepare you pretty well for any discipline you wish to undertake after undergrad...   

Except Engineering. Arguably if Hope wants to pursue Engineering she should go to NC State.  

Enough about academics.  

UNC is so freaking gorgeous, it has such a beautiful campus with tons of history. It is large, but not huge. You can get lost in the crowds if you please, but you can have your small community feel if you seek it.  

It has a pretty phenomenal athletics program. So many D1 teams that offer all sorts of entertainment and engagement, from Football, Soccer, Basketball (Obviously), to the more obscure such as swimming/diving, lacrosse, volleyball and fencing- where the Tar Heels represented at the National Championships. They also have a club team for almost everything else too including Ultimate Frisbee.  And duh basketball games are freaking exciting to go to, the energy levels in the Dean Dome are incredible to experience. Did I mention, fuck Dook?  

In addition, while I lived there I was able to work three part time jobs, and they were all super flexible with my schedule always putting school first. I lived in the dorms all four years and it felt like I was ensconced in a tucked away college away from the ""real world"". The campus is its own part of Chapel Hill away from busy businesses, other schools, or dense residential communities. It truly is magical. Oh, also the bus system is Chapel Hill is fantastic! It is free, and offers routes to almost any part of Chapel Hill you'd want to go. Live on South Campus? Hop on the RU and get to class right on time. Having a night out? Hop on the P2P (point to point) for a safe and fun night. Want to go to Southpoint and watch a movie? Pay $2 and get on the Triangle Transit and hang out there all day.  

It has amazing in-dorm tech support (that was me). Vast libraries. Awesome spacious quads to skip class and sleep under the sun..ahem.. I mean eat lunch. The dining halls..well they're trying to renovate them I really do hope they improve by the time Hope gets there. But Franklin St. .5 miles away has all the cuisine you can possibly desire.  

Finally, it is a very practical school for Hope to go to. North Carolina has great in-state tuition for the public schools. 1 year here is the equivalent of about 1/4 year at Duke in tuition. Also,  Durham is ghetto. Leave the campus and you get mugged. Even walking around at night feels like someone's going to jump out from around a tree at you. It is very close to home, less than an hour so she can see family often and do laundry. Lastly, especially in NC, but in other parts of the US too, UNC is very well recognized name giving it plenty of value on a resume.  "
244qtg,4,2014-04-27,Difficulty finding jobs with a dismissed criminal record? Input needed (Details inside),shamefulanony69324,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/244qtg/difficulty_finding_jobs_with_a_dismissed_criminal/,"First off, I know I will most likely catch a lot of flak for this, and I most certainly deserve this.


I am currently entering my sophomore year at university.

During my freshman year, (first semester) I made a VERY dumb decision, and was arrested, and charged with 3-4 charges regarding marijuana. I payed for my lawyer, and was entered with a plea deal that will get all the charges dismissed, upon a year long probation with no hiccups.  

Now I KNOW this was a horrible mistake, it haunts me in my thoughts every night. Since then, I have given up drinking, smoking, anything that basically inhibits my ability to study or be a better person. I used that shame, that anger at myself, to push me to do my best. My grades have begun picking up, and I have two jobs, both paying very well for a college student.

As of right now, my GPA is floating around 3.0 - 3.1, and I am taking full summer hours this summer as well, in hopes of picking up even more slack, and hopefully raising my GPA as much as possible. 


Now, I have a few questions, and I figured here would be the best place to ask. 

What sort of difficulties will I face in the future? Will finding internships be impossible, or will I be able to correct myself in the future? How do employers view dismissed charges on a record? How do employers view dismissed charges on a record that have a decent time lapse from the event with no other history? (as in, If i apply for jobs when i graduate, 4 years from now, Would employers give more slack to seeing I have changed, or would it be an immediate disqualifier?)

I have used this event as fuel to make ME as good of a person as possible. I hope to learn as much, and more, as all of my colleagues in college, in order to separate myself from them.
 There is not a day that goes by without me regretting my past decisions and idiocy, but whats done is done.  I realize this may be a crippling entity in my search for a job, and my mindset is 
""If I can make myself the best person for the job, regardless of prior charges and history, hopefully they will look over that as youthful indiscretion""

As a side project, I have begun learning the basics of coding applications in android via eclipse and androids SDK, as well as pursuing my studies ahead of time (For instance, I have begun doing classwork and labs for next semesters classes, this summer.) 

I would appreciate any input, tips, help, or support and criticism you have to throw my way. "
244rg9,3,2014-04-27,I can't remember to take my meds.,[deleted],ADHD,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/244rg9/i_cant_remember_to_take_my_meds/,"I've been on Ritalin since November. The first few days went great, I took it the recommended four times a day and it had effect. After that it went down rapidly. Pretty soon it was down to once a day. For the past two months or so it's become a real problem. In a good week I take maybe one or two pills. Not daily, but across the whole week. I'm working an internship 9-5 and another job plus volunteer work besides that. I really can't afford to be this unproductive.

I've tried a lot of reminders. Put notes on my door, my alarmclock, my bed, my desk, anything. Setting an alarm on my phone doesn't work for me, I dismiss it and instantly forget about it. I've tried apps that are designed for remembering medication. When I ask others to remind me they don't think about it and quite frankly it isn't their problem. When I get ready in the morning there's pills everywhere I go but it still doesn't cross my mind to take one. There's no one to remind me then, nor in the evening. I take them with me too, just don't think about it. I don't have fixed co-workers that I can ask to help, also I feel reclined to say something about having to take meds. 

I forget a lot of things, not just this. But this is directly affecting my daily life in so many ways. My todo list is longer than fits on my window but that's not such a big problem. I know exactly what I need to do and when and how, I just never think about it. For deadlines and appointments I have a wall calendar, that's very effective. My walls are plastered with lists and post-its. For taking pills I can't find a solution though. I have a buttload of work to do, if I don't take my meds I'll be in some serious shit. 

What worked for you? Is there something that helps?"

244ujj,9,2014-04-27,Planning a Halo Total Conversion mod,_Nakamura,halo,https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/244ujj/planning_a_halo_total_conversion_mod/,"Original topic on Bnet: http://us.battle.net/sc2/en/forum/topic/12675247492

Hello everyone,

I'd like to start off this topic by properly introducing myself, as I intend to lead a project with the goal of creation of a Halo mod for SC2. My name is Nakamura(as you can see), the project leader of the Age of Mythology: The titans Fan Patch, the Complex Enhanced mod for Homeworld 2 (and balancing associate of the Complex mod), and assisting developer of the Sins of the Prophets mod for Sins of a Solar empire. Some of these you may have heard of.

My focus as a mod developer is mainly in the design and balance area, but I'm a quick learner when it comes to programming, too. Currently I don't have much experience with the SC2 editor, but it seems less complicated than the naked code I'm used to working with - by the time the mod is bound to leave concept stages, I will have the necessary skills(and helping hands hopefully) to create the mod.

Recently I've played around with the thought of creating a Halo themed total conversion mod for Starcraft. This would basically create a huge opportunity to undo the damage that Ensemble Studios did to the Halo franchise when they released Halo Wars for the xbox.

Clearly Starcraft 2 is the best modern RTS out there, both when it comes to mechanics, accessibility to modding and the game itself (free arcade is HUGE for modders) along many, many positive features.

What I would like to do here is assembling a team that would be willing to carry through with this immense project.

But before that, I would like to share a list of main concepts that I wish to enforce on the mod in order to make it as professional as possible, and in order to satisfy you, the potential fans.

So the 10 point list is as follows:

1) The mod will retain the main, non racial mechanics of Starcraft 2. Minerals, vespene gas, supply, main unit commands, unit energy for given abilities will all be in the game, as you are used to them.

2) Asymmetrical design and balance will not be taken to the extremes. All races will be able to deal with what is thrown at them, given proper preparation and execution. The goal is to keep the skill requirement to be near-equal between factions.

3) Units, with the exception of workers will not be able to shift into each other. This design decision provides battles on a larger scale, including multi-pronged skirmishes. It also effectively fights the much complained about ""deathball"" phenomena.

4)Each ability will require a certain type of mechanical skill to be used. Each ability will also have counters, either through moving units away from the effect, or setting up different, specific countermeasures (counter-spells, perhaps).

5) The mod will run on the ""normal"" speed. This will make newer players more easily get into the game, as the timer doesn't appear to be ""off"". The fast pace of SC2 will be achieved through unit stats, not through a time speed manipulation. If my information is correct, this taxes the hardware less, too.

6) The UNSC and Covenant will definitely be featured. Further factions will be up for internal discussion. The multiplayer aspect of the mod is not for storytelling. Sub-factions such as the insurrectionists, Covenant loyalists/separatists would only make the design clumped and overlapping. If we are to build a campaign, things like factions can be featured there, maybe.

7) No copyrighted material will be used - most assets will be created, but hopefully other mod teams will be lending us assets to speed up development.

8) The scale of the mod has no limits. If we can get popular enough, becoming an E-sport would be desirable, if legally applicable (such as DOTA did). Otherwise, community based events can go a long way, too.

9) The development team will consist of 4 departments: Designers/balancers, programmers, artists, and testers, who are going to be interns of the design/balance group mainly. It is recommended for each applicant to stick to only 1 department, as working in multiple can be quite tasking - just like with ""real jobs"".

10) Further into development, donations will be possible. These will be obviously greatly appreciated and spread out evenly for motivating the team. Donations may see use in cash tourneys as well, if legally applicable.

So these are the (very basic) concepts I would want a Starcraft based Halo RTS to have. Please add me on the sc2 client on AM servers (Nakamura #474), or join the ""Halo total conversion"" group, which is also on the client. A dedicated forum is in the making, but not completely ready yet.

If you wish to help out, you need to qualify to be in either of the following : Programmer(works in the editor, codes stuff) Artist(makes models, etc) Designer/ Balancer(the creative mind behind the scenes/polishes design and unit stats)

Testers will be only needed when the mod is in alpha.

Share your thoughts on what you think should be in a Halo mod... and some name suggestions would be great, as I haven't managed to come up with any."

When I talk to Dave he hasn't changed at all, doesn't show any signs of hostility or jealousy towards me and though we don't hang out as much, nothing's really different than it was before.  

Everything for the most part is fine, except that Sally has been basically ignoring me whenever Dave's around, which obviously makes me feel horrible.  Not that big of a deal, except I think she's realized that I'm crushing on her and now is more stand-offish like she's trying not to lead me on.  I'm not really looking to win her over or anything because I understand her situation and frankly I just don't want to cause more problems when she's already stressed out with how busy she is.  

I'm looking for a solution to this.  I searched through this subreddit looking for similar questions and the main answers I saw were basically ""wait it out"" and that it happens to everyone at this age.  I get that, but I'm also wondering if simply being more transparent about everything would help.  

Would opening up to Sally and letting her know that she doesn't have to worry about leading me on be a good idea?  Do I talk to Dave about the situation and make sure he understands that it's not about him or me but it's Sally that just has too much going on and doesn't want any kind of relationship?  I'd really rather not just break off contact with either of them, and to be honest it's not really an option.  Any kind of advice would be appreciated.

**TL;DR Bro and I interested in a mutual friend, starting to ruin the friendship between the three of us**

Edit: Thanks to everyone who commented, ironically I think I will end up waiting for a bit before I decide whether I'll bring it up with them or distance myself a bit.  Even though I'm not doing anything right away, I feel more confident about the situation now that I have a better idea of my options.  I'm glad I didn't throw another teenage relationship question at this subreddit for nothing.  Really appreciate all the advice."

Everything for the most part have been good and despite being in different colleges, we are still together. However, I constantly feel like I'm the one putting all the efforts into the relationship and I feel like that's the case because it's expected of me. For example, last month, we were Skyping and she kept saying how much she missed me. So I visited her during my Spring Break even though that meant missing work and spending time with my friends. But if I ever were to ask her to do the same for me, I know that she'll tell me she'll try, but always find an excuse not to. This summer, she was going to apply for an internship here in my hometown because she used to live here and knew people around. But today, I just found out that she never even applied to work here. When I confronted her about it, she said that she didn't do so because of reasons she doesn't want to talk about (which I respect), but the part I feel bummed out about is that she wasn't as excited to spend time together as I was for the summer. She then mentioned it's her life and that it was none of my business to control her academic life. I guess in the end, the difference between us is that we react differently to bad news, such as if I ever offend her, she would say too bad and if she ever offends me, I would try to defend myself. 

Well, I am also clinically depressed and have anxiety, so I was wondering if I was overreacting or being too attached? 

I feel like I left out a lot of details, so if you have any questions let me know."
24664x,307,2014-04-28,I call in sick one day and come back to this,Egren,talesfromtechsupport,https://www.reddit.com/r/talesfromtechsupport/comments/24664x/i_call_in_sick_one_day_and_come_back_to_this/,"Hey there, tfts. Been lurking for a few months simply for entertaining stories, and so comes the time where I have a little story to share.

First, semi-obligatory backstory; I've been doing an IT-focused internship for a small company (10 people), where the main task has been to create an Access database with various functions to ease the time spent on paperwork for the employees as well as the owner. Most of the people here are fairly tech illiterate, and so my responsibilities have grown over time to include anything related to any of the four computers, the three printers, cell phones, ^and^battery^chargers.

I had gotten most of the basic functions, forms, relations, etc in the database to work, and so it was time to set up the front-end on two additional computers. This required me to install Windows 7 because Office 2013 won't install on an older OS (and because screw Windows 8). Something had to have been done eventually anyways, because these computers were completely swamped with all kinds of malware you could imagine. Said and done, I reformat both hard drives and install a fresh copy of Windows 7 onto it, and go through the process of installing the most basic programs needed. I spend the next couple of days implementing a second, more limited version of the database front-end for the employees to use. Then, last friday, I had to call in sick.

Now, not thirty minutes ago, I came back in to keep polishing said secondary front-end. I start working right when the first scheduled break starts, so I hit up the browser to do some obligatory redditing. And *bam*. I am welcomed by the sight of Search Conduit. After leaving this computer unattended for a single day.

Now, I know a thing or two about computers, but because of this fact, I've never had these problems myself. I am probably going to spend the rest of the day and maybe the next tearing my hair out trying to scratch off every little bit of this annoying spyware, and no one seems to take responsibility for it either. We'll see how this goes.

Not the usual stories, just wanted to vent a little."
2468ub,5,2014-04-28,Planning a Halo Total Conversion mod for SC2,_Nakamura,HaloModding,https://www.reddit.com/r/HaloModding/comments/2468ub/planning_a_halo_total_conversion_mod_for_sc2/,"Original topic on Bnet: http://us.battle.net/sc2/en/forum/topic/12675247492

Hello everyone,

I'd like to start off this topic by properly introducing myself, as I intend to lead a project with the goal of creation of a Halo mod for SC2. My name is Nakamura(as you can see), the project leader of the Age of Mythology: The titans Fan Patch, the Complex Enhanced mod for Homeworld 2 (and balancing associate of the Complex mod), and assisting developer of the Sins of the Prophets mod for Sins of a Solar empire. Some of these you may have heard of.

My focus as a mod developer is mainly in the design and balance area, but I'm a quick learner when it comes to programming, too. Currently I don't have much experience with the SC2 editor, but it seems less complicated than the naked code I'm used to working with - by the time the mod is bound to leave concept stages, I will have the necessary skills(and helping hands hopefully) to create the mod.
Recently I've played around with the thought of creating a Halo themed total conversion mod for Starcraft. This would basically create a huge opportunity to undo the damage that Ensemble Studios did to the Halo franchise when they released Halo Wars for the xbox.

Clearly Starcraft 2 is the best modern RTS out there, both when it comes to mechanics, accessibility to modding and the game itself (free arcade is HUGE for modders) along many, many positive features.
What I would like to do here is assembling a team that would be willing to carry through with this immense project.

But before that, I would like to share a list of main concepts that I wish to enforce on the mod in order to make it as professional as possible, and in order to satisfy you, the potential fans.

So the 10 point list is as follows:

1) The mod will retain the main, non racial mechanics of Starcraft 2. Minerals, vespene gas, supply, main unit commands, unit energy for given abilities will all be in the game, as you are used to them.

2) Asymmetrical design and balance will not be taken to the extremes. All races will be able to deal with what is thrown at them, given proper preparation and execution. The goal is to keep the skill requirement to be near-equal between factions.

3) Units, with the exception of workers will not be able to shift into each other. This design decision provides battles on a larger scale, including multi-pronged skirmishes. It also effectively fights the much complained about ""deathball"" phenomena.

4)Each ability will require a certain type of mechanical skill to be used. Each ability will also have counters, either through moving units away from the effect, or setting up different, specific countermeasures (counter-spells, perhaps).

5) The mod will run on the ""normal"" speed. This will make newer players more easily get into the game, as the timer doesn't appear to be ""off"". The fast pace of SC2 will be achieved through unit stats, not through a time speed manipulation. If my information is correct, this taxes the hardware less, too.

6) The UNSC and Covenant will definitely be featured. Further factions will be up for internal discussion. The multiplayer aspect of the mod is not for storytelling. Sub-factions such as the insurrectionists, Covenant loyalists/separatists would only make the design clumped and overlapping. If we are to build a campaign, things like factions can be featured there, maybe.

7) No copyrighted material will be used - most assets will be created, but hopefully other mod teams will be lending us assets to speed up development.

8) The scale of the mod has no limits. If we can get popular enough, becoming an E-sport would be desirable, if legally applicable (such as DOTA did). Otherwise, community based events can go a long way, too.

9) The development team will consist of 4 departments: Designers/balancers, programmers, artists, and testers, who are going to be interns of the design/balance group mainly. It is recommended for each applicant to stick to only 1 department, as working in multiple can be quite tasking - just like with ""real jobs"".

10) Further into development, donations will be possible. These will be obviously greatly appreciated and spread out evenly for motivating the team. Donations may see use in cash tourneys as well, if legally applicable.

So these are the (very basic) concepts I would want a Starcraft based Halo RTS to have. Please add me on the sc2 client on AM servers (Nakamura #474), or join the ""Halo total conversion"" group, which is also on the client. A dedicated forum is in the making, but not completely ready yet.

If you wish to help out, you need to qualify to be in either of the following : Programmer(works in the editor, codes stuff) Artist(makes models, etc) Designer/ Balancer(the creative mind behind the scenes/polishes design and unit stats)

Testers will be only needed when the mod is in alpha.
Share your thoughts on what you think should be in a Halo mod... and some name suggestions would be great, as I haven't managed to come up with any."
246aor,6,2014-04-28,SE Asia trip - some advice?,thatslexi,travel,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/246aor/se_asia_trip_some_advice/,"Hi!

I'm a 20yo girl and I'll be studying in Shanghai from April to July 2015 (will be 21 by then). After that, I'll have finished my degree and that's why I'd like to take some time to travel in SE/E Asia.

I would love some advice on my itinerary, on the travelling itself, etc. Since I still have a year to plan all that, I am open to other suggestions too, as long as they aren't too expensive!

So:

-I have a pretty tight budget once I'm there, but my parents agreed to help me do the journey preparation: vaccines, visas, etc. and part of the accommodation and plane/train/bus/etc. expenses

-I am a girl traveling alone

-I don't speak any Asian language (but I'll have studied Chinese for 3 months and lived in China during the same time), but I speak fluent English. I'm French.

-I don't have that much time, since I won't have much money and will need to come back to France and find a job

-I'll be carrying all my stuff from the 3 months in Shanghai, which means I probably won't have very appropriate gear and my backpack will be pretty heavy (I will try to let go as much stuff as I can before leaving, but my 19"" computer will be coming with me, for example.)

-I love museums and cultural visits, I like eating cool stuff

-I need advice on my itinerary and my way of traveling (couchsurfing, hostel, more high-end hotel?)

Here is what I've planned for the moment:

CHINA 

-Shanghai -&gt; Beijing (3 days: great wall, etc.)

-Beijing -&gt; Xi'an (2 days: terracotta warriors, city wall)

-Xi'An -&gt; Chengdu (3 days: leshan buddha, panda sanctuary)

-Chengdu -&gt; Hong Kong (3 days)

VIETNAM

-Hong Kong -&gt; Ha Long (3 days)

-Ha Long -&gt; Hanoi (3 days)

-Hanoi -&gt; Hoi An (3 days)

-Hoi An -&gt; Ho Chi Minh City (3 days)

CAMBODIA

-Ho Chi Minh City -&gt; Phnom Penh (3 days)

-Phnom Penh -&gt; Siem Reap (3 days)

THAILAND

-Siem Reap -&gt; Pattaya (3 days)

-Pattaya -&gt; Bangkok (2 days)

-Bangkok -&gt; Chiang Mai (2 days)

-Chiang Mai -&gt; Pai (3 days)

-Pai -&gt; Hua Hin (3 days)

-Hua Hin -&gt; Phuket (2 days)

MALAYSIA

-Phuket -&gt; Kuala Lumpur (1 day, just to visit and take the next plane/train/boat/whatever)

SINGAPORE

-Kuala Lumpur -&gt; Singapore (2 days)

INDONESIA

-Singapore -&gt; Java (3 days)

-Java -&gt; Bali (2 days)

-Bali -&gt; Flores (6 days)

KOREA

-Flores -&gt; Seoul (3 days)

-Seoul -&gt; Panmunjeon (2 days)

-Panmunjeon -&gt; Daegu (2 days)

-Daegu -&gt; Jeonju (2 days)

-Jeonju -&gt; Chuncheon (2 days)

-Chuncheon -&gt; Seoul (1 day)

JAPAN

-Seoul -&gt; Tokyo (2 days)

-Tokyo -&gt; Yokohama (only if my boyfriend got an internship there)

-Yokohama -&gt; Tokyo (same thing, but I'll stay in Tokyo for 4 days instead of 2 if I don't go to Yokohama)

-Tokyo -&gt; home. That's a total of 76 days, so a bit more than 2 months.


What do you think? Any advice or opinion?

246as9,0,2014-04-28,When will I [fucking] learn.,[deleted],offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/246as9/when_will_i_fucking_learn/,"You would think I would have learned when I damaged my car and had to pay $1000 dollars to repair it,  and got away without getting a DUI.

You would think I would have learned when not two months later I backed up into a pole and dented my trunk, because I was drunk.

I hope I'll learn after this weekend. 

I wasn't supposed to drive. I gave my friend my keys at the beginning of the night. But I don't know what goes through my mind when I drink. I managed to get my keys back and drive. And this time, although I don't remember it, I somehow managed to get my car stuck on the railroad tracks. The cops came and my car had to get towed. I spent the night in jail for the first time. I got a ticket for public intoxication and another for interference with railroad property.

I had my whole summer ahead of me,  an internship with an organization I had been hoping to work with since last summer in a beautiful location, money saved up to support me and allow me to travel.

And it all went away in one night. 

I don't blame anyone but myself and I know there's no point in moping about it - all I can do is accept the responsibilities and learn from it. 
But it absolutely sucks and I hate myself for it. Everything I had worked for is gone.
My friends keep telling my they're glad no one got hurt, but that phrase should never have to be said in the first place. 

Im a pretty rational guy sober,  but I have no clue what the hell goes on in my mind when I'm drunk. 

Which is why I've decided to stop drinking for a while. Lately all its gotten me is into destructive tendencies, and that has to stop. 
I really hope I've learned my lesson this time, I hope I can prove this through my future actions. 

Thanks for listening."

The end of my freshman year was the only time I'd be allowed to apply to the business school, so I did, and was accepted as a marketing major. I chose marketing because it's similar to advertising in many ways. It didn't take long for me to figure out that marketing was kind of a BS major and I wasn't really learning any technical skills.

Fast forward to this past weekend. I went to go visit another school for a campus-wide party/celebration. I found myself talking to a girl and found out she's an atmospheric sciences major. She expressed jealousy about how highly ranked the same program is at my school. I asked her about what she studies and it started to dawn on me that this might be the calling I've been looking for. Ever since I was little I've been fascinated by weather. In elementary school I would sometimes spend hours watching the Weather Channel. Whenever it stormed I would stand in the garage to watch lightning. In junior high I took an economics class and was asked by my teacher what I wanted my profession to be (just to give an example starting salary for an activity.) This was the first time I ever had to name a realistic profession (not a football player or something like that) and I spouted out ""meteorologist."" All of these memories came racing back to me converging into a ""holy shit"" moment. ""Holy shit: I want to be an atmospheric sciences major.""

With climate change being an issue that will continue to grow, and WILL have an impact on the survival of the human race, this could actually be a field where I could make a meaningful difference.

My supply chain major requires me to have an internship before senior year, so I have one lined up and I'll be working full time in that field this summer. I've already racked up tons of student loans. All of this is in play, and all I want to do is start over. I want to begin all over again as an atmospheric sciences major, but I've invested incredible amounts of time and money into a pair of business degrees.

How do I overcome this ?  I know positions which I can use my network would be a lot easier, but there are many where I don't have a connection and I am left with two paragraphs of a cover letter and a single page resume to try to convey how good of a candidate I would be for their position.  

Its also frustrating to go visit my girlfriend, where her 30 credit/10 class night school HR masters program people are being recruited by Google, IBM, Nike etc - for completing a one year masters that required no GRE/GMAT score to get into the program.

This is not only true for the world we live in, it is also a main motif in A Song of Ice and Fire.

&gt; *“It all goes back and back,"" Tyrion thought, ""to our mothers and fathers and theirs before them. We are puppets dancing on the strings of those who came before us, and one day our own children will take up our strings and dance in our steads.”*

Today, the way we look at the most ancient history of Westeros has to change. We now know that the Others can turn humans into Others; and that there is an entity north of the wall, that is – at least by the HBO intern charged with synopses – called The Night’s King.

What we know of this entity can be gathered from the story Old Nan told to Bran:

&gt; *The legends say that the Night's King was a warrior without fear, and when he saw a woman atop the Wall with skin as white as the moon and eyes like blue stars, he chased her and loved her though her skin was cold as ice, and when he gave his seed to her he gave his soul as well. He brought her back to the Nightfort and proclaimed her a queen and himself her king, and with sorceries he bound his Sworn Brothers to his will. For thirteen years he ruled until finally the Stark of Winterfell and Joramun of the wildlings had joined to free the Watch from bondage. After his fall, when it was discovered that he had been sacrificing to the Others, all records of him were destroyed and his very name was forbidden.*

&gt; *Some say the Night's King was a Bolton, or a Magnar out of Skagos, others say he was an Umber, Flint, or Norrey. Others still say he was a Woodfoot, who ruled Bear Island before the ironmen came, but others still say he was a Stark who was brother to the man who brought him down.*

&gt; (ASOS Chapter 56)

My theory builds on the idea that the wall was never build to guard the realms of men against the Others in the first place. This has been discussed multiple times on this subreddit and elsewhere. After all, a magical ice wall does not appear effective for the repelling of magical ice creatures. Rather, what if it was a demarcation line? There once might have been a great civilization of ice creatures in the area now known as Beyond The Wall. They would have been creatures of a god of ice, as the Children of the Forest were creatures of the gods of nature. Such a god of ice is mentioned as The Great Other by Melisandre.

When the first men came out of the plains of Essos, they appear to have threatened the native inhabitants of Westeros with extinction. The Children of the Forest shattered both Stepstones and Neck to hold their progress, in vain. When the First Men finally came to the Haunted Forest and the Frostfangs, and the Others were facing the same fate as the Children of the Forest before them, what did they do? Had their god more power than the intangible Old Gods of the Children? If he indeed is a counterpart to R’hllor, the answer could well be yes. So they prayed to their god for their life, and The Great Other listened. He brought a catastrophic winter upon Westeros, and a night that lasted for a generation. The Others had halted the approach of the First Men by literally freezing it in place.

So, a peace was brokered between the Others and the First Men. Possibly between an emissary of The Great Other and one of the leaders of the First Men – A man with the name Brandon Stark. He built the peace that saved both sides from extinction, and was thus known by the name “The Builder”. To mark the demarcation line between both realms, the realms of men and the realms of winter, the Others built a wall of ice along the newly established border. They would stay north of it, and the First Men would stop their push of settlements.

And what to do with those men that had already settled north of the new border? Showing grace, the Others might have even allowed them to stay. They would have to promise to behave, and maybe cement their promise by sending some of their children to the Others as a token of their fealty, as squires, or wards, or hostages, name it as you will. It might even have been an honor for their families, back then.

How the wall was exactly guarded and manned, is still shrouded in mystery. We know that the 13th Lord Commander was a human. Of the first twelve, we know nothing. Maybe they were Others? Maybe they were Men? Maybe the wall at first was guarded by both sides, and the Lord Commandership alternated? Who knows. What we know is, that the 13th Lord Commander took an Other as his wife.

Now, how did that happen?

We know that he found her and chased her and brought her to the Nightford. That sounds suspicious – doesn’t it? A southern conqueror who used the unwitting trust of Northern lords to steal his bride and carry her away? What if the Night’s King stole his bride from the Others, as Rhaegar stole Lyanna from the Starks, 8000 years later?

Such a deed would undoubtedly have endangered the whole peace treaty with the Others, as Rhaegar’s deed destroyed the peace that Torrhen Stark had made with Aegon the Dragon. What if the Others took vengeance, and cast the continent into icy devastation again? Those men that were most endangered by this possibility – The North and The Men Beyond The Wall - gathered their strength and marched against the Nightford. And as Rhaegar fell, the Night’s King fell.

We do not know what happened to his Queen. We do not even know for sure what happened to himself, even though the show’s vignette narrated by Ygritte tells with some certainty that he was slain. Interesting – if he was slain, then who is the Night’s King that we saw in this last episode?

His son. We know that not only did he give his soul to her, but also his seed. This is too specific to only be a word for lust. She gave him a son. A bastard, born of the blood of Northern natives and Southern invaders. After the Nightford had fallen, that son would have been given back to the Others – and might today be still alive, in the Lands of Always Winter.

How interesting would it be, if the one bastard brokered a new peace with the other.

TL;DR: The Night's King got his bride the same way Rhaegar got Lyanna, endangering a peace treaty that is symbolized by The Wall and fathering a bastard son.

Long story short, that didn't work out and I've been searching for a job since late last summer.  I've been applying mainly to the nuclear industry, in operations and engineering, but I've also done some others as well, like oil&amp;gas.  Since then I'd estimate I've applied to around 150 jobs online, as well as solicited a couple of interviews from the few contacts I have.  Not one online application has scored me an interview.  I've got a 2.94 GPA and no internship/co-op, but I did a lot of undergraduate research and some other extra-curricular's that exhibit leadership and interpersonal skills, so I don't think I'm that under-qualified.  Looking back, it's obvious an internship would have been essential, but that's unchangeable and I can't seem to get one even now either.  

At this point I'm just getting frustrated with my future options, as there isn't a career fair for a while and I'm now going to be competing with the current year's graduates.

CUNY or SUNY?,natantantan,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/247fp6/need_help_with_choosing_a_college_cuny_or_suny/,"I am a senior in NYC and want to major in Computer Science. Right now my choice is between CUNY CCNY and SUNY Stony Brook.

CCNY - Great school for CS and ABET credited. Upon graduation I will be completely debt free. Absolutely non- existent social life. Will have to commute 1 hour back and forth everyday between home and the college.
Stony Brook. Also great CS school. It's considered the best CS SUNY school. I will graduate with $40-50k debt after all four years. Will live on campus and in a dorm.

Originally I was considering CCNY because the debt free aspect is extremely appealing. On top of that, for computer science, name of school or even GPA doesn't really matter its all about what you can actually do and your internship. So graduating from both school should net me pretty much similar jobs.
However I am an extremely shy and introverted person and this is something I desperately want to fix. I made some progress in high school but I feel like CCNY would just act as an extenuation of High School. If I went to CCNY i would have to live at home with my parents (which sucks), would lose a lot of social footing/progress, and would generally be unhappy.

If I went to SUNY happiness wouldn't be guaranteed obviously but I would stop being so sheltered by my parents and would be able to finally have some freedom and live like an actually person. I feel like a dorm life would really help me get out of my introverted shell and help me work on my social skills.

Now I am leaning more towards SUNY as I feel this college experience really is worth the $40-50k in debt as it will completely shape me as a person and my future. Social skills are very important in life and if I go to CUNY I feel like I would regress and become even more shy and secluded. Also a lot of people graduate with 200k in debt so 40k isn't that bad. Plus I don't want to be stingy and miss out on a once in a lifetime experience because I was stingy with money.

so

TL;DR Is it worth it to graduate with 40k in debt as opposed to being debt free in order to gain the ""college experience""

247i6k,62,2014-04-28,Birth story: Ramona born March 2nd,buzzdoit,BabyBumps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BabyBumps/comments/247i6k/birth_story_ramona_born_march_2nd/,"I obsessively read birth stories before my daughter was born so I thought I would ""give back"" by posting mine in case others are the same!

I woke up at 5am with contractions on March 2nd.  I’d been having “prelabor” contractions for about 2 weeks that felt like mild menstrual cramps.  I had wondered if I would know when the real contractions started.  And there was no comparison,I could definitely feel the difference!  They started at 6.5 minutes apart and were very light; I was able to doze in between.
 
About an hour later, I found it difficult to sleep so I got up and took a shower.  Around 8am, I timed them again and they were 4.5 minutes apart.  I decided to wake up my husband and we called L&amp;D.  They said to come in and get checked out.  The hospital was about 15 minutes away and although I could tell the contractions were getting stronger they were still doable.  

I got to triage at the hospital and I was only 2cm dilated but the contractions were getting much stronger and were now only 1-2 minutes apart.  Also the baby’s heart rate was not reacting well to the contractions so they decided to admit me.  I would have continual fetal monitoring throughout labor because of that.  

My husband and I went to labor and delivery room where I labored through the contractions for about four hours.  I did not handle them well.  I had to lay on my left side for the fetal monitoring and I basically was curled up in a whimpering ball.  They were so strong and coming so quickly.  It was also more than just the pain.  There was a surreal feeling and I felt like I was going in and out of reality.  Sorry to scare anyone but I was not prepared for that!  The contractions were not bearable so I decided to get an epidural.  

As a sidenote: I didn’t take any natural birthing classes or anything and the hospital I delivered at has a 80% epidural rate.  It wasn’t important to me to have a drug-free birth. But I think that if it was and I had prepared more and delivered in an environment supportive of drug free births then I could have done it.  Before the epidural, the nurses and doctors were just kinda standing around me and staring.  I’m sure at a clinic with staff training in non-drug pain relief it would have been different.  Just a comment for those planning on a non-drug birth!

Getting the epidural put in while dealing with contractions is no joke.  They also had an intern do it which is fine – it is a teaching hospital.  But she did have a lot of trouble getting it in.  I was breathing so fast that I started to black out and they laid me on my side.  Fortunately the resident took over and he got it in quickly.  I LOVE EPIDURALS!  The relief was immediate and I felt like a human again.  I told the nurses that everyone should have an epidural even if they aren’t giving birth!  After the epidural was in, they checked me and I was 7cm dilated.  I went from 2 to 7cm in four hours!  Probably why the contractions were so strong.  

One of the risks of epidurals is that it does stall labor.  The doctors actually told me that before putting it in and sure enough I stayed at 7cm dilated for the next six hours.  But during that time, I napped and relaxed.  Later that evening, the doctor gave me Pitocin to speed up the process and broke my waters.  Finally it was time to push.  

Pushing is exhausting although there was little pain because of the epidural.  And it’s also difficult to know where to push.  It took me a while to get the hang of it.  Another side effect of the epidural is that I didn’t feel an overwhelming urge to push.  I knew I had to push because I could feel a contraction coming but I didn’t get that urge that some women get.  Just an interesting observation!

I pushed for a while and finally the doctor could feel her head and she was sunny side up.  It’s weird because I got an ultrasound two weeks before and she was in the right position so babies can definitely move!  And also another reason why the contractions may have been so strong.  

After pushing for two and half hours, she finally came out!  No forceps and no tearing!  Because she hung out in my birth canal so long she did have a lot of mucous in her lungs and had to have some help breathing but she was able to clear it quickly.  Her apgar went from six to eight in five minutes.  My husband cut the cord and even guessed her birth weight to the exact ounce!  I had a very quick recovery and almost felt 100% within the week after she was born. 

Ramona was born at 11:37pm on March 2nd, twenty minutes before my birthday!  She was 8lbs 7oz and 20 inches long at birth. 

So there you go, postpartum is a story for another day but here’s her cute little face now!

247k8t,49,2014-04-28,The Sorrow of Sir Mike: A Neckbeard Origin Story (Part 1),wikifido,neckbeardstories,https://www.reddit.com/r/neckbeardstories/comments/247k8t/the_sorrow_of_sir_mike_a_neckbeard_origin_story/,"**PART 1**

Through reading this subreddit I found myself torn about posting a story from my own life about one of my friends. I like to think he’s not that bad of a guy, I've known him since 2005 and I’m slowly coming to realize that he is one of the people that this subreddit is focused on, a neckbeard. 

As this realization came to fruition I began to look at myself and say “Is it me too, am I one of them?” I meet many of the “classic” criteria, such as being a comic reader, enjoying DnD, playing video games *(Assassins Creed being the favorite)*, an atheist, a libertarian, environmentally induced asthma and sleep apnea, work in IT, and a terrible past history with social interactions *(it was in middle school to be fair)*. 

Fortunately I am not overweight, 6’ 4” and 240lbs and 24 years old. I have a decently successful career as a Cyber Security Analyst, and US Army Soldier. I work out at a Crossfit gym 5 days a week, enjoy hiking, and running obstacles races. I have never owned a fedora and I have a great girlfriend of 2 years.

So personally *(and I know many here agree)*, I don’t think that neckbeards are defined by their interests, medical conditions, or attire. They are more defined by the way they interact in personal and professional situations with a sense of entitlement that often seems so out of place with their appearance and demeanor. 

This story is the 9 year process of my realization that one of my best friends is a neckbeard, and my attempt to grasp if he was always a neckbeard…or transformed into one by a controlling ex.

This story, as much mine as it is Mike’s, begins in 2005 when we first met. It was the first day of 9th grade and it was my first day in a new school. I had made a switch because of bullying issues at my old school, in short I arrived as the new kid in the middle of 6th grade after my father retired from the military and I was plunged into a terrible socially awkward state by being the way too tall gangly new guy. 
 
I finally convinced my parents to let me change to a local charter school which functioned as an ‘Island of Unwanted Toys’ for schools in the area, a meeting ground for the socially awkward. My first day had already been pretty awkward, getting shown around by some red headed girl who a year earlier had gotten way too deep into my personal space, and didn't even remember who I was.

We finally got to my first class and I was turned over to Mike. It was a relief to be away from the ‘personal space invader’ *(seriously people…arms length)* Mike seemed like a great guy he was outgoing, knew everyone’s name, and was fun to be around. After my train wreck experience at my last school, I decided this is a guy I should get close to. 

Well, we ended up becoming good friends throughout High School. Relevant information from this time includes the fact I dated two girls. One that I was basically peer pressured into dating and ended terribly, and the other which lasted about 2 years and ended with her changing her relationship status on Facebook after not talking to me for 4 months, *(long story, but it was terrible and I’m a better person because of it)*. 

Mike, however, dated no one, he did constantly hang around and sometimes make out in the back of his late 80’s, retirement community style, Oldsmobile with a girl named Melissa. Despite him wanting to, no dates and definitely no sexy times were had. She was a year ahead of us and eventually graduated, moved to college, became a juggalo, dropped out, married some guy, and moved three states away. 

Isn’t that always the worst. 

At this point Mike bounced from having interest in girl to girl, while still being broken up about the Melissa situation, of course never addressing his feelings with these other girls, and always making his voice more effeminate when talking to them on the phone. As I was just about to deploy to Afghanistan he became interested in a girl he worked with named Maddie.

It’s always the M names with Mike…I think he seeks out the relationship alliteration.

Throughout my deployment I worked nights, I was able to talk alot to my friends back home, but had no real face to face speaking interaction with anyone for about 12 months. Mike was always telling me about Maddie and I encouraged him to ask her out on a movie date or to dinner, and frequently offered him advice on how to proceed. *(All of which he ignored apparently)*

When I returned, I viewed the world a bit different and had some seriously lingering social issues having not interacted with anyone for basically a year. So I arrive home and I want to meet up and see Mike.

 He says, 
&gt;“Sure man mind if I have Melissa V2 and Marcy tag along” 

Another girl named Melissa *(who shall be referred to as Melissa V2 from here on out)*, and Marcy…I’m telling you the M names cannot be an accident.  

I guess I don’t mind. We meet up in a McDonalds to grab some food. This is my first time seeing my friend in a year, maybe I’m just sensitive, but attempting to reconnect with my friend while he plays tickle-fight over the last chicken nugget was nauseating. I give Marcy an apologetic look and found a reason to leave. 

The next day I talk to Mike. 

&gt;“Bro, I thought you were into Maddie…she’s all you’ve been talking about for a year” I say.

&gt;“Naw bro I’ve been over that for a while, isn’t Melissa V2 great though.”

Yeah. Great. Truthfully she was really damn annoying, and would go out of her way to invite herself to any event where I tried to catch up with my friend. Thus making it impossible to catch up, and not be thrown into a socially awkward semi-coma, as they basically finger-banged under the table at a Chili’s.

Other relationship no-no’s that were committed included hand-kissing and un-ironic swooping romantic, leg lifting, end of romcom, kisses over the 5 dollar movie bin at a Walmart. 

At this point I decided to put some distance between myself and them. I was going to wait until my other friend returned from deployment and we could tackle this together. It’s not that I don’t want my friend happy, but I also didn't like seeing his life run by someone that wasn't him.

Once David finally returned, a full 3 months later, we got back ahold of Mike. He was fully owned. She had him dressed in V-Necks, Plaid shorts, and Mandals. He was buying her lavish gifts every other week in the excess of 200 dollars, an amount far outside his spending ability. He was burning through his checking and savings account to appease her.  He was also stripped of what few interests or closely had beliefs that he had, and had simply become a ‘gray person’

She was using him and it was becoming very apparent. 

&gt;“Bro, We don’t like Melissa V2…we think she’s bad for you, this relationship just isn’t healthy.”

We had the sit down talk, addressed our concerns with him like good friends would, the response we got…was not exactly what was expected,

&gt;“Well she’s going to Detroit in a couple months for an internship, I’m trying to get the most quality time I can in with her”

Alright…cool. We’re going to be rid of this witch in a couple months, here’s to hoping Mike will be able to eat in the interim because he's running low on money.

*Authors Notes: This is a 100% true story on how a friend and genuinely great person went downhill to the point of becoming a neckbeard. Hopefully you enjoy it, it will have some funny,cringe-worthy, and depressing moments. I don't know how many parts it will have....but I will finish it. So yeah....TEXT WALL. All names and locations in this story have been changes for PERSEC reasons. Because duh*

My s.o., on the other hand, has to keep time free so he can attend band practice. For two bands, with band members much younger than him (They don't have to make rent or pay for anything so they just schedule practice whenever). He has only had one paid gig in 4 years and he works 4-5 days a week. He barely has enough money to feed himself and make rent, and it has been this way the entire relationship. He is very thin. He has this mindset that he works a ""full time job, so that is enough."" It isn't, though, when you are literally starving and can't afford gas or food or car insurance after rent (Which is VERY cheap for this area). He NEEDS a second job or a better job that actually requires effort. If he could get a second job paying even minimum wage working an extra 10 hours a week, he would be doing... okay.

If I were him, with no loan debt and living on my own, I would be working my ass off and laughing all the way to the bank. I would enjoy my weekends with friends at the pub and buy 6 flags season passes, or going out to eat with my gf (We rarely, if ever go out, because I always have to pay for both of us.) and enjoy my 20's. He just wants to sit around and smoke pot and jam. 


I am realizing now that I need to take some things into consideration. I am a very driven person, I like buying things for myself when I need them (school supplies, new car, etc.) and I am pretty financially responsible. He, on the other hand, seems to be perfectly content with being PISS POOR because he a) wants to leave time free for music and b) truly thinks he ""deserves his two days off."" (HAHAHAHA. DAYS OFF. OK WHTAT ARE THOSE.) These priorities absolutely do not fall in line with mine. Even though we are VERY VERY close and important to one another, Is this the kind of person I want to spend my life with? To have kids with? To be legally bound to? To share my finances with?

**My point isn't to be on some soapbox saying I am so great and he is a music slacker. My point is, I don't want to spend the rest of my life with someone who I will always have to support. I don't want to spend my life with someone who seems to be taking the easy way out and who does not want to work hard and gets mad and often claims I don't support his music when I remark that his fridge is bare.. I am a public servant, I will never be rich, but you can guaran-fucking-tee I will be comfortable**  "

I am a guy in a straight couple looking for living arrangements in San Francisco from June 1st - August 15th due to her internship, which will be in the South Beach District. 

Our ideal place is a furnished one room sub for $800-1000 (max of 1200 I guess) with cool roommates that are all ok with having a stable couple live with them. We would love to make new friends, so if you are are like minded or aged, that is a plus. We can split the utilities evenly as well. Pets are a plus, but not necessary. The closer to the South Beach District, the better, but we are flexible as long as it's within the city and public transportation is available. We are very responsible people, and we will have money ready each month. If we could work something out for leasing the bedroom for 2.5 months, that would be fantastic. We cannot stay for the entire month of August as she will have to be back at university in time for classes, and I will likely leave earlier because I need to move into my apartment in Chapel Hill for the new school year, so probably August 5th-10th or so for me. If that's not possible, no worries.

Some information about her: she is 20 years old, currently residing in Cary, North Carolina, and a junior at North Carolina State University. She is double majoring in Computer and Electrical engineering, and her internship is at Verizon. This will be our first time in San Francisco, so we will be spending lots of time outside sightseeing when she is not working. She plans to work full-time (8am-5pm) over the summer so she will be quite busy. She is generally a quiet person on my own, and we are both very clean, always busy with something or another, easy to get along with, and love to chat. She loves fitness, reading, watching movies, and taking long walks on the beach.

I am a 21 year old junior at UNC Chapel Hill majoring in Mathematical Decision Sciences and minoring in Spanish. Since I am of age, I may have a drink or two, but not much since I will be focusing on my fitness this summer. I am looking for an internship/job, but until I can find somewhere to work, I will just stay around the house, so I can help clean or whatever to keep myself busy and help around. I am also a very friendly person, and I would love to become friends with your roommates. I like video games, basketball, soccer, fitness, computers, typical guy stuff.

If anyone has advice on what else we can do to find housing, that would be great. We are kind of desperate at this point, but our budget is still limited. We will take up very little space, so one bedroom is fine.

2) Before I graduate there's a good chance I'll land an internship in a different time zone/side of the country for anywhere between 3-6 months. In this case, will I be able to temporarily transfer to a unit closer to that location or will I be flying home every month? If the former and they have no particular need for my MOS at the temp unit, would I just cross train under a different one?

The program covered a lot of programming languages and frameworks and the main emphasis was on software engineering and web development, with an optional minor in game programming and an optional minor in graphic design. I went with game programming. I'd like to get my Masters in CS, really just to have the opportunity to go over all the CS that I missed in an environment where everyone's doing the same thing. I've compiled a list of Masters programs that assume the student has never taken a CS course before, essentially they go over the ""core five"" CS courses that I don't have, plus some electives that I mostly already do have.

In terms of real life experience, I've co-founded two tech startups, but other than that I don't have any internship or work (for a larger entity) experience. I'd like to keep doing the startup thing, I'm most interested in more schooling so I can learn more, not necessarily because I want to look better for employers.

Anyway, is there anything in particular I can do to look better, seeing as my undergrad degree isn't in pure CS and I don't have any internships?"

Premise: I recently moved to the Seattle area for eight months on a co-op job (some call this an internship). I intended to bring my desktop, with the CPU, GPU, RAM, and PSU detached from the case. I also bought a new ASUS IPS monitor which was delivered to a friend of mine from here.

Back in Canada, nothing really was an issue. I'm suspecting it's a GPU problem. It seems to boot up fine but then what used to happen was that the colours seem to be really screwed up. Everything seems to be red and blurry. The first image might not show justice but the second one is semi-reflective of my problem. Some of the boot screens aren't here either.

NOTE 1: I am certain it is not the monitor. My friend's laptop hooks on and uses it without issue. Monitor is a 239-H.

NOTE 2: This is the build as scoped on PCPartPicker. The card in question is a GTX 650 and I am under warranty. I am not currently interested in purchasing a new card.

I'm sorry - I don't know how to make it shorter without leaving out important things. There are also some naughty words below.

After graduating my honours year, I did an internship at a company via the university and was offered a full-time position afterwards. Collaboration continued between the company and the university, and talk of a PhD came up. Everyone kept repeating to me how much of a fantastic opportunity this is because I get my salary, the PhD is paid for by the company, and I get to work on a real world problem and not some esoteric academic's project. I knew then how much work and commitment a PhD would be, and I'm not ashamed to say I wasn't very keen on doing it. But after literally months of discussions, mostly them insisting how much of a fantastic opportunity it is, I agreed.

The project I was supposed to be working on ended up not going ahead due to political reasons within the company. Instead, I'm working on something else, albeit somewhat related to what I was originally supposed to be working on. The political issues also meant the contracts didn't get signed and exchanged, and, long story short, I lost at least 6 months of my 4 years that I cannot get back. (I couldn't just work on the project anyway while waiting for the signatures, because I didn't even know what the project would be).

Now I've finished my 2nd year, into the 2nd quarter of my 3rd. (Although you have to remove half a year from that for the reasons mentioned above). I have a little over a year and a half to go. I have a tonne of results but it's all over the place - there is no logical flow of ideas, concepts, methods, and results, it's all just random results about closely related ideas. Actually, it does very little to answer the question the PhD is posing in the first place.

Without being specific, the project I'm working on is an extension of something I've done for this company before. What I did before works great, works fast, is extremely customisable, and does exactly what they need. The success of that solution was a deciding factor in my position at the company and in moving me forward onto the PhD. What I'm working on now is in the same area, but the approach is totally retarded. It's complicated, convoluted, and many, many, many orders of magnitude slower. It requires the purchasing of prohibitively expensive commercial software whereas the existing system was totally self-contained. I feel like the whole thing is just a giant circlejerk - trying to devise something fancy and complicated, and come up with increasingly absurd reasons to justify said approach, just so there is something publishable, ignoring the fact that it's no practical for the company and far inferior to the existing system.

So there's one problem: I can't see where this research (which isn't what we were supposed to be researching in the first place) is going, how it's justified, how it's useful, etc.

Then there's my supervisor. He is the ultimate control freak. Imagine the most control freakiest person you know, and that person is a reclining rastafarian compared to this guy. I literally cannot email a bio about my undergraduate study and/or motivation for higher study to the faculty secretary without him calling her up and frantically telling her to disregard the email; then sitting with me for 4 days (I'm not fucking kidding) to re-write it. This is pretty stock standard for him. We know a deadline is coming, we know what's involved and what we have to do, but somehow, every. single. time. he ends up sending emails pleading for the deadline to be extended, and we end up working on it day and night together for a week after it was due. Everything I write is meticulously critiqued by him to the point of insanity. Words in sentences are reversed, thought about, and reversed again. ""That""s are changed to ""Which""es and back again, and back again. We spend two evenings working on a single paragraph that should take all of 10 minutes to write. But if he had a super power, it would not be his super-human ability to make time disappear or control his students every move; it would be his super-human powers of disorganisation. The amount of time I have spent re-explaining things I have explained to him before is probably enough time to write a thesis in itself. He never writes anything down, and it's probably for the best because it would just get lost anyway. He basically comes into every meeting as a blank slate. If I send him an email of something I've done (usually because he asked me to), he won't read it. Months later, he usually ends up asking me to send it to him again - but don't worry, he still won't read it. My first year progress report, 30 pages, was with him for over SIX MONTHS and he never bothered to read it. Then, when the faculty had put its foot down and said ""right, this is getting ridiculous, you absolutely MUST hand it in by this date"", literally the DAY BEFORE it was due, he made up some bullshit excuse about how he couldn't read it because he had to give up his seat on the bus for some old lady, BUT, here's a long list of things you need to have and need to say in your report. Basically, ""Yes, it took you a month to write it, I had 6 months to read it and I didn't fucking bother, it's due TOMORROW, but I want you to rewrite most of it to match what I'm telling you now"". Then, when I handed in the changes he told me to make, I got negative comments from my reviewers specifically about the things I changed according to his instructions. There have been some conferences we've submitted to, and were accepted to, but we have never gone because of various reasons. They have all been suspicious reasons, and I am of the strong suspicion that he doesn't want his name to be attributed to the particular direction of research we are currently doing because it doesn't match what he normally does, and he is concerned it won't look good for his reputation. (He has, on at least two occasions, said things to indicate this).

Anyway - I could go on and on and on and on about him. I'll just summarise it as: He is a control freak, he is disorganised, he is unreliable, he cancels meetings constantly - usually just beforehand.

Doing this PhD from the company I work for, there is the occasional task I'm asked to do which is unrelated to my research. Technically, the contract between the university and the company prohibits this, but everybody agrees that I can't just barge into my manager's office waving the contract furiously in my hand whenever he asks me to do something, especially considering people are being let go left right and center due to budget cuts - I'm in the somewhat safe position due to the PhD. Unfortunately, these occasional tasks aren't as occasional as they should be. I have lost entire weeks at a time, sometimes even longer, working on reports or software or something else. I also feel bad for saying no to these because, unlike the research, these things are actually useful to the company. The other thing is the pay. I know I shouldn't be complaining since my PhD is being paid for AND I get my salary, but I was already in a full-time job before I started my PhD and I took a pretty massive pay cut when I joined this company. When I speak to others around here who are in basic administrative positions, I've learned that a lot of them are actually being paid more than me. My wife has said all along that I'm not being paid well for what I do, and that I could do a lot better at another company.

I've also been getting migraines on an almost daily basis, ranging from a constant dull throb to my head feeling like it's being crushed by a vice. I've seen doctors and a neurologist, and there appears to be no physiological explanation except perhaps stress.

I feel like, especially given the history to date of the research, the final part of my PhD will be an absolute shitstorm of epic proportions. I will probably throw myself off a bridge half way through next year. Just given everything that's happened so far and everything I know will happen in the remainder, I've pretty much already made up my mind that I don't want to continue. This isn't a snap decision - I've been seriously contemplating this for over 6 months. 

It's not an easy decision though, and the longer I put it off, the closer I get to the end, the harder the decision is.

**Reasons To Continue:**

* Finish what you start
* ""PhD is a fantastic opportunity"" - *everyone*
* PhD could potentially lead to good career opportunities down the road

**Reasons To Quit:**

* Pay isn't great (mortgage doesn't pay itself, wife wants a kid = one income, etc)
* Supervisor is intolerable in every conceivable way
* Research is circlejerk and impossible to justify in practice
* Unrelated work getting in the way of research and unlikely to cease
* PhD could potentially hinder career opportunities down the road
* High likelihood of better pay at other companies

**Consequences of Continuing:**

* I will probably jump off a bridge

**Consequences of Quitting:**

* I won't have a PhD
* Supervisor and potentially employer may be upset"

they told me i have about 15days to leave before they cancel my visa and they want to see a plane ticket that shows im leaving the.country.

im sure they cant or wont cancel my visa, so im thinking of booking a refundable ticket to HK, getting my deposit and stay my full duration. zmsounds stupid even to me, but i think it will work. 

or i can go to hong kong or busan, korea and get a 60 or 90 day L visa. that should cost me about 1500 rmb. So i have two options

1. Lie, book a ticket and refund it. get my deposit back. Cost maybe 200 rmb.
2. go to hk or korea and get 60,90 da L visa. Cost 1500~2000 rmb
 im not 100% sure about the costs for this and whether i will get the visa, pretty sure i should but not 100%

3 just stfu and go to school. Cost ~3500~4000

During the winter break of his freshman year in college (her sophomore year in highschool), they began a relationship. This ended abruptly by the end of he school year (May, 2010). 


Fast-forward a few years, and she's looking at colleges. They're friends again, so all is good. His college is a good fit for her, and he was in a relationship, so that had no part in her decision (supposedly). She enrolled, began her freshman year in August, 2012, which is the beginning of his senior year.


Winter break of the 2012-2013 school year, they hook up. She told me last night that it was a one night thing. This was before we met.


---


Context of my friendship with Sam: we were in the same grade and we knew eachother as acquaintances for the first two years. Our friendship grew stronger by junior year, and we were close by senior year.


---


Context of my relationship with Lisa: Sam introduced Lisa to me in the spring of 2013, a few weeks (month?) prior to spring break. We hit it off, and everything is great, so great that I work in her hometown for the summer of 2013 after I graduate. We begin a long distance relationship. She starts up school again, and I move back home (a few hours away from her college), and things are good. In the mean time, I prepare to move to a city in New England that is close to her hometown as well as apply to grad school. We spend winter break together, I move into my new place, and all is well. There was the rough patch of the lack of communication bc of our work/school schedules, but we smoothed it out.


Looking towards summer 2014, she has an internship in the city with me, we have a sublet lined up, and I'm prepared to enroll at a prestigious East Coast grad school in the fall. Awesome.


As with Sam, we are both close friends with him.
He moved to a large city in the Midwest in June, 2013. We even visited him in October. So far, he has been lonely and his drinking has escalated.


---


What happened: Sam visited Lisa's college to catch up with friends a few weeks before their graduation. Lisa hosted him and he brought an air mattress. I thought nothing of it, and neither did Lisa. He even crashed at another place Saturday evening. 


On Sunday evening, Lisa said she got upset and nostalgic and went home to go to bed. Sam called Lisa to get into the house and fall asleep as well. She climbed into her bed, and he followed her in. She wore a shirt, underwear, and leggings (no bra). He wore a shirt and boxers. He was rubbing her back suggestively and wrapped his arm around her. He even put his hand up her shirt and on her back, as well as touched her butt. Basically they spooned. They fell asleep at 1 am, woke up at 4 am, he was rubbing her back some more, and she freaked out. He got out of the bed and both fell back asleep separately.


On Monday, they had lunch with friends and they talked privately. Both of them regret it.


Around 6 pm, she skyped me. She told me about it, and an hour into our conversation i logged off to breathe. At this time, she made it sound like they were snuggling for a few minutes in their day clothes. I talked to her about two hours later. For the next 2 or 3 hours, she disclosed that they actually fell asleep together and that it was more intimate (everything that I described above). She swore that nothing else happened.


I asked her to limit her contact with him. I'm going to talk to him today. I plan on driving there in two weeks to pick her up over graduation weekend, and he might be there.


---


My feelings: despite her saying nothing happened, I feel like something did happen. Falling asleep while spooning is intimate, and it's something that I don't do casually. She claimed that it felt innocent at first, but that she also missed the physical nature of our relationship and that, in some twisted way, she did it because she missed me. She was crying the entire time that we spoke.


I also feel betrayed because he is (was?) my friend. I would never disrespect my friend's boundaries like that.


I also feel stupid and emasculated because I was naive enough to think that Sam could stay in her room, and that other people saw him go into her room. I don't know if I'll be over it by the time I have to pick her up.


---


My reaction: Lisa seems apologetic, and we talked it out. We think that we can work it out and that it won't kill the relationship. I asked her to limit her contact with him, and that she doesn't see him over graduation weekend when I'm not there. When she said that we can negotiate with Sam, I told her that he does not have the privilege of that. Lisa and I are in a relationship and we can talk. Sam is not, and I think that he should do what I tell him to do with the threat of Severing ties. 


I told my roommate/close friend about it, and he said that I was too forgiving.


---


Going forward: In another context, this might not seem like a big deal. However, we have a LDR, and even though she claims it won't happen again, I don't know if I can take her word for it, especially in the moment. 


I want to tell Sam that he shouldn't go to graduation weekend. I don't know if that's asking too much.


We have a sublet lined up. If things go south and I discover that she did not tell the whole truth, what the hell will I do about that? Both of us are on the sublet agreement.


Not to be a dick, but I also don't know why she would have residual feelings for him. He just talks about his loneliness and drinks non-stop. I'm here for her and working shit hours to afford a great summer with her, and I have my shit together. What gives?

---

Your verdict: am I overreacting? Am I too forgiving? Have you had a similar experience?

---   
**tl;dr**: GF fell asleep with good friend/her ex. She's apologetic, but my emotions are mixed.

When I first arrived at my university, I knew something was off. I was an international student in Singapore and I felt very different. I wasn't completely certain about my choice of course as well, and that made me even more uncomfortable.

My first semester was probably the only good one, it was filled with a lot of hope. I worked hard, was very social and made sure to make a lot of friends as I was far from home. It all went downhill from there.

Each passing semester was met with the realization that I did not love what I was doing. My friends drifted away and formed relationships, I was always single. I did a few internships but did not enjoy them. I got rejected by overseas programs and resented it. I tried to put myself out there in the dating world and was sexually assaulted by the first guy I expressed an interest in. 

Every single decision I made seems like the worst one and I kept making a series of terrible decisions that piled up and have resulted in this horrible feeling that I can't shake off. I feel like a huge loser and am so afraid of making any decisions because I know I will regret any that I make.

I can't share my problems with my family. They have such high expectations of me. I have never felt so alone.

I have also been rejected by every single graduate job I have applied to, and I have applied to over 50 of them. I feel like the interviewers can see the dead look in my eyes, no matter how I try to mask it.

To add to all of this, I am bonded to the Singapore government for the next 3 years, as I was on scholarship. With no job yet, I will be forced to stay here over the summer, alone and looking for a job.

The thing that makes me the most depressed is the fact that I think I had so much potential that I threw away.

&gt;However, my main hope in creating this thread was for people to go beyond contacting the FCC/Congress and try to tap into the broader audiences held by Reddit and other prominent sites.

Lol.  XKCD and SMBC.

Bonus points though the OP mentioning Citizens United:

&gt;But eliminating big money in US politics (even just getting us back to a pre-Citizens United level of relative sanity), is going to be a vastly larger, longer fight and a free and open web will be an essential tool in that battle.

PART 1: Governmentjerk.

&gt;&gt;No we don't need to beat Sopa or anti net neutrality, we need to beat the senators and politicians that keep introducing such legislation into a pulp as many times as it takes until they realize introducing such will guarantee them another beating.

&gt;Absolutely. Convince reddit-usa to give a crap about voting first. Lazy fucks spout reasons not to vote far more than why you should, and how stupid easy it is too. Fucking Afghans turn out despite death threats and I hear people who complain not vote because their cat box needed to be emptied instead.

Coming from a website that routinely jerks themselves raw over Obama and whichever Democratic candidate is the flavor *du jour*, this is really hypocritical (or perhaps ironic, I'm never sure which).

&gt;&gt;i voted for a president who promised to protect net neutrality, and looked what happened. it is discouraging and it seems like it doesn't matter who you vote for, everyone just ends up pandering to the big corporations.

&gt;Cash is KING.

And:

&gt;If you beat one crooked legislator another one will pop up right behind him, it is essentially whack-a-mole. What needs to be stopped is the corporate control of our government.

And: 

&gt;How exactly? Until you remove money from politics your voice means nothing to the political system.

And:

&gt;Do you think a politician who does not take campaign money from corporations has any realistic chance of winning? I do not think they do. So the only way they can navigate election process is to sell their soul.

Plus a minijerk: voting doesn't matter, the game is rigged!

&gt;voting system is rigged anyways

&gt;While I agree that the voter turnout is awful in the USA, it's mostly because the games are rigged.

&gt;Aww... you think voting maters... how cute :)

___________________________________________


PART 2: Should we have a Constitutional amendment to Save the Internet?  Reddit discusses.

&gt;&gt;Honestly a constitutional amendment is probably needed. Attacks will never stop without something binding. I'm not as concerned about net neutrality as I am making sure internet traffic is treated as protected speech.

&gt;Internet traffic is not protected speech. That kind of protection only exists for really important things, like **unlimited campaign contributions.**

Emphasis his.

&gt;Seems the only way of fighting back against any such bills that would restrict the internet would be to first get an amendment passed that guarantees the internet to current and future generations. Anything short of this will be attacked, challenged and eventually be bought and sold by corporations (via politicians).

And:

&gt;The best bet would be pushing Congress to pass strong net neutrality laws or bypassing Congress altogether and pushing for a Constitutional amendment to protect net neutrality. However, the current net neutrality concerns have absolutely nothing to do with Congress.

But if the government doesn't protect our rights, what will an amendment change?

_____________________________

PART 3: We.  Are.  Freedom Fighters!

&gt;Whatever happened to our spirit of Revolution? We need to rise up like we did in the 1960s. Unless we effectively stop our work day and school day to protest and rally, they won't see it our way.

RISE UP!  FUCK THE PIGS, MAN!  CIVIL RIGHTS 2.0!

&gt;Human rights is an endless struggle. That's why they call it a struggle. We beat SOPA and we'll keep beating the zombie SOPAs and every other fucking thing they will inevitably throw at us.

&gt;I'm not even close to tired and will fight with others until the day I die for human rights.

And then:

&gt;No. No. I'm tired of struggling. I'm sick and tired of having to sign petitions and donate to organizations who have to fight to get congressmen to see it our way. I'm tired of attending peaceful protests just to get maced in the face and beaten to a pulp. I'm sick of playing these damn games.

I'm tired of fighting the system.  I've *seen* shit, y'know?

Here is a small list of resources that I copy-pasta'd from another post of mine. 

1 - [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) provides a great many classes, actual classes taught by well respected college professors, across many subject areas including Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Programming, etc. These classes are mostly free and some offer a certificate of completion (could be used as proof of knowledge in a resume) and some of them have a small fee for the class. They do have a grading system and whatnot. Coursera has been a great tool in learning new skills for myself. 

2 - [CodeAcademy](http://www.codecademy.com/) is a self paced and free learning environment for learning some programming languages. It is very easy to use, very explanatory, and kind of measures your success. It is not a classroom environment and does not have a lot of support but is useful nonetheless. 

3 - On YouTube there is a guy who does IT videos over almost all of IT concepts. He is great, explains terms and concepts very simply, is easy to understand, and provides examples. The Channel Name is [Eli The Computer Guy](https://www.youtube.com/user/elithecomputerguy)

4 - [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/), [Server Fault](http://serverfault.com/), etc. There is a list at the bottom of these sites providing links to the various forums. These sites/forums are an incredibly valuable resource for any thing IT/Programming/Coding related. There are many commenters and users on there from various fields and levels of experience. I have found it beyond valuable in my work experience.

5 - [MSDN](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/) / [TechNet](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/) / [ScriptingGuy](http://blogs.technet.com/b/heyscriptingguy/) These guys are great and provide tutorials, explanations, documentation, and even forum support for many topics related to Microsoft and their tools.

There are also the Reddit resources as well. Some that I advise are /r/netsec , /r/sysadmin , /r/IT_CERT_STUDY , /r/DailyProgrammer , /r/LearnProgramming , /r/Networking , and /r/CarlHProgramming . 

I don't care what anyone says about Carl H. His legal business is none of mine and its quite honestly jacked. But he provided a very very useful set of topics and discussions on programming that were quite amazing. His personal transgressions are not relevant to learning new information.

Also if you have no internship, contract, or full-time/part-time experience in IT. You need to find a Help Desk/Service Desk/PC Support/Service Technician/Desktop Support/Desk Side Support position while you're in school. Those are all essentially the same position. However, some are phone centers and others are desk-side (in person). This will get your foot in the door and give you the experience and understanding necessary to begin your career once you finish school."

I know it's early to post this, but I thought maybe someone would have a lead on something. I'll be working at a law firm in midtown and I'd like to find a room in someone's furnished apartment or a roommate to look for apartments with, starting around that time. 

I have a sweet little cat (pics of her as a kitten are in my submission history) and would really love to find someone who already has a kitty for her to play with during the day, since I'm going to be at work a lot. If you don't, that's cool too, as long as you are happy to live with a cat.

If you have a room starting now, I'd love to take it if you would be open to subletting it until September (summer is super hot for sublets and I know a lot of people coming in to the city for summer internships).

Thanks!"

I'm 19F and just landed an internship this summer (yay!) so I need an entire business casual wardrobe, pretty formal is what they told me, so suits. I found one skirt suit I absolutely love and was on mega sale and have an old one of my sisters that fits me great.

I have had trouble finding dresses and dress shirts that fit properly. I have a very hourglass shape 38-27-38 and am very busty. All the shirts I try on are either far too much cleavage, they pull too tight on my breasts, or I'm swimming in them but they contain my chest.

I've been looking online for help and have found suggestions of a more vintage style of dress shirt (like 40's-50's) that tapers below the breast that is great with hourglass shapes. The problem is, I have not found these anywhere.

So help!! Any stores or online places I could check out? And also remember I'm 19 and this isn't a paid internship and I'm broke so please not too much $$

24b11j,1,2014-04-29,"Working in Make-Up: Hoping for advice from any UK-based MAC artists, or anyone who works in a Head Office for a beauty brand!",[deleted],MakeupAddiction,https://www.reddit.com/r/MakeupAddiction/comments/24b11j/working_in_makeup_hoping_for_advice_from_any/,"Okay, so there's kind of a short and a long version of this post, the latter of which requires a little explaining. By all means feel free to skip most of this, but if there's anyone willing to read it all (that would make you a saint in my eyes) I would love to hear any and all advice there is to offer. Brevity is really not a strong point for me, I have a tendency to explain everything so apologies for incoming wall of text. I’m just going to put my TL;DRs up here at the top to save anyone who doesn’t want to go through all of this.


**TL;DR for The Short Version** *Can anyone outline their application experience for a MAC counter position in a department store? Preferably specific to the UK, but any and all advice is appreciated!*


**TL;DR for The Long Version** *Graduating uni soon and I’m aiming to work in the marketing side of the beauty industry. Is taking a year to work in retail for make-up a good idea, and does anyone have any more general advice for getting into the industry?*
 

**The Short Version.** Right now there’s a vacancy in a MAC counter in a department store near me, and I’m considering applying there. The issue I have is that I don’t have any prior experience in make-up (read “The Long Version” if you’re interested in knowing exactly the position I’m in right now). As I understand it, the process for applying for MAC seems somewhat stringent in the US.  I’ve read a few experiences of the process, and I know generally speaking they have a kind of two-stage interview process; the more typical one-to-one interview with the manager, and then the actual make-up application interview. I’ve also read that they like to see a portfolio of previous work, but as I said, I don’t have any formal experience working in make-up. That’s not to say I can’t apply make-up on other people, I’m most definitely comfortable doing so - I do it fairly regularly for friends and family - but I’ve never been paid for a make-up job. 


Putting the physical make-up application thing aside, I feel as if I have pretty good knowledge of make-up. I’m not saying I know everything; I’m a firm believer that there’s always something new to learn and gaps in my knowledge. But if friends or family have questions about make-up, they will generally come to me, and for the most part I feel like I can provide a pretty good answer. Similarly I feel as if I could do the same for MAC; if someone were to ask me, I think I could pretty confidently explain which foundations provide what kind of coverage, the difference between different finishes on products and so on. So I think for the sales side of things, I wouldn’t be that concerned about being able to describe products and so on (I’m also familiar with the ethical side of the brand what with Viva Glam and all that jazz).


So the kind of point of this ramble - I was wondering if it’s the same application process in the UK? Are they expecting a formal portfolio, formal make-up training, etc etc? Generally speaking, how does the application and interview process go, and am I unlikely to be rejected on the grounds of not having any prior experience working in retail for make-up?


**The Long Version.** I feel like I’ve ended up in an odd place asking for sort-of-careers-advice, but hey ho, here goes nothing. I’m graduating from university in the summer, and with an obsession with all things beauty having flourished in the time I’ve been at university, I’ve come to the conclusion that I want to work in the beauty industry. I’d like to start in the marketing side of things, and I have more long term ambitions of ending up on the product development side of things. I’ve looked around to see what’s about in terms of graduate opportunities, but I feel as if for the most part I’m currently under qualified for most of the positions I’m seeing.  


When I chose what I wanted to do at university I was really unsure as to what I wanted to do career-wise so I chose a fairly broad degree – English (mine is a literature based course as opposed to language). Most of the positions I’ve looked at are asking for a degree “in a related field”, i.e. Marketing. A lot of them are also asking for prior experience in similar positions - for candidates who have done a year in industry or similar. (I don’t know how it is in the US, but in British universities if you’re doing a Marketing degree or similar it’s becoming quite common to do a “sandwich year” and take a year’s work placement between the years of academic study, so that you have experience when you graduate). In short, I didn’t do that, so I’m feeling largely under qualified for a lot of jobs that I’m seeing.


Having thought about it quite a lot lately, I feel like my best option is probably to take a year to try and get some relevant experience, which is why I’m also looking for advice for applying for counter positions. I'm also planning on trying to find internships in marketing, even if they're unpaid and not necessarily related to the beauty industry. If there’s anyone out there who does have any advice, is this the right sort of approach? Will I benefit in the long term from having some experience on the floor, as it were? Is there any more general advice for trying to get into the industry?


Thank you to anyone who’s read my ramblings up to this point; as I said, any and all advice for anything I’ve mentioned here is appreciated!

**EDIT: Forgot to add, please feel free to use this post as a more general place to discuss the matter of careers and jobs in the beauty industry, regardless of whether it's in the realm of being an MUA or on the more corporate side of things. It's Text Tuesday after all, we're supposed to encourage discussion, right? :)**"

- I enjoy programming and I'm ~~good~~ decent at it, but don't really have a passion for it.

- I don't have a specific area or platform that I am interested in.

- I didn't get an internship during the summer after my junior year.

- I have a low GPA...~2.3

What I do have is:

- Some projects from project courses.

- A 3rd place prize for an iOS medical app from a school competition.

 I try to emphasize those, but it seems like I still don't do well when I talk to representatives. Especially when they ask about my pitfalls above. Any advice on how to make myself appealing despite what I listed above would be much appreciated.

24b40b,54,2014-04-29,The Jambon Chronicles: Episode 5. Eat Fresh.,Crazyphapha,fatpeoplestories,https://www.reddit.com/r/fatpeoplestories/comments/24b40b/the_jambon_chronicles_episode_5_eat_fresh/,"Hello FPS, it's time for a new story. Haven't been able to post for the past few days, work and stuff. Anyways, let's get to it.

The characters:

&gt; Still me, Crazyphapha, French guy now exiled to northern France

&gt; MonkeyMartin. Roommate, hairy, short, muscly, vocal about stuff. Laughs loudly.

&gt; Roman Polanski. Still didn't direct any movies, but he watches a ton of them. Tall, lanky polish guy.

&gt; BlackForest. The ham of the story. Called BlackForest because a) she was black and b) this happened in the Parisian Subway (that we call metro)

Now, onwards with the story:

Every week-end, after the week at my boarding school, most interns would go back to their homes by bus, then train, then subway, and I was no exception. Bus and train went smoothly, but things started getting hairy in the Subway.

The Subway was relatively full, so Martin, Roman and myself sat in those fold-away seats, with our suitcases in front of us. I was facing both of them, when someone came in.

BlackForest hopped on the carriage, who tipped slightly in her direction. She waddled over to me (closest to the door) and asked me to get up.

&gt; BlackForest: ""Get up young man, I need to sit down.""

&gt; Me: ""Excuse me? There's plenty of seats in that carriage, just go sit in this one over there."" I motioned at a free seat that was about 10 feet away, a few rows back.

&gt; BlackForest: ""No, you need to move, I can't walk because of my bad knee. I get tired very easily.""

&gt; Me: ""Sorry, but my friends are here. I'm sure you can walk 10 feet, I believe in you."" Damn my big mouth. Martin started cackling, and BlackForest lost her shit.

&gt; BlackForest: ""GET UP NOW! You have no right to shame me like that in public. Go sit on your damn suitcase if you want to stay near your friends!""

&gt; Me: ""Alright, I've had enough. Get your damn seat, I can stand up since my knees don't have half a ton to carry around.""

She shot me a deadly glare, then to Martin who was openly laughing now, and sat down. The seat disapproved. It creaked, and obviously wasn't built for such a large mass. I would have said something, but I ignored her and walked forward to face my friends. We start to chat again while the subway starts again.

However, next station didn't come without incidents. As the train comes to a halt, I hear something break behind me. Instinctively, I leap to the side, and BlackForest comes crashing down where I stood a moment ago. Her inertia carried her too far forward, so the seat had given in and let her roll. I looked back up, already laughing with Roman, but I was surprised not to hear Martin's laugh. He was cursing, and his eyes were getting teary. It took me a while to understand.

Turns out, my suitcase (looked similar to [this](http://www.foldabikes.com/PriceListPict/suitcase/trollyhandle.jpg)) didn't have the instinct to get out of the way. And upon the impact, it was tipped over with great force, driving the still-raised handle... Into Martin's crotch. I laughed even harder, which eventually motivated BlackForest's shame enough to get up and waddle out of the subway.

I leaned towards Martin, and told him: ""This is karma for that time when you spread that rumor about me and Mobbie. Rumor born from a ham, amidst salt and smoke, and now a ham taketh away your manhood."" Then I got back up and carried on laughing with Roman. We went on with our trip, and everything was right again. For now."

Based on discussions with a few locals and some research of our own, not to mention her work location in the Medical District, we're focusing our search on the Cooper-Young or Overton Square area.  Both of those places seem to be a good fit for our situation (and pocketbook we hope) but we'd be open to other comparable areas the same distance (and price bracket) from said Medical District.

We've heard places tend to be advertised via word of mouth or via casual advertisements like signs.  That, combined with us being quite far away and pressed for cash and time, see bullet point #3 below for why, has us wanting to spread the word any way we can that we're looking for a place.

If there are any landlords out there, a bit about us:

1. I'll be working from home for the duration of my wife's internship, which is 1 year long.  
2. We're willing and able to pass whatever background/credit check you throw at us.
3. We have one (1) awesome daughter who will be a few months old when we move up.
4. We also have two kind and non-aggressive dogs that are housetrained, fixed, and get along well with people (babies and adults) and other dogs.  
5. Reasonable pet deposits are, of course, understandable.  We have faith in our critters but we know they're unknown variables to you.
6. We're open to considering any sort of rental, from a large studio up to a few bedroom house, assuming it's a good fit otherwise.


So, uh, yea, please if you're renting and your lease is ending between now and August or if you're a landlord and have something that might work, here we are.  Or if you see a sign for a cool place near your abode and want another set of nice neighbors. Or whatever reason you need really to help us find a place to live in your city, that reason, use that.  

I'm sure a beer, wine, flower, or gift card bribe, I mean finders fee, could be arranged if that helps grease the wheels and things work out for us.  Just having housing taken care of and off our, stressed and sleep deprived due to the whole new-parent thing, minds would be quite worth it.

We thank you for your time and look forward to any and all help/tips/messages this community has to offer and will be monitoring my inbox for the same.

I've landed myself my first full-time position in the corporate world and I'm looking for some fashion advice. I've never needed to express any sort of fashion in my life as I had a uniform in high school, and wore sweaters and sweatpants literally every day in university. Now that I'm starting a career in downtown Toronto in the corporate world I've got to change that about myself. 


That's where you come in - I don't know how to change or even begin.


I've had three intern positions in the past in corporate bank and each required dressy casual, but they were extremely lax. I could get away with a collared golf tee and pair of jeans with sneakers daily. Now I’m going to be working in a corporate bank position but I don’t think I can get away with these things.


I’ve read both ‘dressy casual’ guides in this subreddit and am still very lost. It seems I need to have a fashion style before I begin shopping. Now I recognize that one of the number one rules is to find your own style using polyvore or a similar online service, but after looking at approximately 300 different outfits on there, I am even more overwhelmed than before. The issue isn’t that I don’t see myself in any of those outfits – I see myself in everything. So I feel like a child being given the responsibility of putting together my own outfit for school the very first time. My instinct is to find one shirt that I like and buy that same shirt in 12 different colours.


So help save me from myself! So far I have a few pieces – two pairs of work trousers (one gray, one navy), and two soft dress shirts (one white and one navy with a collar). All of which my mom picked out for me.  So in total I have two outfits – gray pants with navy shirt, navy pants with white shirt. I also have a pencil skirt that I got myself last summer that I like but I am not sure if it’s fashionable or not. [Link here!](http://imgur.com/VyOCMvH) I’m actually pretty peeved with this skirt – I got it from eShakti with my measurements, and its far too large (in both width and length).  I also have a coral pink short-sleeved dress shirt that I got four years ago that is wrinkled to hell [(album link here!)](http://imgur.com/a/tHHb9#jfdEPMy)


I’m 22, turning 23 in a few months. 5’4”, 120lbs. I’m pretty sure I’m hour-glass shaped (39-28-40), and one of the reasons I hate shopping is because I either find clothing is too tight in the chest but fits everywhere else, or fits in the chest and is loose everywhere else.  I also prefer plain clothing and rarely go after patterns. I also don’t accessorize in the slightest and don't want to.

So here are my giant list of questions.

1.	In regards to the skirt – is this fashionable or a mess? What could I wear with this? Where in the leg should it hit? Is it in fact a pencil skirt or… something else? I honestly don’t know what different things are called. I can put it on and take a picture if you would like, but I don’t think it fits properly.

2.	In regards to the dress shirt. I recognize it is wrinkled as hell and doesn't fit properly – as it pulls in the chest. I actually got this at Cleo four years ago in XXS, and it was the last one left. What would you call this dress shirt? It’s short-sleeved and it has seams all over the place.  Assuming it wasn't wrinkled is it fashionable? Where could I find other similar pieces?

3.	I hate layering my clothing and have many fights with my mom about this. I know that both guides mention how cold air conditioning is, but I’m constantly 1000 degrees. What is a type of shirt that would look good on my body without needing a … camisole or sweater to cover it? I would prefer to show zero cleavage and when it comes to straps I definitely prefer thick. 

4.	Where can a 22 year old find good quality, fashionable work clothing in solid prints? Every site I’ve been on has been favouring patterns and to be honest I just don’t know where to begin with any patterning. I’ve looked at Loft and Ann Taylor so far.

5.	In terms of dresses can I get away with a floral summer dress? I know I’ve talked about solid prints but I’m comfortable with a floral dress. [Could something like this be okay for work?](http://www.modcloth.com/shop/dresses/bountiful-blooms-dress)

24bt3m,5,2014-04-29,How to boost your confidence without being a jerk.,rockybalboapark,introvert,https://www.reddit.com/r/introvert/comments/24bt3m/how_to_boost_your_confidence_without_being_a_jerk/,"Five Pillars in Building Confidence Without Being a Jerk

I was like you.  I got nervous when talking to women, public speaking, or even striking up a conversation with the new intern at work.  As a guy, we WANT to show the world what we are proud of and to be a success.  We are all good at something.  

However, there is something inside holding many of us back.  If you’re like me, you’ve probably asked yourself, “Is there something wrong with me?”  Our inner voices dictate what we can and can’t do- analyzing what seems so simple to other guys but is absolutely terrifying to you. I’m not talking about delivering the State of the Union Address here.  I’m talking about approaching a girl and feeling absolutely frightened of what you might say or how you will be perceived.

At the same time, we don’t want to become THAT guy.  You know who I’m talking about- the cocky dude at the work party where every conversation seems to revolve around him.  He is loud and obnoxious.  Screw him.  We don’t want to be like him BUT we marvel at his incredible ability to make girls laugh.  

And so on and on the same story unfolds in our life.  Instead of taking action, we just beat ourselves up and don’t get anywhere.  Our stomach continues to churn and our glands continue to sweat.  The whole process repeats itself again and again.  

Well, I was tired of feeling this way.  I was ready to take action and figure out what worked for me after YEARS and YEARS of discomfort.  Yes, YEARS.  I will begin to show you how to start becoming more of the man you already are and want to be.  Here are the five pillars I live by.

(1)  Slow Down

Rome wasn’t built in a day, month, or year.  Best advice I ever got was to slow down.  One way to do this- focus on your breathing.  At first, I thought it was bull.  I breathe to survive and why would I want to pay any attention to it?  

But in fact, that was the point.  So many aspects of our life start to become our identity that you forget to just take a step back as an observer and just be ourselves.  So I tried it and you can too.  

Find a comfortable position, reduce outside noise, and close your eyes.  You can do this anywhere.  With every breath notice your chest coming in and out.  Picture your lungs filling up with oxygen and what they look like as you exhale.  

If you find you are distracted by thoughts, keep coming back to your breath.  Picture that breath reaching every cell in your body and every fiber of your being.  Do this for just 5 minutes.  We all have 5 minutes and I guarantee you will start to notice a difference.  

Or, watch the Cosmos series and you start to realize, “Holy shit, it took billions and billions of years just to create me.”  Keep things in perspective.

(2)  Keep it simple

I don’t like to make things complicated.  I am a guy.  I am going to show you something else that you can do right now.  This will begin to shift your mindset.  

When you are doing something you are really good at, say doing the dishes (yes, I am a master), give it your full attention.  

Pay attention to the feeling of the water as you sink your hands into the soapy bath.  Notice the smell of the lemon soap.  Listen to the sound of your tap water rushing out into the sink.  Instagram your superhero stacking abilities in the dish rack. (Don’t do this) Observe how water is slowly running off the dishes.  Love the music you are listening to and notice the mood it puts you in. 

Now, you may be saying to yourself “this guy is nuts- just do the dishes bro.”  Sometimes I just do the dishes bro, but the purpose of this is start rebuilding your thinking patterns.  You begin to see that everything you are good at now was once a tedious learning process and yet, now you’ve lost that sense of accomplishment with that otherwise mundane task. 

It seems so simple now.  You learned how to do it and over time it became rather easy.  Remember what you ARE good at.  

(3) Your perception is YOUR perception

In other words, you are your own worst critic.  How you view and feel about yourself can be vastly completely different than what others think. 

Let me tell you a story. 

I had convinced myself that I was in fact a failure- disregarding any accomplishment I had ever achieved.  I started to believe that it was ACTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE to talk a girl at a bar.  After all, whenever I thought about it, my stomach started hurting, my blood pressure would go up, and my palms were sweaty.  I would work myself up so much and then I just couldn’t do it.  Every time.  

Then one of my friends stated simply, “Dude, just ask her about her day.”  Of course, I thought and thought about it, replaying what she might say or how I would come across.  Then it dawned on me.  All of these feelings were a story that I had created exclusively in my head.  All of it.  The actual act of talking to another human being should not be causing this.  

We get so wrapped up in our own world that it becomes THE world.  In these types of moments, I find it helpful to remind myself that this moment is the only moment and then the next moment is that moment.  That’s all.

Remember that your perception is subjective to you and you only.

(4)  Challenge Yourself to Break Out of Your Routine

If most nights you come home to watch TV, cook dinner, and get on the computer, you need to change it up.  

Routines are only natural to us guys and humankind in general.  I always brush my teeth twice a day or in the morning shower and THEN shave.  I’m not talking about those things.  I’m talking about changing up some of your same patterns and having fun with it.

Do something different.  Anything.  (Guys, don’t get dirty here).  

Go for walk.  Call a close friend.  Go out for a drink with a co-worker.  Play some pool with a friend.   Do something different during the week- something that breaks up your day from the norm.  Even at your job, take lunch at a different time, introduce yourself to a new employee, bring your lunch to work and eat outside.  Heck, call your mom when you get home!  (That one’s for you, Ma).   

Starting doing things that are a little out of the ordinary and be creative with it.  Do some more things that you love.

(5) Focus on Small Wins

For so long, I wanted to be a man who had it all- have the cool car, the big house, and find the perfect woman (I did find the last one.).  I woke up everyday with that in the back of my mind never coming close to achieving it.  Then I was like, “Whoa self, I’m 25 years old and I want to be a 45 year old?  I probably won’t even be like that when I’m 45!""

Instead, I began to focus on small wins and so can you.  For me, it was pushing myself just a little bit and taking action. 

For example, giving a speech in front of my colleagues was a huge hurdle for me and really worked hard at preparing for it.  Afterwards, I felt great and received many compliments.  Also, I took an improv class and had so much fun with it and really got out of my comfort zone.  Small wins. 

If talking to girls is hard for you, try approaching the barista at a coffee shop.  Now, you don’t have to fall in love with her, visit Paris with her, and take her on your yacht that you don’t have.  

Just say hello and make small talk.  Tell her a joke or compliment her in some way.  Talk about the weather.  Something.  

At this point, it doesn’t matter if you stuttered, were sweating, or your stomach was in knots. You probably won’t ever see her again but you talked to her.  Small wins.  Let’s not try to be our hypothetical future selves; let’s just be who we are right now.

These steps are just the beginning.  I know that you don’t want to hear about all these theories, the famous men who created them, and why you can or can’t do something.  

You just want to know what to do.  You want to take action to make those changes. We all have these inner voices, however, it’s when those inner voices start to dictate who we are and what we do that it starts to cripple us as men.  

Maybe it’s society we blame, maybe it’s our parents we blame, maybe it was our first love who broke our heart.  All we want to do is to act normal and live our lives.  Practice these steps and you will start to see yourself as the man you were always meant to be."

I was like you. I got nervous when talking to women, public speaking, or even striking up a conversation with the new intern at work. As a guy, we WANT to show the world what we are proud of and to be a success. We are all good at something.

However, there is something inside holding many of us back. If you’re like me, you’ve probably asked yourself, “Is there something wrong with me?” Our inner voices dictate what we can and can’t do- analyzing what seems so simple to other guys but is absolutely terrifying to you. I’m not talking about delivering the State of the Union Address here. I’m talking about approaching a girl and feeling absolutely frightened of what you might say or how you will be perceived.

At the same time, we don’t want to become THAT guy. You know who I’m talking about- the cocky dude at the work party where every conversation seems to revolve around him. He is loud and obnoxious. Screw him. We don’t want to be like him BUT we marvel at his incredible ability to make girls laugh.

And so on and on the same story unfolds in our life. Instead of taking action, we just beat ourselves up and don’t get anywhere. Our stomach continues to churn and our glands continue to sweat. The whole process repeats itself again and again.

Well, I was tired of feeling this way. I was ready to take action and figure out what worked for me after YEARS and YEARS of discomfort. Yes, YEARS. I will begin to show you how to start becoming more of the man you already are and want to be. Here are the five pillars I live by.

(1) Slow Down

Rome wasn’t built in a day, month, or year. Best advice I ever got was to slow down. One way to do this- focus on your breathing. At first, I thought it was bull. I breathe to survive and why would I want to pay any attention to it?

But in fact, that was the point. So many aspects of our life start to become our identity that you forget to just take a step back as an observer and just be ourselves. So I tried it and you can too.

Find a comfortable position, reduce outside noise, and close your eyes. You can do this anywhere. With every breath notice your chest coming in and out. Picture your lungs filling up with oxygen and what they look like as you exhale.

If you find you are distracted by thoughts, keep coming back to your breath. Picture that breath reaching every cell in your body and every fiber of your being. Do this for just 5 minutes. We all have 5 minutes and I guarantee you will start to notice a difference.

Or, watch the Cosmos series and you start to realize, “Holy shit, it took billions and billions of years just to create me.” Keep things in perspective.

(2) Keep it simple

I don’t like to make things complicated. I am a guy. I am going to show you something else that you can do right now. This will begin to shift your mindset.

When you are doing something you are really good at, say doing the dishes (yes, I am a master), give it your full attention.

I'm looking for a summer sublet starting around May 10th until mid August (around the 16th, but that's flexible). I'll be working in Van Ness and would prefer living on the red line, but I'm not too particular about location as long as it's near a metro. Looking to keep rent below $1000, but the cheaper the better.

About me: 22 year old, coming back to DC for yet another internship. Female, but I'm fine with living with whomever. Clean, friendly, alright with hanging out but also keeping to myself depending. Also, I used to work as a pastry chef and can bake some delicious pastries, if that's what you're into. Let's be realistic though, who doesn't love pastries.

PM me if you have any questions or are looking for a roommate/subletter.


Thanks, y'all!"
24c2be,3,2014-04-29,How do I deal with an unwanted favor done behind my back?,entai1832,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/24c2be/how_do_i_deal_with_an_unwanted_favor_done_behind/,"I’m a rising college senior and there’s considerable social pressure to get a summer internship. I’m interested in the political arena and wanted to have a go at a job in my field of interest at a political consulting or communications firm. The obvious place to look is DC, but I live pretty far away and in a state that doesn’t exactly host a lot of opportunities for my party affiliation.

My dad’s coworker had a connection to a firm that doesn’t normally have a summer internship but calling in a favor the coworker talked with the firm and they agreed to interview me over this past winter break. It went well and they pretty much guaranteed me a position for the summer once they planned their calendar and budget for the new year. This was understandable given that it was early January and the midterm elections for my state were rising. They tell me they’ll get back to me in a few weeks with specifics on the position.

The agreed date goes by and then an additional month goes by without hearing from them or responses to my SOS emails. I assume that something went sour and proceeded to find and apply to 20-25 more internships that are mostly in the DC area. After I get all my applications out, I finally hear back from the initial firm in my home state (which again is pretty much the only firm of my party in the state) stating that they can only offer me an unpaid position which was different than the original, though unwritten and unofficial agreement. I’m cool with it since I’ve sent out plenty more applications, I tell them thank you for the opportunity and that I would rather stay in the state (a lie) but I need a paid position and I’m waiting to hear back from other opportunities and we left on a good note.

Here’s the twist. My dad’s coworker finds out about our agreement through the grapevine and gets pretty peeved. Apparently the firm had told him they were planning on paying me and said coworker of my dad proceeds to strong-arm the firm within the past couple of weeks into paying me. I was not aware of any of this happening and did not encourage it. I was at the point that I wanted to find my own position and not let others do the work for me.

Now that I’m in this situation, I’m at a loss for what I should do. Do I take the position without waiting for the other opportunities to even reply, if they reply? There’s no guarantee that I’ll even get a position in DC, but I would rather be there this summer, though after living expenses I would probably hardly break even, but the experience would likely be far more valuable than staying at home. How do I juggle the social interaction with the firm at home without seeming ungrateful for the favor or for the sudden “discovery of a new position”?

TL;DR- Dad’s coworker helped me find a summer position that is my first but not most desired availability, but was done so with some coercion and I don’t know what to do."

24c7c0,6,2014-04-29,Inferiority Complex.,offmychest456,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/24c7c0/inferiority_complex/,"Whenever I'm around someone successful around my age, I really don't know how to react and i sort of seize up, unable to do anything and become a little depressed(I'm usually quite cheerful). Now that I'm in University, it's really becoming quite noticeable for myself.

It's becoming one of the main reasons why I don't study as hard anymore and i really want to fix it. I've grown into the mindset that if i enter an exam with little preparation and study and come out with a 52, I'm actually ecstatic that i passed, it doesn't matter if a close friend got 90, because as far as I'm concerned I barely even tried.

This semester, I've actually been trying for my units. I got 76 for a midsem which is a Distinction and above average. But my friend, whom I've been studying at uni with, gets a 90. And I don't understand why, but I'm just depressed. It almost feels like his time is worth more then mine.

It's also been happening when I do assignments at University. Just 2 weeks ago I was working on an assignment outside of my major(I'm majoring in Econometrics and the assignment was on finance), and it just so happened that the group close to mine was also working on the same thing but further ahead. For about 2 hours, i just sat there unable to make any progress, just listening to them talk about successful interns and turning down companies and things on the assignment which i just didn't understand. I just felt useless and demotivated hearing the success and differences of someone my own age.

Does anyone else experience this? Is there something i can do to lessen this horrible feeling?

I really wanted to graduate early but they're telling me its nearly impossible. its partially my fault for not taking the proper classes at the right times but also the advisement for not really telling me the full story as i was registering for classes.

24ch5n,1,2014-04-30,(Spoilers All) I think all the Night's King theories are close but a little off the mark. Here's mine.,FinishTheBooksGRRM,asoiaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/24ch5n/spoilers_all_i_think_all_the_nights_king_theories/,"So, in the HBO synopsis, the Other at the end of S04E04 was referred to as the Night's King.  I don't buy that this was a simple mistake, because why would someone associate a random high-level Other with the Night's King from the past?  It's is oddly specific, as we've all noted, and hints that someone (maybe an intern or a low-level employee) took the name from the script without realizing the identity wasn't to be revealed yet.  From this, I think we can reasonably conclude that the character we saw is called the Night's King by the showrunners or in the script.

The thing is, I've noticed the majority here seem to think that this means it is THE Night's King from lore.  I think that's doubtful.  The Night's King of lore was only the 13th Lord Commander of the Wall, which was built about 8000 years ago.  So, even accounting for a generous reign for each of the first 13 Lord Commanders, we're talking about someone who lived almost 8000 years ago.

It seems unlikely to me that, even accounting for the idea that the Others may be long-lived, that this is THE Night's King from that far in the past.  It seems more likely to me that this is the current Night's King and that there has been some sort of succession from the original over the centuries.

Some of the rest of you have speculated this as well and what it means.  Some of you have suggested that maybe the Wall was originally manned and built by the Others to keep out man and that the Others were overcome during the reign of the Night's King and have lived in exile ever since.  I think this is close, but again off the mark.

There's too much evidence that the Wall was built by men.  The forts seem built for men, not for Others.  Also, Coldhands (and presumably the Others) can't yet pass the Wall.  This makes it seem unlikely that the Wall was built for Others by Others and there's some kind of revisionist history going on.  Plus, GRRM likes to foreshadow the fuck out of things.  There's been absolutely none that would lead us to believe the Wall was manned and built by Others.

So what's my theory?  It's pretty simple and based only in what we ""know"" so far.

The Night's Watch was founded, as stated, to keep watch from the Wall for the Others after the Long Night.  Presumably, the war heavily dwindled the Others' numbers, maybe even decimated their society altogether (or it's doubtful they would've given up the fight).  The 13th Lord Commander, just as stated, eventually fell in love with an Other woman, became one, and used ""sorcery"" to control his brothers (which was most likely either turning them into Others as well or perhaps wights but maybe something else).  The King in the North and the King Beyond the Wall eventually teamed up, according to the stories, and ""defeated"" him.

This is the end of what lore we have about the situation.

I believe, because we aren't explicitly told he died, that the Night's King and the brothers he controlled or turned fled back into Other society or what was left of it.  It may even be that while the Night's King and his bride briefly ruled from the Wall that they were the last remaining power structure in Other society (maybe this was a last ditch effort by the Others after losing the war with man).  Whatever the case, it appears to me the Night's King and his band somehow became rulers of the Others, maybe by way of a power vacuum from the war.  Or it may be that the Other woman who married the Night's King was some kind of Other royalty to begin with.  However it happened, it appears to have continued on to present day, with the current leader of the Others still claiming the title of Night's King.

It's simplistic, but makes the most sense to me.  It also explains a few things, like why the Others seemingly have much more animosity towards the Night's Watch than they do toward the wildlings and why the Night's King and the 12 Others standing with him seem to resemble brothers of the Night's Watch."

I am in severe emotional pain and I clawing my way through finals week.  My girlfriend of 4 1/2 years came to me the other day and told me that we needed a break.  She was leaving for the summer for internships and than leaving for China in the fall. She told me we could use this time to grow and become more independent and have a stronger relationship after.

However, it wasn't the whole truth.  I was suspicious and decided to snoop.

I found out that a guy I knew about and her were much closer than I thought.  When I confronted her she told me a month prior she had made out with him and decided after that that she needed to rethink our relationship and what she wanted out of life.

If she had ended it with that guy there I think I could be ok.  But she didn't.  After breaking up with me she went on a date with this person.  It honestly is breaking my heart.  I tried to tell her that if she continues to be with this person I don't think I can handle going back to a relationship.  

I know now before she broke up with me that I could have been a better boyfriend.  After four years together I took her for granted sometimes.  Because of that maybe she just needed the feeling of a new relationship.  The entirety of my being right now wants to be back together with her, even knowing that she emotionally cheated and physically to an extent.  But I don;t know if I can trust her again.  What is to happen if we get back together and she feels like the relationship becomes to comfortable.  

I know I am ranting, I am just very confused.  I told her that unless she breaks it off completely with this person that there is no future for us, but I don't know if my resolve can hold.  I wouldn't care if she dated other people while we were on a break, but that fact that she is going on dates with a person she made out with before she broke up with me tells me that she doesn't want to be an independent person, just that she wants temporary independence from me.  

Should I give her a second chance?  Part of me thinks we could be happy again but the other part of me is so unsure.


Edit:  She has told me that she wants to meet in two weeks to discuss things.


Also the thought of her with this person makes my blood boil and the tears flow.

How about getting into a good graduate school?",[deleted],cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/24d2cx/im_studying_in_another_country_how_hard_will_it/,"I'm currently in my third year studying CS in a Latin American country and have an American citizenship so that's not an issue. Once I graduate I want to either get a graduate degree or work in the US. Will it be difficult to get a good job in the US with a degree from a foreign university? 

On the other hand, what I really want to do is to get a graduate degree in the US (machine learning or computer vision) but I think it will be difficult with my grades (slightly above 80%). They are pretty good for my university but when I read about everyone getting 4.0's in other places it seems like I won't have a chance. I recently found out about the ACM-ICPC programming contest and read that if you do well in it, it could help you get into a good school so I've been reading a lot of algorithm and math books and doing practice problems, but it's a team contest so that might hurt my chances. This has also affected my grades since I've been studying algorithms for many hours a day instead of doing actual classwork, and I'm worried that in the end I might not have anything to show for it.

Lately I haven't been able to sleep because of all of these doubts, so I thought I would ask here for some guidance. Should I forget about the ACM contest and instead work on some side projects so I have something to show when I apply for jobs? Should I forget about graduate school? I was thinking that maybe working on some machine learning projects could help me get into a good graduate school, but I don't know if it's a waste of time. 

I wanted to go to college in the US but even a state college would have been prohibitively expensive since I'm not a resident so I didn't even try. As I expected, I've been very disappointed with my education here, so I've spent a lot of time studying independently which has hurt my grades. Now as I get closer to graduating, I can't stop worrying about my future and could really use some advice from people with more experience. I've also been reading a lot about internships in this subreddit, but I've never heard about that in my country and I don't think we have them, so that has also made me worried because I'll also have that disadvantage when looking for a job. 

Any advice would be welcome, and thank you if you took the time to read all of this."

So today a coworker goes to the bathroom, so almost everyone in our division of the office gather at his computer. They start talking about what to post on his Facebook. I overheard their plotting, so I joined them. I had the perfect, most effective, humiliating status ever: ""I'm gay"".

I didn't really think anyone would agree, but to my surprise they all though it was a great idea, so I posted the status. It took him a while to find what I posted. When he did, he chuckled, and asked who's brilliant idea it was to post this (you could hear a pinch of sarcasm in his voice). I laughed back, and told him it was me. He gave me a dirty look and left the room. A minute later I got called into the boss' office. 

Apparently, I had offended my coworker, because he's actually homosexual. The rest of the office obviously knew that, so they encouraged me to post it on his Facebook. I got a long speech about it, but I didn't get into any serious trouble apart from the fact that it's really awkward now, because I think my coworker hates me and probably thinks I'm  homophobic. Also, he is dating the co-owner of the company, so I get dirty looks from him too."

I attended Boston Reed College in 2010-2011. I was going for the Pharmacy Tech course. I reached the point in the course where you have to start your unpaid internship, and realized that it was just way not for me. I don't want to be responsible for people's Rx meds, I can hardly keep my own life in order, and that's too much pressure for me. 

I have a habit of starting things and not finishing them. A bad trait to have, I've been working on it since then. Anyway.

I dropped the course about 2 weeks into my internship, on the day of the final exam. 

Now, with Boston Reed, if you have completed more than 60% of the course, you are required to pay the remaining balance on your tuition loan. I signed contracts stating I'd do this and all that. At the time I dropped, I was still supposed to complete something like 4 months of unpaid internship hours. I can't really remember, but there was a significant amount of time left, so I guess I called because I wasn't sure if I'd completed 60% of the course. I now realize that the internship isn't part of the course, it is however required to complete everything and obtain the certificate. This was my misunderstanding.  

I had called Boston Reed, and instead of checking my records like I should have, I simply asked the woman I spoke with:  

Whether or not I'd be penalized for dropping  and 

Whether or not I would owe any more money to Boston Reed.  

Her answers were, ""No there is no penalty,"" and, ""No you will not be responsible for the remaining balance.""

So I called my mom, informed her, she wrote it down in her calendar (she documents everything and had helped me with my initial down payment), and I moved on with my life.

2 years went by.

I received an email at the beginning of this month stating that I had a past due balance of something like $970, and unless I paid within the next 5 days, it'd be sent to collections.

I was, to say the least, very confused. We tried to get them to find the phone record of the conversation in question (they record phone calls for security purposes), and I was told that I could delay my first payment until the end of this month.

Today rolls around. I call and ask if they've found any information (my mother has been dealing with the back and forth since she had it written down and since I'd stupidly gotten rid of all my Boston Reed stuff, again, this is all my fault, and I realize that), to which I was told ""no, you didn't give us the number you called from so we couldn't find it.""

I talked to another guy who told me that he just learned that they only keep phone records for 6 months. Makes sense. Could have told me that a month ago, though.

I asked why, if I was indeed still responsible for this balance (which I would have gladly paid! I had been paying it down), was I not notified the first month I missed a payment? Why have 2 years gone by and not a single late notice, not a single notification of any kind, only ""your account is going to be sent to 3rd party collections or we will use legal means to obtain this balance"".

Basically they couldn't tell me why, the guy apologized but said there really wasn't anything he could do. I understand, I signed the contract, it's all in there. It was my mistake trusting the staff at the school I was attending to be knowledgable, and trusting the complete lack of contact as verification that nothing was amiss. 

It was my mistake, in the end. 

I am still extremely frustrated. I work 20 hours a week. My paychecks are maybe $180 at a time. My payments are $163. It's not the end of the world, but I feel completely helpless, stupid, frustrated, and small.

And I just wanted to rant about it because I had to suck it up and finally just pay the first amount so that my already bad credit doesn't get any worse. Here's to giving up practically an entire paycheck each month to an institution that did fuck all for 2 years and is now threatening me with legal ramifications if I do not pay up. They got to wait 2 years but I better jump the fuck up and get it done asap.

Thanks, life. thanks so much.

I'm interning at MathWorks this summer (Boston area); doing a mostly coding, some technical writing, a bit of hardware stuff, and a tiny bit of marketing/presenting. It's exactly what I want to be doing, maybe even after graduation. Perfect job for me. I'd have to drive maybe an hour or so everyday to get there and back, but it's not a problem for me.

I was offered $16.50 per hour, which is a good $10 lower than the rates I saw for MathWorks interns on Glassdoor. Other perks I get are: my own office, flexible hours, some meals are paid for, casual dress at office (this is considered a perk for me), and stuff like that.

Is the salary offer too low?

The HR rep said there was a bit of room for negotiation, so I want to try to go a bit higher, but... I don't know how to negotiate salaries. At all. It seems rude. And the only other job I had was a generic customer service job in high school, paid $8 an hour, so this is looking much better.

Is it a good deal for my first internship as a freshman, or should I be negotiating a slightly higher rate?

I just can't seem to get through it all. I'm not depressed or suicidal, I just don't see the point. I had a great time going out last night with some friends. Today there was some bs amongst 2 of my friends over a girl. I was temporarily amused and now I am annoyed by the entire situation.

University is easy, whatever clicks with me is easy, whatever doesn't is a hell. Aced all but one class so far, but now I have to get an internship. No clue what to do, can't postpone and deadline is coming up.

Have work, hate work, tried to set up my own stuff (quite competent just incredibly shit at pushing myself some days / weeks it goes well for a while but then suddenly everything just drops and I don't seem to be able to finish it or only if there are other people involved who I can not let down).

I can not seem to focus to make certain things happen. Just ever since I turned 18 throughout my early 20's (23 now). Its just utter shit.
But I don't know why, nothing big changed, no structural changes, no big leap in emotional state. I just gradually failed at everything I value. Which leads me to believe that my live isn't worth living because I don't enjoy it more than the hassle I go through to hopefully receive some joy in return. 

It is so much more effort to keep up and keep myself satisfied that I wonder what the point is. Everyone (including me) hop from one goal to another. I can't even seem to complete any I just hop on and get by with the minimal result but it is already so much fucking effort for me to pull that off because I feel like I have to juggle so many things at once. 

When even when I try to rationally look at my situation, I should have nothing to complain about. I pay all my bills, I 'm getting through uni with a good degree. But I guess that isnt enough for me (in my head, chemically or neurologically).

Socially a bit awkward, not that I mind. I do fine on my own ( I do have friends but I meant that I don't mind sit at home watch a series instead of going out.) But I do miss being intimate with someone.

Some days I just want it all to end, or for it all to pause... For me to get some space... Everything seems to work out, but I dont sleep any better, I don't feel any calmer nor any more content.

I do not know where to go from here, I just felt the need to vent and hopefully someone can help me out with some advice.

edit:

Reason I might be so upset or worried is because I tend to think about every aspect a lot. (Different perspectives, different choices, different outcomes and how to respond to all of this.) This means I spend a lot of time overthinking situations that may never occur but could still worry me. It also means that regardless of how much it involves me, I am investing myself into an issue whether I benefit by solving it or not.
I've grown to not care about small stuff and problems that don't involve me but still I seem to worry a lot

**TL;DR**

- No disease, sickness or anything that should make me feel so fucked up

- Friends fight over a girl, funny at first. 3 hours in Kind of annoying. (Girl is insecure, has some issues. Likes one of em alot but they re friends and now the other gave her some attention too and now he is attractive in a 'we could hook up because ur cute and I like the attention kind of way'). **short tl dr of a tldr: I hate social interaction issues because there is no logical solution where all parties are satisfied with the outcome**

- Myself not that social, don't go out too often. Have fun when I do.

- Nothing satisfies me, constantly looking for ways to feel more content.

- Problems (uni, socially, job, anything) keep stacking up and I take a lot of time analyzing and solving them. Driving myself mad over every possibility, factor or person involved

- Take on a lot of stuff as my responsibility

- Bullshit deadlines, no space to do my own stuff and when I finally make some I fail to capitalize on it and rather 'enjoy' the spare time by doing pointless stuff or worrying about why I am not doing something useful (or solve one of the many problems).

- Not been intimate with anyone for couple of years now."

 Hello everybody, my name is Ryan and I'm currently a student at Boise State University. I grew up in Boise (since I was 9 years old) and after spending the last semester in Arizona State I made the decision to return to Boise by thinking that a lot of things would be the same, only to find out that in some ways Boise just couldn't compare to the education/ people at Arizona State. I'm at a point where I must now choose a school for the next 3 years while I finish my education (keep in mind that it is NOT an option to transfer later, it's now or never) First some background on me: I'm currently a political science major. I have been interested in career politics ever since my senior year of high school (I'm now completing my freshman year) when I first took debate, which I fell in love with after getting the chance to travel around the states partying/ winning with my friends/ team.. I have the opportunity to come fresh out of college making 100k in Boise if I become a financial advisor like my dad which I thought I wasn't interested in but over time I have decided that it might be a good way to get myself to a governor/ public office position (so with that being said, if I did go to Arizona, I would PROBABLY come back afterwards unless something (such as my internship) crazy steered me otherwise. I originally moved back for a few prime reasons: Money, family, debate, and a girl that I had date off on and for a couple years. However, when I returned she was upset with some of the things that had occurred while I was at ASU, and used it as an opportunity to hurt me as bad as possible by moving to Cali with another guy. Although she ultimately realized it was a mistake and came back and is now a part of my life again, and she really loves me more than any other girl I've ever met, it just isn't the same anymore now that I feel like I can't trust her, so she should be negated from the argument. 




**Arizona State Pros:**
 I got approved for a double major (Political Science and Business Entrepreneurship) (and a course overload for next semester) and can pull it off over the next 3 years I made some of the best friends I've ever made in my life, whereas I really haven't like most of the people I've met at Boise State thus far, I'm the kind of guy who likes to party on the weekend, whereas a lot of the people I've met here are trying to be wasted every day and they are kind of (not to stereotype) your typical Cali douchebags.. 




At ASU, I am a member of Barrett the honors college, a well put together community within Arizona State 
I felt like I was learning more at ASU, and looking at my next semester class schedules, this would likely continue to be true (Although at the end of the day is it just a piece of paper)




 Phoenix is a pretty great city (Suns games, First friday, etc) 




The Weather 




I do Ballroom dance/ hip hop coalition at ASU 




Young Democrats club is decently well put together (No politics in Boise) 




Better concerts/ general nightlife 




I have to give it up that there are certainly more beautiful women 




McCain institute internship in DC during one of my summers (probably my junior year summer?) 




U of A nearby, friends/ rivalry/ parties 





Gorgeous campus It feels like I'm in college... Whereas Boise State is currently a bit of a commuter college, it gets a lot of older people and even the younger people here have no school pride/ don't want to be here.. and it reflects in many people's shitty attitudes. 




**ASU Major Cons:**




Away from family




 Potentially much more expensive/ residency hassle. (If I go back to ASU, I'm going to have to try to attain residency for my third year. If I do, my scholarship is nearly full tuition (I pay like 400 bucks a year) however, if I don't, i continue to pay a hell of a lot more than I do at BSU (My scholarship is like 13k a year.. I think it's close to 30k a year to go there.. Do the math.. All this being said money is no object as I will get through college however I have to, and a little bit of debt (since I can't accumulate more than 30k anyway thanks to how much money my dad makes the government won't give me any) 





No debate (see later) 





**Boise State Pro:** 





I love the city of Boise, there are plenty of outdoors things to do, if I can find the right people to do it with (however, two of the best friends I still have here are leaving in this summer/ fall)




 My family is here, and I'd really like the opportunity to be a big part of my sister's life, as she is moving into her sophomore year of high school and might need the influence (although I've never been a big part of her life before, I'm trying to be now that I'm here) 





4 seasons of weather (no Arizona summers :P ) 




Make my connections where I think I'll live (whereas it's possible that I'll go to ASU and end up moving back, therefore making a bunch of connections in a place that I won't live) 




And the Kicker: Boise State Debate: I mentioned that I love debate, and the debate opportunity is the only thing that is making this decision impossible for me, here is why: Over the next 3 years I have an opportunity to be a part of something huge. This team has won national championships before... This opportunity literally involves getting all paid for trips to 8 out of state trips a year (oregon, Washington, and they even go to Nashville and Indiana each year) Furthermore, most of the students that are a part of the program receive a 1/3 tuition scholarship based off of GPA and service (roughly 2k a year where the tuition is only like 6.5 a year at Boise anyway) and she does offer a few full tuition scholarships for her captains and such... Although ASU does have debate, there are no scholarships, and they only do one type of debate that I won't participate in.. So I might do speech, but it just isn't the same. Debate is a huge commitment, we're talking 6+ hours a week before extra practices or tournaments, plus mandatory community service. I did love debate in high school, and I will probably love it in college, but it's obviously at a whole new level.. 




I have a spanish minor at BSU that I wouldn't probably attain at ASU 




**BSU Con:**




 No Double Major 




Still looking for friends (which I would hopefully find on the debate team) 




A much less collegey college town




Well I think that's about it. I'm about to start a job at PF Chang's here in Boise, which is a great job, but there is one on campus at ASU too, and I don't doubt my ability to pick up a job there, so that is probably negligible .. If I think of anything else I'll post it. Thanks for reading guys and I really look forward to your input because this decision has been impossible for me."
24dyfi,0,2014-04-30,23 and thinking about becoming an actuary as a career looking for some input.,[deleted],actuary,https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/24dyfi/23_and_thinking_about_becoming_an_actuary_as_a/,"Hey Everyone,

I’m 23 and work full Time in P&amp;C auto, currently in underwriting for a major insurer. I have no degree and will be going to school for the first time as a computer science major.

 I have had a hard time deciding which path I wanted to venture down, the challenge of becoming an actuary excites me.  What math classes should I focus on in school that will help me prepare for the exams?  I understand I need up to calculus 3, and obviously probability and stats.

 What are some other high level math classes I should focus on that would be beneficial? 

Also, can someone give me a reality check of what I would be getting myself into I understand the 100+ hour rule, what does that really looks like on a day to day bases and whats was you experience like? 

I have the option of getting a mentor at work that’s the closest thing I could get to an internship without quitting.

If I passed a couple of exams and hold a degree in Computer science would that be marketable, or should I focus on a degree in math? Would a degree in Statistics be more benficial then a degree in Mathematics?

Thanks for any feed back.

-Office 365 Midsize Business licenses

I was searching and if I understand correctly the ""Office Web App Server"" is free for ""read only"", but requires licenses for ""Edit"" rights.  
But at the moment we have those Office 365 licenses, are those enough to license the Office Web Apps server or?"
24eclj,2,2014-04-30,[Advice Needed] Temporary job in the hand vs permanent job in the bush,CEjobseeker,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/24eclj/advice_needed_temporary_job_in_the_hand_vs/,"TL;DR I need advice handling a situation between accepting an offer for immediate but temporary employment or waiting for a very promising full time position in the exact areas of expertise I want to work in. How terrible is it to accept a temporary job and bail after a month if I am offered the permanent one?

I earned my MS in Civil Eng. in December and I have been job searching for a few months. I have had my heart set on eventually holding a water resources/environmental engineering position, which my degree and internship experiences (2+ yrs exp.) were focused on. 

Long story short I have a second interview for a more general (also temporary 1040 hour limited) Civil Eng./Construction Inspector position tomorrow. It's more of a tour of the department etc. ""to see the work I will be involved with"" and I am pretty confident they are going to extend me an offer. I am sure that I could enjoy this temporary job but it's not what I want to do long term, however my student loans begin repayment in June and I am basically broke and mooching off of my SO.

I have been keeping in touch with previous employers and a senior consulting engineer that I worked with a bit during an internship (for a different company) contacted me Monday about an entry level engineering position with his company. It is exactly the type of position I have been trying to get into and would be the perfect start for my career. I talked with him on the phone today and he basically guaranteed me an interview for the position sometime in the next couple weeks, saying that he was sure my resume would ""rise to the top"".

Now I'm conflicted with what to say if I am offered the general civil/inspector job tomorrow. It would be very hard for me to turn down this job offer, which I would have been satisfied with temporarily if this magical new opportunity hadn't come around. My dad, a senior engineer and another engineer I asked for advice both told me to accept the temp offer and then bail if I get an offer from the permanent position. I have some qualms about this as I know they really need someone right away for the inspector position and I don't want to screw them over or burn any bridges.

If they offer me the position tomorrow, I am thinking about asking until Monday to give them a decision and being honest about having another opportunity that I am considering. "

24egid,1,2014-04-30,Getting a job on digital advertising?,[deleted],advertising,https://www.reddit.com/r/advertising/comments/24egid/getting_a_job_on_digital_advertising/,"A little about me:
I've just applied for a one year marketing certificate at mcgill university, and am super interested in the digital aspect of things. Im well read on concepts like SEO, SEM, and A/B testing. I have some experience in computer science, and am able to work with and edit webpages. Im doing a lot of self learning in web development, and feel that I should be able to hack together some neat stuff moving forward. Ultimately Id like to work as an interactive producer, digital strategist, or something similar.

The specific questions:
1. While I consider myself to be a creative person, Im not much of a designer. Will my complete lack of artistic talent seriously affect my prospects in this industry? If so, which specific skill sets can I begin to develop?

2. Is it weird to piece together a portfolio of imagined case studies? 

3. What sort of entry level positions should I be looking for and applying to? Internships seem to be reserved for people getting actual school credit for their work. Where can I get my first/best experience?

Thanks!"
24emtp,3,2014-04-30,I'm just not any good at living,tatahtoh,offmychest,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/24emtp/im_just_not_any_good_at_living/,"Hate my current position, not have any disease, ongoing trouble or something tearing me down.

I just can't seem to get through it all. I'm not depressed or suicidal, I just don't see the point. I had a great time going out last night with some friends. Today there was some bs amongst 2 of my friends over a girl. I was temporarily amused and now I am annoyed by the entire situation.

University is easy, whatever clicks with me is easy, whatever doesn't is a hell. Aced all but one class so far, but now I have to get an internship. No clue what to do, can't postpone and deadline is coming up.

Have work, hate work, tried to set up my own stuff (quite competent just incredibly shit at pushing myself some days / weeks it goes well for a while but then suddenly everything just drops and I don't seem to be able to finish it or only if there are other people involved who I can not let down).

I can not seem to focus to make certain things happen. Just ever since I turned 18 throughout my early 20's (23 now). Its just utter shit.
But I don't know why, nothing big changed, no structural changes, no big leap in emotional state. I just gradually failed at everything I value. Which leads me to believe that my live isn't worth living because I don't enjoy it more than the hassle I go through to hopefully receive some joy in return. 

It is so much more effort to keep up and keep myself satisfied that I wonder what the point is. Everyone (including me) hop from one goal to another. I can't even seem to complete any I just hop on and get by with the minimal result but it is already so much fucking effort for me to pull that off because I feel like I have to juggle so many things at once. 

When even when I try to rationally look at my situation, I should have nothing to complain about. I pay all my bills, I 'm getting through uni with a good degree. But I guess that isnt enough for me (in my head, chemically or neurologically).

Socially a bit awkward, not that I mind. I do fine on my own ( I do have friends but I meant that I don't mind sit at home watch a series instead of going out.) But I do miss being intimate with someone.

Some days I just want it all to end, or for it all to pause... For me to get some space... Everything seems to work out, but I dont sleep any better, I don't feel any calmer nor any more content.

I do not know where to go from here, I just felt the need to vent and hopefully someone can help me out with some advice.

edit:

Reason I might be so upset or worried is because I tend to think about every aspect a lot. (Different perspectives, different choices, different outcomes and how to respond to all of this.) This means I spend a lot of time overthinking situations that may never occur but could still worry me. It also means that regardless of how much it involves me, I am investing myself into an issue whether I benefit by solving it or not.
I've grown to not care about small stuff and problems that don't involve me but still I seem to worry a lot

**TL;DR**

- No disease, sickness or anything that should make me feel so fucked up

- Friends fight over a girl, funny at first. 3 hours in Kind of annoying. (Girl is insecure, has some issues. Likes one of em alot but they re friends and now the other gave her some attention too and now he is attractive in a 'we could hook up because ur cute and I like the attention kind of way'). **short tl dr of a tldr: I hate social interaction issues because there is no logical solution where all parties are satisfied with the outcome**

- Myself not that social, don't go out too often. Have fun when I do.

- Nothing satisfies me, constantly looking for ways to feel more content.

- Problems (uni, socially, job, anything) keep stacking up and I take a lot of time analyzing and solving them. Driving myself mad over every possibility, factor or person involved

- Take on a lot of stuff as my responsibility

- Bullshit deadlines, no space to do my own stuff and when I finally make some I fail to capitalize on it and rather 'enjoy' the spare time by doing pointless stuff or worrying about why I am not doing something useful (or solve one of the many problems).

- Not been intimate with anyone for couple of years now."
