There are jobs that I am EXACTLY qualified for but I still don't get them. The company doesnt even bother telling me I'm out of the interview phase. I have a 2.91 gpa but my technical gpa is 3.23. So how many of you are getting screwed over AND at the same time being pissed at this ""volunteer to get a job"" bullshit? Come on! you know it's true that volunteering looks bad also ( hey they didnt pay you so you weren't technically working! har har har!)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EDIT:  OK a lot of you say I dont deserve the 60k starting that I aimed for but you dont realize that the average nationwide for ENTRY level e engineering is right about that. I am not the only the one looking for this number and if you read other reddits posts regarding employment you you agree. Also, according to BLS this is accurate.

Reddit trends I noticed:
1) The comments go with one trend and it usually follows the guy with the top votes. The reason for this post was to let put frustration that it's not as easy as ""volunteering"". Most of the comments say it doesnt even matter. Then what the hell does?

2) When something is acceptable in one thread it goes the complete opposite in the other. Many reddit posts say that they DONT even work as much as they anticipated and hence reddit during work( I'm not in today ). A lot of other redditors say the gpa doesn't even matter and that experience does. From what i'm reading in the replies, a good number of you think the opposite. Some guy said it's average for people to have internships ( multiple at fortune 500). 

3) From the comments:  Low gpa is bad, High gpa doesn't matter as much. No experience is bad, 4 internships are average. Basically anything you do is useless ( all according to what I've read so far). I'm not winning this one.

Okay I wont argue with anyone over the internet. Thanks to those who gave me good information.I'm sorry if I came off as an asshole ( it was never my intention to piss anyone off )"

I am not really a ""recent' college grad anymore, as applying for jobs since last December (2009) hasn't turned up anything. I'm at a total loss right now. I don't know what direction to go in. I didn't know where to go for advice so I figured here I could get some help.

There's very few Project Manager jobs around for entry level, and my internship, while helpful, isn't enough. Most Project Manager job offers around here may as well be internal postings with the requirements for previous experience in the company or crazy requirements I could never fill without at least two other Project Manager jobs.

I don't know what I should be focusing on to help my cause, or if I should be going for certifications (though they don't look like anything practical in a real world experience.)

Please, if anyone even reads this, no insults on my part for not being able to find a real job. I feel bad enough. I may not have been trying my extreme hardest, but I've been trying pretty hard. It's not easy to look at a job list full of door to door salesmen offers, go to backdoor interviews for going door to door selling cable packages on cold contact, and phone calls that go nowhere, and placement companies that sabotage you for no explainable reason.

I just want some help. Or some direction. Please?"

My girlfriend was right behind me, wanting me to succeed and knowing that the two of us would be seeing a lot less of one another because I worked from 8pm-4am (sometimes 8am) and had to sleep during the day.

It's been almost a month of me working and I've seen her as much as I can (maybe 8 times in the past month? So 2 times a week) and she has started getting angry when I say I can't see her because I need to sleep due to working that night. She just doesn't understand that seeing her means I have to sacrifice my sleep and stay up for 22+ hours in a day, then go to work on little to no sleep. On top of it, she has become increasingly clingy and I've noticed myself getting short tempered with her because of it.

I want to take a break from each other but I found out after her last ex broke up with her (she wasn't even devoted to the relationship at the end of it because he broke up with her for drugs) she stepped infront of a bus and tried to kill herself. She is head-over-heals in love with me, but I think some space might be good, I'm just afraid she will try to hurt herself and I'm not sure how to go about doing it. Clearly my attitude has changed towards her since I haven't really talked with her much in the last two weeks.

Reddit, what should I do?

TL;DR: New job that forces me to work nights. Seeing my girlfriend means I don't get sleep. She is becoming a little overwhelming. Should I end it with her?"
hpr9e,1,2011-06-02,"Hi Reddit, it's not often I ask for help, but I feel this is a good place to ask.",situational412,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/hpr9e/hi_reddit_its_not_often_i_ask_for_help_but_i_feel/,"The recent negative threads about job searching and the like has, as I know with perhaps many others, hit home with me. Right now my thoughts on what to do, where to go, how to do it, in my life are jumbled and all over the place, and even my thoughts as of at the moment are scattered as I struggle to make this post coherent to have some semblance of flow to it.

I graduated last year from the University of California, San Diego (yay, go Tritons, I suppose) with a B.S in Physiology and Neuroscience. It was supposed to be a stepping stone to medical school. Coming from a decently traditional Asian background, my entire life I had the concept of ""YOU are an Asian male, you are going to be either an engineer or a doctor"" drilled into me. It wasn't something I ever particularly enjoyed doing - I would take my courses to graduate on time just because I had to do it. At the time, I didn't even consider other opportunities. And these classes were especially difficult. Compounding with the fact that I didn't really care or have a passion for the material I was learning, I was content with getting by with average grades (overall 3.04 GPA), and just going to class and immediately going back to my apartment if it was possible. 

I graduated, studied to take the MCAT (30R), and at some point afterwards, I simply said ""Fuck it."" Fuck me for spending my college education doing something not for me, but for others. How can I even consider going to medical school when I don't have the academics to get my foot in the door in the first place? I was angry mostly at myself that I had been blindly trying to fulfill not my own ambitions and goals, but someone else's. 

But what do I do now, then? I didn't take the time to take courses of my choosing during college; I never got to find out what I would really enjoy doing for a career. 

Morale and self-confidence was/is at an all-time low; I couldn't find a job for the past year - I got about two interviews total. I am living at home with my parents with no income to call my own.

I have several random options that I have considered at the moment. I have no idea what they'll turn into or how I'm going to reach those goals, but I'll try to lay it out the best I can. 

1) I lied to you earlier. I actually did find the time to take a year of Japanese language my final year in college, and I had very much enjoyed it, being it the only non-science courses I've taken in years. I applied to JET this past year, but I didn't make it to the interview stage. I plan to reapply this year, so I was looking for ways to see whether or not I liked to actually teach, as I had never really done it before. I began volunteering once a week for an ESL position. Turns out, I love it. I was given several students to work with week after week; these ladies, several of whom had never had a formal education in their entire lives, could eventually read simple stories, write simple sentences, and converse with me in English. It's a great thing to be able to see where your work and effort become in the progress of others. I really hope I get accepted into JET this coming year. Unfortunately, I don't know what would become of me if I get in, go abroad, and come back after a year or two.

2) As mentioned in the prior paragraph, I discovered I really enjoy working closely with several individuals, and seeing my efforts through their progress. I did a little research and I came to the decision that perhaps physical therapy would be best suited for someone of my nature, with it involving science as a plus, since I had graduated with a similar degree. Also, it seems like a more viable career path than going abroad for a couple years (which, to be honest, is a farfetched idea. I don't think I'm qualified at all). I immediately ran into issues.

There was no way I was going to be able to apply on time this year. I have to volunteer about 150 hours minimum with hands on experience, three letters of recommendation from physical therapists, and I have to go back to school to take even more courses. On top of that, coincidentally, because of my degree, I had already completed a good portion of the courses (with the low grades), so I have a bunch of courses I cannot retake for a higher grade, putting my prerequisite GPA at about a 3.0, whereas most applicants get in with a 3.5+. To top things off, if everything went completely smoothly (yeah, right) with no problems, the earliest I could expect to enter the program would be 2013 - two years from now. At the earliest. While I did manage to be accepted into a good hospital internship, I don't know if my efforts will yield results in the end - everything seems to go wrong for me at some point or another. 

I don't know what else to say. I have no idea where I'll end up, no idea what I'll end up doing, and I feel I keep backtracking because I am afraid that more failures would set me back even more years - I feel awful that I wasted a year doing pretty much nothing. I just feel that others out there are/were perhaps in the same position as me, and have found a way to make themselves happy and successful in their lives. I would appreciate any input anyone has to offer.

TLDR: I fail at life, need advice."

I am a 22 year old college student, and I am calling out to the beautiful community of reddit for help. I am currently being assaulted by debt collectors over a sum that I was led to believe that I was paying off via monthly payments, but instead was only paying to extend payments. I have no money, I am not able to work a sufficient job to pay back this amount right now because I am busy working at an internship and applying for medical school, and my parents cannot help because my father recently lost his job and is having a hard time just getting by at the moment. 

I am not one to typically ask for help as I try to solve my problems myself, and I have never been one to beg for anything, but I am desperate at this point. I have seen amazing stories on here before describing people helping out their fellow redditors, and I am hoping that this can become one of them. Of course, any sort of contribution at all would be a huge help to me, and of course I would pay anyone back as soon as I am able. 

If you are interested in helping just send me a message and we can work out the details. 

Thank you so much my fellow redditors."

A lot of this I attribute to studying my ass off up until middle school, giving me the tools to basically blow off my high school and college courses so far with little effort, using logic and common sense to bullshit my way through hw, tests, essays, etc. . . However, throughout this time, I have had little direction and have have no dreams or aspirations, and honestly, after everything, I really don't know that much since I just blew through everything. Now, I'm getting into the real world and I can't just blow shit off and be highly regarded. I started a tech / major related internship this summer and it has really hit me-- I am lazy, don't enjoy my work, and most of all, I'm woefully incompetent in my field, leading to great levels of anxiety. I'm at a point where I honestly feel I could be fired at any point (pretty sure my blood pressure is rising too lol). I can't understand or even remember my bosses tech briefs and I feel like I am just not in the right place.

Its not like I never saw this coming either--In the back of my head, I always knew something like this would happen. Through my years of laziness and isolation, I have developed none of the skills necessary to succeed. Sure, I've dealt with depression and drug use, but I don't think those are the sole factors in my aimless disposition. I've always expected to eventually become successful and happy, but I never really lived life. . .

Right now, I'd rather just drop out of everything and get some mindless job that requires no effort then continue to punch myself every day. Why bust my ass working all day on something I hate and is causing me to feel so feel stupid. It isn't that I don't want to be good at whatever I do. I would love to have an easy job and kill the hell out of it every day than have a hard job and struggle everyday and end up doing a mediocre job that disappoints others. On the other hand, I fear if I go that route, I'll feel forever ashamed and guilty of being a worthless pos.

I know I'm not the only lazy asshole out there, so does anyone else have similar experiences or advice? Sorry this was long, but thanks for any replies! (Throwaway account)

hr4a6,14,2011-06-03,Help... What do you do when you have a crazy and racist mother?,throwaway1419,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/hr4a6/help_what_do_you_do_when_you_have_a_crazy_and/,"So this is what has been happening these past 3 weeks. I am 21 years old, currently on an internship. 

My mom found out I had a boyfriend 3 weeks ago. He is pakistani, I am chinese. I convinced her it was only a four month relationship, whereas it was actually 1.5 years so far. 

My dad freaked out and disowned me. His mother is now praying that I marry him soon so that I will get cheated on because he will for sure marry multiple wives and I will come crying back to my father in defeat. This isn't too much of a change for me because my dad has never really had much of a relationship with me, so it's like nothing happened between us basically. We just never talk to each other anymore. 

My mom is cursing my dad's mom for saying that, wanted to find a place to buy a gun so she could kill her and then herself so I won't be 'cursed'. Hopefully, this has passed and she isn't thinking about that anymore. At the time, she was threatening to also take my cat to a shelter, and I was so angry I said if she did that, I was going to move out. This prompted the following deal, where I agreed to her conditions of being ""open-minded"" and going out on dates secretly if a guy asks me out (behind my bf's back). She claims that she knows me so well and that I won't ever break up with him unless he breaks up with me, which is when he gets married. She says that women are disadvantaged because as they get older, they have a smaller pool of men to choose from so I better start now and not just fixate on one guy. I tell her I will date more guys eventually, she refuses to believe me. 

She continues to worry and cry over the fact that I was going to leave and then writes me a long email saying 'this is my last piece of advice for you, whenever you think of me, please read this'. She says she's going to leave the house so I don't leave because if I leave, I will most definitely get raped and killed living on my own. I tell her I was only going to leave because of a fit of madness and she was all relieved and glad to be able to stay and that I wasn't going to leave. But she still keeps saying that she's scared I'll leave to this day. 

Now, even though I agree to her conditions, she keeps lecturing me every day, about how pakistanis are bad, because they're poor and have large families and don't respect women etc etc. They have a law in which polygamy is okay, so he's going to have many wives and I will live a miserable life if I stay with him. She claims I've become a terrorist. This happens every day. She asks me when I come home where I've been, who I've been with. If I was with my bf, she will freak out and start lecturing me even further. She says she's researched assassins and knows how much they cost. However, she's been not working, has gotten a warning from her superiors to work because all she does is cry at work all day long. I thought she had stopped when I agreed to the conditions awhile back, but apparently she hasn't. She's lost weight, can't sleep properly... 

Then along with that, she's been monitoring my phone bill to see who I've been talking to etc and claims I've been ""webcamming"" with him at night. And that he will eventually make me ""take off my clothes"" for his base desires and then my life will be RUINED because they will get onto the internet and everyone will find out and my employers will fire me and nobody will ever hire me again.

Basically, she's controlled my entire life and these past few years, I've been trying to break out of it, quite unsuccessfully.

She said that because I've been ""webcamming"" with him, that she will HAVE to sleep in my room at night every night from now on. She will even sleep on the floor. At this point, I was just so angry from all the pent-up frustration of constraint from the past couple of weeks, I completely ignored her and slept on the couch while she waited in my room. She completely went nuts and started accusing my bf of putting me up to this. I wrote her a super long email about how she ruined my life (long story, basically she's cheap and overworked me, I turned out bad-tempered, cheap, self-conscious, no ambition, low self-esteem for a multitude of reasons that I don't feel like going into) and she should see a therapist/psychologist because of her irrational desire to control my life and my brother's life (she hovers over his shoulder all night to make sure he's working and not gaming or something. And he's almost finished Grade 10).

She reacted very negatively. Cried a lot, wrote me a response because she couldn't say it out loud or else she'd start crying. Basically her response blamed my boyfriend for everything. I told her about how good he was to me, how he is smart and caring, how he made me a better person, how he gave me confidence, self esteem, a goal in life. She shat on all of it, somehow twisting everything into a bad thing, and then additionally saying that he is poor.

She basically spent her entire life scrounging up money for me and my brother to go to med school. I broke out of that path like a year ago, which was ALSO a huge deal, with lots of crying and emotions. I told her it was all for naught and that she puts too big of an emphasis on money, and that relationships and happiness are more important. She just keeps saying that money is important and because he has a large family and they're poorer than us, I will just end up having to use all my money supporting his family.

I begged her to see things my way and to see that she was way overreacting for something like a boyfriend. It isn't working. She's about to lose her job. She says she doesn't care about her job anymore because she's lost her daughter.

I don't know what to do. The right thing to do would be to break up with him wouldn't it? But I've already made her miserable by telling her all that stuff about her ruining my life and being overly controlling. Even if I break up with him, she may still be miserable and still lose her job.

I also don't want her to win yet again. I really truly want her to see a therapist so she can stop worrying so much. She has more white hairs than her own mother because she worries so much. 

Please help, I'm just so confused and frustrated and cornered and I feel helpless. "
hr38f,5,2011-06-03,I have some sort of issue with my relationships...,[deleted],ihaveissues,https://www.reddit.com/r/ihaveissues/comments/hr38f/i_have_some_sort_of_issue_with_my_relationships/,"Hello, I'm an 18 year old male and for a while now I have been reflecting on some of my issues. I seem to have a problem with maintaining my relationships (both platonic and romantic). 

When I was in my senior year of high-school I became very attached to my best friend L(18 year old female). L and I have always been close but towards the end of high-school I began developing a crush on her and soon discovered she had one on me. We began dating and spent a lot of time with each other during an internship we both were accepted into. We basically spent everyday after school together. At this point I started to become jealous when she would hang around with ANYBODY male or female. I also became suspicious of her actions, thinking that she was lying to me. We eventually broke up and haven't spoken since then. Lost a best friend because of immaturity.

Fast forward to my Freshman year of college. My roommate T is a friend from high-school I use to hang around with in a group. We got pretty close and as we did I noticed myself becoming attached to my GUY friend. I became just as jealous as I did in my relationship with my ex. I began thinking that he would ditch me for another friend at school that we knew and became upset/angry whenever I wasn't invited or included in the conversation. The thought of betrayal appeared in my mind constantly and would always upset me. Now that it is summer I feel even worse because T rarely wants to hang out and is always hanging out with his friends at home. Which I understand because we were just away at college for two full semesters, who wouldn't want to be hanging out with old friends all summer? But what about me? 

I feel as though with any type of relationship I get very jealous and clingy and I don't know why. Just to clarify, in case anybody thought so, I do not have romantic feelings for my male roommate T. i am a straight male. So I know it has nothing to do with me having romantic feelings for my guy friend. Its more of a general clinginess towards anyone who I become close to. 

It's beginning to affect me emotionally. I don't want to feel jealous and upset whenever I'm left out of a hangout or conversation when it comes to a friend. The way I'm acting is immature and I really just want to stop acting so negatively. And I definitely do not want to push my future significant others away because I'm too insecure. **So I'm asking for help and a constructive discussion on what I should do about this. And possibly an answer for why I'm like this.**

**Shortened:** 18 year old straight male who is clingy and becomes very jealous concerning his relationships both platonic and romantic.

**Also, I'm not willing to see a therapist at this time. I might reconsider after college is over and Ive moved into my own place, but for now, no therapy.**"

Im thinking auction where the entire winning bid goes to a charity of the winners choice. Time for the tech stuff: This is not a regular skateboard with two layers of fiberglass, this is designed like a composite part, full fiberglass board 2-4 layers of glass on top of a 3/8"" balsa core for stiffness. From simulations on another part with a .5"" core and 4 layers on each side has negligeble deflection under 15 psi of pressure, lets say the board is 40""x10"". a 400 lb rider with put 1psi on it. So in the words of my self from a few nights back, i hope you like it stiff."

After seeing a report that high schoolers are having problem finding jobs, I need to step up my search; problem is, I get out extremely late from school (the 24th), so I can't really start anything that isn't part-time for a few weeks. I also have all sorts of orientation that I'll need to take off for, and I'll probably end up leaving early for marching band.

I've spent the last two years helping senior citizens in my town with computer problems, and I'd ideally like to get something related to IT work; I'd find an internship helping someone administer computers interesting. However, looking at craigslist, everyone's either looking for college students or is stationed over 45 minutes from my house. 

My question is, perhaps is there some other place that's better for looking for jobs? Should I put out something like an ad in the local papers asking for an internship, or would that get me nowhere?"

I currently have a gaming desktop (955BE, 6870, in an antec 1200) and a netbook (asus 1018p) for school. I am doing a summer internship which will involve a lot of document generation. I had planned on using my netbook despite it being somewhat inconvenient. However, the networking software required caused my system to hang on login, and no amount of changing the startup options would help. While I could borrow a laptop on a daily basis from my employer, I am also considering putting together a cheap system with a larger display. 

The advantages for work would be a larger display for multiple documents, which would be very nice, as well as a snappier system overall. However, since this a fair amount of money I also intend to get more out of this system after this internship is over. In that vein, I would like to have the system convert into a lan party case or a server. I would also be able to run dual monitors on my main system.

In undergrad I originally wanted a job, but decided on grad school given the job outlook.

I'm planning on graduating in December, and have been debating all year whether I should go for a PhD or not.  I've heard many times that a PhD would probably preclude me from many kinds of jobs in industry, and I don't think I want to go into academia (for now at least).  However, I do enjoy doing research.  I'd also like to be done with school by my late 20's.  I like learning new things, getting to work with all sorts of expensive equipment and tools that I could never afford, and my lab mates are great.

I never got an internship or co-op in industry during my undergrad unfortunately; all my relevant work experience has been in the lab.  That, and I got a CS minor in my undergrad so I try to program and toy with computers in my spare time.

What do you think?

hrj32,5,2011-06-04,How do I tell her that this state of limbo of our relationship is unsustainable for me?,tickettoderide,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/hrj32/how_do_i_tell_her_that_this_state_of_limbo_of_our/,"I was broken up with by a gf of almost 2.5 years in January. What followed was about 3 months of pain and confusion, caused by us staying close to one another on both emotional and physical levels, as well as by really shitty behavior on both of our parts. We eventually decided that we wanted to get back together, but this was at early April. Unfortunately she was going away for a summer internship, so we decided to put our plans on hold until she returned at the end of the summer.

So, basically we decided that while we wanted to be together, we should wait, and then give it a shot when we can have a real go at it.

I thought this would work fine, and would give me some time to get over some of the awful things we did to one another. Plus, I would finally have some distance so that I could actually sit back and evaluate everything that has happened.

so far, it is going terribly. I am putting on a happy face for her, so that she isn't constantly bothered by my insecurities and doubts. I don't want to scare her away by making her think that when she gets back together with me she will be greeted by a depressed version of myself. Who wants to be with someone like that? that is why from now on it is all smiles and telling her how awesome my summer is going.

We have made plans to visit each other, and I am going next weekend to see her. Basically I am constantly worried that she is hooking up with other people, and whenever I start putting myself out there, I feel guilty, thinking about how much it might hurt her if I was with someone else.

The whole thing seems unsustainable, looking forward to three months of constant doubt, pain, and distrust. I don't want to make her rush into things, because I really do want to make things work when we try again. She was always my closest friend and confidant, and now that I have to hide my pain from her for fear of scaring her away, it is torture. I fell like I am going to explode from all of the feeling swirling around in my head.

I can't work and I can barely get through the day without crying. I don't know what to do. Any advice on how to tell her how I am feeling, without coming off as an insecure wreck?

EDIT: I am 22, she is 21

EDIT2: I am getting some conflicting advice. Some say to talk with her about exclusivity, others say to bear the pain and focus on myself, and others say to walk away completely. Tough to know what to do here..."

I've been dating a wonderful guy for the past year; he's smart, funny, and absolutely one of the best human beings I know. The problem is that I am convinced he has serious depression and so far has not received help for it.

The story: He was seemed like a normal enough happy guy when I met him a year ago, but sometimes he'd get pessimistic and sad out of the blue and start saying things like ""Why does everyone think life is worth living and has a point?"" He's a philosophy major, so at first I just thought this was hypothetical discourse and talked about it academically. This kept on happening on and off a couple of months after we started dating until one day we went out to the local pizza place and I guess it was a bad day, he started sobbing in the car and told me about the time when he was in high school and he was all set up in his fathers garage to kill himself but somehow couldn't bring himself to do it. We both cried and he agreed to go to the campus psych center and get some counseling. He went and the psychologist tried to tell him he has A.D.D. (which may or may not be true, but it wasn't really the issue he was there to seek out help for). So he stopped going but it was soon pretty clear that this wasn't some passing event. I think it might have been in his childhood too. I asked him why he never did more activities as a kid and he said that he didn't want to bother his parents and make them have to take time to come to practices or games or anything like that (and I know his parents and sisters and they are not negligent or mean parents).

Sometimes when I spent the night at his place, he bolts up in the middle of the night in a panic. I don't mean like whiny, attention-seeking behavior, I'm talking real mental distress. After a party once, with his friend crashing on the couch outside his bedroom, I made a silly joke about death as we were dozing off and he freaked out and bolted out of bed to the front yard and it took a good fifteen minutes to calm him down and convince him to go back inside. That's happened twice since I've known him, but generally he doesn't talk about his depression or his thoughts (to 'not worry me') and I thought it might have calmed down until he graduated a few weeks ago. He applied to a fellowship and a teach-English-in-China program. The fellowship rejected him and he told me plainly that he doesn't want to go to China, but 'what else can he do'? His friends are slowly leaving town for their own careers and he's convinced he will never do anything with his degree because he has no interests or passion for anything. He tried going back to the clinic once more after that but they seem to be going in the wrong direction and counseling him on 'changing his negative thoughts' but I don't think he even told them the full extent of his depression.

He's a smart, wonderful man but he's plagued by these feelings that it's too late for him, he's squandered all his opportunities, and he won't ever do anything with his life but worry me and he wants better than that for me. It breaks my heart to see him like this and I stay up at night worrying about him. I can't do much in person right now because I'm 300 miles away on a research internship until August but I desperately need to find help for him. I don't even know what I'd do if he hurt himself or worse. His parents and friends don't know, I don't think, but I don't want to tell them. Counseling isn't helping him and he's been getting more and more depressed since graduation in May. I asked him when the last time he thought about suicide was a couple of days ago and he said 'yesterday'.

Please Reddit, I love this man and I want to spend my life with him. Please tell me what I can do or where I can find help for him so he doesn't have to live this way.

Edit: I posted this in /r/Askreddit, which is apparently a bad idea. Please just don't tell me to leave him and get on with my life. This is not manipulation, this is not a teenage phase, this is quite real and scary."

Not because of what happened, though fuck that in the a, but because some of the details could potentially reveal the location.  The last thing I need is to get a call from my former employer about a kid trying to break in and him referencing my post, etc, etc.  Based on the details I reveal it would be really, really easy for them to figure out who I am.  So please, if you happen to be a super detective, keep that shit to yourself and do me a solid and not post your discovery here.  Thanks in advance.

/end of rant

I'm still trying to piece together what exactly happened, it's been a few years and some of the details are not clear to me.  I'll do my best to remember and regurgitate it onto nosleep for you fine folks.  Actually, no sleep is the reason I'm posting this.  Reading through a number of posts made me think about what experiences I had been privy to.  Then like a brick to the face I remembered November of 2006.  I remember the month and year exactly because the game F.E.A.R had just come out and I was playing it quite frequently at work after hours.

Some background first.  I had just graduated college that year with a totally useless BFA.  And now I was interning at an office (I'm leaving some pertinent details out on purpose) back in my home town.  The office building isn't your typical brick and mortar stack.  They had renovated an old church which was originally built in the 20's.  Again, not a typical church by any means.  The main rotunda where most of the cubicles are is gigantic, with a diameter of about 125-150 feet.  I'm not exaggerating on the math, the area is gigantic.  All over are sections of Herman Miller cubicles.  On one wall is a two story tall 5000 pipe organ which the owners had fixed and hooked up to a computer.  Anything midi would play through the massive pipes and fill the room with incredibly robust organ music.  It was really quite impressive the first few times I heard it play.  It did the opening to 'Light My Fire' really well, and 'Stairway to Heaven' was also really cool to hear.  They mostly turned it on when clients came for a tour.

Around the second story of the organ, is a balcony which surrounds the entire rotunda, wrapping around the edges.  In the back is an ascending set of pews that was originally used to seat the choir, but now functions as a lecture area for visiting classes of students.  The ceiling, which is very detailed with little plaster inlays and the like, had chandeliers which provided next to no light.  The chandeliers were easily 40 feet off the ground, and attached to the ceiling which sloped from the outside of the rotunda inward into an oculus.  The oculus was roughly 60 feet off the ground level where everyone worked.  It has a sky painted on it and is lit by lights positioned behind a ledge around it.  I had been up there a few times through an 'attic' access.  The only other lighting was this really annoying 'emergency' lighting that was installed to provide adequate lighting.  But they were these hideous white florescent fixtures that were attached to various spots, and pointing up, because the ceiling was too high to mount anything reasonable.  

My apologizes for the long winded description, but I can't help but feel like it helps me to delay writing the whole point of this post.

At the time, I lived in an apartment complex less than six blocks from the office.  So getting to and from work was a casual walk past shops, a few bars and a fair number of pedestrians.  But when I walked the last block around the bend to the office, it was always very desolate.  There were people once in a while, but it's on an off street and didn't have a lot of foot traffic.  So the area adjacent to the building was always dark at night, other than the landscape and building lighting.

Now, getting to the point, I can't help but hesitate as I type knowing in my rational mind that what happened couldn't have possibly happened outside of my own active imagination.  But it doesn't really take away the feeling that I had, and still have when I recall the details.

When I started working there, I was hired as an IT intern, which didn't really consist of much work other than troubleshooting and menial tasks.  I did get my own cubicle though, which was on the far corner of the main rotunda, with my back to the two story organ.

The head of IT was in the cubicle next to mine so he could easily call for me and give me things to do.  I was lucky to have a very fast workstation, which when paired with a spare video card I had, made for an excellent gaming rig.  In fact it was better than my home computer by a long stretch.  I had free reign to stay as long as I wanted after work as long as I didn't log billable hours when not actually doing any work.  So I often stayed till 8-9 at night playing games, skyping, and taking advantage of their insane internet connection.  I also had to make sure before I left that nobody else was there when I set the alarm.  

They often had people working on projects very late, and took their security very seriously.  Each entrance had RFID locks, and within the building itself there were doors everywhere that had RFID locks on them to prevent wandering clients from entering confidential areas.  They also had cameras outside looking over the parking lot and at each doorway.  Even my security code for the alarm was tied to my social security number.  So if I locked the place, they knew it was me who did it, in addition to the security footage of me leaving.  The whole place was designed to passively secure.  Not iron bars everywhere, but rather ways to track who did what, where and when.
So I made sure to check each level of the building before I left at night.  First using the intercom, then if there was no answer to the extension I broadcasted, walking to each level to double check.

From where I sat at my desk, I could hear every sound from the rotunda, and the hallway that wrapped around the outside of it.  So doors opening, etc, I could hear very clearly.  I was always freaked out when I heard the main employee door opening and shutting late at night.  All the double doors facing outside were metal and made a loud clunking noise when the maglock was release and when opened and closed.  On the inside between departments were solid glass doors, which also made the clunking noise when unlocked with a wave of an RFID card.  So whenever I heard that familiar clunk I knew somebody was unlocking the door and either leaving or entering.

One afternoon I got the game F.E.A.R in the mail at work.  I had everything sent there as my apartment didn't have a mailroom and it was just easier.  I had heard a lot about the game, and I was giddy with excitement to play a paranormal fps.  It seemed like such a cool idea at the time.  I also loved being scared by choice.  Not shocked like hostel or saw or the bullshit omen remake.  I hate the kind of gay shit where the screen flashes to a demon head accompanied by a 1000 decibel screeching which startles you more than frightens you.  What I always loved were the spine tingling experiences, Alien and Aliens, The Thing, etc.  Dark corners containing who knows what, in an isolated foreign environment.  Hell yeah.

I started playing F.E.A.R (for sake of typing, refered to as FEAR henceforth my good sirs) the moment the head of IT left for the day around 4.  Nobody ever passed by my corner of the room, so I could do whatever I wanted really.  I was playing with headphones on and got really immersed in the game.  I hadn't even noticed the hours tick by until the lights went off.  I stared up at the ceiling, paused my game and muttered ""Fuck, every god damn time"" under my breath.  But I knew that when the lights went off, it was past 9.  They always blink 10 minutes before they shut off at 9.  It wasn't pitch black by any means.  All the annoying ground level florescent lights still lit the room decently enough, but in a very pale way.  I knew I wasn't done with the game so I got up and walked to the end of the rotunda to press a little button which override the light timer for an hour, and the lights in the rotunda flickered back to life.  As I walked past the giant pipe organ I heard a very loud banging sound from the balcony area.  I stopped in my tracks for a second and then breathed a sigh of relief when I remember that the building still had the original vents for heating around the perimeter of the balcony by the two story tall windows the encircled the rotunda.  It was the heat kicking on and it occasionally caused the old vents to shudder.

I sat back down at my desk, unpaused the game and put my headphones on.  This part, I remember very vividly, it still makes me a little uneasy thinking back on it.  About a minute after I started playing again, my character was walking down an empty hall when I heard very distant children's singing.  I took my hands off the keyboard and sat there with my headphones on, not sure if it was coming from the game or not.  I took my headphones off and the singing stopped.  I put the headphones on again but didn't hear the singing.  This really spooked me, a person who doesn't mind playing a game like fear alone in an office that's decidedly creepy at night.

I took the headphones off again and held them in my hands, listening to my own breathing with what I'm sure was a very skeptical look on my face.  I actually shook my head, thinking how silly I was being.  As I started to lift my hands to put my headphones back on, I heard the child singing again, clear as a bell.  I literally froze in place, staring at my computer screen.  The voice was again, very distant, but was clearly coming from within the room.  There was no mistake about it.  I couldn't make out the words being said, and to be honest, the chills I get now thinking about it pale in comparison to the bone numbing chill I had going through my body at the time.  I sat there for what couldn't have been longer than 10 seconds, listening to that voice for what felt like an eternity.  I could not fucking believe what I was hearing.

As abruptly as it started, it stopped, and I couldn't move an inch, my breathing halted and I listened carefully.  Sitting there for a solid minute I decided it was time to call it a night.  My first thought was to book it for the door as fast as I could manage, and sprint home.  But I knew I was probably just imagining the voice, a result of playing a horror genre game for hours after a full day of work.  I was scared regardless, and quickly closed out fear and put my computer to sleep.  As I was gathering my things into my bag, I heard the familiar maglock by the employee entrance unlocking with a clunk and the door opening and shutting.  The relief that washed over me was intense, a veritable wave of happiness coursed through my body.  I very casually threw the last of my items into my bag as I heard footsteps coming from the front door.  I made my way to the hallway to greet my savior before I left.  Just as I opened the side door near my cubicle and saw something out of the corner of my eye.  I glance over my right shoulder at the pipe organ with it's plethora of exposed pipes and stopped for a moment to scan the pipes.  I saw a feint shadow that seemed out of place on the far end, on the second story of the pipes.  It looked like a different color shadow, like it was being cast through an opaque sheet of glass.  Then it moved.  Not a trees shadow kind of movement, but a very deliberate movement away from the organ.  I know this because it grew in size like it was moving towards a light source.  My entire body was instantly covered with goosebumps and my eyes opened wide before I said, ""Fuck that"" to myself and walked quickly through the door into the hallway.  I heard the glass door around the corner unlock with that same clunk, and almost ran in that direction to at least feel the presence of a familiar person.  As I rounded the corner, I pushed on the glass door just before it closed and found myself alone in the front reception area.  I called very meekly down hallway opposite the reception area across from me.  My heart quite literally sank, knowing that I had just heard the outside door unlock, footsteps enter, walk down this hallway and my grip was on the handle of a clear door which had just been walked through.

To be quite honest, at that point I thought I had to be hallucinating.  I heard those doors open all the time, and playing that game was making my imagination run wild.  I walked to the employee door facing the parking lot, entered my security code and walked out of the building.  I should also mention that the head IT guy was a huge fan of lost, and made the alarm countdown sound, which played throughout the intercom system, the same as the hatch countdown sound.  That made me feel oddly relieved hearing that sound.

Please don't read this section if you haven't finished the story, some spoilers kinda.  You've been warned.

Edit:  I still keep in touch with the head of IT there, so I'm going to try to get in there next weekend and take some pictures of the locations I'm talking about.  I think they'll give you a better idea of how the space felt to stand in.  I'll just post them in this thread.  And thanks for the kind words from everybody.

Edit 2: I think it would be better to shoot a video of my steps in addition to the photos.  That should give a good sense of the space and exactly how everything is oriented.  It's a bit tough to explain the floor plan of the place with words, it's very complex.

Edit 3 Update: I spoke with the head of IT guy today, he still works there thankfully.  He wrote me that it wouldn't be a problem, he said this weekend was going to be busy for them and I could just buzz my way in.  He said he'd make a key so I could get access to the server room to take a snapshot of it.  It's kind of his baby and he's proud of how organized it is, so I think he was pleased as punch that I want to take a photo of it.  I don't know who's working this weekend or if I know them, but I'll head over there Saturday afternoon.  And I'm taking a friend with me because the thought of going through that corridor still gives me the creeps.  There's a 100% chance of this video going up, I'm not going to pull some bullshit where I stop responding a day beforehand to pretend like the ghost killed me for returning or something fucktarded like that.  I'll do my best to give a walking tour.  Should be interesting, I haven't been back there since."

I did do that bet mentioned above, and it won. I'm now also well passed the ""halfway to five figures"" debt I was concerned about. It's striking, it has put me in the sort of mood I guess where this will be therapeutic, but it's also confirmed the fact I've known about myself for the past 10 years or so, and that is I never really care about anything. Nothing really excites me, nothing ever really upsets me. Having said that, the last few weeks, I guess the last few months, haven't been particularly good. I finally moved house, and even though it's an awesome place and probably better than the previous joint, I still don't feel settled, I sleep on the couch more than my bed, I rarely cook and all I seem to do is play ps3 and watch tv. Not to mention the outrageousness of my betfair account. In all honesty, I think it's at 6.5k down, after this weekend's 1k splash where the idea was to make back last weekend's 0.5k loss (and then in all likelihood, ""go for profit""). Even though I have the aforementioned apathy/lack of extreme moods, I think it's affected me. 

Then there's where I'm at with women. I did have pictures in my head at the beginning of this year that kristy and I would be a thing. She was even making it pretty obvious that we should've been. I was complacent about it, then paid the price when that mofo scott came along. I still don't know their full story, I assume they met at the end of term party i didn't go to because of me going to canada, and the rest just followed. It truthfully probably doubly upset me because it was the same scott that seemed to effortlessly get emma at the end of last year. The cream on the cake of this secret angst was of course that he was working in ward 4 all term when I was doing gen med up there, which has just finished. Frankly I think that would've upset me even if the kristy thing didn't happen, I just can't get on with him. I had a moment last night or maybe even today, where I was thinking about Amy. Not that I terribly miss her or that i even have much guilt about how that all went down, but just thinking where I'd be in life had I have called her back and kept things going. I'd most likely be living here with her, I'd be all grown up, but instead I'm 25 and spending most weekends at home, drinking and gambling. Smoking the last couple of weeks too. It's really kinda pathetic, but it's this culmination that's prompted this “bent paperclip” this time around and frankly I think it's helping. 

Not to mention of course the necessary angst that goes with starting a new term tomorrow, that being respiratory med. I've of course landed myself on the team that has Curtwall in it, which concerns me because it was him last year that had a go at me in theatres for not knowing anything. Truth be told I've been lucky with consultants this year, where none of them have been particularly taxing or upsetting. Frankly, Tony was a barrel of laughs, and the only ones I was under regularly last term were the gastro ones, where peterson scratched the surface of me not knowing much but I just got away with it. Hollings was always into the questions too but cared more about george. I pulled out the toronto notes to have a look at the resp chapter, saw that it was 45 pages long, thought it quite reasonable, had the day to read it, and didn't. It's a motivation issue, I kind of knew in myself I wasn't going to touch it. It was all ps3, tv and a miniscule amount of the book “it”, which I'm only reading cos bec asked me the other day if i'd read it when she was going through my bookshelf. 

I should elaborate further, even just for my own benefit, on the girls situation. Two nights ago was the RMO changeover party, and I left before it kicked on at that nightclub nextdoor to it, with Pip, where it was music to my ears that she didn't want to go in when we were in the line. Pip's always been a bit of a nothing in all of this regard, but when we were at home again and going to put a dvd on, i really wanted her to sit on the couch with me, but she of course chose the other one. I don't know if it was just a drunken throwback to how emma and i would've watched something or if i was desperately lonely or if i have a thing for pip. Probably a mix of all three, come to think of it. Then there's old faithful, Laura. It truthfully surprises me that our one time of actual sex turned out to be the only time. She was keen for it the following weeks, but I can't recall why that didn't carry on. Fucking 18 months ago now, that's probably the longest I've been not having sex since i started. Which, who am i kidding, wasn't that long ago anyway. Anywho, I've brought her up because I was at john's for xmas eve last year, and she was straight up cold to me. Not like, playing hard to get, but just not interested. She was drunk and sitting next to me and felt uncomfortable when i was leaned up on her when we were watching that bizarre film on john's computer. So, I don't think i've seen her since then. She seems to be hitting up the clubs a lot more and basically talking about her sexting and various hook ups she's had going on, which is like, whatever. But the last couple of weeks, it's gone back to days of old where the fb chatting turns into who's coming to who's house for what meal. It was pretty full on yesterday for lunch, but I decided against it, frankly I'm not sure why, and just logged out of the chat. Is it fear? The general depression that i've got going on? I don't know. Maybe it'd kickstart me into caring about things again.  

I'll sum up some of the positives. I was reasonably convinced as a medical student that I'd make a bad intern, because I couldn't take bloods well, I basically had never done a cannula, I never really put the effort in and basically taking a history was an umm and ahhh process and I was always scared someone would ask me a question. The bloods and cannulas turned out to be no problem, the history taking hasn't really come up but just general confidence will take care of that, as well as constant exposure to it and I know what to ask and whatnot. It's to do with my lack of motivation/rise in query depression over the last few months, I have nights on end free and refuse to even read the basic ALS/BLS stuff in the on call book. I don't even know where that little gem is. And my car is a disgrace, needs to be cleaned thoroughly, and I just can't be bothered. A cheeky second glass of red out of a box courtesy of mike is helping me put all this down and order it and structure some sort of mentality behind what the heck I've been doing in 2008. Truthfully, that's what it should boil down to. 2008 will forever be my intern year as a medical doctor. How will I remember it? Unchecked gambling addiction, drinking alone, sliding into depression and lethargy, not making any meaningful new friendships/relationships? As it stands, that's what the situation is. There's four months left of the year, I aim to fix these things. It's easy talk though - what are the plans for fixing it? Firstly, I need to just suck it up and get that treadmill I have the illusion of that'll open things up. I don't really doubt it though, the endorphins of post exercising is good enough to motivate me to do anything. Secondly, my intern approach needs to improve. I've been slack in terms of reading after hours, I've dissolved two saturday shifts, spent a saturday and a sunday fearful of being called in because both times I was drunk and hungover, and basically never gotten comfortable with a beeping pager on overtime. 

The overwhelming irony of this admirably lengthy bent paperclip is that it's now midnight on sunday night when I have to be starting my new rotation tomorrow morning where rounds will no doubt start at 7am. Basically I'm doing the kind of thing which is the crux of the issues I've raised as above. I'm happy to write it off though as an investment, because this kind of thing clears the head, gets the ideas out into a totally honest and frank summary, and that's not something I've done for a while. I never really did that with emma last year, but she was someone to talk to. She always seemed to have bigger issues than I did anyway, so maybe it kept me in check as to whether I had issues or not. Jack's been talking about travelling at the end of this month, which I'm keen to do but it will involve getting out of work on the saturday. I've done that twice now, and have in fact only been rostered on for two saturdays, so i'm at a pretty poor strike rate of attendance. By fortune I have two relief weekend days to my name which didn't require me. I'm on this sunday, which I'll do. It's a long weekend too, which is kind of annoying, but as if i was going to do anything worthy of anything anyway. Hopefully means all the teams will sort out their patients extra carefully for the long weekend and they'll be smooth sailing for the sunday. Doubt it. It'll be a good one to get in the bag though, since it'll be my first weekend day shift, and that's a hurdle I still need to jump. Also why I was so happy to have julian take my saturday shift yesterday. The RMO party would've been a bit less fun if I knew i had to work, but the relief i had when he took the shift was more to do with the fact i wouldn't have to work, rather than the fact i could drink heavily on the friday night. The only way to sort that out is to do these weekend shifts, which is just as well, since I seem to have five or six this term, out of the 11 weeks. Seems overly proportional based on the number of RMOs but them's the breaks. Also means I shouldn't have any guilt of getting out of that saturday shift that's holding up the travelling. 

Strangely therapeutic, writing all that, good job."

So I'm in Boulder, CO for a summer internship, and I've had a hard time finding out about electronic music in the area.  Everyone always said 'Denver is where you need to look buddy,' but I didn't know the first place to look.

Out of the blue one of my friends from back in Wisconsin who is living in the area tells me that Paul Oakenfold is playing at this place called Beta in Denver.  OH SHIT, a flash back to Sr. High School, and the '99 Essential Mix World Tour.  Late nights, Guild Wars, and Home @ Space in Ibiza... all these years and I've never seen the guy who initially fueled my love for trance music.

Long story short, this guy put on a hell of a show.  I heard a good mix of classics I listened to in high school and some of the newer stuff I hear on the podcasts.  I wasn't sure if he still did trance, but he most certainly does.  I had a huge smile for a lot of the show, so I'm sure people thought I was crazy or something.  I don't think I've been this happy since I saw Above &amp; Beyond for the first time.

Great night, great music, and I'm glad I could finally see and contribute a bit to the guy that helped me love this genre.

Have a good night/day r/trance.  Maybe I'll see some of you at EDC in Denver?  :D"

hsj0l,1,2011-06-05,Do any Redditors ride their bikes to work?,Say_Hey,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/hsj0l/do_any_redditors_ride_their_bikes_to_work/,"I've been thinking about riding my bike to work a couple of times a week.  my job is between 8-10 miles from my house depending in which route I take.  The area I live in, Central New Jersey (USA), is fairly pedestrian friendly.  There are lots of sidewalks/crosswalks.  However, New Jersey definitely has an over abundance of asshole drivers.

I did a mini test run today (rode about halfway there) and it seems ok.  I did run into a creeper, but I just crossed to the other side of the street.  I'm not so much worried about the time it takes to get there.  I'll just leave an hour early for work.

Positives of doing this:

-Save money on gas
-Get/stay in shape.  I love to run, however I work two jobs and I'm doing an internship, so that doesn't leave as much time to run and jog as much as I would like.  So riding my bike would be a nice way to exercise
-I would get to enjoy the nice summer weather
-Riding a bike is just a lot of fun

Negatives:
-Asshole NJ drivers
-May be a bit dangerous in the areas with heavier traffic
-I would have to adjust my schedule accordingly.
-Creepers

So does anyone else ride their bikes to work?  Do you enjoy it and is it something you would recommend?"
htsd3,1,2011-06-07,Reddit: Am I Naive? (Employment help),braiker,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/htsd3/reddit_am_i_naive_employment_help/,"Reddit, I need your help.  I don't know what I should be doing with my life.  I know I shouldn't have to ask the hivemind for guidance like this, but it seems as though I'm either naive or biased and I can't ignore my feelings.  

First, a little background: I graduated HS in 2000, top 10% of my class.  I went to Univ. of Maryland and failed out and then I came home to go to community college and ultimately graduated college with a Bachelor's Degree (BA) in Accounting with a 2.8 GPA.  It took me almost 10 years to graduate college, although I did skip semesters here and there.  All the while, I was working as a bartender in various restaurants to be able to live comfortably, and pay rent, car payments, car insurance, etc.
While in school I read an article regarding adult ADHD, which almost described my personality exactly and decided to see a shrink for it.  I was prescribed ritalin and immediately saw an improvement in my note taking abilities and retention and I used it until I graduated.

When I graduated, I had a very difficult time finding work.  Most jobs I applied to were looking for someone with office experience or internships of which I had zero on my resume.  Finally, I was able to get an internship at a non-profit in accounts payable which ultimately landed me a job in a family owned real estate business earning 40K with benefits as a property manager.  Unfortunately, the boss in the business was a shady person and asked me if I could cook his books so he could jack up rents in renovated apartments in a recently purchased building (he kicked the previous tenants out after purchase).  While I was property manager, I continued to work as a bartender on the weekends and worked 6 days/week for the better part of a year.  
When the boss asked me to commit fraud, I quit the property management job.  I still had my bartending job and I really wanted to spend the winter skiing.  Since I had some extra funds, I picked up a goPro.  I loved editing the [movies](http://www.youtube.com/supertreegeek) I made with my goPro. I had asperations of becoming a film editor, but I wasn't interested in going back to school so I kept the filmmaking to a hobby.  

Now, I've picked up homebrewing, and I know I can make good beer ( my friends love it) and I'm torn because I have a good idea for a brewery, but my local area is lacking a homebrew supply store and I know the perfect location, which I want to turn into a homebrew supply store/brew your own beer store (a place where people can brew beer without having to make a mess in their homes).  The problem is, I do not have much capital.  I know I can make this dream happen!   

I was explaining my situation to my girlfriend the other day and I need to get a second job, because while bartending is paying the bills, I'm living paycheck to paycheck, I need to start saving more money.  

Here's my dilemma:
I'm the type of person that learns by doing more than anything else.  I learned to become a bartender by watching other bartenders and making drinks.  I am a great bartender and I usually make between $1000-$1500/week bartending (I only work friday, saturday and sunday).  But I am good at my job because I have a solid work ethic and I genuinely like to make people happy (and get them drunk).  
I know it seems that bartending is the only thing I know, but it is not.  I have ~1 year of office experience and I am well-versed in Word and Excel (I can create all sorts of spreadsheets, I know many of the formulas, etc.).  I am also good with photoshop, illustrator, imovie and I can learn most computer programs rather quickly.  
I am also mechanically inclined.  I love to work with my hands and build and take apart items, and tinker with them.  I fixed the dryer in our house by cannibalizing parts from another dryer.  I had no manual, nor did I look online for instructions.  I just figured it out. 

**How can I convey my ability to learn-by-doing and good work ethic to prospective employers without them dismissing me (and my cover letter and resume) immediately because of my lack of experience?**

TL;DR: I'm all over the place, and I don't know how to get myself grounded somewhere.

htr0c,1,2011-06-07,Really feeling like there's no way out right now...,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/htr0c/really_feeling_like_theres_no_way_out_right_now/,"This is probably going to end up being a bit lengthy, so bear with me.

So back in March I moved out of my previous housing and into a house with some friends, thinking my cost of living would go down.  I went from living with one other person paying $350 a month to living with four others, paying closer to $400 a month.  This happened because the house they were living in is built so horribly that, to keep our house around 60 degress F our gas bill was around $300 a month.  So add that onto a $240 rent, and other bills and I was paying through the ass for this place.  So while I was living there March and April, I chose to pay bills and buy food instead of rent because I wasn't on the lease and they weren't being forced to pay it at the time.  Also, since January I only go out with my friends once a week and I barely spend anything, so it's not like all my money is going to a bar.  I was thinking of moving back home with my parent's, but I don't really know if I can A) Ditch my friends like that or B) because my dad turned my bedroom into his office and my sister's old room I don't think would do.  Also, my girlfriend and I would really have nowhere to go because she's stuck at her dad's place until she finds a job (just graduated; job search going bad).  We're barely see each other as is and with that arrangement it'd be non-existent.  

On top of the $960.00 I need for rent until I move out in August, my allergies are making it extremely hard to work my two jobs.  They're so severe that I've been reprimanded and work for blowing my nose and putting in eye drops so often.  I don't do it for pleasure or to get out of working - it's necessary (I work at a presitigious burger joint in the area as a server).  I want to get to the doctor, but I work so damn often and just can't afford it right now.  I have one day off a week and I normally spend it with the girlfriend.  To spend that time at the doctor would mean even less time with her.  I'm getting little to no sleep due to allergies also.  Last night I got home from Job A at 1.00am and had to be up at 6.00am to make it to Job B by 7.00am.  I fell asleep at 1.30am, awoke at 2.00am, and didn't fall asleep again until 5.15-5.30 am.  I woke up at 6.00am, and have felt like absolute SHIT so far not to mention, on top of working Job B until 3.30pm today I work Job A again from 5.00 until 10.00 tonight.

What I'm getting at is that I've never felt so low.  I feel like every time I climb a little higher out of this hole, I slip and fall further into it.  I need to get to the doctor, but what needs to be done to control this allergies isn't going to be cheap.  I'm already late for this month's rent so I can't really spend too much at the doctor's getting shots (in the past we've tried every medication to no avail).  For the past month I've only been able to eat one meal a day that consists of either ramen noodles or one footlong at Subway (6 inch for lunch and 6inch for dinner).  Also, I go out once a week with my girlfriend's friends (it lets me relax only a little and she used to work at the bar we go to so we get cheap, if not free, drinks.  Most I've spent there is $15 and that was after about five hours of drinking).  I haven't had the money for rent so I'm trying to spend as little as possible until i have that covered.  Once that's covered I'm hoping to go shopping so I have grocieries (if bills aren't a shit ton).

On top of working around 50 hours a week, getting no sleep, and barely eating, I need to be studying to take my CCENT and CCNA tests this summer so I can possibly get a job/internship to supplement classes and another job for this fall.  I barely get to study because I'm always too fatigued to focus.  I don't want to do the server job during the school year because it'd be way too much on top of school and the extra curriculars I participate in.  I'd rather it be an internship and my office job, but chances are I'll end up serving because there are no internships available around my area.

I know there are people worse off than me, but I don't know what I'm going to do.  I was hoping to save a bit of money to get a more fuel efficient car to save money on gas, but I don't see that happening.  I was hoping to take a small trip with the girlfriend at the end of summer, but don't see that happening.  I was thinking of selling some stuff to help put a dent in what I owe/will owe, but the only things I have of value are my PS3 and computer.  The computer can't go because I need it for school (I'm a CIS/Networking Major) and the PS3 can't go because it's the only form of entertainment I have.  I don't play games, I just watch movies on my parent's Netflix (I actually don't have any games).  The only things I could sell are a broken XBox 360 I have, old laptop parts from a Dell Inspiron, or my old fish tank.  I think altogether that would net me like, $120 (on the high end).  I think I'm going to try throwing that stuff on eBay this weekend.

I don't really expect help, honestly I don't.  I just needed to vent.  I tried talking to my dad this morning, but he just sweeps everything away and offers no real advice.  My mom is about the same - no words of wisdom, just sweepage.  I try to stay positive for the girlfriend also because she's under a bit of stress as well with finishing her capstone and spending hours a day job searching and resume sending.  It's getting extremely difficult to keep this charade of positivity going for her sake, but I don't want to freak her out.   


tl;dr - Deep in a hole and can't get out - pun not intended."
htja7,1,2011-06-07,"My lil bro is a wow-addict, meth abuser, theif, failing student and cutter.",airchair-kid,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/htja7/my_lil_bro_is_a_wowaddict_meth_abuser_theif/,"I want my brother to stop cutting, stop stealing, stop doing drugs, to play in moderation, and to go to college / vo-tech.

My brother is failing highschool, does drugs during school. He also plays wow all day and steals when he is unable to play. If he cannot play, he will cut himself, threaten to kill his family, strike his parents, damage household items, and then run away from home or get arrested. He hates his family (me, mom, dad)

I'm the exact opposite. attending a top ivy, interned at great companies, and for the most part, on my way to a stable life. I'm never home and currently on the sidelines, but I really want to do something about this, since I know he'll end up on the streets if I don't do something. I would give up the internships I slaved away years for, my girlfriend I've been dating several years, and even drop out of college!

My parents won't be able to help much. they are both disabled - one mentally, the other one physically. Thus my family is very poor.



I believe WoW is central to the problem, although not the only problem. However, I feel getting him over WoW would be a significant step up and can build momentum to attack other things (confidence, schooling). The main reason being that he last said he hated me for blocking WoW and returned to drugs because of that. He also mentioned how happy he was, and how he didn't need drugs for the times he did play. He might just be trying to guilt me though - his words are hard to trust, except i actually believe this.


I know for a fact bribing him with rewards doesn't work with anyone with such a huge lifestyle change. He refuses to do anything except play/eat/hang out with friends/shower/listen to music/spend hours dressing up and ruining my work clothes (ugh). So here are some ideas I've come up with. extremely rough.



Play with him a little and build relationship with him so I have stronger influence over his decisions. Do other activities he likes with him. This may be the only way to communicate with him without being in a heated situation.

Let him play, but ask him to play at home instead of running away. He can invite friends over. Will use a lot of positive reinforcement when he doesn't play.

Let him play, but force him to play when he doesn't want to. Maybe he'll get sick of playing this way eventually.

Travel with him. Try to accomplish a goal we have in common to build a relationship with him. The travel can also give him new hobbies.

Get a pet dog in the house, to at least get him off the game. He'll have to take care of the dog. eventually get him to run with the dog etc.

This one is crazy lol. Get hot girls to talk to him and encourage him to do other things. Use hotgirls to reinforce when he does more positive things with his life. crazy I know... but sex is one of the most basic drives. This will probably hurt him and make things even worse though.


Anyone have any tips?"
htiz4,3,2011-06-07,Intentionally ambiguous working hours are killing me. Suggestions for how to get a more regular schedule?,badboss69,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/htiz4/intentionally_ambiguous_working_hours_are_killing/,"Hi Reddit--
I'm an engineer at a relatively small software company. I work very hard (read: NO reddit at work) and often don't take lunch breaks so I can continue working. I like to think I have a steady output of code that is of at least medium quality. 

Anyhow, when I started the job, the boss said something like ""come in whenever you like, but generally around 9 or so""--standard cs job protocol. Because I take the train to work, and I am at the mercy of its schedule, for me this initially meant coming in at 9:30. For a while, I was an intern, and because the boss explicitly said ""we can't afford to pay you overtime"", as often as I could be, I was out of the office by 5:30 flat. 

I recently transitioned into being a full employee, and got a small raise to signify this. Because I was used to it, I continued to arrive at work around 9:30, but started to leave later, generally around 6:30. Many days, I would be there before my coworkers, but either way, I always left after them. Also, because I still didn't take lunch breaks, and my coworkers took at least an hour, I continued to actually work 1-2 more hours per day than my coworkers. 

Well one day, the assing train got held up for 45 minutes, and I was late to a supposedly important meeting. Boss was super pissed, gave me a massive tongue lashing, etc. etc. At the end of his rant, he mentioned ""you always come in late anyhow, the least you could do would be to arrive earlier!"" 

I sent him a pointed email that night assuring him that I would now be arriving at work at 8:30 every day from now on, and not leaving until at least 6. I informed him that I didn't realize the hours were a problem...Well, this resulted in an awkward meeting the next day in which he said he wished we could all be ""Flexible"" with hour hours. He assured me ""I've got friends who don't leave work until midnight, you're really got it made here!"", etc. etc. 

The thing is, after this meeting, I've really come to realize what he means by ""flexible"". He has become tyrannical in his enforcement of hours. Though I now arrive at 8:30 every day (mind you, he often gets in at 11, and ""works from home"" 1-2 days a week), I now find that I am completely unable to leave before he does without an excuse. And because he gets in at 11, he tends to work much later. I have had to resort to inventing scenarios whereby I ""have to"" leave in the evenings--when i'm leaving at 7:30 after having been at work for 11 hours straight.  As if needing to stop working because I have been doing it for 11 hours already, and more importantly, needing to EAT, are not ""excuses"" enough to leave. 

My boss has the train schedule posted above his desk, and here is his worst, most psychological trick: He knows which train I have been taking home, and if I leave at any other time than when I usually do, he will ask ""which train are you taking again?"" in the most probing, insincere, ""how dare you leave my workplace after only working 10.5 hours"" kind of way. Most of the time, I am leaving at this other time because I am taking the train in the opposite direction (to see my brother for dinner, for instance), and it has a different schedule.

But the supreme consequence of all of this is that I feel completely trapped at work. I must either wait until the boss leaves, which can be a while because he arrives at work 1.5 hours later than I do, or I must be prepared to ""Explain"" why I am heading out. 

I've found myself working from 8:30 until 7:30, without a lunch break, almost every day since this ""incident"". It is draining me in every possible way. 

A further complication is that it actually may be illegal for me to be working these hours. Though I am a salaried employee, my salary is below the cutoff for overtime pay exemption. This is a whole different matter, but something I often wonder about...

And one final issue, I do have a coworker, who is for some reason unnecessarily competitive. I have been working these hours not by choice, but out of a feeling of desperation...but he takes all of this as a sign of competitiveness, and he has taken to trying to ""beat"" my hours by coming in earlier and leaving later. He hates it too, I know it, but he has dramatically misunderstood the situation. Interestingly, I have the feeling that my boss wishes to encourage this ""competition"" (which I honestly would like to have no part whatsoever in), because it means his worker bees work more and he reaps the benefits...

Tomorrow I am meeting for my 9 month review, and I desperately want to tell my boss how much I despise my 11 hour days...the intentionally ambiguous hours-setting that leaves me overworked and under-motivated...the unnecessary scrutiny I receive for simply wishing to go home at the end of the day and eat dinner...the inherent hypocrisy of my boss, who works *at least* 15 fewer hours per week than I do, enforcing such stringent regulations.

But I have no idea how to approach the issue. After the last meeting, I am scared to say anything at all. If I do, I am positive that his response will once again be that I should remain ""flexible"". I hate this word more than any he has ever said. I hate this idea that work hours can be ""flexible"", that my boss can have maximal power over my time and my life.

I'm sorry this is so long, I am just rambling on over the internet because I have no idea what else I can do at this point. If anyone has any advice, or has been in such a ""flexible"" situation before, please let me know what you have done to keep things manageable. 

INB4 ""quit ur job lol"", I get this all the time but it really isn't practical. It is hard enough to find a job these days, you've got to take what you can get...

TL;DR: jerky boss won't let me leave in the evenings, expects 11 hour days but only works 4 days a week himself..."
hti1x,0,2011-06-07,The whole thing sucks. A down to earth view from a downtrodden college student.,Newtonsenigma,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/hti1x/the_whole_thing_sucks_a_down_to_earth_view_from_a/,"So this is my dilemma. I'm a 25 y/o college student my major is in physics and there seems to be no end to the hoops I have to go through just to be enrolled. I am a white male so I don't get as many breaks when it comes to funding. Financial Aid is monitoring my grades for 2 semesters this is the last week of the 2nd semester and it's finals week so a lot rests on my shoulders to get better than 'c's. At the beginning of the semester there was a glitch in the system and I was put up for academic dismissal even though I got straight 'A's. That got ironed out and I was able to continue my education.

That's just the beginning of my troubles. I don't have a job, car, place of my own. Currently I'm staying with my mom but things are getting a little dicey. I still love my mom but I need to get out. The job market in my area is little to none, I get bitched at for not having a job. My mom still thinks that you can just walk up to a business and get hired. It's not the 80's anymore. I've tried to calmly explain why the job market is lousy, but according to ""Fox New's"" every word that comes out of my mouth is liberal.

To be honest I really need a job. I put my search on hold during this last semester. I had a very full course load. I was/am taking AC theory, Tech Math II (there was no pre-reqs but it's equivalent would be trigonometry with basic calculus. I took Tech Math I last semester which I would liken to College Algebra. Other than that I haven't taken a math class since I was in High School), Real Estate Economics, and a survey of rock and roll class.

I have multiple skills, I've worked at a lot of different places and have accrued a lot of different skills. Everything from customer service to defusing altercations. So why is it so hard for a white male in his mid-20's to get a job? If I can't find one soon I'll be living out of my backpack. It's nothing new to me, 2 years ago I was homeless and living on the streets in Anchorage and then Seattle for close to year. To be honest it wasn't the proudest time of my life, there are things I've done and never wish to do again; but, if put back in a survival situation I would do it all over.

I have 2 more years of 12+ units to be able to transfer to Cal-Poly. What good is that? It's not like it's everyday somebody has aspirations to be a physicist. Math and science have always come easy to me and I enjoy figuring out puzzles. What better puzzle to solve than our universe. Who else is going to rebuild the world or find us a new one when SHTF? The main areas I want to focus in are Nanotechnology and Artificial Life Programming. Not your everyday goals. This isn't some random idea that I had. I had to think about it for a long time. I've come to the realization that I am going to spend the next 10-12 years taking classes and attending symposiums before I am done with school. It doesn't end there; I hope to be learning something new for the rest of my life.

In closing, I would like to know if there is any way I can get an internship that would pay me and help me continue to go to school? Like I said there isn't much left for me where I'm at, and I am willing to work for what I want.

TLDR: I'm going to college to be a physicist and the man keeps putting me down.
I need a job but there are none to be had. I bet if I was Mexican..."

hunxi,3,2011-06-08,"Reddit, around $15,000+/- was stolen from my mothers house..what else do we need to do?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/hunxi/reddit_around_15000_was_stolen_from_my_mothers/,"I'm just a lurker but the time has come and I may need some advice.

First I would like to apologize if this ends up being rather long, but I would like to cover as much info as I can.  Also I am sorry for any typos or confusion, my mind has been racing since this happened and I am furious.  I am sure I missed some parts of the story as all of this has been very frustrating.

**Background info:**  My mothers house was robbed on Saturday 6/4, did not find out until Monday 6/6.  Police were notified and are conducting a investigation.

**The Incident:**  My entire family was at a wedding reception (6/4) and sometime between 4:30pm and 8:30pm our house was robbed.  The worst part of it is it was my cousin, a drug addict (heroin and crack).  She has not been around the family for ~1 year and while everyone was away at the reception she had two friends drive her to the house.  I had spoken with one of the individuals who was in the vehicle with her and his side of the story was that my cousin asked for a ride to her fathers house to get money from an insurance claim from her vehicle that was stolen and wrecked (drug deal related).  He claims that they dropped her off on the side of the road up past our house (we live in the country).  After she was done doing gathering up the valuables she called one of the two individuals in the vehicle and said to come back down the road and that she was ready. They picked her up in front of the house and he said she came out with two large bags and two shoe boxes.  He claims he did not know what was in them and that he wasn't involved (obviously doesn't want in trouble). After that he claims they gave her a ride into town, which is where she pawned off roughly 6k worth of my mothers jewelery.

Fast forward to Monday.  My mother could not find her laptop and thought she misplaced it (she is very forgetful).  I am away during the week doing my internship and I was on the phone with her, I mentioned that I could not find the shoebox which contained my xbox 360 (I recently moved back from college and a majority of my belongings were still in boxes in one of our rooms).  I suspected that something was fishy and that it was a good idea to go double check a few places for the laptop and xbox.  She had called me back later, already in tears, as she realized we had been robbed.  She  checked places where she had valuable items hidden (jewelry) and that was the giveaway.  Police were notified, came out and took our information and tried gathering some prints which came up with nothing.  We had suspected it was my cousin, as she has been on drugs for the past year and isn't welcome around the family for numerous reasons (several minor thefts of many family members) and that the time of the reception would have been an excellent window for her to commit the crime.  The police said they would work with what information they had.  Supposedly they check pawn stores/jewelry shops for events like this, however they only do it once a month, which of course everything would be gone by then.  Soon as the cop leaves my mom rushes into town to check some shops.  The second jewelry store she went had a majority of jewelry, therefore my mother had called the cops.  This was a huge sigh of relief, as they keep records of everyone they buy from and had a copy of her identification, as well as pictures of all the jewelry she sold to them. By this time the mall was already closing and we would have to wait until the following day to do anything else.

The next day a police officer went to the mall and acquired the jewelry.  My mother and I went around to several other places looking for more jewelry as well as the laptops and xbox, which came up with nothing.  After some personal investigation and several phone calls later, we found out she had been staying at a hotel for the previous two days where she was smoking crack with some other people.  By the time the police had arrived they had already checked out, the room was in her ex-boyfriends name.

Later in the evening, my mother went back to the mall to look for my items, she had found some watches at one of the jewelry stores, but the owner was rather rude, he already yelled at my mom for calling the cops and said she should have left them out of it.  He told her if she paid $1600 he would have gave her everything back. She called the police again, but they would not send anyone out because the officer dealing with the case was off-duty.

A second jewelry store, which the female driver of the vehicle just so happens to work at, may have had some items as well, that the female had sold to the store herself (it was in their books). It was dated prior to the incident, however I suspect she wrote a prior date to save her ass.  The story was that she came in with her father to sell the jewelry, however my uncle is really good friends with her father and had talked to him and he said that she was lying and he was never with her. She barely stays at home and her dad said he knows she does drugs already.  The owner was also rather rude to my mother and said there is nothing she can do, as he already shipped the jewelry away to be melted.

This is where I am looking for any advice, it has been a stressful last two days, and I think we handled everything properly although you never know.  We already contacted our home owners insurance and opened a claim.  We are still busy trying to identify which items are missing and making a detailed list for both the police and insurance company.  We are not worried about the remaining items as insurance will cover it, however what we want to make sure is done is justice to be served.  There has been a huge drug problem in the county for years now (Indiana, Pennsylvania).  It seems every time an arrest is made, charges never stick and people are let go or given very minor charges.  I wouldn't be surprised if the other two individuals who gave her a ride are not charged with anything.  Supposedly the one girl, who owned the vehicle already spoke with the police earlier this morning and said she did not know the items that my cousin came out with were stolen. I had personally spoke with the other individual that was along for the ride in the car and he said he knew it was suspicious but didn't want to know what was in the bag or whom it belonged to, however he does know our house so I am sure it was just a line of bull as he does not want to get in trouble.  He also has a history of crimes and drug use.  Is there anyway they can charge the individuals in the vehicle with any type of crime, such as being an accomplice even though they claim they had nothing to do with it? I mean they gave her a ride for a insurance check, yet she came back with 15,000 worth of stolen items.  

**TL;DR** Mothers house was robbed by drug addict cousin (roughly 15k worth of items) It seems like very little is being done, and we wouldn't have even recovered the items we did or gained information if it wasnt for our own personal investigation, which we relayed all information to the police."

Advice?,mikenike192,gaming,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/humex/thinking_of_switching_from_ps3_to_pc_gaming_for/,"I've been playing ps3 since its release back in 2006 and I had a ps2 before that.I love shooter games on ps3, I'm a big fan of using a controller with COD. I have a couple games on PC (L4D 2 and Portal 2) that I think are fantastic and really enjoy. However the pc style of controls mouse/keyboard are still challenging for me though I am getting better. Before playing these games this year I hadn't really played any shooters on PC since the days of Metal of Honor Allied Assault and Rainbow Six. I feel superior playing shooters on the ps3 because I am very fluent with the controller and everybody likes doing well in matches.

I imagine myself still playing a lot of games on the ps3 in the future like FIFA as well as 3rd person games like Assassins Creed as I feel dual analog sticks are superior for navigating a 3d world. 

But with games coming out this fall like Battlefield 3 and Elder Scrolls V, I am thinking about switching to PC because the experience I feel will be superior. I have Battlefield 2 for PS2 and loved it and Elder Scrolls IV for PS3 and also loved that. But for these games I feel they are better suited for playing on a PC as the graphics and gameplay will be better with a mouse and keyboard.

I have a macbook pro 2.8ghz core 2 duo 4gb ram and discrete graphics card which I play games on right now and its okay, no where near stellar in terms of performance as the OSX implementation of steam and the half life engine is not of the same quality as the Win 7 version. I've always wanted to build a pc as I think it'll be a very rewarding experience and being a CS major I like tinkering. 

I like the idea of consoles as every game will run perfectly smooth and there is no need to worry about whether it'll run a new game. However  PC's have the capabilities of having better graphics than a PS3. What should I be looking to spend on a custom machine that will run BF3 and Elder Scrolls V smoothly at 1920x1200 which is what my monitor is. How long do pc components stay relevant, how long before you typically need to upgrade your system? Should I go all out with something like an i7 to future proof myself or is that unnecessary? I am also interested in being able to add OSX to the machine (hackintosh) as I really like Xcode and if I have a pc that is more powerful that my MBP why not use that to develop on, though at my internship this summer I'm using Visual Studio which is also a phenomenal IDE as I am working with VB net.

A really cute girl at school has been flirting like crazy with me.  I have my FB status set to where no one can see my relationship status, and I recently set it so that only she can see it (and it says 'open relationship').  After I did that, she contacted me saying we should 'hang out.'  That was over a week ago, (we had to leave town for a week).  I don't know if she wants to get together only to hang out, or if she's down for some fun, but I figure the only way to find out is to have her come over (the plan is for me, her, and my wife to all hang out).  I told her something like ""I'd say we should have some drinks, but you're probably a lightweight,"" to which she responded ""I'll drink you under the table.""

So, it could go either way.

I need immediate advice on two things:

1.  General tips on calling her tonight (to schedule a Fri. or Sat. night evening at our house).  Things to make sure to do.  Things to avoid.  (this one is the most prescient, b/c I have to call her soon).  I don't have AA or anything, but she is kind of the shy type and (1) I'm afraid of an awkward lull in conversation, and (2) don't want to just call her, schedule and then by all like 'bye, talk to you later.'  It seems like I should make sure to have at least a little bit of banter or something.  I guess I could talk about her internship she's doing right now or the American Constitution Society Convention in DC I'm going to next week, but I just wanted to fish for some general and/or specific thoughts here before I call.

2.  Any additional thoughts you have on how to approach her and/or conduct myself, (or basically any tips you can think of) on the actual night when she comes over.  So far, we're thinking we'll have dinner ready at 8pm when she gets here, put the 2 yr old to bed at 9pm, hang out, bust out the drinks and then see where the night takes us.

hvtt3,9,2011-06-09,"There are no decent jobs in Miami, our only public hospital is being defunded, and our public schools can't afford paper. Rally with us on June 6th at Bayfront Park!",[deleted],Miami,https://www.reddit.com/r/Miami/comments/hvtt3/there_are_no_decent_jobs_in_miami_our_only_public/,"Hey /r/miami,

So I just started this internship with the oneMiami campaign and realized that a bunch of other redditors are interning here with me, so we decided it would be cool to give the call to action here. 
The oneMiami campaign is part of a broader grassroots campaign happening in cities across the country called Fight for a Fair Economy, and we have been organizing the lower income neighborhoods of Miami so that we can build a movement to counter the corrupt politics of Florida. 

Some Background: Carnival Cruise Line pays no taxes, and they only pay 200 dollars a YEAR to be able to use the Port of Miami (!). To top it off, none of the employees on their ships are from Miami, but they often send these employees to Jackson Hospital to get free/cheap treatment. Carnival is profiting off of our city, yet they aren't REALLY giving anything back. 
Wells Fargo is also guilty of not paying any taxes, despite having their gigantic building right in Downtown. 

Rick Scotts budget is going to eliminate almost 5000 state jobs and will force local governments to carry out thousands more layoffs in city and county jobs.

Over 13 percent of people in Miami are unemployed, and in lower income neighborhoods that statistic is as high as 30 percent. Meanwhile, unemployment benefits are being cut drastically.

Florida Lawmakers have made the deepest cuts to education in Florida's history, which will bring Miami's school district to a 90 million dollar budget deficit this year!

Politicians like Rick Scott continue to skirt the interests of the public good. The Miami-Dade School Board is corrupt as heck. Jackson is the only hospital in Miami where a lot of lower income families can expect to get cared for, and it is already going to have 130 million dollars cut from its funding, putting it at serious risk of being shut down or cut back. 

The gist of it is this: Miami isn't poor, yet for some reason our government never seems to have the money for the things that we NEED as citizens. Local businesses are getting taxed to high hell while big corporations continue to pay off both major political parties so that they can continue to screw us. I know, I know, I am preaching to the choir, but hear me out. There are more of US then there are of THEM, even though they have all the money. 

We have been organizing small meetings in churches and parks in over 20 locations in the lower income neighborhoods of Miami, such as Little Haiti and Hialeah, and gathering steam as a grassroots movement. This rally is going to be the kickoff to our big collective actions. I've been phonebanking nonstop for the past few days getting commitments from people to show up for Saturday and it's looking good.

We are meeting at Bayfront Park at 1 PM, and we will have people going up as ""witnesses"" to talk about their issues. There will also be a DJ present, and we will be providing water so that we can all beat the hot sun. We have a bunch of buses providing transportation to and from the event from the various community meeting spots that I mentioned earlier so that even people who can't afford to drive out to downtown or who are elderly/disabled can still come and voice their opinion.

Come and tell your story. Graduated with a college degree but you are waiting tables because theres no better job oppurtunity? Can't find a job at all for months? You rely on Jackson Hospital to help your child when he gets sick? Your tired of seeing your local highschool beg their students for reams of paper? Tired of seeing gigantic potholes all over Miami Beaches streets? Whatever it is, come and make it known. 

We will be holding a mock ""Grand Jury"" to ""indict"" Wells Fargo, Carnival, etc. and then marching together as a huge group to the Wells Fargo Building to deliver our letter of discontent. 

I created a new account so that our campaign can continue to use reddit in the future seperate from me as an individual, but I will post under my account later so you can see who I am and scrutinize me, etc. I'll also get the other redditors to do so as well.

onemiaminow.org


TL;DR: Come to Bayfront Park at 1 PM on Saturday, June 11th, so that we can make a statement as pissed off citizens of this damn city that we are strong and unified.

I start an internship with a company that mainly deals with audio processing in a few months, and their code is *strictly* in C++ - apparently, it's the best language for fast audio software, which makes sense. Much of my interview with them was spent going over the basics of representing a wave as a data structure and manipulating it.

I'm fond of Scheme/Racket, and have worked on large projects in both that language and Java. I know some Python basics, and picked up how SQL works at my last job.  However, in both high school and college CS courses, I've never had to touch C++ - not once, not ever.

**tldr;** Does anyone have any recommendations for a good online resource or book to pick up C++ for someone who's not an absolute beginner?"

hwhb9,22,2011-06-10,"Alright, r/Christianity, we need to talk.",[deleted],Christianity,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/hwhb9/alright_rchristianity_we_need_to_talk/,"Mine is a story most... ridiculous, and way too large for just one self post.  However, I've been putting off talking about some of this stuff for far too long, so I figured I should at least somewhere, and here we are.

First and foremost, yes, I am a Christian, and not a troll. 

Secondly, I am angry. Spiteful even.  Here's why:

I got married roughly 5.5 years ago to what turned out to be a manipulative, co-dependent individual. She lied her way into my life, heart, and marriage. I was ministering at a large (3,000+) member church at the time in children's ministry and was working on my pastoral license after taking a year internship when we were wed.

As those in ministry know, it is critical to have a supportive spouse who has the same calling and purpose. There was no reason for me to believe otherwise in our relationship. Or I was too young or unwilling to see it. Hindsight and all that.

Shortly after we were wed, she gave me the 'Big 3' - a list of demands that came out of nowhere: 1) Kids. NAO. 2) She doesn't want to work. 3) Buy a house.

Completely blindsided, I did my best to please my wife and walk in my calling.  I took on a second job on top of my studies and working full time+ at church. It still wasn’t enough for her – she demanded I quit the ministry and get a ‘real’ job (since the church paid so little).  She refused to go to counseling or talk to any pastors at the church because they would ‘be on my side.’ Yet, when I went to talk to them myself, all they’d tell me was that I was a pastor; figure it out. Or that I need to lead better. Or that I need to man up and run my marriage.  And thousands of other unhelpful, broad Christian-ese sayings.

I had my pastoral license a week before I left the church. But that’s another story for another time, perhaps.

As it turned out, my wife came from a rather strict family with some pretty hefty traditions, including getting married young (great grandma was 16, grandma was 17, mom was 18, etc), and pregnant within the first year. My wife was 20 when we started dating, so she was already the black sheep, and her mother was sure making her feel like it.  Her younger sister though, who was a junior in high school, was already engaged and the pride of the family.

Once we started dating, she literally did everything in her power to learn what I wanted/needed in a spouse, pretended to be that, and we got married a few months before her sister in an effort to please the will of her mother (this is where her co-dependency kicks in).

More family tradition is to run a very matriarchal household, where the husband is naught but a ‘yes-man,’ doing whatever it takes to please every whim of his wife, regardless of cost, law, or common sense.  

What I have isn’t a marriage. It isn’t a partnership. It is nothing but a lie that I am trapped in and can’t escape.

I have become severely depressed, have anxiety attacks, and have no hope for anything. Everything was going perfect, then she came into my life and sucked all the joy out of it, and, as a Christian man/father with a 2 year old and another on the way, there’s not a whole lot I can do.

Feel free to AMA.  There are a lot of details I’m skipping on since this is already a novel.  I will answer every question to the best of my ability.

Yes, I still believe in Jesus. No, I don’t understand how I’m supposed to move on from here, how to forgive my spouse for what she’s done (boy have I tried), or how I could possibly have a happy life of anything other than going through the motions and waiting to die.

I am trapped between marriage, morals, convictions, depression, common sense, self-preservation, and the Bible. How do get my life back again? How do I become happy again? How do I become useful again?

**Tl:dr – ex pastor who got manipulated into marriage, is trapped, fighting severe depression, and has no positive outlook on life or hope whatsoever.**

hw7nx,7,2011-06-10,My father seems to be giving up.,worriedson42,SuicideWatch,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/hw7nx/my_father_seems_to_be_giving_up/,"I received a phone call today from my uncle (aunt's second husband who happens to be a doctor) about my diabetic father.  He was reaching out to me because, as he put it, he couldn't stand by and not reach out to me and my siblings while my dad allowed his health to deteriorate to the point that he could hurt himself of die.

According to to my uncle, my 58 year old father has consciously not been taking his insulin, he's dropped a bunch of weight, and is most likely suffering from some kind of clinical depression.  My uncle has also told me that my father has been lying about taking his insulin and that when finally caught in the lie, expressed that his reason for not taking his medication is that he no longer wants to live.

The depression thing isn't really something out of the blue, my dad checked himself into a psychiatric hospital shortly after leaving (some would say abandoning) my mother and me and my brother and sister.  I didn't actually find out about this psychiatric episode until years later.  My sister and I happened to be in college at the time, but my brother was 15 and still finishing high school.  Our house ended up getting foreclosed on and things were pretty tough for a while there.  I'm pretty sure he's been on some regiment of anti-depressants, zoloft, prozac, etc. since.

My mother thinks that my father may suffer from undiagnosed bi-polar disorder and talks about how he would have these manic phases followed by, as she put it, ""hitting rock bottom"".

A little context would help here, I think.  My dad founded and owned a very successful home building company in the 80's.  At one point, he was a millionaire, had a company jet, nice cars, etc.  My mom refers that that as the ""Gatsby days"".  Apparently there was some kind of scandal between him and a young intern at the company and he was forced out of the company that he founded with his brother.  Things seemed ok for a while, from the perspective of an 10 year old anyway.

As I got older, I noticed that we stopped going on vacation, my mom had to get a job substitute teaching so that we had healthcare for my younger brother who had asthma since my dad was technically self-employed (he was a real estate developer), things stopped getting fixed around the house, etc. and then my dad had an episode with his health where he went into a diabetic coma and from that point forward, he was a diabetic, making getting health insurance even more difficult.

Flash forward to my sophomore year in college and my father is having to go out of state to find work as a building contractor and one day just isn't answering calls and we find out that my mom and brother have to be out of the house we grew up in because it is being foreclosed.

Eventually my dad divorced my mom, which is really strange since she probably had more of a reason to divorce than he did and she still wanted to work things out.

To say that the relationship between my father and his kids was strained would be an understatement. From the age of 20 until about 28, I probably spoke to my father less than 10 times.  We were all still reeling from our family, as we knew it, being torn apart when he left, although my younger sister and brother seemed to reach out to him earlier than I did.

They say time heals all wounds and eventually we all began having a somewhat ""normal"" relationship with our dad, to the point that we keep up with each other on a pretty consistent basis, which can be difficult since everyone in my immediate family live in different cities (although in the same region).  He happens to be a pretty fun, funny, intelligent guy to hang out with, now that we're all adults.

So the most current status is that he has been living in my aunt and uncle's second house, rent free, for the past 2 years, I believe he was living with his mother before that, and had remarried and then divorced before that.  He has been having a hard time finding work.  He works as a contractor and the economy hasn't been so hot in the housing sector, in case you hadn't heard.  I've also come to discover that he's having legal trouble, the nature of which I hope to discover when I go visit him this weekend with my brother.  He's supposed to be going to the doctor tomorrow to get a check up and get back on insulin, as well as get his head scanned.  Part of the new found focus seems to be from that fact that my sister is pregnant again after miscarrying her first pregnancy, although I hope this is more than just trying to prevent himself from dying before her first child is born so as not to stress out my sister and put the pregnancy in jeopardy.  I hope he has a genuine intrest in seeing his first grandchild born and grow up.

I feel like my dad's life has seen a lot of great success, only to be punctuated by great loss.  He lost a fortune, for a time, his family, and now he can't find consistent work, is most likely being sued, and is bumming a place to stay off his brother-in-law.  He's always had a veneer of contentment and happiness, although lately it seems like most of the conversations I've been having with him are rote and pretty superficial.  He doesn't really want to share anything real about how he's doing, just that he hasn't been ""handling things very well"" and that he doesn't want to burden us.  He's also always been a proud, if not completely honest, man.

I and my siblings do love him very much and I don't want to see him give up and maim himself or die because life is hard.  This whole thing seems really passive aggressive.  He doesn't seem happy and when I pressed him about trying to turn things around with his health and with his life, there was an aire of uncertainty about the whole thing that was very disconcerting.

I know that we have to be supportive and let him know that the people in his life love and care what happens to him.  I don't think he's a lost cause.

Anyway, sorry for the wall of text.  I needed to get that off my chest.

Thanks."

I trudged through a bachelors in Finance and did slightly mediocre due to my lack of interest. I realized too late that I wanted to make a career in to marketing and by then I was pretty much a semester away from graduating.

For the past year I did a marketing internship and now being a consultant for a startup company. I currently have a part time job that pays very well for the most part on weekends and no qualms of that.

Recently I took a trip to the west coast and met some people who were willing to help me with a job offer either there or in another state in the east coast. I thought this was awesome, finally able to pursue my career into something I might enjoy. I arrived back and told my parents.

At first there was nothing said. They didn't seem to think I was serious. As I constantly kept mentioning to them I guess started to hit them that I might want to live out of the state.

I'm at work and I get a call from my mom just a few minutes ago what the starting salary would be. I told her that I really don't know since I haven't even applied yet...may be around 55-65k just to be safe. She starts freaking out telling that if the starting salary is that low she wont accept me going there? WTF?

Her argument is that if it take a starting salary like that, then when I apply for other jobs in the future they wont want to offer me anything more than that. I always thought the more experience you have will always get you a better starting salary at your next job depending on how much they want you.

I'm so tired of this. I feel hindered by everything they expect me to do. I respect them as my parents and listen to them whenever I feel their advice is sound but this is just ridiculous. This my career, this is something I want to enjoy and they expect me to be some top tier guy making 100k a year as a starting salary. 

I start boiling up with so much anger its unberable. I feel so fucking chained to this situation and no matter how much I try to politely explain it to them they never listen. They're stubborn, they don't think i know anything of what I'm talking about when the fact is I went through the education system here and they did not.

What do I do? I don't know who else to turn to anymore. I feel like my life is going to be completely ruined and just feel a horrible sense of stress and anxiety.

hx2tc,1,2011-06-11,"A lie is a lie... right? Did I do the right thing? I ended my relationship over something extremely stupid, but I felt like I needed to do it...",[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hx2tc/a_lie_is_a_lie_right_did_i_do_the_right_thing_i/,"I know this is long.. please bear with me.
This may sound ridiculous and I know that what I did was dumb and awful, so please, dont be so hard on the comments... :/

My boyfriend(20) and I(19), being in a serious long distance relationship for more than a year (been close friends ever since we were 14), made honesty our number one priority, but a couple days ago, he messed it up... for something extremely stupid. It bothers me so much, because HE was the one who used to make honesty such a big deal in this relationship and he told me that he absolutely HATES liars, and so I decided, after some wrongdoings that I did in the past, that I'll never make the mistake of lying to him again. 

I'll get to the point so this post doesn't end up extremely long.
Two nights ago, my boyfriend called me at midnight like he occasionally does every night. We talked for no more than 20 minutes when he told me that he was extremely exhausted and wanted to go to sleep. I wanted to talk to him longer because we havent really had a ""real"" conversation in such a long time, but I didn't want him to have to stay awake, hearing how ""tired"" he was. So we hung up. I was a bit sad because we didn't talk for too long... 

[Something I should note: usually, with our LDR, he lives in Pennsylvania and I live in California, so that's about a 3 hour difference. For the summer though, he got an intern in California, there's no difference in time.]

Anyways, two hours later, I go on my facebook and see a post that he made a few seconds before. It was a post of the very hot actress that I've been having jealousy problems with (see my previous/first note that explains this whole stupidity with the actress &gt;.&lt; shortlink: redd.it/hvfvt) and with that picture, a caption saying something like ""OMG. *fapfapfap*"" I seriously cannot explain the feeling I got in my chest. Note: my boyfriend KNOWS how much of a problem I have with this actress because of previous incidents, but for this time, I really felt like it wasn't just because of her. He truly sounded VERY tired over the phone. Even though I wanted to talk to him SO BADLY, I let him go BECAUSE he said he was going to sleep. Two hours later, I find this post and he is obviously not sleeping. He went to go watch his T.V. shows that this actresses was in, and decided to look at more pictures of her on the internet  instead of talking to me, his girlfriend who he hasn't spoken to for a while, a litte longer on the phone. 
After a few seconds, the post got deleted and my boyfriend posts a status update that said, ""stupid roommates...."" Knowing him, I knew it wasn't his roommates because 1.) he told me before that he was going to have his own room in his apartment and 2.) he is a very private person when it comes down to his computer and his accounts and rarely lets anyone else use it, so I knew something was up. I posted a comment saying ""sweetie, we all know it wasn't your roommates ;]"" and he replies something like ""darling, if I intended to post that picture myself, I would've worded the caption differently."" and after that I was just like ""watever lol."" 
After that, I stayed up all night because it was bothering me and I had to study for a test for school, and I also posted my first post on reddit. I didn't hear anything back from my boyfriend until that morning (the morning after the facebook post night) and he just texted me something stupid about a dream that he had, and didn't mention anything about what happened the previous night. I ignored it and didn't text anything back. 

After that, I didn't hear anything back or talk to him for two days. 

Earlier tonight, he finally called because he knew I was upset about something. He explained what happened that night because he knew I was upset and he told me and admitted that he lied to me just so he can keep his image on facebook and his friends. He told me he accidentally posted that picture on his wall when he intended to post it on his friend's, and that he tried to cover that up by putting the status about his ""stupid roommates"" and replied to my comment as another coverup. He thought that since I made the right assumption that his roommates didn't post that up on his wall, that I already knew what was going on and he didn't have to explain himself. He tried to tell me that he wasn't trying to lie to me, but he just trying to ""lie to the people on facebook""(those were is actual words). Well guess what, I was one of those people on facebook. He kept making excuses. He thinks this whole thing is stupid because it was on facebook. He hates facebook. He told me that he had every intention on telling me the truth after, but I did not get a phone call or a text after he lied to me, saying that he lied to cover up his mistake. Honestly, if he had told me that right after it happened, I'd be a bit more understandable and okay with it. 
I know it sounds stupid, but I cannot and don't know how much more emphasis to put when I say that he made HONESTY our NUMBER ONE PRIORITY. He has always been a decent guy. Trustworthy, supportive, everything a girl can ask for in a boyfriend, but he throws that all away on this stupid thing just so he can ""keep his image"" on facebook. Honestly, I don't care what kind of lie it was; a lie is a lie, right? 


I know this whole thing is stupid and we're both being immature, especially me. I know I should just be able to let this one pass and forget about it, and I want to so badly because I really did love him so much, but with the condition that I am in, I know I cant. I know I'm still young and immature. I am totally aware of that. That's why I ended things with him. Honestly, if I wasn't so dumb and messed up emotionally/mentally in the head, things would've worked out, but I have so many problems and trust issues that I know I shouldn't deal with having a relationship like this (especially a LDR). He knew how bad my issues with trust were, but he did this to me anyways. This hurts me so much. I am obviously not ready for a serious relationship like this one was and I am too stupidly young. 

I admit that I impulsively ended it with him, but I did the right thing, right? For the both of us?...
I'm sorry if you thought this was a waste of time to read... :/ I am still a foolish young lady. "

I know that I am partially at fault so please don't go out of your way to point that out; I promise that will make me cry. Also, please please please don't tell me to just kill them all. I won't and that will also make me cry. I'm a bit of a baby lately. 

I moved into a house on a fairly big lot about 6 years ago. When I moved in, there was a fairly well established feral cat colony already established. I did not realize how big of a problem it was until after I was living here. I didn't know much about feral cat colonies at the time. I though we could ignore them and they would go away. Nope. They killed things and fought and got really really sickly. I felt bad so I started feeding them and trapping some of them to take the the vet. There, they were fixed, given their shots, and returned to my house. I tamed some of them and found them homes. I wormed the ones that I couldn't catch. I was told that even if I removed all of them or put them all down, once a property was used as a site for a feral colony, there would always be a colony there. This seems to be true. It doesn't matter how low the numbers get. More always show up. Early on, when the numbers were really low (three uncatchable feral cats), I started taking in rescues. At this point, people in my small town knew that I would do everything in my power to help sick, hurt, abused, neglected, or homeless animals. Someone would tell me about a cat that was living in a crack house and was being abused and I would show up and not leave until I had the cat. I would help rehab it and place it. People would drop cats off at my property and I would deal with them. At this time, I made decent money and could afford to help. Everything was under control. 

Today, things are very much out of control. At least, that is how I feel at the moment. A number of things happened all at once and everything is a mess. I had to help my mom out financially because my little sister started having severe mental health issues and we ended up with a ton of medical bills. My hours were cut at my job (same with the rest of the staff). I now make less than $3000 a year. I am in graduate school and have to finish an unpaid internship before I can graduate. I love it but it takes a lot of time. I made it through college with very little debt but now I am taking out student loans just to help with my cat/financial situation. I am the first person in my family to go to college. Graduate school is a huge freaking deal to them. I can't quit now when I am so close to being done. I recognize that some of this is just my own pride but I was the kid in town who came from the bad family and I wasn't supposed to amount to anything at all (but that is another story). 

Some of the oldest cats that couldn't be caught have had kittens. People keep dropping off cats without even talking to me. Fewer people are willing to take them in. I spend hundreds of dollars every month on food, vet bills, spaying/neutering, shots, flea meds, wormer, etc. I really can't afford it anymore but I do it. I've contacted cat houses, the humane society, and a few other organizations in Nebraska but I can't find any help outside of paying to have them put down or paying $70 a cat to put them in a shelter where they may or may not be put down. The Cat House is full. I do attend an annual spay and neuter clinic but even with the discount, it is expensive. Last month, my bill was about $400 for 5 cats (shots, wormer, 1 spayed, 4 neutered). Furthermore, people in my town have started doing horrible things to animals (not just mine). Animals are being shot, poisoned, tortured, drugged, drowned, and disappearing. I was in the process of building a cat fence before my financial situation fell apart but now I can't afford it. I'm really scared. I have a cat that needs surgery but I can't get it. It isn't a life or death situation but she needs her left eye removed and I just don't have the money. I feel bad. 

I regularly donate and help others IRL. When I work, I solicit donations from patrons to help with different causes. I have received some help from people in my community (e.g., bags of cat food, a vet bill paid) but I've run out of people to ask. This is a small town. Those who are willing to help with the cats already have and the rest are not willing. I'm not asking anyone to send me money or anything, I'm just looking for ideas on where to go or resources that I can look into. I did post on a different subreddit today where a person was offering help for people in need of pet food. I will be posting proof later. I'm not sure what all I should provide but I'm planning on posting pics of some of the cats, vet bills, a facebook post where I talked about animals being abused in town, a post offering kittens free to a good home, and a pic of one of my pay stubs. If you want anything else, let me know. 

TL;DR I tried to help cats when I was able to do so. I am no longer able to do as much and will be struggling for the next few months. Any help would be greatly appreciated and I will return the favor when I am done with my internship and able to get a better job. 

If you want the town that I live in or my phone number or anything, please pm me. I am uncomfortable posting those things. 

**EDIT: PROOF:**
I have uploaded some photos of a few of the cats (more to follow because we have a ton now), a few of the vet bills (same), one of my most recent pay stubs, and some old facebook posts about the things being done to pets.

**Edit** - changed imgur to an album because I missed one person's information on facebook and can't delete the pic. So I made it private and put everything else in a public album - added a fixed version of that picture as well as screenshots of a donation I received today from a redditor who has just blown me away. I cannot thank this person enough.

**Edit**

I wanted to give some numbers in terms of how many cats are currently here and how many are feral. 

We have 5 feral cats left over from the original colony. These cats have been wormed but not fixed. 4 are females and 1 is male.

We have 2 black cats that were dropped off and are mostly tame They act like they really want to be pets. One of the black ones was pregnant when she was dropped off. She has had 3 kittens (the gray, black, and black and white ones in the photos). I am unsure about their vet history. They are not fixed so that is on the agenda. Same with shots and wormer.

We have 1 male black and white cat that was beaten pretty badly. He is learning to trust people again. He has his shots but isn't fixed. This is on the agenda.

We have 1 really old yellow tomcat that was left at a house after his owner was placed in a nursing home. Her children don't want him so now he is here. His face is messed up from a dog attack. We've been putting antibiotics on it but need to take him to a vet. 

We have 1 tame cat with a genetic eye problem. She has been fixed and has all shots. No one wants a cat who is going blind. 

We have 1 tame long haired black cat that lived in a meth house. He is fixed and has all of his shots. I'm also trying to find him a home. 

We have 1 Siamese mix. He was found when he was two weeks old and bottle fed. He has a bunch of anxiety problems and has been poisoned in the past. He can't be placed because he is neurotically attached to me. He has his shots and has been fixed.

We have 1 long hair gray and white cat that was literally stuck to the highway during winter. He has been fixed and has his shots.

We have 1 short hair siamese looking cat with an eye that needs removed. She came from the cat with the bad eye that was mentioned above. She will also go blind. She has all of her shots and has been fixed. 

We have 2 male tiger striped cats that have seizure disorders. They are fixed and have shots. They also came from a meth house. 

We have 1 big gray cat and 1 big long haired orange cat. They were my first cats. They're mother was hit by a car when they were kittens. The others from the litter died and my professor gave them to me to bottle feed. He was going to put them down. The gray one has rolling back syndrome. 

We also currently have 2 long hair gray/white siamese-ish kittens (6 weeks old and tame), 1 tiger striped/calico male kitten (6 weeks old and tame), 1 yellow male kitten (tame and 8 weeks old), 1 black female kitten (tame and 8 weeks old), 1 black male kitten with a white tip on his tale (tame and 8 weeks old), 1 black male kitten with a calico face (tame and 8 weeks old), 3 tiger striped kittens and 1 yellow kitten that are special needs kittens. They were born in someone's basement and the mother disappeared. They were almost dead when they were brought over. They are being bottle fed at the moment. They will need a lot of attention. I think they are about 5 weeks old. I don't know if anyone will ever take them. All of these kittens need homes.

http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/hxi1k/serious_cat_situation_please_can_anyone_help/

Someone suggested that I come to this subreddit. I am following any and all leads.

This is going to be a bit of a long story. I know that I am partially at fault so please don't go out of your way to point that out; I promise that will make me cry. Also, please please please don't tell me to just kill them all. I won't and that will also make me cry. I'm a bit of a baby lately.

I moved into a house on a fairly big lot about 6 years ago. When I moved in, there was a fairly well established feral cat colony already established. I did not realize how big of a problem it was until after I was living here. I didn't know much about feral cat colonies at the time. I though we could ignore them and they would go away. Nope. They killed things and fought and got really really sickly. I felt bad so I started feeding them and trapping some of them to take the the vet. There, they were fixed, given their shots, and returned to my house. I tamed some of them and found them homes. I wormed the ones that I couldn't catch. I was told that even if I removed all of them or put them all down, once a property was used as a site for a feral colony, there would always be a colony there. This seems to be true. It doesn't matter how low the numbers get. More always show up. Early on, when the numbers were really low (three uncatchable feral cats), I started taking in rescues. At this point, people in my small town knew that I would do everything in my power to help sick, hurt, abused, neglected, or homeless animals. Someone would tell me about a cat that was living in a crack house and was being abused and I would show up and not leave until I had the cat. I would help rehab it and place it.

I have one more semester left, and then I am supposed to go to a 4 year university, and finish up anything needed to get a bachelors degree in business. My dad wants me to go to a state school, I don't really want to, but I do not see much of an option. I know I'll go through college, and get my bachelors, but I'm not confident about it. I have worked small jobs, and through my community college worked at Disneyworld. They really embellished it, and I did have fun, but it was not a real internship, as I learned little to do with my major.

So the most I have ever been paid in a job is 7.65 an hour. People are telling me I am going to be able to get a job, right out of college, and that I can earn a lot of money, but it's all of the people who want me to go to college, or teach the courses.

Right now, I feel like no one wants to hire a kid out of college at any respectable salary, when the last job they worked was for 7.65 an hour. I do not feel like my degree will be respected at all. I feel like college is just pointless for me.

I want to focus on international business. Travel from country to country, speak different languages, and be successful. I feel like Ill just end up being nothing like what I wanted. I dream of studying abroad, and I hope it can happen.

I would love to live on my own in an apartment, but I really do not see that happening. 

Has anyone ever felt like this before, or have any advice as to what I should do, and knows what they are talking about? Give me some confidence please."

(CS degree),YouAreTheBallLickers,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/hzq7e/how_much_will_choice_of_college_affect_me_after/,"I just completed my first year at UIC. UIC has a top notch CS and Engineering department, as well as lots of internship and career assistance. However, the commute is killing me and my schedule sucks. 

I'm considering transferring to Northeastern Illinois University. It's *almost* like a community college, but I can receive a bachelor's degree. It is right in my neighborhood, cheaper, and they cater for commuters and people with jobs. There is no doubt that Northeastern will be easier (some people call this school Northeasy) and hopefully I could finish my degree faster. 

So what do you think, Reddit? Will I regret transferring to an easier school? Or is it what I do in college that matters, not where I go?"
hzq4k,8,2011-06-14,Dating my intern... help!,AltyMcAlterson,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hzq4k/dating_my_intern_help/,"Hey all, really need some advice here.  Ages: 24F (me), 22M.  About a month ago we got a new intern at work.  He and I hit it off immediately; we spent a lot of time talking and chatting over IM, discovering we had mutual interests.  I have always had one ironclad rule for work, and that is:  Never date someone you work with.  I've seen it go wrong so many times.  Well, it's great to have a rule in theory; it can be a lot harder in practice.  I was very attracted to our new intern and I thought he had a great personality, plus we have so many mutual interests and he is great at making me smile.  It was pretty clear he was interested in me too; he spent a lot of time in my office just talking, he would shower me with compliments (""you're awesome"" ""you're so fun"" ""you have a great smile"" etc), he'd wait for me after group meetings so he could walk and talk with me, and so on.  Within about 2 weeks, 3 different co-workers laughingly mentioned my ""new admirer"".  Another co-worker told me this morning that she overheard some people talking about it.  I work at a very small, close-knit site so gossip is rampant about stuff like this.  I tried to avoid showing interest, both to keep down the gossip and also because I was so adamant about not dating a co-worker, but apparently I wasn't wholly successful.

So this past weekend he and I hung out with a group of co-workers.  He ended up walking me home and confessed his feelings, and I told him I felt the same way.

Here's the problem:  At my company (ok, this is probably true at every company) it is DEFINITELY frowned upon to date an intern, as a full-time worker.  It is even frowned upon to date someone you work closely with, when there is no difference in rank/standing.  It's not like we have official company policies that say you can't do it, and it's not like there will even be a note left in my file, but it may leave a bad impression on those I work with.  On the bright side, I have nothing to do with the work assignments he's been given.  On the down side, he therefore has no reason to be in my office as much as he is so it looks very suspicious.

To complicate things, there are two people in my office - both of whom have offices just down the hall from me - who started dating about a year ago.  They attempted to keep it quiet at first but eventually got called out.  They endured a substantial amount of gossip, teasing, and general grief for it, but never any ""official"" problems (that I'm aware of).  However, right now they are going through a messy break-up and the drama has started to spill into work hours.  It's a nervewracking reminder of what could happen to me, if I'm not careful.

So, I have a bunch of questions:

- Should I be dating my intern?  Yes, he's younger than me; yes, I'm out of college while he is still in college and will need to return for one more year. (this is my friends' biggest argument against it)  I don't think there is a huge difference in maturity levels.

- What should I expect from this relationship, knowing he has to go back to school (halfway across the country) in 3 months?  I don't know if I necessarily need advice on this, as much as I need to wrap my head around the idea that if things go really really well, I may be getting myself into an LDR.  It's pretty clear that he is very interested in me and he's made it perfectly clear he wants to truly date - not just mess around.

- Should we attempt to hide this relationship from co-workers?  It's not going to be easy if we do.  Already there's been enough gossip that people are sensitive when they see us together.

- Should I mention anything to HR?  I realize that if things explode in my face, I want to make sure I keep HR informed, but it's very tempting to try to hide the whole thing altogether.

Thanks in advance for any help!"
hzngv,5,2011-06-14,Information on getting internships at the Big4 as an junior undergraduate (a Q&amp;A session with Potatogun),spacekillers,Accounting,https://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/hzngv/information_on_getting_internships_at_the_big4_as/,"Below are some questions that I asked Potatogun and he was kind enough to reply back with detailed responses. If you are looking for internships at the Big4, I'm sure you'll find this information useful. 
All credits to Potatogun, he is an awesome guy!! 

Consider reading the [Big4 AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/Accounting/comments/glvzt/big_4_public_accounting_ama_qa_through_the_weekend/) for more information about the Big4. 


Question 1:

I will be a junior next year and will be taking intermediate accounting during the Fall semester (which is when I'm be applying). Is it common for juniors to get Big4 internships? B/c I heard from someone that you usually work for a mid-tier firm your junior yr, then a big4 in your senior year because Big4 wants to see accounting experience.

&gt;In the US if you aren't in a specific masters program (5 year), then during the 3rd year is normally when you apply for Big4 internships. The internship being the summer before your 4th year.
&gt;It is unnecessary to have prior accounting experience to land a Big4 internship. Rather you need the grades, and whatever varied life experiences and/or involvement. That could mean leadership, volunteering, part time work help pay the bills, or even sports/music hobbies that you're really involved in. It also is very dependent on your networking, because honestly internships are the hardest thing to land (compared to full time hiring). Big4 now probably source about 60-80% of their full time start classes via the internships. That means that these are the very best candidates in the eyes of the firm.

Question 2: 

Do you mind describing what interns do on a daily bases during the summer term? If I got an internship in assurance/audit, what would I be doing?

&gt;Interns usually have a couple weeks of training to introduce them to whatever audit/tax/advisory work they are going to be working in. Generally the idea is to expose you to as much client service work as possible. Time at the client site or client-facing roles will obviously differ from audit to tax to advisory.
&gt;You generally will help an engagement team by doing all sorts of misc tasks. This can range from help organizing data, copying, picking up food, 'rolling' forward documentation for the next review or audit or helping do some basic test work. This might not sound very exciting, and honestly the actual work part might not be, but you will feel the stress of wanting to do the best you can to make the best impression on your team. So it's your own little set of challenges. Talking to a client seems incredibly daunting of a task. It can be even as a first year starting out (okay, it definitely is at times). Even as an intern you will most likely feel out of your comfort zone. That's a good thing.

Question 3:

I know there are 2 interviews, the on-campus and the office. To get the on-campus interview, it's all based on how well the interviewers knows you and your resume. Do you remember how the interview goes? Is it like: I sit down, and the interviewer starts asking questions after question, then after he is finished, I walk out and calls on the next guy? Is the interview very structured or friendly conversation-like? Do you have any tips on how to do well on the interviews, specifically the behavior questions?

&gt;The interview process is generally what you mentioned. One on campus and 'one' in office. The in office may be multiple interviews but back to that in a bit. For on campus, it generally means you've gotten this interview because you meet the basic grade/experiences (remember not necessarily WORK experience) requirements and have probably networked a bit. If you are not the most stellar candidate then the networking plays a huge role in getting an interview. You want to interact with as many professionals you can where you can establish relationships. This doesn't just mean talking to EVERY single person. You want each person to remember a bit about you. Aside from the generic work questions, please don't start asking about accounting topics. Be a person. Talk about social life or activities out of work that might pique the interest of the professionals you're talking to. We take notes and compile them on candidates, but try to just keep it as conversation; professional with some slight touch of humor.
&gt;The on-campus interview interview is probably 30m with 1 or 2 people. Probably a Manager, sometimes a Partner or even recruiter if things are short staffed. Generally these questions are behavioral and more specific to your resume. Know what you have on your resume; be able to talk about whatever you've mentioned in any writing. I would say the structure depends on the person. However, it is generally more structured than an office interview with a partner. You will likely have a greeter who is an associate. They are there to break the ice. When you meet your interviewer, have a firm handshake and look them in the eye (or at their nose). Be confident but not arrogant. If at any point you are tripped up on a question just ask to think about it a moment. Do some research about your office location of interest. What's the industry there? What are some major clients? How big is the office? Know some about the firms' community service focus or programs such as sending people abroad. Show interest in how the firm develops its people and gives back to the community, etc.
&gt;The general advice I can give about behavioral questions is to think about all the scenarios you've been tired, worked hard, and accomplished something. Be very self reflective because there are probably a lot of things you don't think are impressive at all. They can be examples from school, to family, to work, to self projects. You always want to try to convey that you can be responsible, take charge, be a team player, be communicative, caring, innovative, and willing to push yourself and better yourself. Because remember the goal of the behavioral questions are to find if you fit the qualities of person who can work hard and long hours being an associate at a Big4 firm. If your time goes over the allotment or you go on a stretch one a single topic that you and your interviewer are passionate about, then you know things are going well.
&gt;When your interview ends, reiterate your interest in the internship and the firm after having spoken to the interviewer.


Question 4:

Is the office interview still all behavior questions? Is it round-robin style where you interview with the managers and HR people? I heard from people that the office interview is just to see if you have a good personality and are nice and not about your GPA/resume stats. So should my main goal be: smiling, be friendly, and just have a good time?


&gt;The office interviews are more like a day or two program/event. They generally have you stay the night before so you can go out to dinner with some fellow interviewees and some professionals. This helps ease you in and break the ice. You will likely have presentations and some group discussion/Q&amp;A with other students interviewing. Then you will probably interview with 2-3 people. At least a partner and probably a Sr. Manager or two. These are much more like conversations. But they are really behavioral in how you act and respond. You want to be calm, friendly, and likable. Get the person to talk about herself. Career, family, interests, travel experiences, etc. Try to find some common ground.
&gt;I highly doubt you'd interview with HR. Generally this isn't the process for college recruits. That might be more for experienced people trying to negotiate.
&gt;After all interviews send thank you emails.

I'm an advertising student, trying to focus on art direction / design.
I was used to use a Microsoft Wheel Mouse for 6, 7 years, but now it is dead and I am using my Mac's trackpad.
I am also starting to use a Wacom basic tablet to do more natural tracing, but I think a mouse is still better to paths and stuff.

That being said, what mouse do you recommend me to buy?
I use the old Apple Mouse at my internship, and I think it's nice. I'm thinking about getting the Apple Magic Mouse, because I love the gestures that I'm used to do in the trackpad, and also, not having to use one of my USB ports is a great benefit.

hzlsq,79,2011-06-14,Hey reddit...I just got the email of a lifetime and wanted to share the moment with you fine group of people.,holm0682,lgbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/hzlsq/hey_redditi_just_got_the_email_of_a_lifetime_and/,"Little back history on this, I was closeted until I was 20...and I really struggled in high school and early college because I was trying to hide who I was and live up to standards to be a doctor (pressure from parents) and going to a university they wanted me to go to.  After I hit my final straw, I came out and changed my major to Public Health Education, AND transferred to the school I wanted to go to.  I cut myself off financially from them and went out on my own.  I recently graduated from the University of Minnesota Duluth with my public health degree, WITH honors, the top graduating student award, and after receiving a full ride scholarship.  After applying to a million different internships and jobs, feeling defeated, and reading r/lgbt posts on people who have fought diversity and become successful (which kept me chugging along), I just got the final email today that I got a PHENOMENAL job at Boston Medical Center and will be moving there in September.  Coming out was the beginning to the best part of my life.  I am now successful and happy with who I am and where I am going.  Thanks Reddit for keepin' on the lgbt positive and giving me the motivation to keep on keepin' on :)

hzk17,2,2011-06-14,"Reddit, have you ever had to give up a pet?",nekoshii,Pets,https://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/hzk17/reddit_have_you_ever_had_to_give_up_a_pet/,"Hey Reddit,

So a little background:  I have a parrotlet named Cielo and I've had him since he was 5 weeks old.  He's 11 months old now, and recently started talking and can say, ""Kisses!"", ""Step up!"", and ""Hey, bird!"".

It goes without saying that we share a special bond;  I love my little guy!

The trouble is, however, I'm a recent college graduate.  I haven't been able to find any jobs or internships in the area and plan on moving wherever I find one.  It'd be difficult to take little Cielo with me because it's at least $100 to fly him with me one way, don't have a car, and plan on moving wherever I can find a job.  And there, the worry is whether I can find a place that would allow pets.

Having him during the year was a bit difficult, too, and I often gave up precious study time to come home and take him out of the cage to play.

I feel like at this life stage, I'm not exactly ready to have a pet.  I feel that I *should* give him to a family so that he could have a more stable life (not that I don't take great care of him!) and also 

But at the same time, I feel that I know him best and would love him best (cliche, I know).  He's also bonded to me, so I'm wondering how it would affect him.

In an ideal situation, I could find a fellow bird-lover who's experienced with parrots and is willing to take another bird under his wing.  So far, I've had no luck finding anyone :(

So what should I do, Reddit?  To be completely honest, I don't feel as though I have the time to devote to a pet and would love to find him a happy new home.  I think I'd just have trouble letting go and believing that others would take care of him as well as I did.

What's your opinion of the situation?  Have you ever had any similar experiences?


**TL;DR - Life circumstances are giving me doubts about my ability to keep my bird.  What should I do?  What are your opinions/experiences?**


Here are some photos of my little guy!  I just can't resist showing him off :)

We did not write our own vows and I'm not really the type to put my emotions in words or really speak them for that matter but this morning I started to think about our long journey. I thought getting it out in writing would help me remember it better and figured I would share it with you guys.

WALL OF TEXT

The first time I noticed you was in a class we had together our junior year . You were sitting there leaning on the desk not really paying attention and you seemed like you were deep in thought. I knew who you were because we had been in the same grade since middle school but I never really noticed you until that day. I could stop thinking about you and talked to my best friend how hot I thought you were and he took that as a challenge. He gave you my number in home room and you gave him your number for me. He told you to call me but you told him if I wanted to talk to you I would have to call you. I never ended up calling you but we did meet in the hall way before our respective sports practices. Over the next few days we talked to each other in the hall and that weekend I asked you on our first date. We saw a movie and got a drink at the fast food restaurant next door afterward. I was so nervous when I paid that I accidentally ripped the money in half before paying. You traded me the ripped money for a fresh bill. I was nervous and didn’t make a lot of eye contact but we sat and talked about whatever for a while and we parted ways. Over the next few weeks we started to hang out more, mostly watching movies and either of our parent’s houses. We had live less than ten minutes apart from each other most of our lives but never knew it. This made seeing each other much easier.  I eventually “officially“ asked you out and that began the real start to our relationship and ultimately our friendship. We spent the next year enjoying our senior year together and you were there for my victories and loses. We graduated that year. You were heading off to a local private college to study to be a nurse and I had gotten a job as an apprentice electrician with a local company. We tried to spend as much time together but college takes up a lot of time and some days I would just go to sleep early out of exhaustion but we made it work. I eventually decided I wanted to go to college and you supported me in my decision. I chose a local college that one of my high school buddies was attending so we would still be close to each other. I finally got an apartment with a few roommates and we were able to spend much more quality time together, well as alone as you could be with roommates. You cooked me meals and you helped me with the shopping and my laundry.  The next year we moved into a duplex and you live in the top apartment and I lived in the bottom. This way we appeased our parents but it gave us the chance to sort of live together. I was able to get an internship with a great company and started with them full time after I graduated. I vividly remember when they called me in to tell me they wanted to hire me full time. As soon as they told be the first thing that came to my mind was that I wanted to marry you. On the way home I stopped at Meijer’s and picked out the largest gaudiest fake ring I could find. That day in the car to your parents you kept pestering me about how it went at work and I couldn’t tell you because I wanted to surprise you.  While I was fixing your parents computer, you went into your room to get something.  I told you I had a surprise for you and told you to come over and close your eyes. My heart was going a mile a minute and in one breath without pauses I told you about the job and asked you to marry me. At first you thought I was kidding but then realized I wasn’t. We both had moved in with our parents to save money and you had one more year of school left. It was a tough year going from being able to spend so much time alone to have to be together with our parents but we made it though. We moved into an apartment together this past weekend and you are going to finally move in after we get married Saturday. Over the last six and a half years we have had good times and bad, we have lived, love, laughed, learned and grows together. I can’t imagine a life without you by my side and could not think of anyone I would rather grow old with. You were my first for, well everything and now you are just my everything and I can’t wait for this Saturday to start the next chapter in our lives together.

hyzpy,1,2011-06-13,"Reddit, what is your best/craziest ""wait, what just happened"" or ""how did that just work"" story???",[deleted],reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/hyzpy/reddit_what_is_your_bestcraziest_wait_what_just/,"A few years back, my cousin was making an increasingly rare visit to see me and other family. After both having lived in Austin, TX and attended the University of Texas (Hook 'Em!), my cousin went on to serve in the military, and I stuck around Austin.

Given the rarity with which we now see one another as well as our fondness for 6th street, the bars we used to frequent in our college days, and just alcohol in general, we decide to go out as soon as he gets to town. It was a Wednesday (I think).

Fast forward about 12 hours. As I gradually emerge from slumber, I am overcome with a desire to spew instantly but manage to keep myself from doing so. As I continue to regain consciousness and greater awareness of my being, I also begin to notice things like moderate back pain and a large cut on my hand. After I rub my eyes to remove gunky build up, a quick look around reveals that, in what must have been a drunken stupor, I had decided to crawl up on to my kitchen counter and pass out (for the life of me, I still don't know why . . . know one else was in my apartment, and I had two vacant beds). Exhausted and in pain, I decide to roll to my left and reposition myself on my side in an attempt alleviate some of the back pain that must have been/is being caused by sleeping on a granite countertop. As I do so, the oven clock comes into view. It's 10:30 am. wtfuck

To this point, I had been relatively calm. Sure, I am hungover as fuck, have a huge cut on my hand that I can't explain, and for some reason I am sleeping on my kitchen counter, but that's pretty routine for a weekend in the ATX (once again, Hook 'Em!) . . .but not for a Thursday morning on which I am supposed to report on the state of my section to the managing partners/my employer.

Crisis mode:engage.

Brain activity instantaneously goes through the roof. I sprint to my room and grab my phone. I dial one of our office interns. As collectedly as able, I ask him to let everyone know that I am running a bit behind for the meeting and that I would appreciate if he could make and distribute copies of the materials I had prepared , then I strip off my clothes and hop into the shower. For anyone wondering, it is in fact possible to soap, shampoo, brush your teeth, and rinse all of the above in under 30 seconds if you are okay with missing a few spots.

After I hastily semi-dry myself, I proceed to the closet to pick out some clothes. As I try to decide what to throw on, my mind is also racing trying to figure out what sort of explanation I am going to give as to my tardiness. Bingo. Got 'em coach.

When I arrive at the entrance of the office, I take a deep breath and put on a California afternoon smile. As I breach the main entrance, I walk deliberately slow, flashing the smile and (exceedingly) happily greeting everyone that I encounter en route to my office, doing my best to display a non-typical casualness and disconnect from work matters while sporting my finest power suit. Clearly I had just come from some non-work related activity - perhaps talking to a classroom or some junk. Truthfully, my brain with a hangover is bad about details. I didn't really know from where this character had just come, but I knew a suit would say that it was important and that perhaps I am justified in being late.

When I reach my office, I decide to let word of my arrival circulate the office on its own rather than calling to let anyone I am now available to proceed with the meeting. A few minutes later, the phone rings - caller ID tells me it is the big boss. Before I answer, I give myself a 5 second mental pep-talk and tell myself to stay the course.

I will interject with a little back story: Our core business was breaking even at the time. We had recently gotten into a new area of business conducting what I will simply refer to as ""projects"" that was highly profitable and growing. We had just secured a new multi-million dollar project (very big deal for our relatively small company), and I was essentially project management. I was supposed to be detailing procedures, timelines for deliverables, staffing needs, etc in the meeting that morning. Now back to the story.

I answer the phone and greet the BB as chipper as I had everyone else. I make no mention of the tardiness he was likely waiting for me to explain. Eventually, he asks me directly how I could have been late for the meeting. In a carefree and upbeat tone, I apologize and tell him that I had an important meeting that ran late that morning. He didn't say anything for what seems like an eternity.

At this point, I expect him to raise his tone a bit and tell me to get to the main conference room immediately. He doesn't. Instead, he very coldly tells me to be in his office in 30 minutes. Curve ball.

Instead of game planning, I sit in my office drinking water and trying not to throw up. 30 minutes simultaneously fly by and seem to last forever, and I make my way over.

When I get to the BB's office, I am surprised and disturbed to see a senior HR staff member there along with all the managing partners that work in Austin/that office. I freak out a bit on the inside, but it's too late to turn back now. I decide the smile stays.

I walk into the office and greet everyone warmly, then I have a seat. Someone gets up and closes the door behind me. I notice the person from HR has a notepad and no one else is holding anything. A little piece of me dies.

The BB asks me why I was so late to such an important meeting, to which I respond along the lines of ""Yes, I'm very sorry. I had an important meeting this morning that ran quite a bit longer than expected."" Next, he asks ""An important meeting . . .?"" Being hungover, my brain decides to suck and I can't think of a feasible meeting type, so I go with another response that is vague and doesn't really respond to the question he had implied. ""Yes, it was probably poor decision making to schedule it on the same day. I won't make such a mistake in the future."" I smile and hope we are done here.

The partners all look at each other as I sit in awkward silence. My BB responds with something like ""We are on the eve of starting this company's largest project to date, and you are out interviewing for other jobs!""

I'm caught totally off-guard and stopped dead in my tracks. Deer in the headlights.

I sit quietly for a moment. I start to see the bigger picture. As I previously explained, the projects were not a part of our core business, and as such, the partners were not experienced our knowledgeable as to the details of their operation. Given the size of the company, redundancy was rare, and I was essentially the only one that knew operations/process inside and out, and for that matter, the only one that knew the specific progress, plans, etc for existing projects. Given my tardiness, the suit, and my referring to an ""important meeting"" as causing my tardiness, they have all reasoned that I was at a job interview. And given the bigger upcoming project, growth in demand for the projects in general, and my mini-monopoly on some of the information, they all seem to be on tilt.

I decide to take it in stride and go with it, as I have no other better explanation. I try to downplay it and diffuse the while situation by responding ""I am not actively looking for other employment or anything like that - if I was I would tell you. I simply like to know what my options are and what my services elsewhere are worth. I've been on other interviews while working here, and no one has taken exception to it before. Back in my school days, I was taught to always know your options and to know what you are worth.""

My BB turns red (yes, he is one of those) and erupts. ""Do you think you can angle for raise right before we start this project"" yadda yadda yadda or something like that. Hungover me didn't understand how he had brought about such a response, but sober me gets it in retrospect.

This continues for some time. I try to play it cool and give collected, non threatening responses, but I think that just made the guy even more angry, like I wouldn't fess-up or like I was so calm because I knew I had him by the balls. Really, I was nervous as shit. I was thinking:

   1. Man, I need to hurl.
   2. It's hot in here with this jacket and tie.
   3. Fuck, I might get fired
   4. Hmmm, no one has noticed the huge cut on my hand or that it has started to bleed.

After he's done talking at me, he sends me away and tells me to get back to work. I'm worried by the fact that we are not having the meeting.

I sit in my office for the next couple of hours thinking over the whole situation. I am FUCKED. As I sit there thinking (Hmmm, my resume needs to be updated, and my friend mentioned that his company was hiring. Damn it, I'm going to punch my cousin.), the HR rep calls me and asks me to come to her office. Sigh, I didn't really like the job or the company that much anyways, not the end of the world. I take a moment, and when I am ready for it, I head over.

I sit down. She gets up and closes the door. If history is an indicator, that wasn't a good sign.

She begins to speak; ""GarrettGilberPass, BB and the other partners are not pleased that you are out interviewing for other jobs."" I think to myself, here it comes. ""We are prepared to offer you a raise to your annual salary in the amount of $XX,XXX if you sign a new employment agreement for 2 years, in which you are required to obtain approval before interviewing with other organizations"". Best wtf moment ever.

SOOO, I guess I got a raise?

**tl;dr:**

   1. Drank like a fish
   2. Woke up late and threw on a suit
   3. Showed up late for work when I had an important meeting
   4. said I was late because I had a different ""important meeting""
   5. got a raise

Also, granite countertops apparently look more comfortable than pillow-top mattresses when you are piss-drunk.

Since his grad school and summer internship both use PC's, he's looking to get a new PC.  He's got a $1500 budget, and while he would prefer a laptop (for the mobility) he'd also go with a desktop if it provided enough benefits.  The catch is that the desktop would have to include a monitor, keyboard, and Windows 7 in the price.

The primary use of the PC will be to run AutoCAD, 3DMax and other graphic programs, not games.  Though I'm sure he'll play some, it should not be a priority for the build.

The catch is, that he's in California, I'm on the East Coast, and he doesn't know how to build a PC (having had a mac for years....).  So ideally I'm looking for a laptop or desktop that's either completely assembled or mostly assembled and he can figure out on his own how to get it finalized.

I'm stuck and don't really know where to start, or where to focus my attention since I've mostly focused on gaming rigs.  Anyone have any ideas?  Thanks!"

I got braces when I was younger; unfortunately the retainer was fitted incorrectly and my teeth went completely back to their normal state with wisdom teeth and some other complications.

Because of this, I have had to get braces again. I just started two new jobs programming, and I've overheard new co-workers comment on how ridiculous I look already. I'm fighting with my girlfriend of 4 years and it's compounded by the braces, I am working 12 hours a day and have no time to do anything I enjoy...I feel a little bit lost right now, and it's all being compounded by these gargantuan hunks of metal on my face, that are keeping me from my beloved comfort eating.

Is it worth it? I am considering just having them removed, they hurt to much to deal with right now, and the orthodontist left the little metal bit that digs into your skin sticking out the side and I cannot go to get this fixed for five weeks...I think I will just get them removed and examine my situation from there.

As part of my college course we do an internship also, will having braces affect how I am seen by my interviewers? I have already noticed people being more condescending/assuming I am younger than I am."

As I breach the main entrance, I walk deliberately slow, flashing the smile and (exceedingly) happily greeting everyone that I encounter en route to my office, doing my best to display a non-typical casualness and disconnect from work matters while sporting my finest power suit. Clearly I had just come from some non-work related activity - perhaps talking to a classroom or some junk. Truthfully, my brain with a hangover is bad about details. I didn't really know from where this character had just come, but I knew a suit would say that it was important and that perhaps I am justified in being late.

When I reach my office, I decide to let word of my arrival circulate the office on its own rather than calling to let anyone I am now available to proceed with the meeting. A few minutes later, the phone rings - caller ID tells me it is the big boss. Before I answer, I give myself a 5 second mental pep-talk and tell myself to stay the course.

I will interject with a little back story: Our core business was breaking even at the time. We had recently gotten into a new area of business conducting what I will simply refer to as ""projects"" that was highly profitable and growing. We had just secured a new multi-million dollar project (very big deal for our relatively small company), and I was essentially project management. I was supposed to be detailing procedures, timelines for deliverables, staffing needs, etc in the meeting that morning. Now back to the story.

I answer the phone and greet the BB as chipper as I had everyone else. I make no mention of the tardiness he was likely waiting for me to explain. Eventually, he asks me directly how I could have been late for the meeting. In a carefree and upbeat tone, I apologize and tell him that I had an important meeting that ran late that morning. He didn't say anything for what seems like an eternity.

At this point, I expect him to raise his tone a bit and tell me to get to the main conference room immediately. He doesn't. Instead, he very coldly tells me to be in his office in 30 minutes. Curve ball.

Instead of game planning, I sit in my office drinking water and trying not to throw up. 30 minutes simultaneously fly by and seem to last forever, and I make my way over.

When I get to the BB's office, I am surprised and disturbed to see a senior HR staff member there along with all the managing partners that work in Austin/that office. I freak out a bit on the inside, but it's too late to turn back now. I decide the smile stays.

I walk into the office and greet everyone warmly, then I have a seat. Someone gets up and closes the door behind me. I notice the person from HR has a notepad and no one else is holding anything. A little piece of me dies.

The BB asks me why I was so late to such an important meeting, to which I respond along the lines of ""Yes, I'm very sorry. I had an important meeting this morning that ran quite a bit longer than expected."" Next, he asks ""An important meeting . . .?"" Being hungover, my brain decides to suck and I can't think of a feasible meeting type, so I go with another response that is vague and doesn't really respond to the question he had implied. ""Yes, it was probably poor decision making to schedule it on the same day. I won't make such a mistake in the future."" I smile and hope we are done here.

The partners all look at each other as I sit in awkward silence. My BB responds with something like ""We are on the eve of starting this company's largest project to date, and you are out interviewing for other jobs!""

I'm caught totally off-guard and stopped dead in my tracks. Deer in the headlights.

I sit quietly for a moment. I start to see the bigger picture. As I previously explained, the projects were not a part of our core business, and as such, the partners were not experienced our knowledgeable as to the details of their operation. Given the size of the company, redundancy was rare, and I was essentially the only one that knew operations/process inside and out, and for that matter, the only one that knew the specific progress, plans, etc for existing projects. Given my tardiness, the suit, and my referring to an ""important meeting"" as causing my tardiness, they have all reasoned that I was at a job interview. And given the bigger upcoming project, growth in demand for the projects in general, and my mini-monopoly on some of the information, they all seem to be on tilt.

I decide to take it in stride and go with it, as I have no other better explanation. I try to downplay it and diffuse the while situation by responding ""I am not actively looking for other employment or anything like that - if I was I would tell you. I simply like to know what my options are and what my services elsewhere are worth. I've been on other interviews while working here, and no one has taken exception to it before. Back in my school days, I was taught to always know your options and to know what you are worth.""

My BB turns red (yes, he is one of those) and erupts. ""Do you think you can angle for raise right before we start this project"" yadda yadda yadda or something like that. Hungover me didn't understand how he had brought about such a response, but sober me gets it in retrospect.

This continues for some time. I try to play it cool and give collected, non threatening responses, but I think that just made the guy even more angry, like I wouldn't fess-up or like I was so calm because I knew I had him by the balls. Really, I was nervous as shit. I was thinking:

   1. Man, I need to hurl.
   2. It's hot in here with this jacket and tie.
   3. Fuck, I might get fired
   4. Hmmm, no one has noticed the huge cut on my hand or that it has started to bleed.

After he's done talking at me, he sends me away and tells me to get back to work. I'm worried by the fact that we are not having the meeting.

I sit in my office for the next couple of hours thinking over the whole situation. I am FUCKED. As I sit there thinking (Hmmm, my resume needs to be updated, and my friend mentioned that his company was hiring. Damn it, I'm going to punch my cousin.), the HR rep calls me and asks me to come to her office. Sigh, I didn't really like the job or the company that much anyways, not the end of the world. I take a moment, and when I am ready for it, I head over.

I sit down. She gets up and closes the door. If history is an indicator, that wasn't a good sign.

She begins to speak; ""GarrettGilberPass, BB and the other partners are not pleased that you are out interviewing for other jobs."" I think to myself, here it comes. ""We are prepared to offer you a raise to your annual salary in the amount of $XX,XXX if you sign a new employment agreement for 2 years, in which you are required to obtain approval before interviewing with other organizations"". Best wtf moment ever.

SOOO, I guess I got a raise?

tl;dr:

   1. Drank like a fish
   2. Woke up late and threw on a suit
   3. Showed up late for work when I had an important meeting
   4. said I was late because I had a different ""important meeting""
   5. got a raise

hyyru,1,2011-06-13,"What is your craziest ""wait, what just happened"" or ""how did that just work"" story???",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/hyyru/what_is_your_craziest_wait_what_just_happened_or/,"A few years back, my cousin was making an increasingly rare visit to see me and other family. After both having lived in Austin, TX and attended the University of Texas (Hook 'Em!), my cousin went on to serve in the military, and I stuck around Austin.

Given the rarity with which we now see one another as well as our fondness for 6th street, the bars we used to frequent in our college days, and just alcohol in general, we decide to go out as soon as he gets to town. It was a Wednesday (I think).

Fast forward about 12 hours. As I gradually emerge from slumber, I am overcome with a desire to spew instantly but manage to keep myself from doing so. As I continue to regain consciousness and greater awareness of my being, I also begin to notice things like moderate back pain and a large cut on my hand. After I rub my eyes to remove gunky build up, a quick look around reveals that, in what must have been a drunken stupor, I had decided to crawl up on to my kitchen counter and pass out (for the life of me, I still don't know why . . . know one else was in my apartment, and I had two vacant beds). Exhausted and in pain, I decide to roll to my left and reposition myself on my side in an attempt alleviate some of the back pain that must have been/is being caused by sleeping on a granite countertop. As I do so, the oven clock comes into view. It's 10:30 am. wtfuck

To this point, I had been relatively calm. Sure, I am hungover as fuck, have a huge cut on my hand that I can't explain, and for some reason I am sleeping on my kitchen counter, but that's pretty routine for a weekend in the ATX (once again, Hook 'Em!) . . .but not for a Thursday morning on which I am supposed to report on the state of my section to the managing partners/my employer.

Crisis mode:engage.

Brain activity instantaneously goes through the roof. I sprint to my room and grab my phone. I dial one of our office interns. As collectedly as able, I ask him to let everyone know that I am running a bit behind for the meeting and that I would appreciate if he could make and distribute copies of the materials I had prepared , then I strip off my clothes and hop into the shower. For anyone wondering, it is in fact possible to soap, shampoo, brush your teeth, and rinse all of the above in under 30 seconds if you are okay with missing a few spots.

I'm a developer intern working on a C++ program which uses the JUCE libraries for GUI. I've just installed the ndk, and have cygwin updating (yuck... this is taking forever) so i have awk, make and all that.

But beyond the basic ""set up the ndk questions"" which I'm sure I'll have more questions about in the future as I'm sure to come into problems I have a more pressing questions.

Has anyone here used JUCE in Android? It's supposed to work with it. Right now all our GUI is defined using JUCE. The company seems interested in creating mobile applications of the product but it almost seems as if we'll have to start from the ground up because much of the program is GUI driven. That is, unless we can use JUCE gui on an Android. Which I don't know if that is possible. Or even if it is, I don't know if handling input will be possible, or if there will be a multitude of other problems

If you are interested in this problem and would like to help, I will be updating this thread periodically on my progress. Until it becomes stagnant, in which case I'll create a new thread.

I was a youth minister intern in my early college years, but I de-converted during my sophomore year of college.
My research interest are in three main areas: Faith Based Initiatives, tax policy towards religious institutions, and instruction on religion in public schools (as opposed to religious instruction). The latter is a policy idea proposed by Daniel Dennett. 

I am very careful to not allow my atheism to influence my academic research. However, there simply isn't that much funding for people studying religion in the public policy field. I find it important enough, however, to pursue it even though it is very difficult to find funding. 

So my request is this: does anybody know of good sources of funding that I might look into that are specifically focused on religious policy?

I'll be glad to send my resume or my stated research goals, just PM me.

EDIT: Thanks everybody, these are some really good ideas. I've got a lot of work ahead of me to follow through with all of them. Thanks for all your help, and if you ever run across somebody that is influential enough to help, please send them my way. "

Basically I hate my job (cannot quit it because it's an internship) because I work alone on a boring project from monday to friday. On top of that, I take night classes with some friends, who are only friends in the classroom, but outside of class time they don't know you. Things haven't beeng going good lately, 
		
I feel like all my friends just use me, especially this girl who is seems to be nice to me, probably not because she is interested in me though.I have good conversations with her and I feel like she could be the ""one"" but all of that seems like an illusion. 

No one ever texts me or messages me on live messenger for anything or even just to talk. And even when I do get invited to parties or a bar, I feel left out, like I don't belong, like I'm tired of it, tired of my friends.

I do try to keep myself busy just to ignore it, exercising when I'm free or play online games but the loneliness feeling just demotivates me. 
		
I feel like I'll be living my whole life like this, always been single, alone with friends who are only there when they need me. What do I do?"

I have a late 90's Raleigh R700 Competition with Shimano Ultegras that I started riding this past April. Before my summer job I was riding 5 days a week, about 25 miles each day with a long 60 miler on the weekend. Average speed I would say was 17mph.

I am currently working 60 hours a week (plus 20 hours of driving a week) as a Field Engineer Intern. This has severely crippled my time I have to ride. I have from 6:30-8pm M-F, 4:30-8pm Sat, all day Sun free.

There is a cycling event at my college very similar to IUs little 500. It is in April. Teams of 4 ride a single fixed gear bike around a 1/4 mile track for 40 miles, trading off when need be. Time trail speeds for 1/2 a mile are around 1:05 (~27 mph) and near the end of the race are about 1:20 (~23 mph). Normal strategy for most teams is to switch riders every 2 laps.

I would like to train for this event on my relatively little time schedule. I can go back to training 6 days a week in August. I really know nothing in terms of training for cycling. I do know that since these are fixed gear bikes that building a powerful high cadence is important. 

Most of my friends that have done the little 500 have told me to build up my hours on the bike in the fall (I would like to be up to at least 10 hours a week), then start working on intervals / cadence in the winter / spring (I have rollers it the weather is bad / under 35*F).

Any ideas on a good 6 day a week schedule?

Any ideas on a good 4 day a week schedule for my current time constraint? I am thinking: || Wed: medium intensity 1 hour || Fri: intervals / hills 1 hour || Sun: long ride 4 hours || Mon: recovery ride 1 hour

-During the night, they barely interact with each other. With one either watching TV and the other playing computer games. 

-Their communication usually consist of ""what needs to be done.""

-They complain to me about each other on numerous occasions. 

-They rarely ever smile. 

Now here's the ugly part. My father doesn't have a job, he's been out for almost 2 years now, he does some counseling work part-time (generally about a couple session a week). I've observed the majority of time he watches TV and play computer games. He hasn't been interested in taking much responsibilities and does not like to make decisions. He also has a tendency to cave to avoid conflicts in all costs. His outlook in life has become more cynical over the years. He is 53.

He used to be such a pleasant fellow and very encouraging. This isn't like what he used to be at all.

My mother on the other hand is very goal driven. She is your exact definition of type A personality. She feels like she needs to take charge in almost everything. She is stressed out a lot. Currently, she is the bread winner of the house. She is 52.

They've been married for 12 years and both have been divorced before. 

Now as you can see the dynamics are pretty awkward. My mother would push, push, push and my father would just retreat, retreat, retreat. It just isn't going anywhere and it is really painful to watch. My gut tells me that they are very frustrated with each other. If things continue the way it is, I predict that things are going to end up pretty ugly. 

As a son, I don't want to over step my bounds and neither of my parents takes criticisms very well. Reddit, can you help me or give me an idea on how to approach this? I love my parents very much and I really want to help them live a happier life. 

TL:DR - Parents in a loveless marriage, would like advice on how to help them as a son. "

As a professional programmer I find I've reached a point where my skills are just below the level I want to be, and I'm having difficulty finding the best way to move them up.

I've gotten a Computer Engineering degree, I've worked professionally as a web developer building LAMP(HP) web apps for several years (some during school), I've created db-driven web apps used by &gt; 1 million users, I did an internship at one of the major tech companies where I did a lot of Java work. I have the basic language skills (C/C++, Java, PHP, along with some HDLs), lots of db experience, along with architecture patterns like MVC and REST.

I've interviewed 3 rounds at Google, but at the end they said my knowledge wasn't quite there. Same as at some ambitious start-ups attempting to do Google-scale stuff. Basically I'm looking for advice to become a programmer on that level. I'm hoping to move on from basic MVC LAMP web apps to highly-scalable, distributed systems, high-performance back-end (C++ maybe), working with massive amounts of data, concurrency issues, scalability issues, ranking, search, artificial intelligence. All the things that separate novice-level from expert-level.

My current approach:

Utilizing Stanford iTunesU and other free resources every day (1 a day) to ensure I'm constantly learning

Reading

Debating going back for a Masters in Comp Sci, as many of the jobs I apply for say Masters or PhD preferred.

And working of course, but I seem to get the same kind of work I've always done, just marginally bigger every time.

... that's it really

So, to the experts, how did you make the jump from novice to expert? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

Get out of this industry as fast as you can!",[deleted],reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/i22ia/im_a_programmer_just_started_internship_in/,"When I ask people why they chose this career, most just shrug their shoulders. There's no passion in the work. The business is very top-down, so on top developing for a small consumer base, no one even really understands how what they work on fits into the big picture. There is no team dynamic in the groups I've seen, and they don't use models that are an effective use of employees' time.

Every speaker, every event, has stressed how important it is to network. Everyone is so concerned with moving up the hierarchy so they make decisions based on that. No one makes career decisions based on what they like do to.

I know I only have a limited view, but the whole point of internships is to check out the business. Tech companies have shorter hour, more impact, and more fun times, and making slightly less seems worth that. On top of enjoying your work, you have more free time to enjoy your life.

tl;dr Investment banks are not for people that want to actually enjoy their lives. If you're a programmer take advantage of those tech companies."

If so, how?",acct987654321,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/i3w0b/have_you_ever_intentionally_screwed_up_someones/,"Sometimes, we do things that inadvertently have a negative impact on someone's life. Hell, on the other hand, sometimes people do something that will greatly benefit someone.

We've had a lot of threads about those kinds of things happening. What I'm curious about is if any of you have deliberately done something to screw someone over.

Several years ago, I screwed over an ex. We'd recently broken up, mostly because I found out she was screwing her friend's husband.

I didn't key her car, harm her pets, or do anything else destructive to her property.

Instead, when I learned that she had spent a few days with one a friend messing around with various drugs, I decided to give the place where she did her internship a call and suggest they perform a ""random"" drug test on her, because she had recently taken part in extensive drug use.

She was doing an internship for her masters, working with troubled kids at one of those facilities that they send children to when they have drug, gang, and other such problems. They had a very strict drug policy for the staff, and I knew that she'd taken a drug test at the start of the internship. She and I weren't drug users; I'm still not. I don't have any issue with them, but the facility's policy allowed me to do this.

Well, they tested her. She ended up learning her internship, which had been a key step in acquiring her license/Master's degree. The way she lost her internship put her in a bad spot with her college, and she spent the next couple of years trying to get things sorted out, with no success.

The best part is, I also informed her part-time job (where she worked with children and was responsible for coordinating schedules) and she was suspended for drug use from there as well.

She ended up having to work shitty part-time jobs for three years, before finally getting herself halfway back on track.

TL;DR - Ex fucked her friend's husband, did drugs, I tipped people off and set her career back several years. "

I was hoping that it would brick with the new firmware update so that Microsoft would have to send me a new one, but I wasn't so lucky. There are some factors to consider here:

* I'm currently borrowing my friend's wireless internet adapter, which I will have to return in a couple of days. I will need one in the new house that I'm moving into and they cost ~ $50.

* I am currently unemployed for the summer and am on a college budget. I've interviewed for a paid internship position and should be hearing back this Monday. I do want to save a money because I am going abroad next semester.

* I'm not sure if a newer model will play or run any better. My console does run a bit slow and has some frame-rate issues from time to time, but I don't know if it's the console or the games themselves.

i4o2k,13,2011-06-20,"Thank you r/fitness. (long post, sorry.)",iwillnotgetaddicted,Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/i4o2k/thank_you_rfitness_long_post_sorry/,"Sorry, no before/after pictures; it's not a dramatic physical change anyway! That's not the point...

I started lifting about 3 months ago, on the SL 5x5 program. I was trying to look good for an event that was about a month away. r/Fitness wasn't especially supportive, but one member did point me to SL5x5. It sounded okay.

Here's the thing: I never go in the weight room. I've been in shape most of my life, from basketball, running, and hitting some of the equipment in the hallways at the rec center. But I've always been intimidated by ""guy"" guys-- frat guys, jocks, gym rats, etc. I don't know why-- I've always imagined them brimming with confidence, having meaningful social lives with deep connections to many friends (don't ask, I don't know why I had these notions), and above all, being hugely judgmental of everyone who wasn't in their group of friends. Meanwhile, I've always had a bit of a self-esteem issue.

Reading people's comments on r/fitness motivated me to get to the gym, but also showed me something else: for the first time, I got to see the other side of those gym rats. A lot of them are friggin' reddit nerds, for christ's sake. But also, a lot of them are nervous about being in the gym, and a lot of them think anyone who is judgmental is an idiot who doesn't belong there. 

Now when I go in, I still feel like there must be someone judging me, but when I think of that, I also know this: if that person made his views known, there would probably be 5 other people telling him to STFU. Mostly, I realize most everyone in there is just lifting, and they don't care what I'm doing.

For such a small thing, this has had a huge impact on my life in just a small amount of time. First, one small thing: I've become a better basketball player than ever before. It's not because I've gotten stronger, it's the mental shift. I'm not bad at bball, but my style of play has always been really timid. I never ask for the ball. If I get it, I can usually score inside, but I'm always afraid I'll screw up, and that's especially damning if I called for it in the first place, so instead I post up and think ""I'm open, don't pass it to me."" I never shoot outside, even though I have a good shot; if I miss, everyone will be mad at me for taking the shot.

Anyway, that small mental shift that r/fitness gave me has, in this short time, made a huge difference. I've been playing ball 2-3x a week for 3 years in the same gym, and never met anyone. In the past 2 weeks, I've become friends with a handful of regulars who now pick me up if I walk into the gym and they're getting a team together. That never happened before.

This also factors into other areas of my life. I have this problem where if I screw up in front of people, I feel like it's an incredibly overwhelming task to face them again. This has actually led to some huge problems in my studies-- I'm a veterinary student, and in clinics we have to work closely with classmates, interns, and residents. Last year, at one point I literally didn't show up one day to clinics because I didn't think I could face my classmates and their judging me. It's stupid, and I failed the rotation because of it.

Well, that too has changed. Not like, black/white, night/day change-- it's still a problem-- but the transformation that started on r/fitness and continues each time I hit the gym or the basketball court is allowing me to have a much greater amount of self-confidence in every area of my life. And if you weren't aware, self-confidence is hugely beneficial, well out of proportion to what I previously suspected.

Anyway, I feel silly crediting a forum about working out for such a drastic change in my life, but there it is-- I think a lot of my recent transformation has been thanks to you guys. So, thank you r/fitness for making my life better in a hundred big and small ways."

So what I make now, I'm stuck making until I can find something else. My art degree is completely useless here. I am interested in illustration, character design, that kind of stuff, I loathe graphic design. I had an internship at the museum here drawing dinosaurs and shit, I LOVED it. I applied to work for them when they had an opening, but they turned me down on the grounds that ""why would we hire you to do what you already did for free?"" Not to mention at other art jobs I've applied for, they have no idea what my degree is (""Associates in Specialized Technology with a Focus on Visual Design""). I'm scraping by paying for a student loan for a useless degree. What a wasted two years of my life going to a piece of shit school, I wish someone warned me before I went. 

I don't go out anymore, I don't have friends here anymore. I cut ties with my only two friends after they fucked me over. I work three days a week at said shitty gas station, getting ignored all day unless someone wants something, getting bitched at for this or that, pretty much getting treated like a robot. After a while, I start to believe I should be treated that way. 

I have a girlfriend, she lives across the country. I've realized over the last few months that I love her, but I'm not...""in love"" with her. We have so many things in common, we have a wonderful time when we're together, but I can't help how I feel. I do think about her a lot, it's not a one sided relationship by any means. She said to me today that she feels like she has a best friend moreso than a girlfriend, and I guess I have been treating her that way. When she was here, we went on dates, we made sexy times, all that couple-y stuff. I do feel a very strong attachment to her, but I'm not sure if I'd call them romantic feelings. Even that being said, I am not thinking of leaving her or breaking up with her anytime soon, she makes me happy, and she's completely in love with me. My feelings aside, she is the best relationship I've ever been in, and I don't want to throw it away. 

Recently, she decided she's moving out, and she wants me to move in with her, across the country. This is something I want VERY badly, and have my entire life. I feel like I could be happier out there. I've lived in the same area my entire life, and I hate it. There is nothing for me here. I'm pretty much stuck here, working at a job I hate and browsing the internet, until she says ""hey, okay, I got the place, you can move here now!"" I hate it, I hate how dependent I am on it. I would LOVE to just be able to do this myself, but I simply cannot afford to. I don't have the credit, or the money to be able to get my own apartment across the country, I am not in a position to just pick up and move unless I have a place to go. I have talked to my parents about this move, and my mom has agreed to help me when the time comes, it's the only way I'm able to afford it. My mom agrees that the change would be really good for me. (She has no idea that we're dating. I was kind of kicked out/left when she found out I was with my first girlfriend, so we just don't talk about it anymore. Being gay is the least of my problems, it's one of the few things I am comfortable with about myself.) The job market here is shit, I can't even tell you how many other shitty retail jobs I've applied to just to have some more cash flow, but to no avail. Even after I called back, went to interviews, the whole lead on for a month thinking I have another job. 

Where my gf lives has so much more opportunity for me. I can (hopefully!) get an art job there, as those are much more available in that area. I am completely content in settling for something shitty until I can get a ""real"" job there. I just want out of here, and I want us to be happy. 

But since I've realized my feelings about her, I don't know if I should go through with it. I do love her, very much, but that ""in love"" feeling that I've had before, just isn't there. Sometimes, I really, really do think it's the depression. When I was ""in love"" before, I was in a much happier place in my life. I keep telling myself I'll move out there and see how I feel, but with moving out comes so much money, that I don't have, and lease agreements, etc. What if my feelings don't change when/if I'm happier? Who says moving at all is going to change anything? If I can't find a job with my degree, it changes the place, but not the situation. I was very happy when she visited me a few months ago, I did feel a lot better when she was around, that's why I'm hoping things will change, and I remember those feelings when I get down about things. I think it's the distance that is making me feel the way I do, and my mundane day to day hating everything. My job has made me hate the general public so much that I don't want to leave the house on my days off.  But I'm so worried about being stuck 3,000 miles away from anything I know, hating everything even more. 

I really just want to give up. There is nothing for me here. As excited as I am about the move, I just don't know if I can do this to my girlfriend. What if I get there and realize I really don't love her, or we can't stand each other in a living situation? I know these are chances that need to be taken, but I simply don't have the money to be taking chances. For once, someone wants to help me do something, and I fuck it up, by feelings I can't help. I don't want it to come off as that I'm ""using"" her, because those are not my intentions. I do genuinely care for her. Like I said, we had a wonderful time together when she was here. We've been friends for many years before we started dating, so it's not like I didn't know her at all before this started. 

Everything is just a fucking mess right now. I feel like no matter what I do I just fuck up, what's the point in trying anymore. 


It felt really good to write all that down...I seriously have no one to talk to about any of this. Even if you don't reply, thank you, Reddit. 

Edit: If I don't reply it means I went to bed. I just wanted to get all of this out before another shitty day at work tomorrow..."
i44go,1,2011-06-20,Should I move in with a friend??,yumjello,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/i44go/should_i_move_in_with_a_friend/,"I roomed with a girl two years ago while living abroad for an internship. Since then, we've kept in touch and decided to try moving in together once we graduated college. After telling her that I would be up for rooming together, we've been talking about it almost non stop. She just got laid off from her job, which means the move in process can start sooner. 
However, when she came to visit for a few days I started having second thoughts. When we knew each other during the internship, she was very humble, slightly chubby, and open to new things. When visiting this week, she was overly confident, talked mostly about herself or her boyfriend, and acted very judgmental towards me and my family. She's lost 40 pounds since the internship, and now gives me dieting and exercise advice constantly (I'm not on a diet). She's the master of back handed compliments, congratulating me for getting a job while also saying that they're such a big company they can afford to hire anyone. 
This experience has made me seriously doubt and slightly dread moving in together. We haven't signed a lease because I won't know my work location until late August/early September. I'm becoming more and more anxious as the days pass! Should I move in with her because I made the commitment? Should I jeopardize our friendship by telling her I don't want to move in together? Or should I find a way to discourage her from moving in with me so I don't hurt her feelings? If you'd like further description of my situation, please ask. "

I'm 22 and she's 21. I decided to do an internship in a neighboring state for the summer at a camp. This camp is in the woods and I have no cell phone reception. I do have access to the internet, obviously, but this job is a lot of work and very long hours. I've been here about a month, so I'm starting to get the hang of it and have more free time.

My girlfriend was very supportive of me coming here. The first few weeks were really rough in terms of communication. She's been showing a lot of frustration about our lack of communication. It's starting to reach a boiling point with her, I can tell. She's sent me several lengthy facebook messages on the subject. I've assured her that I'm figuring it all out and we'll be able to talk more.

While I've been working today, I saw she was on facebook and started chatting. She is working too, tutoring at school over the summer, so it's been a pretty constant back and forth. I was talking like normal, making jokes and trying to just talk, like she wants. Suddenly she tells her it's making her more sad and continues to bring up how frustrated she is. I tell her I'm trying and that I'm happy to be talking to her and how much I miss her and she says she won't say anything because it will just sound rude. I tell her I have no idea what to do, so she says she's taking her lunch and just logs off.

Additional information:

* While we are just a state away, it's Phoenix to Northern California and it's a two day drive. Plus, I have no car with which to get anywhere. 

* She has told me in the past that words don't mean anything. I've said all I can say on the subject to her, and I know repeating it doesn't do anything for her.

* I wrote her a letter and mailed it today. I didn't tell her because I was hoping it would surprise her in a good way. Should I mention it?

* It's so easy to just lose track of time here, and I have so little time with the other interns that I can get wrapped up in wanting to spend time with them.

So, that's where I'm at. What do you think?"

I'm hoping to lose about 10 pounds in the process, but really I just want to feel active and healthy again.  I have always preferred running, but have had to deal with a weak ankle that was brought on by an injury from years ago.  I have worn an ankle brace while working out for a while now, even when I was on my high school track team, but for some reason it isn't providing much relief when I run anymore.  Now, I can run for about a half a mile before I have to stop because of my ankle.  I'll walk until it feels more comfortable, run again for a little less than a half mile, and then I have to stop again.

I don't think that it's anything I need to get checked out by a doctor, since it only happens when I run (not on a day-to-day basis, or even when I go for a walk or a hike).  I know that exercise like bicycling or swimming will not put strain on my ankle -- and I am prepared to do that instead if need be -- but I really do prefer running.  Any advice on running on a weak ankle?"

Career rut.,RudeAudio,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/i51ll/no_idea_what_the_fuck_to_do_help_career_rut/,"So, I'm not sure if it anyone feels like helping me out.. I don't know who to ask in real life.. So i hope you all can provide helpful insight.

I am 23. At 18 I began my degree at Wilfrid Laurier ( Waterloo,Ontario) for Global Studies..It was a great program and I am still passionate about that kind of stuff but I wasn't happy at all-- All my family live abroad, I'm the only one here and everyone I knew was in Toronto or GTA.. whatever the reasons may be.. I wasn't happy. So after 2 years I dropped out.

Part 2 of my scholastic life : After dropping out I returned back to the country where all my family live( caribbean) and had a good year. I researched a lot on post-secondary options and finally decided between Film and Media production at Humber or Public Relations at another college. I was set on Film and Media..and i applied.. got all the required documentation together, but needed 2 references from school. I got the first one no problem, and then was given the run around for months from one of my old favourite teachers..finally gave up and asked my old RA from Res in Uni ( cuz i was on House council and stuff) and he obliged. But then his res burnt down ( no lie) along with all his shit..needless to say.. my letter wasn't priority.

He didnt let me know til 3 weeks later. 
The day i found out, I realized the program had closed. Depressed, i looked into my second option. PR. I am a musician, and I am very into social justice/politics. and media in general, so i thought this was a great medium between all my interests.

It was a great but intense accelerated program( 3 years in 2). In my final year (2nd) first semester, after organizing a concert for my perspective internship (throwing a concert series, and working with WarChild ( my dream)) I got and email over christmas from my prospective placement boss saying ""Really sorry to hear that we wont be working together"". Frantic, I email my program coordinator, to which she replied "" Sorry, you failed magazine design, you no longer qualify for placement or second semester"".

After meeting with student liason I realized my options were to withdraw ( and pay back all my osap for the year somehow, and Rent with no money) or stay in school a  a semester and get a 2 year general arts diploma . I chose the latter option. I now have a 2 year general arts diploma.. I am unemployed..could not even get hired at Mcdonalds for the summer.. and now i am not sure what I should do in College/Uni as this diploma is useless.

I am worred about wasting more money, and I am worried about choosing something that I cant get a job.

My passions are music (EVERYTHING), Politics/Social Justice (close second) Film, 


I Know this whole message must be confusing...

so long story short. I am 40 grand in debt, have about 9 Uni credits, a year and half of PR credits, which i transferred and got a 2 year GENERAL ARTS DIPLOMA. 

Should also note, I would just say fuckitall and be a hippy and live with my sister in AUS and see what happens..but i have a Gf who i love very much, and she has a great job as a nurse, making good money so I wanna stay in Canada for now..


Thanks in adv. please provide insight"

This year, I have really gotten into web design on my own and am still working a bit on my [first site](http://www.fifaencyclopedia.com) to make it as best as possible. I know it's not all that impressive, but I tried to make it as much of a learning experience as possible, meaning I tried and am trying to implement things I would like to use in the future.

From this, I have gotten quite good at what I would classify ""intermediate"" HTML and CSS. I'm going to start learning some PHP and possibly MySQL (would it be needed?) My next point of action would be to begin working on some more self-owned sites and do as much freelancing as possible, but I'm not so sure I'm experienced enough to do freelancing yet.

In my town, there is a small local web design business that is a popular choice for a lot of local businesses. Looking at their Facebook page, the working environment seems awesome. Mostly younger, less serious guys who still work hard it seems. They have an employees page, and it says a few of the guys worked as interns before being hired full time, but most of them are in or have graduated from college already. 

Meanwhile, I'm only 16 and will be nearly 17 by the time I would be applying (after soccer season as it would be impossible to work during that time). I posted a question to their formspring page (what I'd be like at the time of applying, hopefully):

**Say a 17 year old with some experience in web design (namely HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL) had a decent resume of self-owned sites and some freelancing work, would you consider hiring them as an intern despite age?**

*OF COURSE WE WOULD! The younger the better! We would hire an 8 year old if they knew php WELL and they could CLOSE PROJECTS OUT! Really though, don't be shy! Apply!*

Should I apply for summer work now even if I'm not that experienced yet? What do you think of all this? I really just want a nice environment to get good experience in web design and possibly even be hired somewhere down the line."
i6fxk,2,2011-06-22,How to deal with a break up?,IxiusRoulee,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/i6fxk/how_to_deal_with_a_break_up/,"A little background:

M:21 F:21, I'm the male.

We've been dating for 2 years and 4 months. Over that period of time, we've had our ups and downs and have gotten through them. Recently (Past few months) we've been arguing a lot. Sometimes she says that she isn't attracted to me anymore and wants me to build muscle on my upper body. I'm not fat or overweight at all, I'm a little on the skinny side but I'm not lanky and I find myself to be quite attractive.

This past semester, my grades weren't up to my parent's standards and since I borrow a car from them, my privileges to use the car have been taken away. My girlfriend finds the lack of independence to be very unattractive and she says she doesn't want to be dating a kid and can't respect me. Also she is two months older than me and always makes it seem like I am younger than her by a large margin. She diminishes me in front of my friends and her friends as well. She thinks I'm an idiot and have no common sense or logic, which is completely false. She does get better grades than me (she is one of the best in her class) but I still get pretty good grades, I just have a very strict family (not of asian descent) We decided to take a break until I buy my own car to be able to visit her or get my car privileges back and get my life in order. We still talk a lot and still say 'I love you' back and forth but we've been on the break awhile now and I'm just on the verge of getting my car back. I am also saving money from my internship right now to buy a car and get an apartment for the next year. 

Today, we had a misunderstanding and a fight emerged because of it. She thought I was going to call her to wake up but I was going to call her after she woke up so that I would keep her from going back to sleep. She has insomnia so when she sleeps well it is a big deal, and she didn't have work today so she could sleep in. She said she was going to wake up around 9:30 am, so I texted her at that time to say good morning and see if she was up. She didn't respond so I figured she was able to sleep well so I let her sleep instead of calling and waking her up. Lunch time rolls around and I decided to give her a call. She picks up and gets mad at me for not calling her, I asked her if the alarm went off and she said yes, and she got my text but didn't wake up, respond or call back whatsoever. She says continues to say how dumb I am and have no logic etc. etc. Usually she gets this way just because she is mad so I throw back the counter-arguments ""It was a misunderstanding"" etc. She then says that her friends see my lack of common sense and logic too but I think she points it out to them and amplifies the situation every time something goes wrong. I try to be a wonderful boyfriend, be understanding. I am very patient and have put up with her short fuse and frustration for a long time, but this has gone too far. She's made it clear that she doesn't respect me, and finds me unattractive. 

I know break-ups are tough for almost all situations but I'm not a very assertive person. I still love this girl very much but it needs to end before it goes too far. I can't be in a relationship with a girl who treats me like this. Any words of advice about breaking it off would be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR my girlfriend doesn't respect me, and finds me unattractive after 2 and a half years relationship, but continues to string me along. Need help with the mental hurdles of breaking up with a girl who I am still very much in love with.

edit: This is way longer than I expected it to be, ask any questions about anything I may have left out and I will include them in replies and further edits."

The updated information is they admitted her to the hospital, and she has an actual room now, and may be there 4-7 days.

A little info I forgot to include in the other post: She usually lives about 30-45 min away from me, depending on traffic. She actually was just visiting this past weekend, as she has an internship 4 hours away, where her parents live.

I hope this doesn't sound selfish, but right now I seem to be having trouble figuring out what *I* am supposed to be doing. She wants me to come visit her, and I feel bad since she has no one else here. I know she was finally calling both her parents (they don't live together) tonight after I talked to her, but I'm not sure if they're coming or anything.

First of all, I'm not sure me being there is a good thing. At some point I'd think she will go from thinking I'm this great guy she's in love with, to thinking about how she's there because I called 911. She already said today she wished I had just come myself, and taken her to the E.R. so she would be there voluntarily. I told her maybe it's a good thing they are keeping her there. The Craigslist post was incredibly fucked up, and so was reading the notes.

Sorry for rambling, but I guess the advice is, what can I do for her, and what can I do for myself? I do not have any desire to get back together with her, but I'm pretty sure she still does. Another reason I'm not sure if her seeing me is good or not. I did promise her I would bring her some stuff from her apartment, so I am going to see her at least one more time, unless there's an unexpected twist."

**[I am a failed entrepreneur. A little guy who lost to the big corporate bullies of the free market. Ask Me Anything.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/c9iq1/i_am_a_failed_entrepreneur_a_little_guy_who_lost/)**  
  

Many years ago I created, developed, perfected and marketed Wiggly® Brand Mayonnaise -- the richest, creamiest, wiggliest mayonnaise in the south.   
  

I made the mayonnaise myself; the first experimental batch I made in the bathtub turned out chunky and too yellow.  After that (and following my wife's accident), I was forced to move my mayonnaise lab down to the basement.  It was trial and error for the first couple of months as I tried to find new and exciting ways to improve and invigorate mayonnaise.  But once I perfected it and got it just right it was beautiful.  So thick you could lay on it.  I knew I had created a mayonnaise that would go far beyond being a condiment for food.  The applications of Wiggly® Brand Mayonnaise would be endless...
  
I bottled it in mason jars and sold it out of my home.  Once word of mouth about my mouthwatering mayonnaise spread all around town, I started selling it at the farmer's market.  Soon I had the grocers and druggists begging me to let them sell my mayonnaise.  That meant I had to make much more mayonnaise.  
  
During the summer months I recruited some strapping young interns from the schoolhouse.  I couldn't pay those young lads much (a dollar a day plus all the mayonnaise they could carry home in their pockets) but I was able to give them the one thing they wanted most: Sense of Accomplishment.  For me, it was more than just male bonding and mayonnaise in my sweltering hot basement.  That was probably the best summer of their lives.  
  

Soon I worked out a distribution deal with Piggly Wiggly supermarkets to test out Wiggly® Brand Mayonnaise at half a dozen of their stores in Tennessee and Kentucky.  They were even going to let me slather advertisements all over their stores from the windows to the walls.  Unfortunately, the Big Boys of Mayonnaise -- Hellmann's, Blueplate, Duke's, Zippy's, Gold Medal and, of course, the behemoth of them all: Kraft and their vile Miracle Whip* -- ran me out of town.  
  

The big food companies pretty much dictate how much supermarket shelf space is made available for all products, not just their own.  Especially mayonnaise!  I got about six inches on the bottom shelf, barely enough space for a single jar-wide row, and close enough to the floor where the cleaning crew's floor scrubbers and waxers would dirty up my mayonnaise mason jars on a nightly basis.  
  
I never had a fighting chance.  I only sold a few cases and after just three months Piggly Wiggly sent me packing.  That was the beginning of the end.  The dark days of mayonnaise had come.   
  

I still make mayonnaise for my own consumption and for gifts (look out Secret Santa!) but I'm out of the mayonnaise selling business for good.  Too many bad mayonnaise memories.  
  
Those were the golden days of mayonnaise, long before mayonnaise culture was sullied by cheap gimmicks like light mayonnaise, vegenaise (who could love you?), and wide-mouth jars.  Back then it was about the mayonnaise.  
  
Ask me anything about my mayonnaise business or about mayonnaise in general.  I consider myself an expert on the subject.  I'll even share my mayonnaise inclusive recipes (like my triple fudge mayonnaise cake made with real mayonnaise!).  Mayonnaise has limitless uses beyond food.  Ask me about what mayonnaise can do for you.

________
**Make your own Wiggly Mayonnaise at home.**  
(Although it's not authentically Wiggly without Grandpa Wiggly!)  

  

**INGREDIENTS**  

* half a cup of peanut oil (or a favorite flavorful nut oil of your choosing)
* half a cup one cup of corn oil
* one tablespoon of sesame oil (optional)
* two egg yolks (one egg yolk for every half cup of oil)
* one tablespoon of honey Dijon mustard
* one tablespoon of fresh lemon juice or white wine vinegar (or half of both)
* one small squeeze of indigenous honey
* one garlic clove, crushed (optional)
* a pinch of salt
* a pinch of pepper
* a pinch of paprika (optional)
* a pinch of cayenne pepper (optional)
* a pinch of onion powder (optional)
* a pinch of tarragon (optional)  



  
**INSTRUCTIONS**  
  
* All of your ingredients should be at room temperature before you begin.  I prefer right at 21 degrees Celsius (70 degrees Fahrenheit).  
* Add the eggs and half of the lemon juice and vinegar together in a bowl and lightly mix together.
* Slowly add your half of your oil mixture while whisking (not folding) everything together.  It will start to thicken nicely, forming mayonnaise.  
* Add the remaining half of your lemon juice and vinegar.  Whisk.
* Add the remaining half of your oil.  Whisk.  The more you whisk, the thicker your mayonnaise will be.
* Add the honey Dijon mustard, honey and lard.  Incorporate them into the mixture.
* Add the salt, pepper and other spices.  Whisk.  Whisk.  Whisk.
* You now have Mayonnaise in its simplest form!  Resist the urge to eat it.  Your mayonnaise will have more of a creamy light yellow color than store bought mayonnaise.  That's how you know its homemade mayonnaise!
* Refrigerate your mayonnaise for at least two hours, allowing it to cool completely.  If you're planning on bottling your mayonnaise in mason jars still allow it to cool first. 
* Once your mayonnaise has cooled you can enjoy your mayonnaise.  But save Grandpa Wiggly some!
  

Some mayonnaise recipes call for sugar, not Wiggly Mayonnaise.  I prefer to add a little sweetness to my mayonnaise using a sweet honey Dijon mustard and a dash of honey.  Always use indigenous honey!  You should buy local honey and only eat honey that is indigenous to your area and climate.  No sugar means a healthier mayonnaise!  
  
Olive oil, especially EVOO (Extra Virgin Olive Oil) will make your mayonnaise tangy and too heavy.  Eventually the weight of the olive oil will cause it to separate from the egg and that's not mayonnaise. If you truly desire the taste of olive oil in your mayonnaise then substitute it for one-fourth (but no more than a half) of your corn oil.  
  
For extra EXTRA thick mayonnaise: Freeze your eggs over night and then allow them to thaw.  Make sure they cool to room temperature before you begin to make your mayonnaise.  
  
For a thinner mayonnaise: Add in heavy whipping cream, half and half, or milk.  The more you add, the thinner your mayonnaise will be.
  
If you want your mayonnaise to be extra rich use only egg yolks.  
  
Mayonnaise with just white wine vinegar and no lemon juice will have a longer shelf life.  Ideal if you're making mayonnaise for the season or for holiday/birthday gifts.

i7c9q,2,2011-06-23,"Reddit, what is your best/craziest ""wait, what just happened"" or ""how did that just work"" story??? ",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/i7c9q/reddit_what_is_your_bestcraziest_wait_what_just/,"A few years back, my cousin was making an increasingly rare visit to see me and other family. After both having lived in Austin, TX and attended the University of Texas (Hook 'Em!), my cousin went on to serve in the military, and I stuck around Austin.

Given the rarity with which we now see one another as well as our fondness for 6th street, the bars we used to frequent in our college days, and just alcohol in general, we decide to go out as soon as he gets to town. It was a Wednesday (I think).

Fast forward about 12 hours. As I gradually emerge from slumber, I am overcome with a desire to spew instantly but manage to keep myself from doing so. As I continue to regain consciousness and greater awareness of my being, I also begin to notice things like moderate back pain and a large cut on my hand. After I rub my eyes to remove gunky build up, a quick look around reveals that, in what must have been a drunken stupor, I had decided to crawl up on to my kitchen counter and pass out (for the life of me, I still don't know why . . . know one else was in my apartment, and I had two vacant beds). Exhausted and in pain, I decide to roll to my left and reposition myself on my side in an attempt alleviate some of the back pain that must have been/is being caused by sleeping on a granite countertop. As I do so, the oven clock comes into view. It's 10:30 am. wtfuck

To this point, I had been relatively calm. Sure, I am hungover as fuck, have a huge cut on my hand that I can't explain, and for some reason I am sleeping on my kitchen counter, but that's pretty routine for a weekend in the ATX (once again, Hook 'Em!) . . .but not for a Thursday morning on which I am supposed to report on the state of my section to the managing partners/my employer.

Crisis mode:engage.

Brain activity instantaneously goes through the roof. I sprint to my room and grab my phone. I dial one of our office interns. As collectedly as able, I ask him to let everyone know that I am running a bit behind for the meeting and that I would appreciate if he could make and distribute copies of the materials I had prepared , then I strip off my clothes and hop into the shower. For anyone wondering, it is in fact possible to soap, shampoo, brush your teeth, and rinse all of the above in under 30 seconds if you are okay with missing a few spots.

After I hastily semi-dry myself, I proceed to the closet to pick out some clothes. As I try to decide what to throw on, my mind is also racing trying to figure out what sort of explanation I am going to give as to my tardiness. 

When I arrive at the entrance of the office, I take a deep breath and put on a California afternoon smile. As I breach the main entrance, I walk deliberately slow, flashing the smile and (exceedingly) happily greeting everyone that I encounter en route to my office, doing my best to display a non-typical casualness and disconnect from work matters while sporting my finest power suit. Clearly I had just come from some non-work related activity - perhaps talking to a classroom or some junk. Truthfully, my brain with a hangover is bad about details. I didn't really know from where this character had just come, but I knew a suit would say that it was important and that perhaps I am justified in being late.

When I reach my office, I decide to let word of my arrival circulate the office on its own rather than calling to let anyone I am now available to proceed with the meeting. A few minutes later, the phone rings - caller ID tells me it is the big boss. Before I answer, I give myself a 5 second mental pep-talk and tell myself to stay the course.

I will interject with a little back story: Our core business was breaking even at the time. We had recently gotten into a new area of business conducting what I will simply refer to as ""projects"" that was highly profitable and growing. We had just secured a new multi-million dollar project (very big deal for our relatively small company), and I was essentially project management. I was supposed to be detailing procedures, timelines for deliverables, staffing needs, etc in the meeting that morning. Now back to the story.

I answer the phone and greet the BB (Big Boss) as chipper as I had everyone else. I make no mention of the tardiness he was likely waiting for me to explain. Eventually, he asks me directly how I could have been late for the meeting. In a carefree and upbeat tone, I apologize and tell him that I had an important meeting that ran late that morning. He didn't say anything for what seems like an eternity.

At this point, I expect him to raise his tone a bit and tell me to get to the main conference room immediately. He doesn't. Instead, he very coldly tells me to be in his office in 30 minutes. Curve ball.

Instead of game planning, I sit in my office drinking water and trying not to throw up. 30 minutes simultaneously fly by and seem to last forever, and I make my way over.

When I get to the BB's office, I am surprised and disturbed to see a senior HR staff member there along with all the managing partners that work in Austin/that office. I freak out a bit on the inside, but it's too late to turn back now. I decide the smile stays.

I walk into the office and greet everyone warmly, then I have a seat. Someone gets up and closes the door behind me. I notice the person from HR has a notepad and no one else is holding anything. A little piece of me dies.

The BB asks me why I was so late to such an important meeting, to which I respond along the lines of ""Yes, I'm very sorry. I had an important meeting this morning that ran quite a bit longer than expected."" Next, he asks ""An important meeting . . .?"" Being hungover, my brain decides to suck and I can't think of a feasible meeting type, so I go with another response that is vague and doesn't really respond to the question he had implied. ""Yes, it was probably poor decision making to schedule it on the same day. I won't make such a mistake in the future."" I smile and hope we are done here.

The partners all look at each other as I sit in awkward silence. My BB responds with something like ""We are on the eve of starting this company's largest project to date, and you are out interviewing for other jobs!""

I'm caught totally off-guard and stopped dead in my tracks. Deer in the headlights.

I sit quietly for a moment. I start to see the bigger picture. As I previously explained, the projects were not a part of our core business, and as such, the partners were not experienced our knowledgeable as to the details of their operation. Given the size of the company, redundancy was rare, and I was essentially the only one that knew operations/process inside and out, and for that matter, the only one that knew the specific progress, plans, etc for existing projects. Given my tardiness, the suit, and my referring to an ""important meeting"" as causing my tardiness, they have all reasoned that I was at a job interview. And given the bigger upcoming project, growth in demand for the projects in general, and my mini-monopoly on some of the information, they all seem to be on tilt.

I decide to take it in stride and go with it, as I have no other better explanation. I try to downplay it and diffuse the while situation by responding ""I am not actively looking for other employment or anything like that - if I was I would tell you. I simply like to know what my options are and what my services elsewhere are worth. I've been on other interviews while working here, and no one has taken exception to it before. Back in my school days, I was taught to always know your options and to know what you are worth.""

My BB turns red (yes, he is one of those) and erupts. ""Do you think you can angle for raise right before we start this project"" yadda yadda yadda. Hungover me didn't understand how he had brought about such a response, but sober me gets it in retrospect.

This continues for some time. I try to play it cool and give collected, non threatening responses, but I think that just made the guy even more angry, like I wouldn't fess-up or like I was so calm because I knew I had him by the balls. Really, I was nervous as shit. I was thinking:

   1. Man, I need to hurl.
   2. It's hot in here with this jacket and tie.
   3. Fuck, I might get fired
   4. Hmmm, no one has noticed the huge cut on my hand or that it has started to bleed.

After he's done talking at me, he sends me away and tells me to get back to work. I'm worried by the fact that we are not having the meeting.

I sit in my office for the next couple of hours thinking over the whole situation. I am FUCKED. As I sit there thinking:

1. Hmmm, my resume needs to be updated
2. My friend mentioned that his company was hiring
3. Damn it, I'm going to beat the snot out of my cousin

the HR rep calls me and asks me to come to her office. Sigh, I didn't really like the job or the company that much anyways, not the end of the world. I take a moment, and when I am ready for it, I head over.

I sit down. She gets up and closes the door. If history is an indicator, that wasn't a good sign.

She begins to speak; ""GarrettGilberPass, BB and the other partners are not pleased that you are out interviewing for other jobs."" I think to myself, here it comes. ""We are prepared to offer you a raise to your annual salary in the amount of $XX,XXX if you sign a new employment agreement for 2 years, in which you are required to obtain approval before interviewing with other organizations"". Best wtf moment ever.

SOOO, I guess I got a raise?

**tl;dr:**

   **1. Drank like a fish**

   **2. Woke up late and threw on a suit**

   **3. Showed up late for work when I had an important meeting**

   **4. said I was late because I had a different ""important meeting""**

   **5. got a raise**

**Also, granite countertops apparently look more comfortable than pillow-top mattresses when you are piss-drunk.**

i6tv2,4,2011-06-22,The July Effect: You are no more at risk going to the hospital in July than any other month. Except for this year.,DocIrish,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/i6tv2/the_july_effect_you_are_no_more_at_risk_going_to/,"The TIL community has [a sensationalist post](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/i6n8y/til_deaths_due_to_medical_mistakes_increase_by_10/) up regarding the JULY EFFECT *Bum da dum!* and how going to the hospital this upcoming month will kill you. 

Every year the popular press gives us this topic, and every few years the medical community will publish a paper refuting it or supporting parts of it. The article that the CNN piece refers to was published last year in May [(Full text here)](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;ved=0CCQQFjAC&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fi2.cdn.turner.com%2Fcnn%2F2010%2Fimages%2F07%2F08%2Ffulltext.pdf&amp;rct=j&amp;q=David%20P.%20Phillips%20jgim&amp;ei=paICTpPLN6bRiAKRq_ijBQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNGGoB-X3K2YWY4UiI4WLgWSSGo9wQ&amp;sig2=oYkSC4aUbmy64Oi10dw7IA&amp;cad=rja) and is worth taking with a grain of salt for a number of reasons:


* 
as in all papers, it emphasizes the positive findings and minimizes the negatives.  The pertinent negative in this study was that [overall deaths were exactly as predicted in July](http://i.imgur.com/KBjkw.png), and that medication errors in July were also 4% higher in non-teaching hospitals although this failed to reach significance. 

* while the lay press and redditors have claimed that this means you shouldn't get a surgery in July, despite no evidence of this sort in all but one paper, surgical morbidity and mortality is [actually](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19717044) [equivalent](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19474693) (and actually non-significantly lower in the JGIM article) for both trauma and elective surgery at teaching hospitals in July. The oft-cited piece in favor of a July Effect is this [Annals of Surgery paper](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1959349/?tool=pubmed) which states that there is a seasonal variation in surgical morbidity, with [\(peaks in July and January.\)](http://imgur.com/sxFUp)This was hugely controversial when it was presented in 2007, and many discussants were not included in the writeup. However, as pointed out in the discussion by Dr. Lillemoe of Johns Hopkins, Indiana, and now Mass General fame, there are multiple peak months on that plot, which happen to coincide with peak vacation times of attending physicians, rather than peak months for new residents.

* other researchers have examined this phenomenon and found that a potential explanation for observed outcome differences is that [handoffs](http://qjmed.oxfordjournals.org/content/103/11/895.extract) increase in July (August in the article), due to the aforementioned vacations and new interns, leading to cross-coverage issues (taking care of a patient you are not familiar with for a partner). 

Now assuming for a moment that increasing handoffs/changeovers increases mortality (far more substantiated than the new intern July effect): Starting July 1, new work hour restrictions for interns present a double-edged sword for these issues. 

Interns can no longer be on call. They can only be in the hospital 16 hours at a time, and must have senior housestaff available in the hospital at all times. This is great for the supervision aspect of things. 

However, because they can only work 16 hours at a time, we now need 2 interns to cover a 30 hour call shift, whereas before this could be achieved with one. This doubles the number of changeovers in most cases, and can actually quadruple them depending on the services covered and the hospital. It reduces the amount of time a given physician gets to know a patient's status, and increases the number of times some bit of information about that patient's status can be lost in transmission.

So, in conclusion, to be safe in the hospital, get to know your surgeon if you're going for a planned operation, ask questions about your care and be a proactive patient if you can, but otherwise, try to ease your mind that while you are in a teaching hospital you will be receiving excellent care that is double checked by multiple layers of physicians (intern, resident, attending) and nurses who are watching our butts.

I understand a lot of places don't work many hours on Friday, or if on Friday at all. With all of these benefits (including even better healthcare in some countries) and nearly the same salary if not more, why would anyone choose to work in the US versus Europe.

I probably don't know much about the subject, any enlightening would be appreciated. I am 22 (graduating college in December) and trying to decide if I should venture out to work in another country.

I met a nice girl at an internship of sorts, we are both college students. I was happy to find that she was a very pleasant person. It looked like she enjoyed talking to me, we really clicked.

She did mention she had a boyfriend, but I invited her to the cinema despite that since I really enjoyed her company, she was a very fun person.
The next day my internship ended and I was going to the seaside. I sent her a short text saying good luck with the rest of her internship and that I enjoyed the movie. To my surprise, she immediately replied with a text, saying she enjoyed herself too, but as she had a boyfriend, she would like to stay just friends (a bit strange, I didn’t remember making any moves). 
But of course, that was logical, and I thought nothing of it, I wasn't really desperate anyway.

Fast forward two months, I invite her for coffee. I realized afterwards that she was now single (FB is weird isn't it) and proceeded to invite her two more times to the cinema. She wasn't making any suggestions, and as i was swamped with studying I couldn't find the energy to man up and tell her I am growing to like her a lot.

Then suddenly in February she invites me to her birthday. This was completely unexpected. I went clubbing with her and her best friend. Again, nothing from me or her. I decided she wasn't interested in me. As I had nothing to lose though, I invited her a month later for coffee. I told her I've fallen in love with her. She replies by saying that I am more than a friend to her and that my chances with her aren't bad at all, but that she cannot guarantee anything (or something in this manner, you can imagine I was pretty nervous). I said it was OK with, me, I won't be offended if we just stay friends. 

After I got home she sent me a text repeating that my chances with her aren’t bad because she values me as a person - that maybe we should hang out a bit more often and ‘see what happens’.

We meet two days later. I act as usual, as I didn’t want to push it. We drank some drinks, walked through town and talked. The usual. We part before shortly before midnight. I send her two texts, one before I go to sleep, and the next one in the morning, mostly talking about when we should meet next. Yes, the second text contained pretty much the same content. I was curious because she didn’t reply to the first one.

Now for the kicker;
The next day, out of the blue, she sends me a text saying she is actually still feeling love for an ex, even though she knows he was a bad person. She says she feels I am more like a brother to her. I am supposed to be her ideal, and her mind says yes, but her heart belongs to the ex (I am aware of how strange this sounds) - the obligatory it’s not you, it’s me comment was included.. I was a bit disappointed with that, obviously, but said I understand.
I didn’t really contact her for the next two months, I was afraid my response would be too emotional.

This week, I see her at the university and we chat for a while. I can’t deny it was fun to talk to her again, she is an interesting person, but as I crossed an emotional line, I decided not to contact her after that. 

Today, she sends me a text saying it was really fun to talk to me on Monday. She would like us to do it more often (if that’s OK with me).

And now you see why I am confused. Did I do something wrong? Is she trying to get something from me? Was she ever actually attracted to me (there are easier ways to get free drinks than to talk to a guy for three hours, mind you)? I know you probably don’t have enough data, but it would be cool if some of you ladies could at least point me in the right direction, by my actions you can probably see that I'm not very good with this. 

Feel free to ask for more info on anything.

Thanks!"

Type into your terminal ""ls -la"". After the permissions column, what does that next column refer to?

i8wck,3,2011-06-25,"Database solution advice, please please!",billyfazz,Database,https://www.reddit.com/r/Database/comments/i8wck/database_solution_advice_please_please/,"I just started a new job this week, and they basically selected me to develop a database solution for their current project, even though I have no training or major experience in CS or database design. Here's the deal:

* Goal: Create a database of all case records (client list, about 2,000 records) by adding invoice data to each record.

* Current data: (1) MS Excel file of all clients, with basic contact and budget code data. (2) Physical file folders for each client, containing the invoices that need to be added to the electronic client records.

* My boss wants a database for all of the records that can be accessed, viewed, analyzed, and updated either (1) via the web (128 bit SSL encryption, password-protected); or, (2) via a shared network drive. I have no idea why we would need it accessible via the web, but he wants proposals for both options.

* I have a team of 5 summer interns who will have the job of updating all the records in the database. They are minimally skilled and minimally-trained, so the database will need to be extremely idiot-proof, so they cannot enter errant values in the record fields they update. There are about 75-100 individual fields that to be added to each record (or less, depending on how many invoices are associated with each record).

* I will have the job of using the updated record data to generate reports and to generate individual case data sheets for auditors.

The web-based database and web-form sites seem good in terms of ease of use and security, but none seem to allow a user to import existing data and then use web forms to update the imported records. 

The options I have come up with so far are: (1) create an MS Access database that the interns can access and update via the shared network drive; (2) Create a set of online web forms (e.g., Wufoo.com) for the interns to plug in the new data, then export it to an Excel sheet to use to update the existing spreadsheet; (3) Contract someone to build a custom web client that can be used by the interns to update the records.

I have a deadline of only a few days to figure out the best solution, and only a week or so to get it up and running. What do you think is the best way to go? Are there better solutions?"

Or perhaps book referrals?,wdm23,web_design,https://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/i8kly/tips_on_producing_more_modern_designs_or_perhaps/,"Hi guys, I had a meeting regarding a potential internship a few days ago which went very well. I'm positive I'll be hired, but one thing scared me: 

(Speaking about a past worker) ""He was designing like it was Windows '95!""

I am young and inexperienced for the most part, but they were impressed enough with the single site I've been updating for months since I got into web design/dev that they decided to hire me on as an intern as more of a learning experience.

While that site looks relatively nice and modern after a big redesign two months ago, I have a bit of trouble coding websites that don't look ""like Windows '95"". I've been practicing a bit so I can get used to the fundamentals of creating a modern site from scratch in one shot, but it's pretty tough.

What sort of advice can you give me that will aid me in this? Or could you recommend a book in particular? I want to design sites that impress them and clients - that opens up the door for being hired as a paid worker. I have no problem with working hard, but I just need to get the hang of producing modern looking, ""pretty"" sites.

Here's a list of _all_ postings. Some of these hirings are still available.  Please submit anything you know of.

Redditor Advantage: I think that some of these companies just throw resumes in a pile and pick at random. If you're an employee at the company, you could quite possibly help out redditors by 'referring' them as friends.  This isn't nepotism, companies do referrals all the time, and often give current employees bonuses for hired referrals.  I think many consider other redditors their friends, so this is A-OK.  Besides, don't other forums do this?

EDIT: Dave816am has [a good point](http://www.reddit.com/r/Atlanta/comments/i9vbf/this_week_in_jobs_for_june_26_2011/c222guz), don't refer people you don't know. Maybe talk to the person a little.

i9qz7,6,2011-06-26,I love him but the feeling of betrayal lingers,sounan,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/i9qz7/i_love_him_but_the_feeling_of_betrayal_lingers/,"I've never gotten into a relationship with anyone until last October. I met him at a Reddit meetup and he was really into me. I was extremely excited that after so long, someone actually likes me back so I began to date him. Everything was lovely and felt like a dream come true. He is funny, intelligent but not so clever at times. He would introduce me to books, movies, tv series and so on. My interest on him grew more and more.

After the next few months, I've started to feel like I'm having a crush on him. This sounds very strange. It's the same old feeling I had all these years when I failed at getting a response from guys I like and I was afraid to call him, to talk to him all day because I want to be the perfect girlfriend. That problem was fixed after my best friend urged me to express my feelings. He said it's fine, don't worry and I am amazing as I am. 

Between we started dating and now, different events happened that made me worse than I felt before.  It started with a phone call. He told me he hasn't talked to a good friend for a while so he's going to do that. The person called first and I noticed the particular ringtone for the friend. It's a friend, just let him talk, I mean, I'll do that if it's an old friend I haven't talked to a long time. After hours, he came back with a pissed off face. I didn't want to bother him or cause him trouble so I didn't say anything, but he finally told me that he was talking to his ex and she already has a new boyfriend. He can't believe that she moved on so soon. Inside I felt extremely hurt, even though I wouldn't understand how a person feels about their ex, but the feeling that he is doing the exact thing he's angry about and disregarding me is really hurtful. I didn't do anything about that time.

My curiosity got the best of me after that and was bored one day to go on his facebook profile to understand bits and pieces of his past. I understand it's a stalker-ish thing to do, so I did not tell him about this. I got the name of the ex that he was talking about earlier and I also got the reason why they broke up. She is still in college and lives a couple of states away from he is so it was a hassle to get to her. One day he drove to visit her but because of terrible weather he has gotten himself into an accident thus, ending the relationship because of the distance. 

After that I tried to put it behind my head and continue my days. My love for him grew bigger and bigger and I wouldn't even have such feelings on other men. He has his flaws but he is well-rounded and is a kind of person that I would love to be with for a very very long time. I have classes during weekdays and everyday, I'm always looking forward to Friday the most because that's the day I visit him and stay with him for the weekend. I love the lazy days we spend lying on the couch relaxing and I also love the days when we go out and do fun activities or walk around the park. 

There were a couple of times we went to meetups at the bar and I get drunk. I would tell him how much I love him and I would sometimes accidentally tell him that in my mother tongue. He would always tell me, he ""likes"" me, he likes me a lot. It kind of bothered me at times. He would explain that he says ""love"" only when he means it and the only woman he ever loved was someone he dated for 3 years. When he explains it like that it saddened me and I would rather he not say anything at all. Sometimes if I were very drunk, I would cry when he says that and he would quiet me down by saying he loves me too. 

These were the build-ups for me, but what triggered me were two events. They might sounds minor and silly to consider as a big deal, but it's always on my mind. The first when we were shopping for furniture and he was calling me from afar but he called me by his ex's name. At that time, he didn't know that I know who his ex was yet. The second time was when I was on the meetup group page and I was just skimming through to see which ones I should go. I noticed in the newsfeed that there was a familiar name. It was her. In her introduction, she says that she will visit where we are during the summer for her internship. This alerted me so much I became worried and cried often. My best friend urged me again to confront my boyfriend if I wanted to solve this problem. After being timid and nervous for days, I finally did when we went to a bar again. 

I chose that day because I noticed if I get tipsy enough, I would be able to speak my mind and not be afraid. We went to get pizza as an intermission during the meetup and I finally told him. I told him all my worries and the two things that triggered me. The downside to my courage juice is that it also makes me cry easier. I felt scared again when I started tearing up while telling him because my dad told me that women shouldn't cry and crying would show her weaknesses and how vulnerable she is. He was very surprised how I know his ex's name. He then started telling me he can't help it and how much he still loves her. He says that if he needed to choose between her and me, he would choose both, how they promised they will be together 3 years later when she graduates if they're both single. I can't remember what happened next because I was crying too hard. 

It was fine for another few months until summer, I am now on my summer vacation and I got an internship. My best friend/roommate is leaving the country until August so I'll be all alone. I thought staying with my boyfriend would be nice because it would be more convenient for me to go to my internship office and no more loneliness. Fast forward to recent weeks, he went out twice for dinner with a ""friend"" the second time, the night before his ex called him thus I suspect it was probably dinner with her. I didn't say anything until one weekend when he was writing his retirement plans documents and under the benefactor or something (sorry, I don't really understand it) he fills in his ex's name and stuff. I became depressed all over again. He talked on the phone with her for a very long time until I went into the room with finished laundries. He noticed I was crying and I told him why. He kept on apologizing, how much he doesn't deserve me, how terrible he was and how pathetic he is that he can't cut off ties with his ex. I didn't say much. He says he was overwhelmed when I moved in for summer and so on. I understand my problem. I asked him if his ex, who has a boyfriend, feels the same way about him, he says he doesn't know.

The next few days was awkward. We went to another bar meetup and I got a bit tipsy again. I told him I was hungry and didn't eat all day, so we both left to get food. Along the way, he brought up our problem again. He starts to admit, he said, he can't see me being with him in the future married with kids. I started bawling on the streets. I asked him if he could see that with his ex. He says he can. I was very angry because seeing such things in the future just means he's dwelling in the past. He's unfairly comparing me, that he dated for 6 months to a person whom he dated for 3 years. It really hurts me a lot.  I cried so hard I couldn't stand straight. I told him I've lost all appetite and might vomit so we went back to his place. He complains that he wants to be married, have kids, and so on, but the problem is I've never discussed with him about my view on these! How would he know I'm not a children person?! How would he know I don't want to get married some day?! I calmed down a bit and he comforts me by telling me how amazing I am, what a good life I have and all the nonsense I hate hearing that doesn't solve our problem. He then told me another of our problem is that we have nothing in common. For 6 months, nothing in common? What an excuse, such bullshit.

In the end, after all the advice I got from my dad and my best friend, I still wanted to be with him. I asked him if he would give me a shot to let me change his mind and his ""future"" that he sees. He didn't refuse it but he became even more distant and cold to me each day. I am too stubborn and blinded by love that I am not going to break up with him. Sorry this was so long, but I thought writing in my blog where no one reads wouldn't help me and redditors would give me some good advice, or just inspiring comments to boost my confidence. (Sorry in advance if wording or grammar is strange, English is my second language)

**TL;DR**: Boyfriend still can't get his ex out of his head. Can't see me with him in the future married to him with kids. He is an ass and I'm an idiot that is too stubborn and love him too much to break up with him. "
i9pm6,10,2011-06-26,Where do I go from here?,linksyswrt54g,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/i9pm6/where_do_i_go_from_here/,"I'm 24, she's 22.  We've been dating for almost three years now.  We started dating when we were both in college, I'd been having a dry spell and I met her through some friends.  We hit it off.  She is beautiful, charming, intelligent, and funny.  

We continued to date after I graduated and moved about an hour away to get a job.  She did a semester abroad and we ""broke things off"" despite Skyping almost every day, and I went to visit her.  This seemed to rekindle things, as I was in love with this girl.  She came back from Europe and we continued to date, with lots of travel and a few rough patches.

She graduated the following spring, and moved about 4 hours away from me for an internship, having no luck finding a job.  The stress of her commute and financial situation took its toll on us, and I couldn't take it any more.  Every phone conversation started with, ""Oh my God.. this day is terrible.. you wouldn't believe what happened to me..""  I tried to be compassionate and helpful, but I really ran out of steam.  I told her that I couldn't handle my stress and her stress anymore, and that I didn't want to be together anymore. We didn't speak to eachother for a few months.

She got a better paying internship and was able to move closer to it, eliminating her commute.  We got to talking over the holidays and I apologized and we wound up going on a trip together.  Everything was great, and it was like nothing had happened.  She was in the process of getting a new apartment and internship and seemed like everything was pointing in the right direction.  Conversations were cheerful and bright, and the future looked good again.

She finally got an interview for a full time job, but this time on the other side of the country.  She's now a 5 hour flight from me.  She's disenchanted with the job, her apartment, her lack of friends, and her lack of anything to ""do"" in the evenings (she's never really been one to have any hobbies).  Our phone calls have returned to her rattling off a list of things that are going terrible in her life (no friends, overweight, hate my job, etc).

I'm across the country, and this is bogging me down.  Am I a jerk?  I try to help her out by being constructive and trying to help her find things to do.  She enjoys swimming, so I suggested that (no way!  too much money for suit/goggles/gym membership), okay what about a bike club (do you know how expensive bikes are?!).

I really don't know how to handle this anymore.  I'm flying out to visit her in a week, but she tells me she ""isn't excited to see me"" because she's so down in the dumps.

I know there are a lot of ins and outs with this story, and I'll gladly fill in details where necessary.  I feel like I used to love this girl, but between distance and her inability to cope with things on her own I'm growing increasingly stressed.

TL;DR:  I've dated a girl for a long time and she's now living really far away from me.  She's unhappy about her new job/lack of friends/general low self esteem.  What do I do?  It's dragging down my life and with the situation as it is, I don't intend to move to her, or vice versa."
i9d0v,3,2011-06-26,I'm planning on quitting my job tomorrow.,chunkymonkeychow,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/i9d0v/im_planning_on_quitting_my_job_tomorrow/,"So here's the story.  I've worked at Best Buy for the past two years as a seasonal/ocassional.  In other words I come in and work over the summers and during my breaks when I'm home, I'm a college student and I go to school over an hour away.  It's been nice for extra spending money and what not.  So this summer I have a great internship where I'm working 40 hours a week, making double what I make at BB, and have way better working conditions.  I've also been working weekends at BB 8 hours on both Saturday and Sunday, it's quite a bit of work but I really like having money so it is worth it to me.  But after today I think I'm fed up.  I sell computers, which I absolutely love, I enjoy finding great deals for people on stuff they actually need.  I'll spend hours with a customer if they are friendly and willing to learn.  Today I didn't sell a single computer which I don't really care I'm not on commission and I sold other things but I missed out on getting 5 different customers the computers that they wanted because of the incompetence of the system at BB.  On top of working with an incompetent system I'm always over worked my shift is always understaffed.  I can count the number of 15 minute breaks I've had while at best buy using 2 fingers.  The reason my shift is always understaffed is because I sell more and help more customers than anyone else.  In other words they count me as two workers.  I also have proof for this because they recently started tracking sales and out of a 12 person department I make up 17% of the revenue.  I've never received a raise, even after asking 2 separate ocassions, because I'm ""seasonal/ocassional and don't qualify for the same raises everyone else does"". 

So I've never quit a job before what should I say?  I have to be in to work in 7 hours and I have my complete and total pick of managers to go talk to.

ialds,1,2011-06-27,Employers (and perhaps the employed) of reddit--is it possible to fabricate non-technical work experience on a resume?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ialds/employers_and_perhaps_the_employed_of_redditis_it/,"So basically, as a recent college grad who can't find a job despite going to a good school and getting a relatively marketable degree (finance) with a decent GPA, I'm left with the conclusion that I'm being boxed out because I lack internship experience (not for lack of trying--I simply could never get hired). Anyways, I've heard employers rarely check up to make sure work experience is 'legit' (particularly when apps don't require references), and even so, it may be possible to reference a small company that has gone under, or has a website I put up, or I give my friend's phone number, etc etc.

If I commit a solid effort toward being able to 'describe my experience', would I be able to get away with something like this? Obviously no technical experience could be faked, but I'm pretty sure a lot of internships (non-engineering/CS anyways) don't teach you anything you can't learn in a week on the job + google. I realize of course this would overall be called a bad idea, but I'm getting tired of rejection despite feeling qualified for the entry level jobs to which I'm applying.

Any thoughts/comments/suggestions appreciated"

I'm not sure whether I'll want to accept it- it will depend on the specifics.

I'm a software engineer at one large software company and I would apply for jobs at other large software companies. I assume a smaller company would work on a much shorter hiring schedule, but maybe large companies wouldn't mind hiring 8-9 months in advance?"

Help?",ilovemuffins49,Advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/iai21/im_at_an_internship_in_dc_that_was_supposed_to_be/,"So I know this is an age-old story (legal intern comes in expecting to go to trial and ends up filing papers type thing) but my situation is somewhat different.  I interned at a law firm last summer, a paid internship by the way, and learned about all the nitty gritty details of how a firm works.  I spent 8 hours a day 6 days a week filing, entering info into the computer, running the mail room, helping attorneys with random tasks, etc. for an entire summer.  This summer, I signed up for a program my university puts on in which a coordinator set me up at an unpaid internship in Washington, D.C.  The program is pretty expensive, and I signed up believing I'd have this invaluable experience and come out with some solid rec letters and knowledge about what lawyers actually do.  As it turns out, the firm has never had an intern and truly has no idea what to do with me.  I'm leaning absolutely nothing and doing absolutely nothing.  They occassionally give me tasks but from what I can tell those tasks are unnecessary and of no help whatsoever to the employees (e.g. writing down all the files in an office even though the firm already has a list detailing which files are in which office).  It's more like they feel bad and just want to give me something to do so I don't just sit in a corner all day.  I talked to my supervisor who said she'd try to find me some projects to get started on, but it's been three weeks and I've still done/learned nothing.  At this point, I'd even be happy just to file papers.  I'm trying very hard to stay positive, but I've now spent a month sitting at a desk counting the seconds until six o'clock hits.  I ask if anyone in the office needs help with anything pretty often (I try to restrain myself from asking too much because I don't want to be that annoying intern), but everyone keeps telling me they don't have anything for me to do.  I'm at a loss here reddit, and I need your help.

So does anyone have any suggestions on how to make this miserable experience into a positive one?  Nothing I've tried has worked, so I really am open to anything..."

For example, in engineering companies the gender ratio is very distorted with men making up the majority of the workforce. I imagine this is because more men *want* to be engineers and hence go to university to study engineering. This means that there are more men to choose from and therefore, the quality of the top tier graduates will be significantly higher than the quality of the top tier female graduates. This is not to say that women are not good at engineering or not as skilled so please don't take offence.

As companies will logically employ the best people, the majority of the engineering company should be male, and rightly so. But in order to appear non-sexist (which it already is not), it discriminates against men in order to attempt to equalize the gender ratio. Presented with an equally skilled male and female graduate, I think that engineering companies would prefer to hire the female graduate. I have no actual proof of this except anecdotal evidence during my internship at ARUP, where I found seven women in an office of thirty people, two of which were receptionists. Is this fair? Has society gone to too great a length to ensure there is no discrimination within the workforce that we have to discriminate against those who had not been discriminated against before?

**Tl;dr** I think that we just hire people to make the company look better and not actually function better."

So tada :D  
  
Hello:  
  
My name is Christopher Woodall. You killed my father. Just kidding :D, unless you did. Then prepare to die. I saw that you had a few job openings, but I am unsure where I would fit in. Because of this I have [attached my resume](http://www.christopherwoodall.com/resume/) and will give you a brief run-down about my self.  
  
First I take it you would like to know some of my past work experience. Well, I got into the wrong major in college, Criminal Justice; thought I'd end up as a Game Warden or... well really don't know what I was thinking. I started out as an electronics sales person at AAFES, a retail outlet on military bases. This wasn't taking me exactly where I wanted so I moved to Italy and worked as a house keeper in a hotel. This was nice but the cost of living was just too much thusly moved back to the US. Keep in mind, all the while attending and trying to pay for college. I ended up in Tennessee working as a horticulturist in a small family-owned-and-operated green house until school started back that fall. My last job was as an intern at the local District Attorney's Office working on murder and theft cases; interviewing witnesses, police officers, ect.  
  
There was still something eating at me. My love for computers and technology; one day I hope to be assimilated into the borg. Because of this I decided to teach my self to program. I started with [Python](http://www.christopherwoodall.com/gmail.py), moved to [PHP](http://yourfaceonatshirt.com), then [Javascript](http://www.christopherwoodall.com/map ""Only works in firefox, needs refactoring.""). Still don't know as much as I'd like but I am getting close. I was always interested in computer security so I worked my ass off to get into Google Corporate Hall of Fame for application security; check it out, I'm in there!
  
What I am really asking for is a steady paycheck and a place to grow. Shoot, I'd be happy working as a janitor solving problems on a chalk board if someone would hire me. I am a self starter and motivated to do something with this short time I have. 23 now, take it I'll live to about 60, so I am already a third of the way through life! If you give me a chance it will not be wasted.  
  
Respectfully submitted,

Reddit, I'm desperate to clean [the bathroom](http://imgur.com/a/i2wgV). I'm living in this house for the summer, and it's goddam gross. The house was built in 1973, and I don't think anything's been re-done since. 

The current owner lives there year-round and 3 of us interns are living with him this summer. Granted, we're leaving in about a month or so, but I can't stand going to that bathroom any longer.

One of the roommates and I already tried cleaning the floor with some solution and a mop, but that barely worked. There's like piss stains along the edge of the floor with hair and it's GODDAM IMPOSSIBLE to remove.

I heard vinegar and baking powder were a good solution combo?!?!? I don't even know what type of flooring it is, maybe laminated flooring? 

I don't even know where the black stripes are from...

Please help. There's sticky spots, piss stains, possibly 30+ year old hair on the floor...

icf7p,1,2011-06-29,To what extent is something considered an invasion of privacy?,kimchizal,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/icf7p/to_what_extent_is_something_considered_an/,"I just wanted to see what other people have to say about my situation. It's kind of bugging me a lot, but given my situation, there's plenty of reasoning for both sides.

So I'm living in this guy's house, let's name him Joe. I moved in mid May and am staying until August. I contacted him late, but he said he would put me in the last room available in his house. So I'm sleeping on a futon for the entire summer... And the room is basically an office; Joe has his computer there.

So because of the computer, Joe comes into my room to do stuff. How often? I have no clue. It's probably at least twice a week. And this is irritating me, because as someone paying him money to stay in his house, I feel like I should have my own privacy in my room. My stuff is all over the floor because he didn't clean out my closet, so half my floor space is taken up. Granted, his computer is there, but he made the decision to put me in that same room, without any warning to me. 

Would you consider it invading someone's privacy if someone goes into your room without notice? 

**EDIT**: I never signed a contract, as it never seemed necessary. This was kind of setup through our company where he is a full-time and I'm a summer intern. He lives in the house all year long and has interns move in during the summer. So there are 2 with nice big rooms with a closet, and me in a smaller room. My closet is full so I have to leave my room and go to a separate closet. Something that seems important to mention: Joe did tack off $100 from a $500 rent, so I probably won't ask for him to lower it again."

I grew up on the edge of an incredibly small town, in PA.Country girl all my life. My real mother left for another guy, when I was 3, and had my sister. I grew up Daddy's girl/right hand man, I went with him everywhere, i worked side by side with him in the garage, went hunting, fishing, I was an all out little tomboy. Dads parents helped out a lot along with my dads Pap. Gram was and always will be the person I see as a mother figure. And I adored my great grandfather. Though I didn't know him long and have few memories they are some of the sweetest. 

All of this sounds alright so far.

It was also around the age of three I was diagnosed with Wolff-Parkinson-White-Syndrome (WPWS). Over the years I had doctors visits, heart monitors, medicine. But It was manageable. The worst part was the sticky things for the monitor. It always tore at my skin and had to try and take them off after getting them wet in the bath. My gram used to put them on these 3 identical dolls that i had to help me. I would pretend to take care of them like she took care of me. (the only ones i've never been scared of) To this day I have Pediophobia which is a fear of dolls.

Dad remarried when I was 5. The always dreaded stepmother. This woman despised me. Intern I came to despise her. She was a spoiled woman who had always had everything handed to her and never had to do a thing for herself. What my dad saw and still sees in her I will never know. I still went with my dad everywhere, I didn't want to be around the nasty woman. But everyone now and then I couldn't go with dad. He had changed jobs in the last few years because the place he had been working at went out of business. So he had work and meetings and places he had to be from time to time. Before I would of always been with Gram but now ""she"" was here. She treated me like scum. Wouldn't let me out of my room. I would sneak out for snacks praying she wouldn't catch me. If she did I got drug back to my room by my hair. She also was in charge of bathing me. I couldn't stand it. She made fun of me. Pushed me around, also mostly by my hair. I also had and still do have natural curly hair which knots easily. She would purposely yang a comb through my hair and yell at me when it broke. I would be so angry but could do nothing. All I could ever do was cry. To this day half the time I become Angry i feel helpless and start to cry. Its like a defense mechanism I haven't been able to shake. 

I tried to tell my dad about this, but whey ""she"" was around him she acted all innocent and all my dad could think was that I was being a bratty kid and he listened to the ""adult"". 

It was't for a few years and a few times that he caught her that he finally learned I had been telling the truth. Though he still seemed to think that I always provoked her. I shouldn't been speaking to her that way or I should of done exactly what I was told. There was always some reason. But I could see that it was tearing my father apart trying to choose between his daughter and his wife. 

Then when I was 8 years old my brother was born. Yes he is technically my half-brother but I will never see him that way. I love him almost like a son. As stated before ""she"" didn't know how to do anything. So at 8yrs old, i'm the one thats up all night feeding him, changing him, burping him and holding him. While dad was there he loved doing it all and did most of the time because he thought he was ""relieving"" ""her"" for a few moments since ""she"" works so hard any other time. My dad was usually was home at nights but is a very heavy sleeper. Half the time you try to wake him you scare the both of you. HA!

Keeping and reducing the HST to 11% or 10% appears to be sound public policy. As an economics major, I can appreciate the comparative simplicity of the HST and the need for the province to increase their tax revenue to meet an aging and increasing population.

However, I feel very strongly that the BC Liberals need to be held accountable for their backroom dealing and the disgusting manner in which they forced through the HST. I don't want them to feel like this was AT ALL acceptable and expect that they can do this in unpopular legislation in the future.

I'm sure someone will say, ""Don't let your feelings about the Liberals distract from good public policy, there are other ways to hold them accountable."" I really doubt this. What would I do, write them an angry letter for some intern to toss in the recycling bin? Hold a rally that no one will pay attention to because the HST debate is ""over""? It seems like the only message the Liberals might actually listen to would be a majority vote to abolish the HST... but I think the HST is actually good policy in itself.

Any thoughts? Do you know how you'll be voting on the HST ballot?"

Been looking crazily for jobs since then. Got a couple of interviews and one part time job that lasted about two months. I even joined up with the National Guard so I could go to basic and earn some rent money. But that was about 3 months ago and things are looking pretty grim. 

I'm hoping on the off chance that someone here works somewhere that's hiring, or knows maybe something I don't. I dunno. 

I'm not at all unskilled. I'm moderately computer literate for someone of my generation (don't know how to program but know a whole slew of the normal programs jobs look for). I have a Bachelor's and Master's in social work and I'm taking my licensure exam tomorrow. I've got a hand full of internships under my belt and a decent work history up until I graduated (four years on one industrial job as an undergrad). 

Life sucks but I'm not trying to have a pity party. Any suggestions or leads would be appreciated. "
idal1,5,2011-06-30,Job searching goes great but put me in awkward situation. Advice?,Papshmire,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/idal1/job_searching_goes_great_but_put_me_in_awkward/,"Currently, I work two part-time jobs.  One of those jobs was for an ecommerce store that I worked as my college job and went full-time right after.  However, it was not really a professional job and didn't provide any benefits.  So, I decided to take an internship with a marketing department thanks to a friend who works there.  She promises that it would become a full-time job right after the internship.  


Well, year comes and goes, they have me stick around but I never got asked to go full-time and things sort of fall apart at the company.  I decided that it was time to move on.  After months of never hearing back from a job, I apply to another two and suddenly get interviews for both of them.


Both jobs seem great and they seem to want me, but they both require me to move away.  Here is the predicament.  At the same time, my two part-time jobs NOW want me full-time.  


So....I guess my question is, how do I go about giving myself the best case scenario?  What questions do I have to ask myself in order to know what I want?


**TL;DR**:  Sought full-time work because my two part-time jobs wouldn't hire me full-time.  Now got two potential full-time jobs lined up, with the part-times wanting to hire me full-on.

id02v,37,2011-06-30,"Here's the letter I wrote to my Congressman, if you're interested.",[deleted],trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/id02v/heres_the_letter_i_wrote_to_my_congressman_if/,"Rep. McCaul,

I'm writing tonight to urge you to consider your position with regards to the Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition Act of 2011 (HR2306). Although I understand that it is extremely difficult, nigh impossible, to change someone's opinion on an issue, especially an opinion that has been entrenched and fomented over the course of an entire lifetime, I still feel obliged, as one of your constituents, to make my opinion known. 

My name is [Anonymous]. I turned 18 years old this year, and have been living in Austin my entire life. I love this city, and I plan to stay here to attend UT Austin this Fall in order to study engineering. I graduated in the top 10% of my class, scored a 2100 on the SAT, scored in the top 98% NMSQT/PSAT and graduated with honors. I tell you these things with the hope that you, or the intern that is likely reading this, will not disregard my opinion as one of a slacker, a doper, or whatever other ad-hom typically applied to anti-prohibitionists.

Our country is in a dangerous position. Today, Rep. Paul described the state of our nation in a way that both awakened and terrified me: Although our country contributes only 5% of the total population of our planet, we house 25% of its prisoners. This is not because Americans are especially violent, or lurid, or immoral, but because of the racist policies implemented in our country decades ago that we deceptively refer to as the War on Drugs. I say deceptively because, to date, the ""War on Drugs"" has only served to increase, not abate, national drug use. 

Henry J. Anslinger, engineer of the policies which shaped the War on Drugs, testified before Congress, saying, ""There are 100,000 total marijuana smokers in the US, and most are Negroes, Hispanics, Filipinos and entertainers. Their Satanic music, jazz and swing, result from marijuana usage. This marijuana causes white women to seek sexual relations with Negroes, entertainers and any others."" If you believe that you are intelligent and informed enough to ignore my argument, you must also be intelligent enough to realize that the claims which founded marijuana prohibition are patently racist and, ergo, morally illegitimate. 

Furthermore, I have read that many of your fellow Republican Congressmen have argued that marijuana has a known substitute, called Marinol, which is a concentrated form of THC. Marijuana, on the other hand, is comprised of a complicated mix of multiple forms of THC and chemicals called cannabinoids, which interact with different receptors based on their structure. Many people have reported that Marinol makes them feel worse than the symptoms it claims to ease, and it is easy to see why after watching this video: http://youtu.be/8J7cZf2tFCQ You can see that any solution composed of pure THC is an improper replacement for the delicate mix of THC and cannabinoids found in marijuana. 

Furthermore, you should also be aware of the numerous social benefits of ending marijuana prohibition. Our police are stretched thin, made to enforce laws which have proven to be neither productive nor just, save for lining the pockets of the municipal court racket and the private prison industry. Legalizing and taxing marijuana would bring desperately needed funds to your constituency, free police forces to pursue real safety hazards and real violent crime, including drug-related violent crime. Let me repeat: legalizing marijuana does not mean legalizing drug-related violent crime. 

Finally, I also wish to address the argument that marijuana is a gateway drug. Marijuana is only considered a gateway drug because it is sold by drug dealers, who, in addition to selling marijuana, also tend to carry other wares: psilocybin mushrooms, powder cocaine, Xanax, ecstasy, et al. Legalizing marijuana would remove from these drug dealers a customer base and regulating marijuana would ensure that the chemicals which have historically been sprayed on marijuana by drug dealers, such as glass and green paint, would not make their way into the market again. If anything is a good example of this fact, of the benefits of regulation, it is the flesh-eating cocaine (sprayed with levamisole) that is currently wandering our country. 

Consider these facts, weigh them carefully in your mind, and decide what is right for the voters (and the Constitution) that you serve. Occasionally I find myself asking, ""Are politicians human beings? Do they worry, the way I do? Do they sense their mortality, the way I do? Do they have trouble falling asleep, the way I do? Are they depressed, hopeful, ambitious, perceptive, fearful - the way I am?""

Well, Congressman, are you? Prove me wrong.

I'm currently a 2nd year going into my 3rd year at a four-year University. I want to start recruiting in my 3rd year so I'm hoping to pick the best internship that would provide me the most relevant or best resume building experience.


I'm currently choosing between a corporate finance analyst internship job where I'll be organizing data collection methodology, assisting creating of valuation models, and statistically testing collected data sample

vs.


Finance intern at a investment / wealth management firm where I'll be assisting them with client investment plans, entering trades into computer, managing stocks, and calling insurance brokers to make sure that the firm isn't doing anything illegal and everything is fine. I'm not sure how involved i'll be in the whole process but the interviewer mentioned that since its a small firm, I'll be exposed and involved in the whole process.

Both internships are at pretty small companies, nothing fortune 500 or anything like that, so i believe i'll be able to do actual work rather than coffee delivery or secretary work. 

Right now I'm debating which one would look better to consultants during recruiting season and which one would teach me more applicable skills in the business world.

thank you all in advanceee &lt;3 "
icwdt,3,2011-06-29,Need some advice...,wilsun,cscareerquestions,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/icwdt/need_some_advice/,"I recently graduated with a BS in CS from a good top/second tier university (some digging in my profile/history will no doubt reveal it). I interned last summer as a software engineer and am now participating in an information systems rotational program in a defense company (again, some research will easily reveal its identity).

Problem: I effing hated the internship, and am already dreading going into work a week after starting at my first full-time job. This may have something to do with the fact that I was not given much to do in my internship and my current manager has been too busy to assign me tasks and I have no admin rights on my workstation so I can't do anything fun with it. Or maybe I just realized I hate industry.

Now, I have choices. I can certainly stay on this job, but I'm scared that spending years in an IS rotational program will put me behind the competition in terms of software engineering experience, and software or systems engineering is where I ultimately want to end up. If I leave after just a week, I'm scared that I'll be burning bridges and maybe end up hurting me in the future.

I don't know. Academia, maybe?
