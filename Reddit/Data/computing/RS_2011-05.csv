h15vv,2,2011-04-30,Things were perfect until she said something.,NRussiaAccountThrowU,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/h15vv/things_were_perfect_until_she_said_something/,"I am 20, my girlfriend is 20, and the other girl is 20. I have been dating this girl for 2 weeks. I have known her for over 8 months though. We have a connection that runs months deeper though.

So what this makes this story unique is that it takes place in Disneyworld. Yeah. I was working there as a college internship, with my now girlfriend as my coworker. I was single the whole time I was down there.

One night I run to catch a bus, only for interns, and get on and say ""You guys don't need to worry, I made it"" to which this voice responds ""Good I was really worried"" I look to see this gorgeous girl, with her roommate, and I say ""I think Ill sit down right here""

We start talking for a 20 minute bus ride, and she is snappy and sarcastic, which I go right back. I got off the bus, and wasn't mad, but she made me trip up over a whole bunch of things I said, I knew stuff I should have said, and I was upset that this girl beat me at a sarcasm match.

She also said ""I bet you are going to be a creep and add me on facebook"" because I saw her name tag. I was, but now I couldn't. So I sent her a message on facebook saying ""This isn't a facebook friend request"" We talked a little, and eventually she added me.

The whole time she said I was hollering at her, so I couldn't be predictable. So I never made a move after that, and we were friends.

Months later, I am infatuated by my current girlfriend. She is wonderful. Nothings going wrong, everything goes great, and we really like each other. 

I get a message from my friend. The one I met on the bus. We start talking, and topics go to topics, we talk about how we met. Then I say, ""well Im glad I didn't ask for your number, that would have been bad, you would have turned me down."" to which she says, ""You had an opportunity before I started dating my current boyfriend""

This girl is beautiful, and funny, and wonderful. My girlfriend now, there is nothing I can complain about, she doesn't have a huge sense of humor, but she is the nicest person I ever met.

Ever since that girl from the bus said this, every time I am on the phone with my girlfriend now, I think ""I really do not care what you are doing, I want to know what bus girl is doing"" Every time she text me, I hope its bus girl, and I know shes great, and nothings wrong, its just I cant get over this girl and this lost opportunity.

I don't think I can solve this, I just need to get over it, how can I reddit?

h2ops,1,2011-05-02,"Sober 4 months now, but don't know what will happen after drug test.",rockcanteverdie,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/h2ops/sober_4_months_now_but_dont_know_what_will_happen/,"First off, I'm glad to find this community. It's nice to be able to talk to people going through similar experiences. 

i'm a 19 year old engineering college student. My dad is a professor at the university at which i study. He pays my tuition and i live with him. This last semester i had been striving to get a co-op (like a paid internship but alternating semesters studying and working). My goal was to be able to pay my own rent and finally live on my own(meaning away from parents, not without roommates) without getting student loans. For once in my life, i was driven. I quit smoking weed completely this semester so that no matter what, even if the drug test was a hair sample, it would not fuck up my chances. 

Well, i got the co-op. i start in august. i'm really excited, but one thing kind of bothers me. since i quit, alot of things in my life have gotten better. I'm much more responsible. I'm alot more willing to step outside my comfort zone and stretch my limits. i'm 1000% more social and outgoing now. last year, when i using a few times a week, i was doing better academically, but all i did was school and then get high on the weekends. now i'm in a fraternity and actually have a social life. So my problem is this: i've been feeling what i saw Subduction refer to as a [reservation to use](http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/gnu34/i_want_to_be_done_playing_this_game/c1oxwg7). And once i pass my drug test, i'll have no important reason not to smoke weed anymore. i'll be in a new city and living away from parents for the first time. I predict that at this time it will be VERY hard for me to not start smoking weed again. and i don't even know if that's a bad thing. I've gone long periods of time with what seemed to be controlled weed use. But i've also abused it. i smoked daily for about 8 months after graduating high school and my life most certainly went downhill. I know that i'm happy with my life now, but i also know that it's possible to use and not abuse it. but the possibility of using it without abuse makes it easy to start abusing it without realizing it. i don't know what's going to happen. i don't want getting high to become my default activity again, even if i'm getting all my stuff done. but i really miss weed. it's funny, if i were to get high right now i'd be so excited that i'd spend my whole buzz trying to decide how best to spend my buzz. it's happened before, and i always feel so pathetic when it does. i don't know what to do.

sorry if that was really disorganized, i just never get to talk about these things."

Perhaps this isn't the subreddit for it but could anyone maybe give some advice from their own experiences?

h2abk,8,2011-05-02,Closed-off SO is driving me insane. Is there hope or is this a lost cause? ,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/h2abk/closedoff_so_is_driving_me_insane_is_there_hope/,"We (19M, 19F) have been in a LDR for almost a year now. We've been friends for 6 years since high school (though some might argue about the intermittent 2 years). The distance has been extremely tough on her, but somehow we've made it through to this point. It's also become increasingly clear to me that she has trouble opening up (to me, to anyone, but her aggression is more noticeable when we interact). 

A particularly bad but revealing phone conversation happened last night. She called while I was sleeping, but I answered it anyway. She insisted I go to sleep but I asked her to indulge my request for once (i.e., to talk to her). Our previous phone calls have all ended on bad terms, so I really wanted to break the chain of bad conversations before I head home and see her on Saturday. 

Throughout the time we talked, I spoke to her encouragingly about telling me what's bothering her, but she would dismiss my concern, stating she doesn't have to tell me anything and she doesn't have anything to say. As the call went on, she became extremely rude and insensitive to how I might feel in reaction to the mean things she's saying and the annoyance in her voice. 

I was getting restless and upset, but I stayed calm. I asked her why she bothered calling if she sounds like she doesn't want to talk to me at all. I don't think she knew how much she was hurting me. At the same time I understand she has this irrational fear of getting close to someone because they might hurt her (note: her parents had a bad split when she was young; her dad's a scumbag). The conversation ended badly with me not getting through to her and us parting in bad moods again.

I've thought about giving up on this relationship several times now, but she's the best damn thing to have happened to me. She's transferring to a closer school this fall, and we made plans to live together for the summer while I intern in San Francisco. Everything seemed fine, but the week before I head home, this happens and the implications really hit home. 

I want a girl who's not needy but also isn't afraid to open up and confide in me because she, like me, takes solace in knowing someone else is there for her even when I can't help her with her problems. I need someone who wants to talk to me, because a LDR is hard enough as it is without the physical presence. Not incessantly talkative, but feels comfortable telling me everything. Why do some people feel the need to be so defensive? It makes no sense to me, because a closer relationship benefits both parties, whereas one that's closed off is ultimately a lost cause. Should I try to fix this shortcoming or move on? This problem drives me crazy, and I don't know what to do.

**TL;DR** Girlfriend has trouble opening up to me, becomes very defensive about my trying to get close to her, doesn't talk to and confide in me like I wish she would. It drives me crazy. Fix or move on? "

That said, this August, I'll have completed my B.S. in Computer Science.  I'm doing well enough, and have a good enough reputation with my teachers that I could go back for grad school, and I'll be taking the GRE and applying for grad school just in case.  
I also have been putting in a lot of applications, have one summer internship offer (albeit not actually having anything to do with CS), and have a few interviews coming up for local software engineering positions.  
That said, the more I look at the US, and the more I think about my future, I don't want to be here forever.  And the more I think about that, the more I think I want to get away soon.  
I spent a year doing exchange study in Japan during Highschool, I speak Japanese well enough to get around, maybe not enough for a strictly Japanese corporate environment, but if I had to, I could get back up to snuff fast I think.  
I'm also hearing a lot of good things about Sweden through here and other parts of the internet.  
Does anyone have advice for someone in my situation looking to get into software engineering, or maybe graduate study in Sweden or Japan, or are there other places that are looking good for people looking for low level jobs for CS majors?  
Thanks in advance for any ideas, info, or for just being one of the best subreddits.

h1zgl,6,2011-05-02,I was just at the party outside the White House. AMA,tenspeedscarab,IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/h1zgl/i_was_just_at_the_party_outside_the_white_house/,"Heading off some potential questions: to my knowledge, I did not make it onto a camera, I am 18, dual citizenship USA and Thailand, Democrat. I'm in Washington for an internship on the Hill.

I got there at around 11:30, when there were just a few people around. Then it started swelling. Lots of college kids from GWU, lots of beer and cigarettes. Lot of people tried climbing the lightpost, and one person attached a US flag to it. A guy in full body america flag spandex and Spider-man showed up. Anything you want to ask me, go ahead.

EDIT: To be clear: I was not one of the flag-waving, chanting frat guys. I was a roiling mix of anger, fear, sadness and confusion. I think the way the crowd was acting was incredibly wrong. No one's death ought to be celebrated. It's just wrong to take to the streets chanting when someone dies. It's what Fox News would have us thinking the barbaric Arabs would do. The double standard sickened me, and I was scared because I felt that if somehow, my thoughts were known to the crowd, I don't know what would happen to me. That's why I made this AMA.

h1uv2,6,2011-05-01,I was turned down for my dream job...twice...help me remember that my career isn't everything in life,shattered_dreams,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/h1uv2/i_was_turned_down_for_my_dream_jobtwicehelp_me/,"There's a specific job I've wanted (for a specific company - not just the role) since my senior year in high school - 2006. Back then it was just a passing fantasy, a ""wouldn't it be cool if someday...""

But then in 2009, partway through college, there was an opening for the position, and I actually got the opportunity to apply and be seriously considered. I was up against tons of other applicants, so I wasn't surprised when I got the very nice letter (and personal) letter telling me that I wasn't quite qualified, but maybe someday.

Then in 2010, I was offered an internship with the company for which I wanted to work. During that time, I got to know a lot of people within the company, including the ones who make the hiring decisions. Soon after finishing my internship, I got a call from my former manager letting me know that there was another opening for the position, and that I was being considered for it.

They flew me across the country for the interview, and I let myself get my hopes up. I was under the impression that they had already made up their minds to hire me, and that this interview was just a formality (after all, I had interned for them, they knew me, etc). But I soon found out that three other people were being considered for the interview. Still, I thought the interview went well, and afterwards I was told I'd hear the decision within two weeks.

MONTHS passed, and finally I received a short email from them saying that they had decided not to hire anyone after all, but that I was on their shortlist if they decided to hire again.

So I graduated college, took a position in IT, and now work a boring 9-5 job in which I feel trapped and bored. And I feel like crying because of it every single day. I have no motivation to try to excel at my current job, and I also feel very little motivation toward anything else - I just keep thinking that my life would be perfect if only I had my dream job.

I have great family, great friends, am in a very happy relationship - yet I honestly have trouble caring about that. Jobs are such a significant part of life - they're where you spend roughly a third of your time, they're how you are able to provide even the basest means of survival for yourself. So I always told myself I was going to be one of those people with a job I love - that I would live to work, rather than working to live.

Reddit, please remind me that having a dream job isn't everything - that family, friends, and significant others are worth living for. Because I've completely lost sight of that."
h1uk8,1,2011-05-01,What's your best academic dishonesty story?,CheatOnTuringTest,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/h1uk8/whats_your_best_academic_dishonesty_story/,"In high school, I worked for the help desk for three years.  The office was right next to the IT department for the district.  There were two employees in IT, which was separate from the help desk.  One was a 50 or so year old man who had below-average computer skills and handled things like purchasing computers.  The other had initially set up much of the infrastructure, and played WoW all day until the network went down, then called Dell to come fix it.  As part of my internship, I got to do a final project, so I chose to do a security audit.

All the computers in the district had two local accounts.  One was for regular users (the acronym of our district) which used the same acronym as the password.  There was also an admin account.  Every computer of a given model was imaged the same way and Norton Ghost was used for computers not used by teachers to restore it to the same state regularly.

Instead of integrating Windows authentication properly, they just installed a Novell client of some kind which prompted users to log in to their Novell account right after the Windows credentials were entered.  Every student and teacher had their own Novell account, and we were supposed to keep all of our school-related stuff on our (protected) space on a network drive that was mounted by a script.  We were also told not to save stuff to the local drive.  The teachers disregarded this because nobody had access to their computers.

One day I remembered that all of the local drives are shared by default on Windows (SMB) shares.  You can access them from the local network as long as you have the credentials that would be necessary to get to them otherwise.  These shares are named ""C$"" for C:\, ""D$"" for D:\, etc.  They're also hidden in the network browser (""Network Neighborhood / Network Places"").  By visiting \\[computername]\C$, any user could easily browse the entire hard drive from the network.  If they had simply configured the computers not to require credentials for Windows' log-on, then it would not have exported these drives!

So, I logged onto all of my teachers' computers with the normal credentials, which were named by their building and room numbers like ""hs-314"" and realized almost none of them used their network drives to store files.  I downloaded a bunch of tests.  Most teachers who had been there for a while used the same four or so versions of a given test.

I told the IT department about this as part of my audit report, which I made immediately after finding out.  They said ""nobody would figure that out"" and ""people aren't supposed to put things on the drives anyway.""  I lied, saying that I asked teachers if they stored tests on their hard drives, and they said that they did.  He said ""tell them not to do that.""

So, I downloaded copies of these tests, which usually only had minor variations from one another.  Then I got trusted friends who were much smarter at me at humanities subjects that I would have to try really hard or do poorly at (AP English, AP World History), and, in exchange for the correct answers, I'd give them the test ahead of time.  I didn't tell them how I got them, but I did tell them not to tell anybody about it.  I ended up acing every test that I did this with over the course of 2 years, to the point that it was suspicious, but I never got caught.

As further evidence of their stupidity, I later cracked the administrator's password (it was an LM hashed on a Windows 98 computer that was used for one of the shop classes) and it turned out to be the name of our mascot.  He hadn't changed his password in years, either.

TL;DR: School's IT is retarded, easily downloaded tests well in advance, gave them to other nerds, they took them, I remembered their answers."
h1rm7,1,2011-05-01,Getting back to the gym - seeking advice/recommendations on my routine,[deleted],Fitness,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/h1rm7/getting_back_to_the_gym_seeking/,"So I’m starting to get back into a routine and I thought I’d ask for some feedback/advice.   I read the FAQs (and read much more elsewhere) so please don’t tell me to go and do that, I’m posting this in hopes that someone has some advice personalized for me or can point out something I'm doing wrong.  

Some background info- I’m a 21 year old college student 6’3” weighing about 180-185 and have some previous gym experience but haven’t really been serious since last summer, and just started up again about three weeks ago.  It feels so good to be active in the gym again and I’ve convinced myself I’m never going to taper off again (and I quit cigs over a month ago woot!).  This summer I’m going to be working an internship back home so I’ll probably be working out almost every day.  
As far as supplements go I take animal pak in the mornings, recently started taking jack3d preworkout, and take whey post workout.
I recently bought starting strength but haven’t gotten around to reading it yet.

So I’m doing a split routine divided into five different days, usually in the following order:

**Chest**

* barbell/dumbbell bench press

* barbell/dumbbell incline press

* barbell/dumbbell decline press 

* cable crossovers

* dumbbell flys

**Legs**

* squats

* still working on this, need to start doing deadlifts but I’ve been too lazy to read up and learn about them

* seems like I don’t like a lot of the leg workouts but hopefully you guys know some that I should start doing 

**Back**

* wide grip pull-ups

* bent over dumbbell row

* barbell reverse grip bent over row

* close grip lat pulldowns

* hyperextensions (lower back)

**Shoulders**

* dumbbell shoulder press

* barbell front raise

* barbell upright row

* dumbbell lateral raise

* dumbbell bent over delt raise

**Arms**

* skullcrushers

* dumbbell bicep curl/alternate hammer curl

* preacher curl/barbell curl

* 21s sometimes

* reverse grip triceps pushdown

Some questions:
* The gym I’m currently at doesn’t have free standing squat/bench stations so I’m using a smith machine, am I really losing out on a lot by not controlling the weight myself?

* Are chickfila nuggets good for someone with a pretty fast metabolism trying to bulk (8 nuggets has 260 cal, 12g fat, 28g protein)? Now that I type those out it definitely looks like it’s a good option, and they’re so delicious and accessible on campus so I eat them pretty frequently..I guess I try to avoid fast food but when I get it I go for what I think would be high protein and relatively less fatty (ie stay away from fries, sodas,etc). 

* Any advice on getting those calories in as a college student?  I’m usually busy most of the day so I try as much as I can to keep eating but it’s not always easy.

* What’s better – controlled (slow) lower weight, or higher weight that I can’t control quite as well (not dangerous or anything)?  How many reps should I be able to do of a certain weight before actually moving up to it (ie doing 10 reps of 55 on dumbbell bench but only able to do 6, then 4 reps of 60)?

* Whenever I do my last set for a particular exercise, I immediately do another set with half the weight until my muscles are completely destroyed. I don’t know if that’s recommended but I’ve done it for some time now and it makes me feel like I take my muscles as far as they can go (ie repping 60 on dumbbell bench and can’t even get 30s up at the end)

* Any other suggestions/tips/criticisms?

Thanks for taking the time to read and respond.

I'm 31 years old... my first attempt at college was a disaster.  I returned to university in 2007 and kept a 3.96 GPA at my current school, and my cumulative GPA is 3.34.  I will be starting a job as a security researcher in June, and have a 2 year commitment due to my scholarship.  My employer offers a number of options for continuing education.  I'm currently deciding if I should start working towards graduate school in a few years, but I have a few questions: 

1.) Would it be worth it to start a graduate degree this late in life (after 30?) 
2.) If so, is there any advantage to pursuing a PhD vs. a Masters? I've always wanted my PhD, but the idea of committing 4-6 years of my life is intimidating. 
3.) If I did decide to go for a graduate degree, will bad grades in classes 10+ years ago hurt me?  I've had all A's and 1 B for the past 4 years, and will have some research experience through internship and work, but I literally made all F's one semester back in 2000.

TL;DR: At 31, is it worth it considering grad school, and if so, would I have a shot?"

I have a lot of experience in the field: I have been working for XHTMLized.com since last year, where I have taken a lot of projects and gathered invaluable experience; also, I have been dealing with other clients for about four years now.

I am looking for an opportunity of a one, two month long paid internship during my holidays in July and August (preferably July). I would love to get some experience in actual office work, not only in front of the computer: to get to know great minds of your company, exchange ideas, attend meetings, work on really exciting projects and all that. Whatever you need! (As long as it does not include nudity.)

You can take a look at what I do here: [**eraevion.net**](http://eraevion.net/) Keep in mind though, that most of my work, which is done for XHTMLized is not allowed to be shown publicly.

If you're interested, please [send me an e-mail](emailto:jakub@eraevion.net). "

I just found out tonight (through a mutual friend) that a very well known investor has put $1 million into his first startup, and that he'll be moving to California to being growing it in a few months. I also learned that he only has one programmer working with him and is probably going to be looking for more in the very near future.

So, Reddit, I ask: What would be the best way to contact him and ask him if he has a job to throw my way, without sounding like I'm trying to ""latch on"" to him or his success?

h4aq5,6,2011-05-04,Does it ever get better?  Will it change?,throwaway5280,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/h4aq5/does_it_ever_get_better_will_it_change/,"I (male) have been going out with my girlfriend for over four years.  We are both in our early 20’s and have recently graduated from the same college were we met.  We do not live together, but see each other often, and sleep over three times a week.  For the first three years our relationship was great, I saw her as the girl I want to marry.  However, this past year has been the toughest part of our relationship, and I don’t know if it is worth it to continue.


I will try to be as unbiased as I can be describing the situation, but that is almost impossible as I can only take an educated guess at how she feels.  Consequentially, this is all from my point of view.

   

**Background**


From my point of view, the trouble started last September when she started an internship and her MBA courses (she is part of a 1-year MBA program, so the course load is larger).  The large amount of work that she has is causing her significant stress.  Additionally, around this time she went off her birth control and became paranoid of getting pregnant.



Around the end of November my Internship ended, and I was turned down for a full time position due to cut backs.  In the mean time I have been working part-time in retail while I search for a full time job.  She has told me that she sees me as the man she wants to marry, so my difficulty finding a career has been a source of stress for her.  I understand how this affects her, and I am trying to remedy this situation. However I don’t think she realizes how hard it is to start a career in this economy. 

   

**Sex Life Problems**


Since September our sex-life has radically changed.  Her paranoia about getting pregnant meant that we started only doing oral sex.  Up until January, we would be intimate once or twice a week.  In the past three months I feel lucky if it is even twice a month.

She has made what I feel to be no effort to be more intimate.  I have approached this problem with her, but it has become a really touchy subject. I have talked to her about it, and she has agreed that it is her problem and she needs to change it, but I still feel like she hasn’t done anything about it.  This is a great source of stress for me.

   

**Relationship Problems**


I recognize the fact that she has been stressed with her work load, and I have offered to help her in any way I can.  I occasionally drive her to and from school, help with research, proof read her work, write study guides, and cook.  However, I feel that recently she has been treating more like an assistant than a boyfriend.  She has started to act like me doing these things are my job since I am not currently employed full-time.  I rarely feel any gratitude from her after doing these things.

Additionally she has been a lot more irritable and tends to snap at me quickly.  This has never been an issue until now, and recently I feel like I need to always tread carefully around her.  Right now, if I were to try to bring up any problems she will have a break down, and I do not want to be the cause of it.

I feel like this relationship has been almost entirely one-sided with me doting on her because she is always stressed.  If you were to ask me what she gives me in return, I would honestly have to think about it (though I could be blinded to it due to my anger at the situation). *Edit: I have had time to think about it, and there are plenty of examples of little things that she does that show that she still cares about our relationship.  They are just not that easily noticeable.*



She graduates from her MBA course in June, and has already discussed with her internship about full time employment.  By my projections, I HOPE to have a full time job by then as well.  My current plan is to wait until then before approaching her about how this year has been, when both our tempers are cooled and the future is not so foreboding.

So my question is:  Will it get better?  By the end of the summer when we are both gainfully employed will things change?  Will I get the girl I used to be with back?



**TL;DR:**  Girlfriend is overworked, has low sex drive, and is irritable.  I am looking for a job and feel like our relationship is falling apart.  Will it change?

**   **

** *Edit:* **


*In the interests of being fair, I should tell you that one of her complaints about me as of late is that whenever we do anything fun together, she feels like she has to be the one to plan it.  My excuse is the when ever I have tried to plan anything, it always falls through because she is so busy, so I have recently stopped trying.*"

h3pg4,2,2011-05-03,"hopeless, 21yrs old, and heavily addicted to opiates. Reddit PLEASE help",KidPhil1989,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/h3pg4/hopeless_21yrs_old_and_heavily_addicted_to/,"I don't even know where to begin, so I guess ill start from the beginning. I go to a accredited 4yr public university about 2 hours from my parents house, I'm currently a senior and plan on graduating in about a week. Growing up I was always the conservative friend that managed my money extremely well. I had saved close to $10,000 before I started college from work and what not. Once in college I began trading foreign currencies successfully and soon was making upwards of $500 a week.

  I started doing oxycontin and percocet the end of my sophmore year during sundays with the excuse ""it was my one day to relax and mellow out"" before school and the markets opened back up. Before I knew it I was doing them every night after homework and when the markets closed. It wasn't long before I started skipping class, not following the markets, and just really lowering my quality of life. My roommates had noticed a change and confronted me about it. It was enough to knock some sense into me and marked when I began to realize I was addicted. I never really stopped, but instead cut back and became a closet addict. I was able to somewhat salvage my Junior year, keep my GPA up, and luckily was going to a town 2000 miles away for an internship. I had looked back on the damage I had done to my academics, the money I had wasted, and told myself that I would get better while away. 

A month into my internship the only thing I could think about was oxycontin and percocet. I began driving around the city after my work day and searched far and wide for the drug but had very little luck. I never ended up finding any and my dealer refused to mail them to me so I was pretty much S.O.L.. The internship had ended and I went back to my college town with the intent of only doing them once and a while. Sadly, I began abusing them heavily and started to freebase the pills which I look back and mark as the beginning of the end.

For this past year, I would say I have been doing about $150-$200 worth of pills a day, everyday. I literally spent every dime to my name, drained every investment account I had, and even cashed about $3000 worth of savings bond. I almost broke down and called my parents asking for help but knew my parents would be heartbroken and decided to get clean on my own. With some of the worst timing imaginable, my parents had sent me a $10,000 check (which is about 20% of their combined income for a year), with a letter saying that this was for a down payment on a house or for a car and how proud they were I was graduating so soon (I will be the first to graduate college in my family). 

Its gone..(I seriously can almost cry when I think of this). Within a month and 26 days I had completely blown every last dollar my parents gave me. And thats where I am now. Reddit, I have no one to turn to, I have little to no friends anymore and cannot break my parents heart with the news... I am so addicted to this drug that I am starting to scare myself thinking about what I will do to get money for the pills. I can't afford rehab, I just don't know what to do, I've contemplated suicide for the first time in my life... The only thing I have left thats positive in my life is that im graduating but even with that I destroyed my GPA and don't have a job lined up..

Any advice would be appreciated. I am losing my will and drive to even try to fight this demon. If anyone has some kind of hope they could pass this way, it would be great..

TLDR- wasted over $50k on pills and had my parents give me a graduation present of $10,000 which was blown within 2 months... I cannot have my parents find out and I losing hope and need serious advice."

Now before i get jumped for being born so lucky please take a second to understand the situation.  Now that I have this money I am effectively cut off, with the exceptions of living expenses while in college (tuition, food, shelter).  In other words I have no allowance for leisure activities, and once I graduate I am 100% on my own (this $ is also my grad present)   

So Reddit......What would you do in my situation?  Investments, trips, etc....


Other details..

1.  I will need a car after graduation

2.  I will most likely have a 30-40k job after graduation (I have worked a lot of internships that appear to lead to this path)

Thats all I can think of at the moment.  I am just really looking for a plan that will help me to make the most of the gifts I have been given.

h5egi,2,2011-05-06,STILL can't get over her,[deleted],relationshipadvice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationshipadvice/comments/h5egi/still_cant_get_over_her/,"I'm still hung up my ex. We dated for 6 months, but it ended 7 months ago. My problem is, I can honestly say I've never been happier in my life than when I was with her. She graduated college in San Antonio about a month after we started dating, and moved back to Houston. We visited each other every time we could and things were going great. I made plans to move, attend the University of Houston, and work at an internship with a racing team. I lie to myself about it, but the main motivation for the move was to be with her. I wanted to marry her. Then, about two months before my planned move, she started acting distant and dumped me for no reason (that she would tell me). She said she just had a change of heart. The opportunities in Houston were still worth the move, so I went ahead with it anyway. We tried hanging out as friends a couple times before I moved, but even though she had said she loved me during our relationship, she was bringing new guys around almost immediately. I had been hoping once I moved we could reconnect, but that hasn't been the case. We haven't spoken once since I've lived here (4 months). I think that our relationship ended during the ""honey moon phase"" where everything is perfect, so I have her built up as the perfect woman in my head. I have to admit, the only flaw I can find in her is an immaturity with relationships. She's 23 but dates guys like it's middle school. When one relationship ends, it's right on to the next one.

I'm starting to see someone else, we haven't even kissed at this point, but I definitely like her. But I still think about my ex constantly, I even had a dream about her last night. I don't know what to do. I want to move forward, but I still can't get her out of my head. I feel like I'm trying to start a new relationship just cover up the old one.

 I'm afraid of being rejected if I try to reconnect with her, and if we started hanging out again I know my sole motivation would be to get her back. And even if we did get back together, I would constantly fear getting dumped again for no good reason. I'm seriously considering therapy at this point. I don't want to live the rest of my life fearing that the perfect girl for me got away. I know there are plenty of fish in the ocean, but let's face it, some are better than others.

Should I try to talk to her? Should I just ignore the feelings and hope they go away? Should I get professional help? She dominates my thoughts when I don't have something distracting me, and I'm sick of feeling this way."

Some background info:
I'm heading to England through a school program and will be an intern at HerpDerp Group for about 6 weeks. (Mid May to early July)
I've browsed through /r/travel and looked through a few posts and got some excellent suggestions. (Many thanks to OutofH2G2references).

However, I've actually got 2 weekends of my 6 weeks there taken up. I will be heading to Bath and York those two weekends. This experience will actually be my first time out of the US in some 18 years.

Can any of you give me some suggestions as to what the heck I could do with my spare time? I've got a few things in mind but some solid suggestions would be great. Also, I am looking for some fairly cheap things to do (though I realize England isn't the place to be for that) if possible. Considering this is probably one of the few time I'll ever be able to go outside the US, I think I can make an exception to the cheapness rule. 

Suggestions for ""you absolutely have to see -this-this-and-this if you're only going to be here once"" would be awesome.

By the way, how do the British ladies feel about not-so-bad-looking Asian Texans? Just wondering if anyone had the answer to this.

I'm starting my internship on the 16th and feeling kinda screwed.

Anyone have any leads on housing? Anyone need to sublet their place for 3 months? I'm totally flexible and will crash on your couch for a couple of days if our dates overlap. 

Thanks Reddit!

Edit: Thanks for the replies so far... Like all good redditors, I've been checking Padmapper and Craigslist consistently -- the problem isn't finding listings, it's getting the people with listings to write back to me (which people have, but then they're way too far from the subway or decide to take some local and stop replying). I considered paying up for GW housing but the dates don't work and they don't have singles left for the summer. 

Edit 2: FOUND A PLACE TO LIVE! Thanks so much Reddit!"

There's a few things I'm unsure about, so I thought I'd see if anyone had some experiences to share, either from being an intern or working with them.

I really have absolutely no experience with production-level coding.  I was very up front about this in the interviews, so I'm not too worried about it but I'm curious how they'll start me off.  What has this process been like, in your experience?

What was the social aspect like, considering that I'll be the only intern (22) in an office full of professionals?  Did you find that interns didn't quite ""fit in""?

Any other advice on interning and first days would be greatly appreciated."

How do I prepare to adjust my life to the ""real world"" of non-college jobs?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/h5uqd/i_graduated_from_university_today_and_start_my/,"Today was graduation and I got my degree in computer science, and I have a full-time internship all set up for this summer at a local software company in a couple weeks.  But I'm really nervous and kind of terrified at just what it's like to work in a ""9 to 5"" kind of job; I'm used to being a T.A. or doing part-time on-campus programming jobs that work around my school schedule and that I can work on from my dorm.  So I was looking for any thoughts or insights on what this is like and how I can transition into it well.

One thing in particular is just realizing that I will probably never again have the amount of free time I did while in school, and that when it comes right down to it, the number of hours between getting off work and needing to sleep for tomorrow seems so short.  Do you have to plan a lot to figure how to use your free time effectively?  

I'm sure I sound pretty silly, but I do feel ill-prepared for entering the real world despite having learned a lot about my field.  Any advice would be well-appreciated."
h5t3k,4,2011-05-06,[FR] AA + house party + pub,Dorman010,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/h5t3k/fr_aa_house_party_pub/,"Okay, just got back from the field, somewhat tipsy (4:35 A.M. here), so excuse any mistakes with this FR.

I come back from my internship, take the usual bus at the train station, when this *smoking* hot redhead HB9 sits in the same bus, wearing a tight grey dress. I am reading my book (in Hebrew) and try to get her interested, but then I remember that *I* am the one who needs to approach her. Got AA all over me and next thing you know, girl exits the bus. I spend the entire remainder of the bus ride and more kicking myself mentally for not even trying an approach. Get home by around 19:00

There is a house party at one of my female friends' places on around 20:00. I know I cannot get prepared on time (gotta shower and whatnot), so I arrive a total of around an hour and a half late. House party is meh, only social circle, so no real place for gaming.

At around 00:30, we move out to the centre of Brussels. Two of the group decide to go home, leaving us as a total of 3 (2 girls and me, one of them kinda HB 7, but not gonna try to game her). Eventually, I call one of our friends, and she and more mutual friends will be where we are in 5 minutes. We wait 10, and they still don't arrive, so we decide to go to the *Delirium* - basically Brussels' most notorious spot and, unknown by my female friends, a regular PUA are.

Fuck. So tired. Already 04:45 A.M. now... bite the bullet, finish this FR!

So we get to the Delirium. I decide to call my friends to see what's up. This is when things get interesting. A girl (HB around 7.5, let's call her Dancer) grabs me and tells me ""Let's dance!""

Me: ""I gotta call my friends.""

Dancer: ""Let's dance!""

Me: Or else what?

Dancer: she pulls closer to me, can sense some attraction in there (well, duh, she drew you in for a dance! I know, I know.

Me: No, really, I have to call my friends.

Dancer: I don't care. *continues dancing*

Me: *pulls her closer* Well, whatcha gonna do about it if I go? *smiles*

Dancer doesn't answer, but grabs my hands, so we dance a bit, and then she suddenly pulls away from me saying ""Very bad, D minus!""

I decide it's time to sit down, so I grab the nearest chair and another, and tell her to sit down next to me. I do some fluff talk with her with pretty heavy kino all the time, and then I stand up, and touch her armpits to make her stand up again (wanna dance again). Next thing I know, she's back with her friends without telling me anything. What the hell. Next!

That is exactly when my friends arrive, so we have some fun and laughs, then I notice a group of 4 girls, mostly HB7, standing next to the bar in order to buy a drink, but they're being hit on. I wait for them to go back to their table, make eye contact (keep the 3s rule this time), I stand up, walk to them, and start the conversation:

Me: ""Hi, ladies, how are you?""

HB7: ""Fine, you?""

Me: ""Well, I have a question for you - I saw you over there, from across the pub, and I wanted to come and talk to you. However, I don't know how. So, do you have any advice for me on how I should talk to you?""

She: ""You could start by buying my friends here a drink."" (she's the only one with a beer)

Me: *sits down on one of the chairs* Oh, I don't do that, as a rule of thumb. [fluff talk and some kino here, but I don't feel the attraction, so I eject as my friends are waiting for me].

Go back to my friends, talk some more, then I go to the bathroom. On the way back, I meet Dancer again. So I smile and say ""So, we meet again."" she says ""Yeah, I just have to use the bathroom!"" and taps me on the chest. I knew immediately what this was - pity tap. Meaning ""I don't really like you that much, but I'm going to touch you in order to give you some of my value and make us both feel a bit better."" I go to my friends and I sit there, looking for other sets to open, but there's nothing in this part of the pub. I notice that one of our friends has disappeared, so I go look for her. I find her standing alone, so I ask her why she's alone and not with the group. Next thing I know, some Portuguese guy comes and talks to her (and she likes him, 'cause she's 1) a slut 2)Brazilian). I go downstairs, where there also ain't a lot of people. I make eye contact with a girl (HB7) immediately, and walk up immediately.

Me: Hey, how are you doing?

She: *looks puzzled*

Me: How are you doing? *smiles*

She: I'm sorry, I don't speak English.


*BAM*. Dead in my tracks. I try Dutch, she speaks only French. Well, that's my cue. Time to leave.

As always, feedback is appreciated!"

I have a lot of experience in C++, along with some experience in C and Python.  I'm in the middle of applying for internships, but if that doesn't pan out, I want to do something to benefit myself as a programmer with the free time I will have this summer.  Summer school is not an option, my school is not offering financial aid for summer courses (I have no idea why, all I know is I can't afford it).  Note: The goal is to put something on my resume

Here's some projects I thought could be interesting:
Creating a basic game-
I have very little interest in developing commercial games when I exit college (unless I can work for Valve), but this might be a good exercise to familiarize myself with using different libraries.  I have messed around a little bit with Pygame and SFML already.  This might be more fun, but probably not as productive as the next.

Teaching myself C#/.NET/XNA -
A friend of mine has expressed interest in attempting to develop some apps for Windows Phone 7, which uses C#, .NET and XNA.  I already installed the WP7 SDK and got the free eBook Microsoft provides for developing for Windows Phone 7.  I'm an Android user personally, and have no intention of getting a Windows Phone device, but the languages and .NET could prove to be very valuable to know.

I'm also open to suggestions.  I've considered teaching myself Java and trying to develop for Android, but I'll be taking a Java course in Fall anyway, and figured spending my Summer time on something else is probably better. Thanks in advance."

I was wondering how difficult is it to get into internship for, lets say, facebook or google. Now, the obvious answer, of course, is to simply apply for it directly, but I'm afraid that if the application gets rejected, I won't be able to get a second chance that easy.

For some information : I'm a 2nd year pre-grad CompSci student, with not a particularly good grade average, 3.6 atm (on a 1-5 scale, 1 being fail).

I haven't competed in much programming competitions, and have almost no special achievements in my history. Pretty much best thing i did so far is getting perfect score in this year's google code jam.
I consider myself fluent in Java, and pretty good in C(++). I can dab around with SQL and php.
Also, I've got Cambridge's CPE (certificate of profficiency in english).

Question would be, is it even possible for me to apply, and if yes, will they take the application into consideration. Also, what would anyone suggest that I should learn (language-wise) to improve my chances.
Again, I'm sorry if this doesn't fit here, but it seemed like the best place to ask, and I am sure others could also use the information given by someone experienced in such matters."

Never been before. I will be living in Lincoln Park (edit: near N. Racine)  and half my time there will be commuting to Skokie, and the other half to the south (26th and California). I can take a car, but with gas prices, the distance I have to drive, and the unreliability of my junk car, I would rather just fly and rely on public trans if I can. 

According to Google, my public trans commute to those two areas (to Skokie, hoping a line and then onto a bus; to 26th, two lines) my commute would be around an hour (to 26th) to an hour and fifteen minutes (to Skokie). If I portion off two hours in my day to commute each way, how safe would I be in my estimate? Here in Pittsburgh, it's not unusual for a bus to just skip right past a stop during rush house because of lack of room on onboard. Is that common here? Realistically, how much time should I be adding on to my commutes?"

Well I just sit here and read code, but I either go ""what the hell is going on?"" or ""wait wait let me look up that function in the library/documentation"".

I remember back a few months ago, when i first started dating my girlfriend, all I had to do was think about her and I kissing and BAM, rock hard (she was my first EVERYTHING, including kiss, I'm 20, so that might be why there). That was about 7 months ago.

I did break it off with her recently, not getting into that. However toward the end of the relationship I noticed it getting much more difficult to get as hard as I used to be able to (for instance, on spring break, we had sex twice a day, no problem getting stiff). My erection was very easy to lose, like when getting a condom on, and sometimes it would get about half way. I still had sex with her like this, but I wasn't very happy with my hardness.

Now we have been broken up for about a month (I broke it up with her), and I can't get very hard even watching porn. The thought of just looking at porn and the videos used to get me hard. Now it is a struggle.

The semester is over and so are finals. It is summer time and I start my internship in a few weeks, so I don't see any stress in my life.

h8s10,8,2011-05-11,I am too weak... need advice.,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/h8s10/i_am_too_weak_need_advice/,"I guess I should start off by saying that I am kind of a dorky guy, and just ""broke up"" with my first girlfriend... The thing is, I can't help wanting to be nice to her... and I was wondering if this is normal or if there is something wrong with me, or maybe I am just handling this all wrong.

So we started dating when I was 21. Things started out well at first - I guess that's what they mean by the Honeymoon Period. I trusted her completely... but slowly things deteriorated.

She would argue with my about the silliest things. Things that she knows I am right about, but she would just argue to save face. She would sometimes not speak to me for days and call up ex-boyfriends or friends who had a crush on her during these times. I always end up forgiving her; I guess I am just too soft. But I think that's when I started to develop trust issues.

During winter break 09/10, she went back to China, where she was from. When she saw me after she came back, she told me how much she missed me, how much she realized I am the one she would want to spend her life with. A couple of days later, I found out that she had been talking to her ex back in China, and has been writing him long emails about how much she misses him and how much she loves him. When I confronted her about it, she says the emails meant nothing, that she was just trying to get revenge on him for cheating on her the first time around. I wanted to leave her then... but she got physically sick every time I tried to break up with her, so with her I stayed.

Things were fine for a while... then I found out she has been calling and texting this guy who was interested in her. A LOT. And everytime I asked her about it, she told me there was nothing going on. I asked her to respect my feelings and back off a little, because I did the same for her. She would agree, but never actually carry out her promise.

One day, she just called me and told me that we should be friends because she might have to move back to China one day. She started telling everyone that I was single... but pretended that we were still going out in front of my closest friends. I just went along with it... I didn't want to hurt her feelings... I guess we are not dating, but she doesn't want me to see anyone.

This spring, she was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. She would bring this up every time I tell her about something that bothers me... telling her to leave her alone, cause she has problems. Three weeks ago, she left for another state for an internship... she told me that her phone died a couple days after she reached her destination, and that I shouldn't call and text her (which I used to do daily). I found out today that her phone never died, and that she's been in regular contact with a couple of the guys who she knows are interested in her.

My heart hurts. I don't know what to do. I know for my own sake I should avoid talking to her, at least for a little while. But I do know she loves me (after not seeing me for a couple months, she started crying the second she saw me and wouldn't let go of her hug), and she also has an anxiety problem, and I don't want to stress her out by distancing myself from her.

Sorry for the long post. I guess I just wanted some opinions on what I should do. Also... since she was my first girlfriend, I don't really know if all girls are like this? Am I being too sensitive? Any advice would be welcomed...

The past year, I lived with my 2 siblings. My second year of University is going to be a very different experience specifically because both of my siblings are temporarily leaving for year round internships. I'm essentially going to be in our leased house alone. I've never had to face the challenge of living alone and so after discussing it briefly with my parents they believe it would be helpful for me to have my dog stay over with me for the academic year.

I thought about having my dog live with me and I realised that similar to any situation there are positives and negatives. A positive would obviously be the companionship. However it could create many inconveniences for me, such as having to feed and walk him on a daily basis.

I'm worried about the idea of living alone because I feel that it's already going to be a challenge to be that much of an independent individual so suddenly (to the extent that I have to worry about what food I need to make, paying bills, managing the tough academic workload, having a good social life, exercising) I think that if my dog were to come live with me it would complicate things a lot more for me and generally making everything more difficult.

It's clear that the answer points to a no here, however after being on vacation I realised how much my dog is neglected by my parents. He's fed well but he doesn't get the full exercise and attention that he needs and I get the feeling he's a bit sad and lonely.

On one hand, I'm feeling guilty and want him to live with me because I'd know someone else is present around the house and he's a great companion. On the other hand I can't help but think that it'll become extremely difficult to manage everything and that I won't be able to handle such a complicated lifestyle.

I'd appreciate your advice.

hapv9,3,2011-05-13,4 Year Relationship (2.5 Years LDR) at a Crossroads.  Need Advice...,snkp360,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/hapv9/4_year_relationship_25_years_ldr_at_a_crossroads/,"**Background Info**
* I'm 26 she is 23
* Met while still in college my senior year her freshmen Year (I did the 5 year plan)
* I moved about 4hrs away when I graduated 2.5 years ago for a career
* She just graduated and moved home about 1hr from where I currently live
* In about a month she is moving 8hrs away for an internship for 9 months

**The Story**
Our relationship has been great, but like a typical relationship it has its ups and downs.  We we have done out best to keep things interesting and exciting.  For the first part of the LDR (1yr) things continued on as normal, albeit not seeing each other that frequently due to school/work etc but we managed and made it work. Her senior year she went to study abroad in Europe for a semester and that's when things started to take a turn for the worse.  


She started pulling away from me, not really putting effort into the relationship and what seems to me not really caring about us anymore.  She ended up going abroad when things were still on rocky terms, after a lot of talking and soul searching we worked things out for the better and ended up strengthening our relationship even further, I ended up taking a trip out there for 2 weeks and traveling with her.


After the study abroad our relationship was amazing, I was going to propose in July, up until the past couple of months when she started pulling away and not putting effort in the relationship again.  I think a lot of this was due to her being overworked in school/trying to graduate/work commitments coupled with me not physically being in the same town as her.  This put the mentality in her that ""oh hes not here so I don't have to worry about it"".


To summarize the last 5 months we fought constantly and she was always angry or frustrated at something, leading to awkward and angry conversations between us most of the time.  I did my best to support her/be there for her/love her but never really got reciprocation.  When we would see each other on the weekends we could, things were good and we had fun.  But every other time is was frustrating and hard.


About 3 months ago it got to the point where we decided we needed a short 'break' (I know a bad idea) to re-evaluate our relationship and how we feel about each other.  I took it seriously, thought a lot about it and came to the conclusion that I still did want to be with her, but that we needed to make changes in our relationship, really putting in effort because lets face it, LDR's are hard.


We got back together and I was putting everything I had into making this work, she was moved back home now so it was a lot easier to get together, but still wasn't seeing any effort from her in the relationship, no kissing/hugging/intimacy since before the break.


I come to find out she really didn't do much thinking and didn't take it seriously because she ""knew she was going to see me and talk to me after the break"".  She also went out on a date with a guy friend of hers that has been hitting on her and they kissed.  I know we set ground rules about etiquette during the break and it was basically do what you want, but still it really got to me.


About 2 weeks ago I ended the relationship because I just couldn't take anymore. A great analogy someone told me is it was like running into a brick wall constantly, you can only do it so much.  After the breakup I drove to her house to pick up some stuff, she broke down crying and apologized for everything, saying she was sorry for taking me for granted, how she treated me and how she acted.


I still care for her and would do anything for her but I just don't know how I feel.  We are currently talking and trying to figure out how we feel about each other and the relationship, I know she wants it to continue but I am utterly confused. I am worried that the fact that she is leaving again in a month will restart the cycle of her pulling away from me and not caring about the relationship.


I am not looking for a direct answer or exactly what to do, because I know only I can make that decision.  But any advice /r/relationships has to offer would be greatly appreciated.


**TL;DR.** Girl of 4 year relationship, 2 years LDR has pulled away from me in the past and did it again.  We broke up and she wants me back.  I still care for her and want to work it out, but still have apprehensions because she is leaving again for 9 months.

hanql,1,2011-05-13,I got a graphic design job less than 1 month after graduation. Just wanted to share the news / what I learned about job hunting. AMA,[deleted],IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/hanql/i_got_a_graphic_design_job_less_than_1_month/,"There's so much job seeking / unemployment talk everyday that I thought I could shed some light and give some good ideas. I'm 22, renting in Florida, and just finished a BA in Art with a Graphic Design minor. I had 2 graphic design jobs in the past 4 years totaling 10 months of employment plus 6 months of retail work. Because of my spotty work history I had no positive job references, no connections, and filling out the employment history section was always a pain. I'm not even that good of a graphic designer. There are about 10 brochures/mailers/posters I actually feel like showing.

So with all that out of the way, here's what I did. Before I graduated, I revised my resume and made 2 different copies. 1 is for applying to art and the other is for graphic design such that the art resume listed galery shows and materials used while the graphics one listed design jobs and freelance work with long descriptions of duties. I used online job searches and applied to those despite not meeting all requirements. Those are generally a waste of time unless you are over-qualified and it can be just like throwing paper into the wind. You have to go out on foot. I drove to a copy placer and had 20 copies of each resume printed on decent paper for about $7 total. I used Google maps and searched for art or design places in a nearby area. I drove to each of these places, walked into the office, and asked to speak with someone about ""employment opportunities."" I got to speak with someone almost every time and even if they weren't looking, they still gave me advice and kept my resume. There is always something to gain from talking to someone whether or not you get a job. Before you leave, make sure you get their contact info and when you finally get home, send them an email or a letter thanking them for whatever. Applications are a waste of time. If you know your application won't say much, try to find smaller places or get as far as you can without having to fill out any long forms.

So it turns out the place I now work is attached to place that printed my resume. I walked in there and only one person (out of 6) was in the office. I asked her about hiring and she said they were thinking of an intern or something as they economy has turned up a bit and they have extra work. I showed her a printed portfolio (bring something physical with you along with a resume to demonstrate your skill) and gave the resume since she said she would show it to her boss. Despite me being a bumbling idiot that day and knocking over a stack of business cards, I went home and sent her a thank you email that also worked as a cover letter. I told her I had looked at their site and I liked their stuff and I attached a digital copy of some more of my work. The great thing about follow-up emails is that a place can easily lose your resume, and that email is easily forwarded to management. I found out later that I made a strong enough impression on the woman I spoke with that he was kind of advocating for me.

But it's not done yet. I got an email from the boss asking to interview, so I said yes to any time she would like and brought the printed work from before along with another resume copy. I learned the most I've ever known about interviews during this interview. It was nothing hard or grilling. When interviewing, the interview has nothing to do with you. It's not about what you have done or who you are. It's about what they want and it's about talking. You are not representing yourself, you are just talking. Do not think of it as drawing from the limited bank of knowledge including your past and your skills. You are actually speaking from an infinite amount of possibilities aided by your previous knowledge. If they ask you a question, yes or no should never be the end of your response. Every answer you give should be a longer demonstration of what you could be for them. If they ask you what you know about a topic, you must say far more about that topic. For example, if you are asked ""What do you know about compressing JPG images without losing quality?"" You tell them all about JPGs and then about GIFs and PNGs and TIFFs. It's also important to ask them questions. Be inquisitive. There's probably some questions you honestly would like to have answers to but you're too nervous to think about. If you just start asking, those questions will come to you and you will become more confident in your position. At some point, ask if you can take a tour of the workplace. This gives you another chance to see what they work with and to say for yourself that you can do what they do or that you could improve something. If there is a boss above who you interviewed with, ask to meet that person or see if you can come back when they are available. When you go home, send another thank you.

I was always hearing about people getting jobs with luck, and it discouraged me. But that's what job hunting is, you are looking for that luck. The job you will get is most likely not listed anywhere, it's just an idea being tossed around an office. Sorting for candidates and posting jobs is a chore for employers, so if you can find them before they have to go through that, you have a much higher chance of getting hired.

Hopefully my info can help someone. I'll be moving around a lot today so I'll answer questions sporadically. I cannot give referrals and I do not know of any openings anywhere."

I am graduating essentially a year early. I began college in the fall of 2008, so under normal circumstances I would be graduating in the spring of 2012. However, due to college in high school credits I am able to graduate this summer and have chosen to do so due to the financial benefits; plus, I'm so sick of school.

I'm graduating from an accredited university (choosing not to say which) with a BS in Information Sciences and a minor in Supply Chain Management. I was the treasurer and webmaster of my college's honor society for the past year, a member of the honor society for 2 years, involved in multiple other honor societies and clubs/organizations, I have an overall GPA of 3.8/4.0 and an in major GPA of 3.91/4.0, I have had two summer internships (one at a small local company, another at a major corporation), have a strong resume IMO, and an online portfolio. In addition to my degree I have experience with various computer programming languages, some more experienced than others.

I have applied to over 70 companies ranging from a local company that has less than 50 employees in the IT help desk position to developing/design positions at Apple and Google to entry level new graduate programs at various corporations including Microsoft and Google. There are many small companies and many large that I have applied to.

I haven't heard from anyone except for being denied by a new graduate position at NASA.

I know the economy is down and there is a lack of jobs, especially for inexperienced new graduates; but I know a lot of people that have received jobs ranging from their local high schools to HP and Google. I know I'm not perfect and dislike bragging, but these few friends that have landed these jobs do not have anywhere near the writing, communication, verbal, and computer skills that I do; yet they're getting jobs. I know some people in the same boat as me and some who have just taken jobs in retail at GameStop and some driving for FedEx.

But what is the deal? Any advice?

Not sure if this is relevant, but I am a white male living in the US.

**EDIT: If I said specifically local companies instead of small, I didn't mean I've only applied to big companies and local companies. I've applied to a range of companies all over including DC, Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Boston, New York, Chicago, Raleigh, San Francisco, San Jose, and Atlanta (may be forgetting some). I've applied to local companies, too.**"

Hopefully my info can help someone. I'll be moving around a lot today so I'll answer questions sporadically. I cannot give referrals and I do not know of any openings anywhere.

I don't know how much I can really shed some light on the subject, but I was involved with the many employees who work at the GE Tax Dept.

From 2008-2009, I worked in the GE Tax Department as a 1-year state tax intern.  My responsibilities were to create state tax returns and annual reports for the GE Energy entities.  During my internship, I created over 600 state tax returns for various entities.  I was also in charge of filling out quarterly estimates and extensions.

I have worked with various state and federal tax employees there.  I will try to answer any question to the best of my knowledge."

It's an excellent job with decent pay and some nice perks, and I'm doing exactly what I've always wanted to do--work on a large scale web application at an internet startup.  

That being said, however, I have this feeling that if I continue doing what I'm doing I won't get a degree and I'll be stuck here.  It would be difficult with my job to go to school while working as it's a fairly demanding job.

I really wish I could fast-forward to 10 years from now when it will be really obvious which path I should take.  Has anyone else been in a similar situation?  Are you glad you got your degree or was it a gigantic waste of time and money?"

I just got hired for an internship in SD for the summer and I need a place to live.

I am a 21 year old college student studying Computer Information Systems. I currently live in Wisconsin so moving to CA will be a big change. I like to experience new things/people so I'm always down for an adventure.

A typical night for me is smokin some 420, drinkin a beer or two, surfing reddit/netflix and having some good conversation with friends.

If you want more details just PM me and I would be happy to provide references, FB etc."

Basically I thought this was being in charge/looking over systems and keeping them up to date or setting them up and such, but a lot of my courses are in programming. I picked it because I thought it was supposed to make a lot of money, and that kind of work would be easy for me I think. I am also really good at troubleshooting/repairing computers, but I didn't see an obvious or GOOD major for that. If there was something relevant, I don't think they make a lot of money (do they?)

Nobody I've talked to has any idea what this is, and the people at my college are very stereotypically awkward to talk to as the computer guys. Or they're really bitchy and I can't really ask them. Or I can't understand their accent. 

I haven't been able to get a job. I've been looking for an internship to try anything with computers like I wanted, but I haven't been able to get anything. Not even this summer. So when I graduate and finally see what it's like, I might not even like it.

It sucks being at home without a job again. I want to find a job so I can get my own place; my family goes to bed really early so I can never really have friends over. And if you want to meet people, you can't just invite yourself over to their house really.

I first of all don't want to, but I'm considering getting some entry level high school job. Maybe coffee or something like that (I don't even know what, and it's such a hassle to find a list of what people want to hire. And even then, it's all spam or babysitter jobs which I wont do.) Even with that though, I don't know if I'd even get enough hours to pay for a place. But even worse, I feel like I should be spending my time looking for a job relevant to what I'll be doing and if I get a high school job, I imagine I wont have the motivation to look for anything anyways. I kind of doubt I'll find a job like my maor though.

Anyone have any thoughts or advice? About the job situation, or if you know what MCS is/does? I've been looking for these answers for a while. None of my friends have any advice, they're in completely unrelated majors and jobs and have internships doing stuff they expected and such. "
hbnka,5,2011-05-14,How can I get a job in the industry I want?  I graduated from a state university 2 years ago to this weekend and still haven't had a true whiff of what I've been wanting to do.,volshans,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/hbnka/how_can_i_get_a_job_in_the_industry_i_want_i/,"I graduated Northern Illinois University in May of 2009, with a B.A. in Anthropology and a certificate in GIS.  It must have been awesome to have had a job lined up after graduation but as most people graduating large public schools knew, the cards were not in anyone's hands despite their good fortune.

I played my earlier decks well, almost accidentally, by not knowing how college worked after HS.  They passed some paper around the last few months of graduation asking where graduates were going to attend for college.  I'd not even considered the option seriously so I chose the county's community college.  I lived a grand two years, taking courses that made my mind whet and learned to live solo/progressively as best as I could.  I figured out how degrees work, how being vegan was no bueno, how raccoons scare the shit out of me when mountain biking solo at night and what treasures Appalachia hold for someone raised in the Midwest by Soviet Jewish parents.

When I graduated with honors there, I moved on to obtaining my Bachelor's at NIU.  I spent two years making intense connections with friends, dating a Japanese woman whom my family accepted as one of our own (hard to do with any gentiles ;)) and busting my ass to become happy with my dreams.  I started clubs, took over others and kept fit while learning to appreciate craft beers on the regular.  I didn't bother going to my graduation ceremony - I just wanted to get the hell out of DeKalb.  I was looking forward to utilizing what I learned there to better our society - that aloof college mantra.

Upon the final months of graduation, I dove deep into the Peace Corps process and passed through my interview process swimmingly.  But  I was disappointed in the placement so I abandoned the plans before undergoing the extended medical review.  Afterwards, I interned at a farm in central northern IL but ultimately never stayed the commitment because of factors out of my control.  I really wanted to farm, sustainably, but the winds blew me elsewhere at the time.

For a year, I worked a dead-end delivery job for my family's auto parts warehouse.  I begrudgingly watched the business fail as the economy fucked all of the service industry around us but especially the mechanics.  Laborers whose 10,15,20 year old shops went under because floating in the black was just too difficult.

Finally, after a year of dissatisfaction, I stumbled upon an internship for the North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources, Office of State Archaeology.  A glimmer of hope for me as I finally could showcase my ability to apply GIS to a needed function - digital transition to marking future dig sites.  I spent a vivid 2 months there, hoping that the unpaid internship would yield a future position with the department.  But a frozen State hiring landscape coupled with my inexperience left me option-less again.  I returned to IL once again, defeated but eager for more of what I had tasted.  I met a girl pre-trip who I'd begin dating but knowing the context of how I'd find nothing for me in IL, we'd expected a breakup when I'd somehow move away.

And so I did, move, almost instantly.  My step-brother wanted his work vehicle transported to AZ.  When he offered me work, both with him and a restaurant, I jumped at the opportunity.  I packed my seven-thousand base layers, climbing gear, track bike and will with me and drove across the US to crash at his place until I could find residence.  It took me less than a week to meet my current roommate who would be training with me for the tequila bar we'd both be working at.  I left my job with my step-brother and became a barback from busser at the bar.  The money's decent and tides me over for rent, ROTH IRA contributions and beans and rice.

But it's 2011.  May, 2011, for those still here with me.  I've been applying to GIS Technician jobs for these two years. I've submitted my package to two boards with the USAF now, results in September.  I've done nearly an internship a year since I started college and an Archaeological field school.

I'm at wit's end.  I pulled up a guide to learning Python because I'm tired of waiting for something to happen.  I've sent my info towards Teach For America because I didn't know the deadline for applying already passed.  I'm reluctant to study for the GRE because Grad School just seems like more debt to put on at this point and not means to an end right now.

I've got good amounts of cash saved. I've bought a car in cash.  I broke up with that previously mentioned girlfriend weeks ago and have been living solo for all of May now.

What am I doing wrong?  Why wont they take me?  I'm capable and eager to grow within a company.  Who keeps taking my opportunities away from me?"
hbmvr,0,2011-05-14,"Reddit, what was your greatest celebrity encounter?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/hbmvr/reddit_what_was_your_greatest_celebrity_encounter/,"I know there have been threads like this before, but I really like reading these stories. I have a pretty good one, so here it is (xposted from another thread).

The greatest encounter I've had was on a trip with my high school's ""Political Science Club"" (which I formed) to Washington, D.C. We had talked about a trip to DC throughout the year, but it was always us saying ""Who wants to go to DC?"" half-jokingly. So, we started fundraising to go and we soon realized we'd have enough money to go, so we booked a party bus for April 29, 2010. Now, earlier that year we had met a graduate of our school who was working relatively high up in the White House, so we decided what the heck, let's see if we can contact them and get a tour of the White House. We called three weeks before the trip and didn't hear back until the night before the trip. They needed all our Social Security numbers, but we couldn't get in contact with all the members of the club so we just told them ""looks like we can't do it.""

So, we left our school at 4:30AM and began our trip to Washington, D.C. About two hours into the trip, we got a call from a secretary of the person we knew asking if we had the SS numbers, which we did. We gave them to her and she said she'd see if we'd be able to get in. A half-hour out of D.C. we get a call saying we're getting a tour of the White House. We were all happy. I remember someone saying ""What if we see Obama,"" to which another member replied ""We have a better chance of seeing John Kennedy.""

Before the White House tour, we went to the Newseum (had already bought the tickets). It's a pretty cool place, but we were only there for about 15 minutes. It turns out Oprah was doing a live taping and had a correspondent in the Newseum for her No Phone Zone thing. There was a huge crowd, and for a brief period we all thought Oprah was there. She wasn't, and the crowd that had gathered really started getting in the way, especially since we were trying to get in and out. 

We got dropped off in front of the entrance to the White House where we met a White House intern that had been sent for us. She took us to the front of the line, which was pretty awesome. She also served as our tour guide, because strangely enough the White House tour is normally self guided. Before we went into the White House, the secretary told me and my friend ""I don't think I'm supposed to tell you this, but you're in for a surprise. Marine One is taking off at noon and we're going to put you on the South Lawn to watch it."" 

Wow. We didn't even know what to think. In fact, we were so out of it we actually asked the nice lady ""will the President be getting on it,"" to which she replied ""Yeah, it's his helicopter."" So of course we didn't listen to a word of the tour because we were anticipating watching the President take off in the helicopter. We met with the person who made this all possible, and they took us back to where we had began. We were briefed by Secret Service and the director of the White House tours as to what to expect and what to do in the event of an emergency. I remember the Secret Service telling us ""If there's gunfire, do not run. Duck and walk back here. This is your safe zone. Do. Not. Run."" That was probably one of the most terrifying things I've ever heard.

We were let [out onto the South Lawn](http://i.imgur.com/QgpIQ.jpg) 5 minutes before any other tourists because of our connection, and gathered in front of a rope line. I was surprised by the lack of security; all that separated us from where the president was walking was a thin rope. I'm aware if any of us crossed that rope at any time, we'd either be shot or tackled immediately, but it was surprising nonetheless. It felt so strange being so close to the [back of the White House](http://i.imgur.com/odGDC.jpg). 

Across from us was [the press pool](http://i.imgur.com/2nrDv.jpg). It seemed like an endless line of cameras. I was surprised by the amount of press there to film him walking from the White House to the helicopter, but I realized if anything had happened, they'd all want the footage of it. 

After what had seemed like an eternity, the [helicopter appeared](http://imgur.com/vOshE.jpg) out of no where. Then we waited for another lifetime, when suddenly the President [emerged from the back door](http://imgur.com/6EEnJ). As he was walking, I shouted ""President Obama"" as if he would hear me shouting and walk over. Then, as he was walking, he [saw the staffer](http://i.imgur.com/4Oprb.jpg) who got us there, recognized them, and walked over to ask why they were out here. The staffer explained the situation, so President Obama walked the rope shaking our hands. RIGHT BEFORE HE GOT TO ME, HE WAVED AND WALKED AWAY.

Well, he did. And he shook my hand (proven by [this glorious photo](http://i.imgur.com/a3ziF.jpg) of him turning back)

That was the best encounter, because of both the odds of it happening and the fact it was the President. Here's a [video I took of it all](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHi1_GP8fYE) and here's [a photo of me taking the video](http://i.imgur.com/cMrCm.jpg) and him shaking my friends hand.

hcv1i,1,2011-05-16,This guy I met on an internship is LITERALLY a 5 year old obsessed with poop,[deleted],funny,https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/hcv1i/this_guy_i_met_on_an_internship_is_literally_a_5/,"Not biologically, but mentally.

I'm a senior in college. Last summer I did a 6 month internship at a large, multinational company. I met this guy there who goes also goes to my school and was on an internship at the same place. Now let me start by saying this kid is 22 years old. I took him out for his 21st birthday. However I'm thoroughly convinced that mentally he's mentally a five year old.

Basically all he does is play video games. One of those kids. Except he doesn't even play intelligent games, he sits around all day playing his Wii. He once told me that he had stayed up until 5AM all week (while we were working) playing Carnival Games for the Wii. Or Mario Party on the Wii, with the baby minigames. That's the kind of games he plays all day.

While I was on my internship, he literally brought a backpack full of games to work with him every day. Tic-Tac-Toe, Checkers, connect four, simon says, stuff a 5 year old would enjoy playing. He literally had a backpack full of games like this on him at all times. We would play them at lunch sometimes, which was cool. I asked him if he could bring something like Chess or Uno (you know, something that takes more than the mental capacity of a 5 year old to play). Instead, he started bringing Mad Libs.

Now, this was all good and fun, for the first couple weeks at work. We would hang out at lunch and play games or pool. I would try to crack jokes, but they would always go over his head.

Him: ""Hey want to play doodie-ull?""
Me: ""What?""
Him: ""Doodie-ull. See, I took the word pool, and replaced 'poo' with 'doodie', HAHAHA!"" (laughs really loud and obnoxiously)
Me: ""...""

About the extent of his sense of humor.

And the fucking Mad Libs. We did a couple in the first couple weeks, each of us filling in the blanks with poop/gross related things. You know, like you do when you're 5. It's fun once in awhile. He could not keep his shit on the downlow though. He would always read these Mad Libs REALLY loud in the cafeteria, and laugh really loud and obnoxiously at them. While my coworkers were sitting nearby. Even after I would tell him to shut the fuck up, he wouldn't get the picture. After I quickly stopped participating in the mad libs, he would fill them out by himself, and then still read them out. LOUDLY. and laugh. really loudly and obnoxiously. Many times I just stood up and left in the middle of lunch it would get so out of hand. Once he literally sat there and read poop related mad libs out loud while the President and VP of this large, multinational company walked around and talked with people in the lunchroom. They didn't go anywhere near the table he was sitting at.

I thought it was obvious that you shouldn't act like that during lunch WHILE AT WORK. Aren't we trying to make a good impression here? This guy is 22 fucking years old. I figured he would have at least a cursory understanding of what's appropriate socially. I was dead wrong.

And it didn't start out that bad. He would just throw a doodie reference in there every once in awhile and we'd laugh. Eventually, over several months, it got way out of hand to what you see above. It was a gradual process. Saying stuff like:

""dude, keep it down""
""People are looking at us""
""Don't fucking shout""
""Dude, what is your fucking problem? Stop yelling about shit at the top of your lungs. This is supposed to be a professional environment.""

had no effect.

At first, I thought this kid was just a really good IRL troll. Because after all, who doesn't like a poop or fart joke once in awhile? But no, after knowing him for almost a year, I know that it's for real, and literally nothing else goes through that kids head. I would tell him this, sometimes rudely, daily. At first, we would talk about games, tv, music, etc, but he would ALWAYS degrade the conversation to poop, farts, and doodies. Every time. As time went on, there was less and less time spent talking about normal shit before he would start talking about doodies and laughing obnoxiously to himself.

Then the text messages started.

After I made it very clear to him that talking about that shit ALL THE FUCKING TIME, especially that obnoxiously at work, was not cool and he should shut up, he started sending me doodie text messages. Up to 5 or 6 a day. I would never respond or acknowledge them. Seriously, look at this:

Note, I went through 3 phones over that internship, so these are just some of the messages on the phone I currently have. They started about a month before that and continued across all 3 phones.

In 6 months, I responded ONCE to these messages. Here it is for reference:

http://imageshack.us/m/853/9049/snap20110415115756.png

Now again, I would get 5-6 of these per day, every day, AND NEVER EVER RESPOND. And he'd keep sending them. Eventually I blocked his number though my cell provider. No more messages. Until like 3 months later when I saw him in passing at school. I later got this from him on facebook:

http://imageshack.us/m/233/8835/74551698.png

Yes, he actually called me ""Charmander"". He refused to call me anything else.

I didn't get any texts though. Until a couple weeks ago when I got another one. Promptly sent him this (green message):

http://imageshack.us/m/577/3379/snap20110415115840.png

A few days later I get this:

http://imageshack.us/m/42/1529/snap20110415115845.png

Yes, after I blocked his phone number and told him, he used one of those web-based text message services to send me that.

Again, if I didn't know this kid personally, I would think he was the best, most devoted troll of all time. But no, this is literally who he is. This is literally all he thinks about and all that goes through his head.

A couple week ago I got this:

http://img694.imageshack.us/img694/2694/snap20110501214605.png

Then I got on facebook and messaged him and told him he has no life.

----------

Anyway, how can I fuck with him? Despite the fact that sending me this shit over 8 months after I told him not to legally constitutes harassment, I considered outing him publicly on facebook, but he blocked me from seeing or posting on his wall.  I'm still FB friends with him, but can't view any aspect of his profile at all.

----------

Anyway, I posted this on another message board I go to a couple weeks ago and people got a kick out of it.  I figure people here would too."
hctf0,1,2011-05-16,Family is in extreme debt. I need a student loan/grant/scholarship/whatever to help fund my dream internship and final year of college. What can I do?,[deleted],Assistance,https://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/hctf0/family_is_in_extreme_debt_i_need_a_student/,"Hi Reddit. I'm a 20 year old art student in Philadelphia. I've got myself a kickass (but non-paying) internship at Marvel Entertainment in NY and one more year left of college. I'm currently living in a beautiful and super cheap apartment in Philly that I'd love to keep, but I'm having some trouble. Moving back home is not really an option at this point.

I have kept somewhat good grades (A's and B's) and they'd definitely be higher if I wasn't working so much. I currently work as a freelance web designer with odd but regular jobs on the side. I also take a lot of free and underpaid jobs, just to get my name out there. I work really hard. I have the biggest dreams for myself and my work.

Today my family called to ask me for a pretty ridiculous sum of money to help them pay their mortgage. They're in a great deal of debt and living with them, is living in a very unstable and stressful environment. They've got two other children to put through college, so asking them to cosign a loan is impossible. I know this. I've got no extended family to ask to be a cosigner, as our family was basically disowned.

I'm just asking for a stress free summer and senior year, so that I can focus on my work and make the most of my internship. I have been working really, REALLY hard this far and I'm reaching my breaking point. 

And yes, I've gone to financial aid on several occasions and it sounds like they can't offer us any more. 

What options do I have left?"

My uncle who is going through a messy divorce asked me to come work for him this summer in the Arkansas Ozarks. I went down there for a week and realized that I would be working all day without getting paid pretty much at all.

Fuck that.

hciw5,1,2011-05-16,"I'm subletting with friends this summer, but they don't want to split the rooms evenly. Help!",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/hciw5/im_subletting_with_friends_this_summer_but_they/,"I thought I'd get a couple opinions on this one, so let's give it a go.

About a month ago, me and two friends decided that we would get a place for the summer, since we would all be in the same city doing undergraduate research with our school.

After two near confirmations on Craiglist, which led to two failures (you wouldn't believe how fast sublets get taken), we finally were able to submit a sublet form and confirm our housing with a nice three-bedroom apartment.

Now the backstory is that I've done about 90% of the work, emailing, calling, and checking out every single apartment we were interested in. Besides talking about the places over email or occasionally coming along with me to check out the place, I've been handling most of the conversations with potentials. We were originally going to be finding a three-bedroom and split it evenly three ways, utilities and all.

Now flash forward to the place we have now, and the people we're renting from have the bedrooms priced differently. We're supposed to pay each person separately as well. They're priced at about 750, 800, and 850 per month, for two and a half months.

Roommate B is automatically assigned the 800 room. He'll be staying for a couple extra days since Roommate A and I have early return housing to campus, and the 800 room is the only one open for a couple days extra.

Now Roommate A takes the 750 room. I let him choose that room, since he's been complaining he might not be able to get a paid research position this summer and thus siphoning his summer funds off his parents to pay for his part of the sublet. 

Now this leads to me to take the 850 room, obviously the largest room (but not by much). Disgruntled as I was at the time, I chose not to complain because - hey, what's a $250 difference (between the 750 and the 850 for 2.5 months) between poor college students? So we signed the contracts and confirmed out housing for the summer.

But obviously I wouldn't be here asking this question is $250 is a lot for someone like me. My parents can't afford to pay for any part of my summer costs, so I'm thankful I'm getting paid a couple thousand for the summer. Honestly, $250 can practically buy me groceries for several weeks here. 

So I approached my friends about this but obviously they seemed content to pay less than me and are basically saying no. Every time I approach the subject, Roommate A complains he's not getting paid and that splitting things between us evenly and then paying off the people we're subletting is too much of a roundabout way to do things. Roommate B does his best to do as little work as possible as well as shirk the question every time.

I've done pretty much all the work in finding the apartment, and I don't want to stir up trouble too much because money shouldn't have to get between friends. But when Roommate A said, ""In the real world, people don't give a shit about how much you work. You think Google interns get as much as the Google CEO?"" I was very much tempted to hold his head underwater for a couple minutes. (god I hope none of them read this).

I guess my mistake was in letting Roommate A choose which room he wanted instead of me jumping on the cheapest one, but he kept complaining about price and so I let it go and I hate being confrontation anyhow. And everytime I approach the situation, he tries to deflect it by saying we should be both be going after Roommate B for doing even less work and being less responsive. 

We'll still be splitting everything else evenly like utilities, but it pains me to have done all the work in acquiring the apartment, only to be paying the most out of my friends. I'm lost how to approach this now since it seems both my friends don't want to back down.

(sorry for the long post, but you have to read it to understand the whole story properly)

Do you think this is fair, and if not, what should I do!? This is stressing me out a lot actually, especially since they're both friends who just happen to piss me off at the moment.

TL;DR My roommates are paying less than me because of differently priced rooms, but I did most of the work and somehow got stuck with the most expensive one.

EDIT
Originally before signing the contracts, I talked to them about splitting it evenly, and they pretty called me out on making it more expensive for them so I backed down (""yes"" to anything you'll say about this part. I was retarded)

Techinically, Roommate B is making about three times what I am paying, and I'm making just enough to pay for sublet and food for the summer. 

So far I guess the consensus is that I was dumb and did it to myself. I wish I knew that I was going to be making tons of money down the road and looking back it wasn't going to matter, but architect majors end up poor D: Ah well... thanks for the advice everyone."
hccnt,4,2011-05-16,Losing weight and getting fit while constantly on the road?,gtslow,loseit,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/hccnt/losing_weight_and_getting_fit_while_constantly_on/,"I am wondering if anyone out there in /r/loseit are in the same boat I am.  I am most likely taking a consulting position where I will be on the road most of the time.  This will usually be Sunday-Friday gigs and I will be doing them 2-3 weeks out of the month on the norm.

I have lost 26 pounds from my peak which I put on starting during my internship during school and continuing through my current position.  I attribute my 268 pound peak to a combination of sloth and poor diet choices. 

I lost the 26 pounds through diet control mostly but I have also put on a lot of muscle through weight training.  Currently I am strictly doing 5x5 routine 3 days a week and starting to get my diet under control again after my wife and I recently had our first son.

I recently had my first take of life on the road, and although rewarding from a career perspective I found it hard to control what I was eating like before and getting to the gym was more than a challenge.  Breakfast was easy since I had oatmeal from the hotel's continental breakfast.

I will be working with co-workers at client sites for the next few weeks, but after that I will be flying solo.  

My thought on fitness was to buy a set of resistance bands and start doing p90x instead of my 5x5 routine when I am on the road.  If there is a suitable gym available I will do SL5x5, but most hotel gyms don't have free weights.  I absolutely abhor running and I think I am still a bit too heavy to do any sort of distance jogging for fear of hurting my knees.  Currently I weight 243.  Recent low before my son was born was 237.   

For diet I had a couple of ideas.  If the hotel room includes a small kitchen, I could always buy groceries and cook for myself.  I could make a single grocery shopping trip when I fly in.  If I am eating out I could pretty much stick to lean protein or something like subway.  If I eat mainstream fast food it is pretty easy to track calories albeit not at all healthy.

Do you guys have any thoughts?

TL/DR:  Taking job where I will be on the road.  Any ideas for workout/diet to continue losing weight?"

Last summer, I was going through a lot of family problems. It was a lot for me to handle. I met a really great guy, and he wanted me to date him. I was not in a good place mentally to date someone seriously. At first I tried. We kept scheduling dates, and something would happen and I'd have to cancel. We spent more time emailing, texting, and talking on the phone than in person. He was understanding about everything and tried to be my friend, but in the end he said it wasn't enough. We stopped talking in January because he wanted more than I could give him at the time. He told me that whenever I felt ready to date, to let him know. He didn't want to turn his back on what we could have. 

Since then, I've been going to a therapist and getting help. My family problems are getting better. I finally feel like I am in a good place mentally. I want to contact him and see what happens. The problem is that I am about to leave for the summer for an internship. I am going to be on another continent until August. So should I contact him now? Or wait until I get back in August?

I feel so antsy about contacting him. I want to talk to him because I miss him so much. But I don't think it's fair to contact him when I won't be around for a while.

(Or making a move for that matter),[deleted],IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/hcb9i/iama_guy_who_is_terrified_of_asking_girls_out_or/,"I've been like this for as long as I can remember. Most recently, there is a girl who I would REALLY like to ask out but I just can't get myself to do it. She bought me Starcraft II for my birthday, a $60 computer game, and I still don't have the courage to do it. Here is a picture of it and the card she made for me http://i.imgur.com/yeRFf.jpg. (I posted this picture about a month ago to pics and nearly all the comments pressed me to make a move on her, to no avail though).


I don't know if there's a phobia or a term for this, but my fear of rejection is what keeps me from doing anything. In my mindset, I'd rather nothing happen than be rejected. I guess this can apply for other things too in my life, like I never try out for sports teams because I just assume I wouldn't be able to make it.


Experiences with this problem I can recall from elementary school; in 4th grade I wanted to ask a girl out so I made her a valentine card. I couldn't give it to her myself though so my rowdy friend had to practically steal it from me and give it to her. I wasn't there for it but he later told me she said it was against her religion to do it or something like that.

In 5th grade, a girl I liked more than a lot was practically best friends with me the entire year. Her friends even yelled at me for not asking her out and soon the year ended and it was too late because I wouldn't see this girl ever again throughout middle school and high school. She surprisingly goes to my college now and we smile and wave whenever we see each other.


The only time I've ever asked out girls has been on the internet, and once through a text to a girl who lived on the other coast of the country from me and I had only ever been with her during an internship. She accepted but we ended up never seeing each other again so we broke it off.


I'm not sure if anyone even has anything to ask me but I just really needed to get this off my chest somewhere. Who knows, maybe this will give me a chance to get kicked into shape."

**polyparadigm:** One granted patent and a few pending regarding ceramic processing, and another pending involving micro-miniaturized vacuum tubes. The latter is a little more interesting: hot filaments are a terrible idea as you get smaller, but if you get small enough, field emission becomes the easy way to get electrons out into the vacuum anyhow. At some small length scale, vacuum becomes (arguably) the reasonable choice again."

A bit about Masters: ideally, I want to do something interdisciplinary &amp; contributive, like Development Engineering (scoped courses in Tokyo, Netherlands) or Engineering &amp; Public Policy (scoped in CMU USA and CEU Hungary among others).

I do enjoy .NET, but want to get my feet wet with something else.

I have played around with very basic PHP, but I want to do something more advanced. I have looked into CakePHP, but I don't know if that's a good way to go or not.

hd6ec,0,2011-05-17,Second abortion 2 weeks ago today. Then cheated on my boyfriend. Not able to cope. What do I do?,stuff_and_stuff,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/hd6ec/second_abortion_2_weeks_ago_today_then_cheated_on/,"Hey Reddit,

I wrote the title to this post and felt like a monster, but there's no other way of putting it: it's what happened. I'm posting this to try and explain myself and get some help.

I had an abortion two weeks ago today. It was my second--I had the first one about two years ago and still think about it almost every day. 

When I told my boyfriend I was pregnant, it was 2 in the morning, raining, outside his apartment. He got really angry. 

His initial response was ""No"" and after we talked about it for a little while longer, I told him that I was thinking about ending the pregnancy. He agreed and told me that we were in it together but he needed some space to think and so I went home in a cab. The next morning I made an appointment at Planned Parenthood to get a medical abortion. 

Over the course of the week I moved between feeling complete despair and numbness, which had not so much to do with socio-cultural stigma or my even wanting to have a baby, but more this feeling that I'd really, really, really fucked up everything.

Medical abortion works like this: you take a pill at the clinic that kills the fetus, then you take another pill 24 hours later that makes your uterus eject everything. Lots of blood, severe cramping, lots of throwing up, for pretty much a full day. 

He went with me to the appointment, held me in the waiting room, took a nap with me when we got home. Then, he came over the next day and held me through most of the graphic, awful parts. And the next morning, I woke up and I could smile and feel okay because he was still next to me.

But over the next week, I went back to feeling numb or full of despair. We didn't really talk about what'd happened, I think because neither of us really knew how to. I guess I seemed outwardly fine, or that's what he told me.

Then, my ex-boyfriend visited me and my roommate. He'd been good friends with my roommate throughout college and we'd been on good, platonic terms for several months after not speaking to each other for four years. Anyway, long story short, we took a lot of xanax and drank a lot and then I cheated on my boyfriend.

Then, I ignored my boyfriend's phone calls for 2 days, lied to him, and kept taking xanax. Eventually, he came to my house and I admitted what had happened and everything fell apart.

It's been another week and I feel bereft and lost. I know that it's my fault--the relationship and the abortion, and that I have no right to ask for anyone's pity, especially not his, but I don't know how to cope with how I feel. I've let my job and internship slide, I'm broke, and no one but him really knows what happened. I feel like I need him and his support really badly in order to heal from this but I have no right to ask him for that.

Reddit, has anything like this happened in your life? What am I supposed to do now?"
hd69n,3,2011-05-17,I had sex with my ex and I really want to tell her current boyfriend,[deleted],relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hd69n/i_had_sex_with_my_ex_and_i_really_want_to_tell/,"Hi my ex girlfriend and I broke up over Christmas break because it was obvious that something was going on between her and some other guy (I had moved in the fall for graduate school). I thought we were in love she stayed with my family over Thanksgiving and I was suppose to stay with her's for Christmas. We were pretty serious to say the least I had plans to propose this Summer.

So, now she has an internship in my city for the summer.

She came over to my place several times last week and we eventually hooked up. When we were hanging out the next night I found out she had cheated on her current boyfriend(the guy who she ended it with me for) with someone else as well, and not only that, but had also cheated on me and every single one of past boyfriends followed by laughing. I know I also ""got on the good foot and did the bad thing"" but it is definitely evident that she is going to always do this. She told me that she just got bored easily, which is fine but she lets guys fall in love with her just to back stab them, and then tries to keep them in her life just to have someone to fall back on.

Should I let her current boyfriend know the situation? I would have really liked it if someone had told me before I got so attached. 

Oh, and I am never gonna talk to her again.

**edit** I told him,and he said he appreciated it. What's done is done."
hd4no,2,2011-05-17,"I need Career Advice, Reddit.",[deleted],self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/hd4no/i_need_career_advice_reddit/,"So I want to go into the film/tv industry.  I always have.  I went to college for Video Production, learned all about the ins and outs of shoots, and graduated in '09.  I kept hearing about how the job market in LA was awful at the time, so I stayed in my college town to direct a webseries, that I'm still finishing.  I then moved to Chicago last August to start my career in video production.  Since then the only production related job I've been able to get (other than a few random freelance gigs) was a four month, full time, unpaid internship in corporate video.  Everywhere I look for jobs it's all corporate video, or helping out for free or low pay on student films or low-budget indie films, or PAing on the few TV shows or movies that come here, but the people I know who do that have been doing it for years and are just professional PA's (not trying to knock PA's, it's just not what I want to spend the rest of my life doing).  

I know that I'm very young and have to work the shit jobs, I know that I have to PA and be the intern before I can move up, I'm just considering that Chicago isn't the right place for me.  I feel like I could work my ass off here and get into corporate video, which isn't my goal.

What I'm considering doing is moving home for a year, living with my parents to save money, and moving to Los Angeles.  I really want to live in Los Angeles, and the industry I want is there.  Should I leave Chicago when my lease is up in August to go home to save?  Or should I keep trying here in Chicago?  I love Chicago, I love living in a city, I DESPISE the weather here.  I'm at a loss, because I don't want moving home to seem like I'm giving up, because I'm not.  I'm just going in a different direction.  Now I'm rambling.

tldr: I moved to Chicago for video production but realized my dream is TV/Film, which really exists in LA.  Should I move home for a year and save up to move to LA?  Or should I not yet give up on Chicago?

hd0y4,1,2011-05-16,Help me create comedic art! Literally.,BreakingANDGentry,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/hd0y4/help_me_create_comedic_art_literally/,"Dear Reddit,

I am currently wrapping up the second year of my degree and have noticed lots of my friends have internships planned or have started their own businesses. They have something they can be proud of, something that they created. One of them is even a diamond merchant and a millionaire. So I thought, how can I compete with that? I realised, I don’t want to compete in a business sense or as a way of making money, I would like to have something, something created from nothing, something to be proud of to show others.
This is why I have come to Reddit, to ask of the talent here, to help me.

During 2010 and 2011, I have been living in Mainland China and every-time I have thought of something funny, I have jotted it down. This has helped to keep me sane from the culture shock of adjusting. I have now accumulated enough items for about 40/50 sketches. I originally wanted to film the ideas and make a comedy sketch show akin to “Picnic Face” or “Derrick Comedy”, however after much thought, I realised there’s so much artistic talent on the net that I’d love to work with some people and make variations on the joke. If I could set the scenario, then Reddit draws their versions of it, then they are hosted on a website, a gallery of art from a theme.

I originally came here to find a single artist to work with, yet I feel, that I don’t want to create a “web-comic” everyone and their mother has done that. I don’t want a weekly news feed and a comic section, as a matter of fact, I want the term comic, to be insulting to what you produce. I am here to ask for some “starry night” raw-top of the line art. Make it surreal, make it pop-art, make it modern art. Make it watercolours. Just make it your own and make it art.
I’d like to describe to you one of the first jokes, 




**The Mine**

Panel 1:
A larger, almost Santa like figure sits at the head of a long table, his face covered in mud, his eyes red, the table is long and lined with all his catholic children. In the middle of the table sits one solitary pie, steaming away.


Panel 2: 
The panel zooms into the dark gloom of his face, to show his weariness.


Panel 3: His perfect house-wife cuts the pie into pieces, making sure to cut a larger slice for father, father’s mouth twists into a grim smile of approval.


Panel 4:
One of his angelic blonde haired children believes that today is the day to test his luck, throws down his chair and shouts “Why every night do you ALWAYS take the largest slice of this families meal? Why not share equally? Is it because you believe us not your equals despite being your sons?”


Panel 5:
The father flies into a Catholic Rage, the crucifixes and paintings shaking on the walls and bellows “Listen you BRAT! When you have spent every one of your snivelling little days down the mine like I have, you’ll know some respect!”

Panel 6:
Silence falls upon their home,they stare at their feet, too ashamed to speak.


Panel 7:
The soft glow of a purple neon sign illuminates all around it; the dumpster next to it, the abandoned cars. The neon sign reads *“The Mine”.* 


Panel 8:
Inside we see the father in a fake tacky and dirty miners outfit grinding a business man in a suit for money,  as the businessman, clearly skinnier than him, glances at his watch in boredom. (I want this scene to still be purple, illuminating the figures.)


P.s Sorry if my grammar or English is not very good, I’ve spent quite a while in China speaking and reading Chinese everyday and hearing people speak Chinglish. Sorry!
If this one gets a few entries and goes well I’ll start posting the others. Thank you

Edit1(Spacing)

TLDR: Let’s make some art, skip to the end for the first joke I’ve put up for people to try. Also shame on your for not reading my writing D:

hem8q,0,2011-05-18,"Reddit, help. My roommate is an AC nazi",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/hem8q/reddit_help_my_roommate_is_an_ac_nazi/,"I've been living with two roommates for a little over a year now. We live in an older house that went through a few renovations, but none to fix the efficiency of the AC system. We have had disputes over the past year about the heat and what temp it should be at during different parts of the day. Last summer, I was out of the house nearly all day because I worked and went to summer school (I am the only one in the house who actually pays for my own bills; the other two just have their parents write a check). When I'd get back around 9pm, the AC would be set at 85. We live in Austin, so it's pretty damn hot during the summer. I usually would just turn it down to 74 when I got in the house. One of my roommates didn't start living with us until the fall, but since we had all moved into the house before the summer, she still paid for part of the bills. So when schools starts, and we're all living in the house, one of my roommates starts turning the AC off when she leaves. When we'd all get back from class that evening, the house would be at 85-90 degrees (I had all morning classes, so the AC was ok when I'd leave for class. She'd change it after I'd leave the house). This went on for a while. Even though we all talked and came to compromises, the two roommates never stuck to them and would always turn the AC either way up or off when I wasn't there. Their explanation was that the AC has to work extra hard to keep the house cool, so if we keep it at the same as the outside temp, the bill will be low. I tried telling them that our AC would be low if we kept it constant during the day, but they continued to argue. Eventually, I just started staying at my boyfriend's house. Things chilled out over winter (literally) and AC wasn't an issue.

Fast forward to this semester. I literally never see my one roommate; she lives alone in her room. The other roommate is constantly on my ass about the thermostat. I quit my job in March so that I could focus on GRE stuff, my internship, grad school things, etc., but it's cool because I saved money to pay for bills. I was home more often because I had a ton of things to do, so I had more time to experience the extreme heat conditions. At first, I'd do work in my room (the rooms are tiny, so you can feel the AC better them), and after a few hours of dying (the fans don't help), I'd change the thermostat from 79 to 74-75. It may be only a few degrees, but it makes a huge difference in this house. Within a few minutes, the roommate would leave her room and change it back up, either to 79 again or higher. I'd either turn it back down, leave, or suck it up. A few weeks ago, she wrote a sticky note and put it under the thermostat. [This is it](http://imgur.com/ptam5). She's never put it at 76 during the day, idk why she wrote that. Considering the cost of our last bill, 15% of our bill would come out to around $5 more per roommate. I don't know where she found that stat. I've tried to talk to her about it, but she just walks away and goes into her room. 

Last night was kind of my breaking point. My boyfriend and I were packing my stuff and moving it to my car. The house was at its normal high temp, so I asked my boyfriend if he could turn it down to 74. It was about 6:30, so I didn't think my roommate would care. While we were moving, my roommate had opened her door to watch us as she sat on her computer. When my boyfriend got to the thermostat, she took off her headphones and started yelling at him, saying that he better not touch the thermostat, yada yada. He told her that we were moving stuff and it was really hot in the house, and she started yelling louder, telling him that he doesn't pay our bill, etc, etc. He walked into my room to get away/grab some more boxes, and she followed him in there. She told him that we were wasting so much energy and causing the bill to be extremely high. He told her that if she cared so much, he'd give her a $10. She just kept yelling. So I go over to my room, and I hear my boyfriend tell her to go fuck herself. That didn't help the situation, but it was about time someone said it. I broke up their argument and tried to explain to her that the house was really hot, and that we'd turn it back up when we were done, but she just kept going on about how much money I waste by turning the AC down and how much energy I'm wasting. I told her I wasn't going to change it, and that our last bill wouldn't even matter because we were about to get our deposit check back anyway. She said that the deposit has nothing to do with the bill. I walked off. She just went back to her room and sat on her computer. It was a bit more dramatic then I'm saying, but it's obvious that she's a crazy bitch. My boyfriend and I finished up some packing, turned the AC back to what she had it, and left.

I have a week left living here. Can anyone help me with facts to support my argument, or something to take away from hers? I feel like she is just extremely wrong.



Some additional things:

-She used to go through my room when I wasn't home. I bought a new doorknob with a lock and she got offended

-If she saw my laptop plugged in, she would take the plug out of the wall, then my laptop would die

-When we had parties, she would turn it way back up when people were in the other room. That pissed everyone off

-She has never had a job, her parents buy her everything, she drives an Audi

-She literally does nothing all day except sit on her computer (the biggest iMac that apple offers). She puts her facebook status to ""offline"" so she can facebook stalk literally all day. I know this because she told me she does this.

**tl;dr** My roommate keeps the AC really high because she thinks it saves money, but it just keeps the house extremely hot and unlivable

helbm,2,2011-05-18,"Reddit, I'm going to let it out. Will someone listen?",kardboardrobot,reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/helbm/reddit_im_going_to_let_it_out_will_someone_listen/,"Hello friends.

I don't know how this will turn out, but tonight my heart is crying and for reasons I do not understand, I have no one to talk to.

Let me start with my bio. My name is Andrew and I was diagnosed bipolar and a.d.d. at age 14. I realized I was bi-sexual at a young age, although I have never had any opportunity to express my feelings, and have defensively repressed most of them. I spend most of my young life struggling with friends and dealing with these emotions that I could not explain. This could easily be the cause for my attraction to smoking pot. Outwardly, I have a good life, and am a gifted musician and an intelligent, passionate student.  

In my senior year of high-school, I met a girl named marianne. I loved her and she loved me perfectly for several years. She went on to a college 2 hours away from mine to study music, and I would visit her. With each visit, I felt her drift away until on one visit, she broke up with me. 2 weeks later she had a new boyfriend, and stopped talking to me completely.

I am now 20 years old and well along in my young professional life. This year at school, I met a beautiful chinese girl named Zoe who fell in love with me. We dated for a while, but I continually felt very detached. Before she left, she asked me if I even liked her and I couldn't respond. Now I have no way to talk to her.

Most of the time, i am very happy. Happy with the way I look, happy with my musical prowess, and happy with my excellent summer internship. Last night though, I had an emotional breakdown. I feel nervous and alone, as if I cannot deal with growing older. I can't keep my mind off marianne, although I honestly want nothing more than to stop torturing myself. Life is a blessing, and I love being alive, but I sometimes feel dead and corrupt. 

I don't want to feel this way, and I'm beginning to realize that depression is not something I can simply shrug off. I want new people in my life, positive people, but I cannot find them. 

Redditors, please. I don't know what I'm asking of you, or why I so badly need to get this out. I know I am a good man, and want to share myself with anyone. I thank you so much, anyone that responds. God bless us all."

I am a columbia university master's student interested in moving in Manhattan ASAP! I have to move in by June 1st, and have money ready! I am 22years old, female, and pretty chill! I love theatre, music, and being involved politically. I am super busy - I intern 3 days a week, go to class 2 days, and work on the weekends and some nights. I also make income from an acting troupe I'm in. I'll be a great roomie cause I'll hardly be in during the day and will come home late a lot of nights after working! I also don't smoke or have pets, but am totally okay with it and just a socializing environment if that is your place! 

I've been screwed over by so many people who were looking for a place with me, so I prefer people contacting me who already have a place and simply need another person to fill a room.

Also, I totally understand these places will be above 125th, I have tons of friends who live in the 140s, '60s, '80s and higher so I am fully aware =) Most of them I know pay $650 or less, so ideally I'd like to be in that range, but if not I can do up to $700. 

Thanks so much and Please PM me ASAP if you can help a girl out! =)

This one month out of this year I will not have anything to worry about. I enjoy relaxing in the evenings with friends or alone, toking up and listening to music. I also like to go crazy and party on select nights. Less than once a week.

The guy I have been seeing (I am a girl, by the way) is a huge drinker and partier, but HATES when girls smoke weed. He currently doesn't smoke (clean for 2 years) but before that, in high school, was a huge pothead. He sent to me two texts when I brought the subject up:

""Girls and weed just don't mix. I mean even when I smoked weed I still didn't like it. None of my girlfriends have smoked weed.""

and

""Idk just like a girl sitting there baked out of her mind. Not very attractive.""

Why does he feel this way, and what are some arguments I could use to suade him to being okay with my smoking?

hdy53,10,2011-05-18,My long term break so far.,ChronicElectronic,leaves,https://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/comments/hdy53/my_long_term_break_so_far/,"For the past two months I've been on a break from smoking. I thought sharing my experiences maybe able to help a few people.

First off, I am not quitting outright. I initially quit so that I could get clean for a drug test I may or may not have to take for a summer internship. One of the biggest challenges I faced initially was that I was still growing a few plants with my roommate (I have my medical recommendation). I also have a lot of friends that still smoke. There was just no way I would be able to avoid being around it.

This has definitely added to my cravings. The big things that helped me fight the cravings are: letting my friends know about my goal, keeping in mind my reasons for quitting, and my meditation practice. I began meditating about three weeks before I started my break. It has helped me deal with the withdrawal symptoms and the cravings immensely. It also gave me another reason not to smoke: having a clear head greatly improves my practice.

The hardest time I've had so far was 4/20. It was the day after my 21st birthday, so I was really hungover. I've learned to rely on marijuana to help with hangovers, so it took all my will power not to smoke that day. Hangovers are still my biggest trigger for cravings. Nothing fixes the nausea so fast and so well as a hit of marijuana. Anyone have any alternatives?

Well thats my story so far. I plan to start up again over summer. Although I'm not quitting permanently(yet), it's  nice to know that I have the will power to go from smoking everyday for about 3 years to not smoking at all for 3 months. "

Not sure if this is the right place to post this question. Please redirect me if there’s somewhere better!

**TL;DR** - My girlfriend of about one year is a virgin. We get along great generally. Is it unfair to base thoughts about “sexual compatibility” on how we interact now, or should I wait until when/if we have sex?

Her age: 24
My age: 27

-----

Dear me... I seem to have lost track of how long this post is. Sorry if it’s too long!

Although intimacy is the primary topic of this question, it’s possible that any issues are elsewhere and this is a side effect. 

I’ve been dating this wonderful person for about a year now. We’d known each other for about two and a half years prior to this, so we certainly weren’t strangers when we started dating. 

We get along well. Fantastic is probably a better word. When we’re together every concern is forgotten and we don’t have a care in the world. We frequently lose track of time and are both happier when with each other. That is, until we go to my place to hang out or go to bed... She seems to stay the same, but I’m starting to get frustrated and bummed out when we’re at my place or in bed.

We talked about sex fairly early on after our make outs got more exploratory and physical. She’s a virgin, I’m not, and our idea of when sex should happen is fairly aligned (couple should be happy with each other and comfortable in the relationship). We don’t have sex, but that’s not to say we don’t do anything at all!

Physical interaction followed a natural progression of how far we went over time. Kissing, making out, touching, removal of shirts. Pants/etc have never come off, but we have “satisfied” each other despite this. This is where it starts to fall over though.

Maybe 8 or 9 times out of 10 she tells me she doesn’t want me to move my hand south when I make motion of it (obviously not in those words!). The times she has allowed it usually only last as long as it takes for her to satisfy me (obligation perhaps?). Only 3 times of those have I been able to pleasure her, at least as far as I can tell.

At first I thought this is fair enough. She’s a virgin, doesn’t want to rush, all that business. We were at this point about 4 months ago. It hasn’t progressed past this at all in any form, and if anything our physical interactions have decreased.

A couple weeks ago I was really in the mood to give her attention and satisfy her. Her satisfaction always comes before mine (which really bites when she doesn’t let me), but the feeling was particularly strong  this time. We’re making out on the couch and I take her in to the bedroom. I light a couple of candles so we can see what we’re doing, but so it’s not so bright she’s self conscious. I give attention to everything I can without rushing, and try my best to make her feel beautiful and special, and more importantly, comfortable. Things progress and I make motions towards satisfying her, and she asks me to stop after just a moment.   Massive buzz-kill. Regardless, she continues for me. 

As soon as it’s over, bed covers pulled up, her shirt back on.

As we’re getting ready for sleep a bit later on I ask her why she won’t let me do anything for her. She answered that she’s embarrassed at showing any signs of pleasure.  I try to empathise with that, but I don’t really understand it, especially after natural physical progression over a reasonable period of time. I don’t care if we don’t have sex, but nothing at all after what we’ve done? In the past I’ve also asked her if she’s physically interested in me, which she’s answered in the affirmative.

Since when I last asked her we’ve done nothing beyond hugs and basic kisses. Admittedly, I’ve backed off to give her some space in case she feels pressured, but also to see if she initiates anything. This is something else that is prominent in my mind and overlaps with intimacy. She never seems to initiate anything (intimacy/dates/outings/etc), is always keen to doze after work (she’s an intern at a hospital and works long days), and doesn’t really show any visible level of interest in general, despite being quite attached to me and telling me I mean a lot to her.

I have absolutely no interest in forcing or manipulating her to have sex with me, or do anything to get my own personal satisfaction via her. Obviously I have my own drive that wants satisfying, but more than anything else I want to satisfy her and make her feel awesome.

There are many thoughts that have risen over the last few months out of this, one of which is whether she’s genuinely interested in me in general (physical interaction can be a good litmus for other issues I guess), but there are two or three major things for me:

1 - I don’t know how I can satisfy her in any way (including non-physical things); she can’t suggest alternatives after discussion about this. I feel completely useless and unable to do anything to bring us closer as a result

2 - When she stays over I’m often awake until after 2am due to sex drive. I get grumpy and tired as a result, which affects work, fitness, social interactions, she thinks I’m upset and feels bad for me not sleeping (whether she’s aware it’s libido or not, I’m not sure), etc...

3 - Through the course of her satisfying me, and not letting me satisfy her, I’m starting to catch moments where I think only of my satisfaction. This **really** guts me, and thinking selfishly like this is the last place I want to be... I used to imagine all the things I wanted to try on her, but these thoughts far less frequently cross my mind now.


I have no intention of breaking up with her as a result of all this at this point in time, but if she has a naturally low sex drive or just isn’t interested in sex in general, it will cause issues down the track, especially if/after we have sex.  I feel a bit selfish saying that, but if I’m thinking these things now, what will it be like in the future?

So, after this small novel, my question.

Is it valid to gauge sexual compatibility with my girlfriend, a virgin, before we have sex? 

Secondary question: is it likely that this is an indication of where our relationship is at, or perhaps some confidence/esteem issues she might have?


If anything needs clarification, or more info, don’t hesitate to ask. Although this seems centered around sex (it’s certainly a very prevalent issue in mind), I would not be surprised if it’s a secondary thing resulting from something else."

(TL;DR at the end)

I am a 31-year-old female who just completed a B.S. degree in chemistry. I also just got engaged to my boyfriend of 3 years. We do not yet have any kids, but we are certain that we want to start a family, and soon. (In my case, I'm worried about the possibility of waiting *too* long, and not being able to...)

The plan originally was for me to get a job working for a few years, get married, start a family, then go back to grad school when the kids are old enough for daycare. People tell me that it is a bad idea to wait any length of time before grad school; however, I really just can't imagine trying to have a baby while in grad school. (If anyone actually *has* gone through this, please speak up!)

We also both want to move elsewhere... we're not too picky about the *where*, we just both know we don't like it where we currently are. Future hubby has been with his current company for 9 years now and doesn't like it... he stayed so that we could be together while I finished school. Unfortunately, I'm thinking that it's going to be difficult looking for jobs without a clear idea of *where* to look. It's also not helping that I have been told by a few people that the majority of jobs are found by networking rather than through actual job postings. I have a good network in this area, but as I said... the future hubby is set on moving.

I haven't actually applied to grad school yet (probably a bad move in retrospect), and right now my ""plan B"" is to get a 1-2 year contract position or internship around here and get into grad school as soon as I can. Again, though, the issue is that I *know* hubby is not happy here, and so I really would rather find something in another area.

Reddit, any opinions or thoughts are welcome! Thanks!

TL;DR: 31-year-old female, just finished B.S., wants to have kids before it's too late; hubby wants to move elsewhere, but I fear having a tough time finding jobs without networks in other areas. Also worrying about putting off grad school."

I was put into contact with a senior partner in the department of the firm I want to work with, in a different office than the one in my region. I talked to her on the phone and she agreed to forward my CV to a senior partner in the office I'm interested in for consideration for an internship this summer. She said to wait a month and if I didn't hear anything, then get back to her. I didn't hear anything so I replied with this:

""Hi again,

I hope all is well.

I have yet to receive a response from X firm so I am writing you in pursuance of your last e-mail. I am awaiting their reply to confirm my summer plans; would you have any updates about the progress of my candidacy?

I do appreciate that you and your coworkers are very busy, and I'd be grateful for a response at your earliest convenience.

Regards"".

It's been over two weeks since I sent this out so I'm wondering what my next move should be. She on average takes a week to reply to me but I'm thinking she has just forgotten at this point. Maybe a phone call to remind her? I do need to make other plans if this doesn't work out but I don't want to get on her nerves either...

hfpwz,1,2011-05-20,Does anyone else have parents who are just impossible to please?,Say_Hey,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/hfpwz/does_anyone_else_have_parents_who_are_just/,"I'm a 21 year old female living in New Jersey.  My dad has always been hard on me when it comes to school and work.  My grades were never good enough and I never seemed to work enough hours.  Well that was all fine and dandy in high school.  I firmly believe that parents should push their kids to succeed.  I'm extremely grateful for the work ethic he taught me.

Well when college rolled around, neither of my parents gave me a dime (my parents are divorced and I live with my dad full time).  So, to get myself through school, I worked two jobs.  This was fine.  I actually enjoy working and keeping busy.

I got my associates degree in Paralegal Studies and I would like to continue going to school part time to get a degree in environmental science (I probably won't actually get a degree until I'm 30, but that's moot).  Right now I'm working as an unpaid intern at a law office, and I still work both of my jobs.  So, as of late, I work between 60 and 70 hours a week.  I'm pretty proud of myself at this point, however my dad can't seem to get past the fact that the internship is unpaid.  He never fails to remind me how stupid he thinks I am for working for free.  When I explain to him how much I'm learning, he just tells me that knowledge isn't going to buy me a new car (or something along those lines).  

What makes it even more difficult at times is seeing my friends who have great relationships with their extremely supportive parents.  I didn't even bother going to my graduation ceremony.

I'm just at my wits end.  It's gotten to the point where I hate being home when my dad is here because I know he's going to ask me why I'm not at work or cleaning the house (I'm pretty much in charge of keeping the house, my dad does the yard work and such).

All I really want is to know that my dad is proud of me for SOMETHING.

Has anyone else ever experienced this; tried so hard only to have their efforts go seemingly unnoticed?

tl;dr: I bust my ass constantly and my dad still doesn't think I do enough.  Has anyone else ever gone through this and how did you get through to your parents?"

She has an 8 year old son and I've become a father to him now, he's everything to me. Obviously it was a very strange situation at first, but I'm a great dad (I'd like to think) and I take care of both of them with everything I have.

We got together during my Sophmore year, dated for a year, then moved in together and have been ever since. I love her with every bit I have to give, but it seems she's always finding a reason to be unhappy with me. I'm not sure why. I honestly believe that from her past experiences, she doesn't believe she deserves to be happy, so she finds fault with anything she can, that's merely speculation though.

Well, lately she's been talking about being unhappy in our relationship, and I'm about to leave for 3 months for an internship 2 hours away. I'm worried that she's going to see it as the time to leave me.

I don't even know where to begin. I have Social Anxiety and don't deal well with stress and confrontation, I'm a very chilled out person so it's never been a huge problem except in situations like this.

Essentially I feel like the life I've woven together for the last 2 years is near it's end, and if it goes that way I won't know how to handle it. Moving out, leaving who is essentially my son of 2 years, and being alone for the first time in 2 years, out of college with no set plan.

I will do everything I can to keep her, I've always sacrificed everything I had for her and will do it all over again, but I'm afraid it might not be enough this time around.

Advice? I'm slightly scared.

Edit: Last night she came to me crying at 2am, saying that she just didn't know anymore and that she wanted time apart, I'm leaving soon for my internship so I'm thinking after a week or so of being gone she'll decide if she wants me or not. I'm slowly starting to get over the initial shock, and at this point I just want her to make a decision so I can get out of the hellish torture that is wondering if I'm going to have her or not. If not, I'd like to start getting over it, if so, I want to feel like my fiancee loves me again. Either or. Tired of the games."
hfldl,0,2011-05-19,Have you ever wanted to call someone for lying about being gay?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/hfldl/have_you_ever_wanted_to_call_someone_for_lying/,"One summer I worked for a company in a foreign country so the company provided us housing.  We had a very nice apartment for the two of us, except she was probably one of the worst people I'd ever met.  What peeves me the most though, is that she lied about being gay (Or at least regarding her partner, though I don't think she's gay either).  She told the company that her ""partner"" would be staying in our apartment for the summer, but I'm pretty (almost absolutely) sure they were just good friends.  What pisses me off the most is that I arrived at the apartment a week before them and could have taken the master bedroom, but since I was trying to be considerate to who I thought was a couple, I took the smaller room and ended up spending the summer sleeping in a bed that was a racecar (I'm 6', 250 lbs).

I know people will want to know why I thought she was lying so here are the reasons:
- The alleged couple shared a king size bed, BUT kept a large body pillow in the middle that separated the two sides as well as slept with separate blankets.   
- I never once saw them be affectionate, cuddle, hold hands or kiss during the entire two months we lived together.
- They would call each other ""wife"" and make sarcastic posts to each other back and forth on facebook calling each other ""wife"".  It could have just me being suspicious and hating them, but it seemed contrived.  And while I'm not versed on lesbian couple etiquette, it just doesn't seem something a real couple would do.  I have tons of hetero-female friends who refer to their best female friends as ""wife"" in a similar sarcastic-joking manner.
- They had been friends since junior high, went to different colleges, one lived in North America while the other in Europe during the past 5 years.  I find it highly unlikely that two childhood friends both realize they are gay and then date many years later, after moving away and apart from each other. 
- Her ""partner"" had a ""friend"" visiting from Spain during our two months there.  Her ""partner"" traveled around Thailand with said ""friend"" for three weeks out of those two months.  You'd think that if she lived an ocean away from her partner and this is a friend who lives in Spain, where she lived, she would want to spend more time with her ""partner"" and not run off spending half the time with this guy, especially since they said they only see each other during the summers.  Also, she had a calendar taped up in her room that had a date circled with a heart and inside the heart she wrote ""Roberto (or some other similarly sounding European name) coming, YAY!""
- I took a weekend trip to a beach/island, but she had to work that weekend (She was a kiss ass and volunteered and then lectured me for not working, even though our boss said it was not a big deal and I spoke to him privately explaining I had coordinated the trip (with 2 other interns as well) and he told me to enjoy myself).  When we got back from the trip, not only did she lecture me about asking for the day off, she was also pissed I didn't invite her partner.  It baffled me because I've lived with my girlfriend and another roommate and it was always such a treat to have the entire apartment to ourselves, I thought she would have felt the same, but obviously not because she's a god damn liar.
- She got sick towards the end of the intership and left a week early.  Her partner stayed in our apartment, which I found weird since I thought she would have left with her sick partner and accompanied her while she was sick.
- They were very nitpicky about expenses.  Like paying each other back for a 20 baht meal (Exchange rate at the time was like 35 baht = 1 USD).  If I asked my girlfriend to pay me back the 65 cents I spent on her for dinner, I'm pretty sure she'd punch me right in the dick.

There was more stuff I'm sure, but I can't remember every detail now as it was 3 years ago.  I just talked to one of the other interns who worked with us that summer, last week and he brought her up, we all hated her.

tl;dr - coworker lied to company about being gay so friend could stay in our company housing."
hfhd4,15,2011-05-19,When to say when and when to hold on,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/hfhd4/when_to_say_when_and_when_to_hold_on/,"Hey, I have been seeing my fiance for about 7 years, and we have been engaged for two years. We're young (26). 

The last three years have been long-distance (seeing each other every two months or so) and at least next year will be long distance as well (I am in school).

We've already had bumps along the way (he broke up with me for a summer, three years ago, when we first realized that we would have to be apart) and I know he has questioned the relationship at other times as well (earlier on). 

He has recently told me that he is again wondering if we are doing the right thing. He thinks all of the distance has caused us to grow apart/become different people. BUT he says he just isn't really sure. 

What makes it even harder right now, is that we are actually seeing each other every weekend for the whole summer (I am doing an internship in a nearby city). Things feel totally fine when we are together. I see his family all of the time too, and am really close with them. Unfortunately, people keep asking us when we're going to get married, which is awkward, considering he isn't even sure we should be together right now. 

He has left it at, ""lets see how the summer goes"" but I don't know how much more ""doubting"" I can take from him (even though I understand it, and appreciate that he is trying to be honest).

Is it a sign that we shouldn't be together, but its been so long that he's just having trouble ending it (he's so comfortable that it is confusing him)? Did we get together too young? Will he (and maybe even me) resent the other person for taking away so many of our ""carefree"" younger years, when we could be dating other people? Has anyone else ever bounced back from this kind of doubt to have a good relationship? 

I don't want to end up being his bitter ex-wife down the road....
But I did always picture being with him forever, and used to think I could handle anything for the both of us...

Didn't think about her much after that, since business is business. Bumped into her again a couple weeks later when we were both with our group of friends and I noticed two things:

* When I said hi, she shook my hand with her mouth agape. At the time, I asked her why she was so surprised to see me. 
* While we were both waiting for our friends, I sat down on the bench, and she turned her entire body towards me, sat cross-legged, and randomly suggested I try strawberry spinach yogurts, because they were the best things on earth.

Her: You know what you should try? Strawberry spinach yogurts. They're the best!

Me: Spinach? That sounds like one of the worst ideas I've heard all day. I'm going to file that one under ""bad ideas"".

Her: No! You defn have to try it. It's delicious.

And when we were done waiting for our friends, she mentioned it again as she was leaving. All the things together, I took as an IOI.

I don't like mixing business and pleasure, but I usually regret thing I don't do, rather than things that I do, so I shot off an email to her a week later, saying I thought strawberry spinach yogurts were a bad idea at first, but I wanted to try it and asked if she wanted to join me.

The answer came back yes. I can't take much credit for a pickup here. When she's interested, you just have to make sure you can read it, and pull the trigger, even if you're not 100% sure.

She invited me over to her place to cook together and make yogurts as a first date. She lives in a house with at least a dozen to two dozen other people with a large communal commercial kitchen, so I don't think it's what you're thinking.

I've been learning to keep my conversation lighter. I tend to ask about things that are more heavy in nature, like their jobs or their goals, when I let myself slip. You never want to have a girl talk about things that depress her mood, since she'll associate that feeling with you.

She was telling me about how there was a naked body painting party last night, and that's why there was a bra hanging from the ceiling. She said she didn't attend. Mistake here is that I could have done better here to escalate and tease her about lying about attending to start a push/pull

I did do some kino, mostly hand on the knee in brief for emphasis. I did find a way to kino when we were talking about allergies. 

Me: You got a cold? You're sniffling. 

Her: No, I have allergies.

Me: Have you ever had an allergen test done?

Her: No.

Me: here [takes her hand], they take your arm, [pushes up her sleeves], and then they poke you with different kinds of allergens, and see which one welts up. [pokes her forearm repeatedly]

It was just kino I made up on the spot, though I don't know if it's a good idea to associate my kino with allergies. In addition, she pulled her hand away first. I really should have dropped her hand first, akin to Mystery's kino advice.

In hindsight, I could have also added high-fives to the kinoing. When I tell her good news, she usually replies with 'alright!'. That's a good time for a high-five kino. lesson for next time.

We cooked and ate, and the funny thing about a communal kitchen is that the housemates will just gravitate towards prepared food. Hardly anyone was walking around when we were cooking, but when it was done, they just seem to come out of the woodwork. It ended up being a crowd of us and 4 others eating in the kitchen. I was able to talk and joke with them on various topics, all of which I was able to converse something about--which I assume is a DHV.

I was able to re-isolate her by mentioning that we should eat the (small) dessert that I brought, and we ended up sitting outside her place on another bench, and just talk and eat. Good convo, though I can't remember what we talked about.

Here, the only kino I managed to do was wipe some dessert off the corner of her mouth, and the usual arm and knee touches in conversation. 

No k-close, as I mistakenly kept walking with her back into the house and then decided to leave, rather than deciding to leave before we had entered her house at the end. She initiated a hug before I had much time to think. Then as I was walking away, she told me that I should give her a call and we should hang again. 

No yogurts were made, but I think overall, she had fun. And yes, I should have k-closed much earlier, esp with the dessert wiping off of her face. I need to stop thinking that the end is the only time one can k-close. Some texting back and forth since the date, and she's game for date #2. We're actually going to go get yogurts next time. And next time, I will escalate much faster."

I don't like mixing business and pleasure, but I usually regret thing I don't do, rather than things that I do, so I shot off an email to her a week later, saying I thought strawberry spinach smoothies were a bad idea at first, but I wanted to try it and asked if she wanted to join me.

The answer came back yes. I can't take much credit for a pickup here. When she's interested, you just have to make sure you can read it, and pull the trigger, even if you're not 100% sure.

She invited me over to her place to cook together and make smoothies as a first date. However, she lives in a house with at least a dozen to two dozen other people with a large communal commercial kitchen, so I don't think it was hookup time.

I've been learning to keep my conversation lighter. I tend to ask about things that are more heavy in nature, like their jobs or their goals, when I let myself slip. You never want to have a girl talk about things that depress her mood, since she'll associate that feeling with you.

She was telling me about how there was a naked body painting party last night, and that's why there was a bra hanging from the ceiling. She said she didn't attend. Mistake here is that I could have done better here to escalate and tease her about lying about attending to start a push/pull

I did do some kino, mostly hand on the knee in brief for emphasis. I did find a way to kino when we were talking about allergies. 

Me: You got a cold? You're sniffling. 
Her: No, I have allergies.
Me: Have you ever had an allergen test done?
Her: No.
Me: here [takes her hand], they take your arm, [pushes up her sleeves], and then they poke you with different kinds of allergens, and see which one welts up. [pokes her forearm repeatedly]

It was just kino I made up on the spot, though I don't know if it's a good idea to associate my kino with allergies. In addition, she pulled her hand away first. I really should have dropped her hand first, akin to Mystery's kino advice.

In hindsight, I could have also added high-fives to the kinoing. When I tell her good news, she usually replies with 'alright!'. That's a good time for a high-five kino. lesson for next time.

We decided to make curry, and she wanted to put all sorts of vegetables that don't usually go into curry like asparagus, yams, and green peppers. That made it easy for me to tease her about her dubious taste, and that I wasn't sure that if her choice in curry vegetables were so abysmal that I could trust her taste in smoothies.

Cooking was fun, though there was far less kino cooking together than I thought there would be. At one point, I actually couldn't figure out how to work the can opener. If that was an intelligence test, I had definitely failed it. But I eventually got it open but managed to splash some all over and on to her pant leg as well. 

We ate, and the funny thing about a communal kitchen is that the housemates will just gravitate towards prepared food. Hardly anyone was walking around when we were cooking, but when it was done, they just seem to come out of the woodwork. It ended up being a crowd of us and 4 others eating in the kitchen. I was able to talk and joke with them on various topics, all of which I was able to converse something about--which I assume is a DHV.

I was able to re-isolate her by mentioning that we should eat the dessert that I brought, and we ended up sitting outside her place on another bench, and just talk and eat. Good convo, though I can't remember what we talked about.

Here, the only kino I managed to do was wipe some dessert off the corner of her mouth, and the usual arm and knee touches in conversation. 

No k-close, as I mistakenly kept walking with her back into the house and then decided to leave, rather than deciding to leave before we had entered her house at the end. And yes, I should have k-closed much earlier, esp with the dessert wiping off of her face.

No smoothies were made, but I think overall, she had fun. Some texting back and forth since the date, and she's game for date #2. We're actually going to go get smoothies next time. And next time, I should escalate much faster."

I'm a writer. Parents can't afford cool super expensive school where I can major in something useless (I.E. English.) Jealous of preppy ass holes who don't take advantage of their awesome education while I'm stuck in a commuter school with the grades and no cash. Sick of majoring in business. Can't stand it anymore. Don't want to be stuck in a cubicle. Thinking of dropping out. It's all a waste of time.

The less arrogant version is below.

LONG VERSION:

Hey, Reddit. Help me out here.

I'm a creative individual whose parents are forcing me to be a business major at a public, in-state school, so that I have something to fall back on. I wanted to be an English-ed major, but they say it won't get you a job (and in this economy, it won't.) Obviously having a backup plan for a creative individual is a smart move, but my problem is that I'm starting to fall apart mentally. I'm a hard working individual but I can't stand business and the thought that I would ever have to make a living doing that.

I recently failed my Calc final (which automatically fails you in the course) and my parents are pissed. It was my own fault. I lost steam towards the end of the semester and didn't put enough time into studying (I was writing instead.) I sort of went loose with repression on how its bullshit that I have the grades for great schools but I'm stuck in a business school, where I'm wasting my time studying for bullshit instead of pouring energy into my creative works*. I haven't spoken to them in a few days, but I told them I either want to transfer or drop-out, because I'm truly unhappy where I am, with writing the only thing saving me from total depression.

I know it's smart to have a back-up plan, but I feel like I'm wasting my time. I don't know whether or not I'll succeed in my creative aspirations, but I do know that I'll work harder than anybody else to get there - a passion that I feel no equivalent in with business. Why am I wasting my time majoring in a subject that I can't stand the thought of doing for a living? Why do people get to major in useless shit (I.E. English, History, Philosophy - all awesome and fun to learn, but rarely gets you a job unless you go to grad school) and have a college experience at some expensive, out-of-state (or in-state) private school? I just don't get it.

I'm jealous, I guess. Life's not fair. I wanted to go away to school - not to be a dumbass and go party everyday - but to live away from home, meet new people and enrich myself in knowledge and fun experiences. And meanwhile all these kids I know - whose families make shit for income - get to take out loans, live in debt, and get to tell me about what an awesome experience they had in college while I get to hangout with finance majors worrying about their GPA and paid internships at Lehman Brothers.

There's some part of me that feels like I'm being a whiny little bitch and I should just suck it up and appreciate what I have. You can't always get what you want (SEE ALSO: http://xkcd.com/863/) Now that I'm approaching junior year, I feel like all these business courses I have to take for the next three years are gonna suck the life out of me. They're hard courses that I don't have the time, energy, or dedication to make an effort for. This is not what I want to do with my life. This is not where I want to be. My college experience is shit and I can't fucking stand it anymore.

Help me out?

Thanks,
A redditor (hiding behind a different username because I don't want my sister to see this and tell my parents how unhappy I am - not that they would understand.)

hhbmb,5,2011-05-22,Online backups of important financial stuff?,wassailant,Frugal,https://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/hhbmb/online_backups_of_important_financial_stuff/,"Hey /frugal,

I'm currently beginning a pretty severe personal financial audit. I've gone from good to bad to good financial habits over the last few years, and last year was really good for me - I worked a range of jobs with multiple income streams and went from 2.5k in credit card debt, to paying for moving overseas (4k flights / insurance / admin stuff), upgrading my camera gear (an earner for me but still pricey at 4k) and having a wee bit of a savings buffer.

This year, I am earning practically nothing, as I am undertaking a low paid internship where I'm trading off pay for developing skills, learning and experience in a field I'm really passionate about but have had limited experience with professionally (travel).

I've moved countries, and I'm using this as an opportunity to redesign my life. Consequently, I would like to create some good habits, and one of the things I foresee as being really beneficial for myself is backing up my bank statements and other important financial information from the last few years and creating cloud copies, so that if I encounter computing errors I have additional protection of this information. I was undertaking a business for the last few years within Australia as well as receiving business development grants and working a range of jobs, so my financial situation is complicated compared to a standard single employer worker.

What I'm not so certain about is security. I'm Australian, and last time I checked Mint.com wasn't available to me (although this may have changed). I'm currently living and working in Germany and now have bank accounts in Germany and Australia, with two forms of currencies.

What is a good option for this type of goal? I have a private web server and I can store quite a lot of information on that, but I'm unfamiliar with online security practices like password encryption and hiding this stuff from Google trawling. Would I be better off finding a site that's designed to take care of this type of stuff?

My main worry with something like this is the potential for identity theft - if someone could gain access to wherever I end up storing this information, there is a severe risk of basically handing all of this information to someone...

I plan that at some point within the next few years (sooner rather than later if I have any say in the matter) my earnings will go back up again, and at that point I will probably benefit from seeking financial advice from someone who is familiar with the complications of Australian/German accounting headaches, but for the short term there is no practical way that I can spend money on advice like that.

Thoughts?"

It's part of how I am coping with it now but if you are willing to read all of it(I will do my best to not wall of text you to death), please let me know your opinion.

So here's some basic description of the two of us.
*Imo, she is basically your typical ""perfect girl.""  Stunningly beautiful(imo), great personality, smart.  She matched my personality very well.  Not extremely out going and not many close friends other than myself.

*She is 2 years older than I.

*Dated around 5-6 guys prior but each relationship lasting no longer than a year

*We have been dating for almost 3 years.  For the longest time it seemed that we were going to get married.  I wanted it, she wanted it(until now).  

*Already met the parents.  We get along very well and have had dinner many many times.  Pretty much had approval from the get go.

*The past year we moved into a 2 bedroom apartment and around the end of April she dumped me.  

*Reasons do not include seeing another guy, me cheating, her cheating, any sort of wrongdoing on both parts.  

*I still love her to death.

**Reasons why we broke up(that I can think of):**

**1.  Demand for Sex.**  
Before you make false assumptions, our sex is great.  We are very comfortable with each other and are able to get each other to climax with no problems.  We are both physically attracted to each other.  Now to get back on topic....I was often unhappy when she would continuously reject my requests for sex before we go to sleep.  Understandably she was tired because she has work, but I don't think I was overdoing it.  Usually I will never ask her after a 12 hour shift day of work for any fun time.  Normally I would not ask but if 2 or 3 days go by I will ask.  I don't think it's too unreasonable in that case to get some action.  When it goes on for a week I will noticeable be a little frustrated.    

**2.  Our living environment.  **

We are both pretty messy individuals so our place often times gets pretty messy fast.  We are both very tolerant of it but I sometimes think that if I had been more clean and provided a nicer living environment for her things may have been different.  

Also, in the past year we went and started raising 2 kittens and a puppy.  I did not know I would have a negative relationship with cats until we started raising two cats.  Since I was always more of a dog person I was not used to how cats were not as loyal and loving.  Quickly I began to hate the cats and often times was visibly frustrated at them.  The added on responsibilities of raising cats, housebreaking a puppy may have been too much for us to handle.  This definitely added on additional stress.

**3.  Relationship gone vanilla.  Got too comfortable.**  

In the past year we haven't had as much time to go out and do things and explore life.  She being a nursing student and also working full time during the weekends, it was hard finding time to spend time and have fun together.  Simply going out to dinner doesn't really cut it.  I'm talking more like going out hiking, traveling, trying new things, exploring life.  It's hard to blame this on either person as we are both college students with heavy workloads and the fire in all relationships eventually die down.  I was still very happy with the relationship as is.  In fact I was still very much in love with her.  I figured that when I graduated and started working I would be able to do this again.  It seems that she did not feel this way.

**4.  Age?  Inexperience?**

I am 21 and she is 23.  She has dated 5 people prior and me only 1.  Her stints last around 6-8 months normally and my previous gf also lasted around 2 years.  


**5.  I put too much responsibility on her to making me happy.**  

During one of our post-break up conversations she told me that she always felt pressure because she felt that I found nothing in life to make me happy other than her.  This is slightly true since most of my time is spent studying and going to classes, and coming home and seeing her does bring great joy in my life.  I don't see this as anything wrong.  I would have thought this was a plus.  Inversely, I haven't had as much time to pursue hobbies or do things together as stated above in #3.  I spend much of my time in front of a computer either surfing or doing homework.




**The Break-Up:**

Ever since March, she insisted that we should move back into separate 1 bed room apartments side by side to each other.  I did not understand the reason for this as we would have had to pay much more money.  This argument persisted until she blurted out that we should break up.  For some reason it did not occur to me that the reason why she wanted us to move out was that she probably did not enjoy living with me anymore.  


**Coping with the breakup:**
I will admit that it was excruciating.  Considering it was around the time I needed to really gear down and study for finals it was very difficult to harbor my emotions.  It also did not help that we had to still live together until 5/25/2011(next week).  It was very strange because during the day we would act as if everything was normal and we were good friends still.  But, when night time came and I had to sleep alone, I felt immense pain and felt very lonely.   It was a very difficult month but friends, exercise, and pursuing old hobbies has helped distract me.  I feel like I've survived the experience and have matured greatly from it.  I've begun to find more ways to enjoy life and myself instead of putting all my happiness into my girlfriend.






 Now, Reddit.  Here is where I want to get your opinion.  She has had some pretty interesting things which make me wonder if it means that she still has feelings for me or not.  Reddit girls, let me know what you think and what a typical girl is thinking when they do these things.  

**These events occur post break up**

**1.  She offered to let me live with her in her 1 bedroom apartment.**

She began to feel guilty about having to make me go live in a 1bed which is noticeably more expensive than splitting a 2 bed and making me and my dad pay more.  I would be sleeping in the living room while she took the bedroom.   Seemed kind of strange but I accepted and it seemed as if we were both very happy with this decision.  The next day she changed her mind and decided not to let me move in.  

**2.  Chasing me at school.**

One time I drove to school while she walked because she wanted exercise.  I arrived at school and parked in the parking lot.  Suddenly I notice someone tapping my shoulder and it ended up being my ex who had ran across the entire parking lot to catch up and walk with me.

**3.  Asking me to pin her at her nursing graduation pinning ceremony**

Usually this is considered more important than your typical graduation for nursing students.  Usually, students have their parents come up and put on a pin or medallion over their neck in diploma handing out fashion on stage.  She wanted me to do it for her because I was her ""rock"" through the past 3 years and she felt she couldn't have gotten through nursing school without me.  I ended up rejecting the offer and told her mom to do it considering her family was going to be present.  I ended up attending this event in one of my best suits with roses and she looked very happy and also complimented on how good I looked.  I told her that she looked amazing in her dress and she lit up when I told her this.  

**4.  Still having me over for dinner with the parents post breakup**

Her parents came up to school to attend her graduation and in the past couple of days I had been invited to all their dinners and activities.  It was definitely a bittersweet couple of days.  While I was very happy to be around them, it hurt that I wasn't spending time with her family as her boyfriend.  During the past couple of days I would look at her and feel extreme pain because she wasn't mine anymore.  

**5.  She wants me to move into a 1bedroom close to hers**

Self explanatory.  She still wants me to be near by.


*Overall, her actions have had a negative effect on me trying to get over her. *




Conclusion:
I will be working during the summer at an internship out of town and I  see this as a break for the both of us.  Should I shut off all contact with her and then continue to pursue her when I get back or should I start seeing other women?  Some of me wants to move on and see other girls but I also feel like if I let her go I will regret it for the rest of my life. I don't think that I am being blinded.  I really feel that she is everything I want in a woman. I am still head over heels in love with this girl.

So, reddit.  What do you think?  Should I?


TLDR version:

Perfect girl breaks up with me after 3 years.  I think she still likes me.  Should I use the summer as a break and try to slowly get back together with her again?

**Us**: dating for 2+ months (feels like so much longer for both of us), extremely communicative of whatever the situation is. Both in college, she a grad-student(F/22), I going into my senior year(M/21).

**Present**: She is travelling in Israel in her birthright, with plans to extend the trip to England and Copenhagen to visit family, eventually going back home to visit family then coming back to where I am presently. I am up in between summer jobs, waiting to hear back from several places ranging from internships to day camp.

**Situation**:Before we started going out she had mentioned that she just got out of a serious monogamous relationship 3 months prior. And that never having been single since high school, had her first casual relationship in the interim. At that time, she told me that she could back out from that while still remaining friends (they had known each other for a year prior).
From the time we started going out, she had mentioned that she was interested in sexual relationships with other people. She would mention that she could go off and try other things, and then bring them back to us. I was adamant in that I felt uncomfortable with her having sex with other people, if just for that reason alone. Time goes by, usual relationship business (date nights, movie nights, Dr. Who with her friends) and she brings it up again. This time as a friends with benefits situation. I remained open to discussion, but couldn't properly express myself (I still feel I can't). Now it turns into ""I'd like a full fledged relationship"".

**Where she's coming from**: Sex is a logical extenuation of friendship. She has such deep bonds with several of her close friends that physical intimacy is the next step. She says she loves me, and that she's looking for an ""and"" rather than an ""or"", an addition to our relationship with the close friend/casual relationship she had back prior to me. That if anything were to get in the way of us, then she would not take that route because she is happy with me. When she says all these things, I trust her, through and through. She wants to reach a point where I'll be comfortable with this just so we can try it out.

**Me**: I'm open to listening to the idea of a poly relationship, but the truth of the matter is that I'm still uncomfortable with the idea of her having a sexual relationship with someone else. When she says that it's different than with me, I understand this; it still doesn't make the fact that I gag every time I picture her with another guy any easier. It's a non-issue as long as I'm uncomfortable, she says. But the fact of the matter is I'm torn because I know this is something she wants to try and that it will make her happy; meanwhile I keep picturing her with this other guy and it is literally driving me insane. It's not even the concept of her splitting her time between the two of us, just the sex. As a result of knowing that this is what she wants, but also understanding my limits, it's just one giant ball of stress on my end because it's affecting us. I'm not as happy as I was knowing that she wants to have sex with someone else.

**Note**: Not as much now, but the it bothers me that the other guy (prior casual relationship who wants this to happen) wants this to happen as much as her, leaving me as the odd man out.

**Now**: Just got off Skype with her via Israel. I feel like a dick because here I am back home being miserable and made her sad as a result. I just can't control my brain when it comes to this. She says it's not an issue at the moment because I'm uncomfortable with it, but it's still all I can think about. I'm open to listening about it, but I really don't feel much of anything will change my mind.
I've talked to my friends about it (all think I'll lose it), I've talked to her friends about it (who are all for it as they've done it before) and all in all I'm just unhappy.

**TL:DR** Girlfriend wants to try poly, I'm uncomfortable with the idea of her having sex with other guys. Can't stop thinking about it, affecting otherwise stable relationship.

I'm sure there's more to this than I'm explaining, feel free to ask. This just seems more of a rant than anything, but any advice from a third party would be helpful.

**5/24 Update** So what I've realized after talking with her further is that I'm uncomfortable with her physical aspect because it's something I don't want to know is happening with someone else. If the situation presents itself when she comes back from her trip, I said I would be willing to try it for some undetermined time. I can see this working: the only real difference between what's already happening now is the sex, and I've asked if she was ok with several caveats. Taking the next logical step in the progression, even if this does work out for all of us and I recognize this, but don't want it to continue anyway, what would you do?

I realize that we're dealing with something that may not even happen for another two-three months, so nothing definitive can be said. Also that there are a lot of variables that need to fall in place this summer for it to happen that much sooner (me getting job in her area, him also being in the area; none of which is definite at this point). This is just where my brain is at. To me this is something serious and I'm having trouble putting it on the back burner and focusing on other things. Shes going to talk with whom she wishes to start this with at some point this weekend and then he'll talk to me. As much as I don't want to know about their relationship, I'd like to know where he sees this going in the future, his end goals, and frankly how he feels about me. Because if this is something where he just wants to experiment and have fun, I'm not sure I could go through with it. Thanks for all your words of support, you all have been more than kind and for that I am truly grateful."

hhtns,5,2011-05-23,Should I try to get back with my EX?,[deleted],relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/hhtns/should_i_try_to_get_back_with_my_ex/,"95% of the time I would agree that moving on is always the best decision.  It's part of how I am coping with it now but if you are willing to read all of it(I will do my best to not wall of text you to death), please let me know your opinion.

So here's some basic description of the two of us.
*Imo, she is basically your typical ""perfect girl.""  Stunningly beautiful(imo), great personality, smart.  She matched my personality very well.  Not extremely out going and not many close friends other than myself.

*She is 2 years older than I.

*Dated around 5-6 guys prior but each relationship lasting no longer than a year

*We have been dating for almost 3 years.  For the longest time it seemed that we were going to get married.  I wanted it, she wanted it(until now).  

*Already met the parents.  We get along very well and have had dinner many many times.  Pretty much had approval from the get go.

*The past year we moved into a 2 bedroom apartment and around the end of April she dumped me.  

*Reasons do not include seeing another guy, me cheating, her cheating, any sort of wrongdoing on both parts.  

*I still love her to death.

**Reasons why we broke up(that I can think of):**

**1.  Demand for Sex.**  
Before you make false assumptions, our sex is great.  We are very comfortable with each other and are able to get each other to climax with no problems.  We are both physically attracted to each other.  Now to get back on topic....I was often unhappy when she would continuously reject my requests for sex before we go to sleep.  Understandably she was tired because she has work, but I don't think I was overdoing it.  Usually I will never ask her after a 12 hour shift day of work for any fun time.  Normally I would not ask but if 2 or 3 days go by I will ask.  I don't think it's too unreasonable in that case to get some action.  When it goes on for a week I will noticeable be a little frustrated.    

**2.  Our living environment.  **

We are both pretty messy individuals so our place often times gets pretty messy fast.  We are both very tolerant of it but I sometimes think that if I had been more clean and provided a nicer living environment for her things may have been different.  

Also, in the past year we went and started raising 2 kittens and a puppy.  I did not know I would have a negative relationship with cats until we started raising two cats.  Since I was always more of a dog person I was not used to how cats were not as loyal and loving.  Quickly I began to hate the cats and often times was visibly frustrated at them.  The added on responsibilities of raising cats, housebreaking a puppy may have been too much for us to handle.  This definitely added on additional stress.

**3.  Relationship gone vanilla.  Got too comfortable.**  

In the past year we haven't had as much time to go out and do things and explore life.  She being a nursing student and also working full time during the weekends, it was hard finding time to spend time and have fun together.  Simply going out to dinner doesn't really cut it.  I'm talking more like going out hiking, traveling, trying new things, exploring life.  It's hard to blame this on either person as we are both college students with heavy workloads and the fire in all relationships eventually die down.  I was still very happy with the relationship as is.  In fact I was still very much in love with her.  I figured that when I graduated and started working I would be able to do this again.  It seems that she did not feel this way.

**4.  Age?  Inexperience?**

I am 21 and she is 23.  She has dated 5 people prior and me only 1.  Her stints last around 6-8 months normally and my previous gf also lasted around 2 years.  


**5.  I put too much responsibility on her to making me happy.**  

During one of our post-break up conversations she told me that she always felt pressure because she felt that I found nothing in life to make me happy other than her.  This is slightly true since most of my time is spent studying and going to classes, and coming home and seeing her does bring great joy in my life.  I don't see this as anything wrong.  I would have thought this was a plus.  Inversely, I haven't had as much time to pursue hobbies or do things together as stated above in #3.  I spend much of my time in front of a computer either surfing or doing homework.




**The Break-Up:**

Ever since March, she insisted that we should move back into separate 1 bed room apartments side by side to each other.  I did not understand the reason for this as we would have had to pay much more money.  This argument persisted until she blurted out that we should break up.  For some reason it did not occur to me that the reason why she wanted us to move out was that she probably did not enjoy living with me anymore.  


**Coping with the breakup:**
I will admit that it was excruciating.  Considering it was around the time I needed to really gear down and study for finals it was very difficult to harbor my emotions.  It also did not help that we had to still live together until 5/25/2011(next week).  It was very strange because during the day we would act as if everything was normal and we were good friends still.  But, when night time came and I had to sleep alone, I felt immense pain and felt very lonely.   It was a very difficult month but friends, exercise, and pursuing old hobbies has helped distract me.  I feel like I've survived the experience and have matured greatly from it.  I've begun to find more ways to enjoy life and myself instead of putting all my happiness into my girlfriend.






 Now, Reddit.  Here is where I want to get your opinion.  She has had some pretty interesting things which make me wonder if it means that she still has feelings for me or not.  Reddit girls, let me know what you think and what a typical girl is thinking when they do these things.  

**These events occur post break up**

**1.  She offered to let me live with her in her 1 bedroom apartment.**

She began to feel guilty about having to make me go live in a 1bed which is noticeably more expensive than splitting a 2 bed and making me and my dad pay more.  I would be sleeping in the living room while she took the bedroom.   Seemed kind of strange but I accepted and it seemed as if we were both very happy with this decision.  The next day she changed her mind and decided not to let me move in.  

**2.  Chasing me at school.**

One time I drove to school while she walked because she wanted exercise.  I arrived at school and parked in the parking lot.  Suddenly I notice someone tapping my shoulder and it ended up being my ex who had ran across the entire parking lot to catch up and walk with me.

**3.  Asking me to pin her at her nursing graduation pinning ceremony**

Usually this is considered more important than your typical graduation for nursing students.  Usually, students have their parents come up and put on a pin or medallion over their neck in diploma handing out fashion on stage.  She wanted me to do it for her because I was her ""rock"" through the past 3 years and she felt she couldn't have gotten through nursing school without me.  I ended up rejecting the offer and told her mom to do it considering her family was going to be present.  I ended up attending this event in one of my best suits with roses and she looked very happy and also complimented on how good I looked.  I told her that she looked amazing in her dress and she lit up when I told her this.  

**4.  Still having me over for dinner with the parents post breakup**

Her parents came up to school to attend her graduation and in the past couple of days I had been invited to all their dinners and activities.  It was definitely a bittersweet couple of days.  While I was very happy to be around them, it hurt that I wasn't spending time with her family as her boyfriend.  During the past couple of days I would look at her and feel extreme pain because she wasn't mine anymore.  

**5.  She wants me to move into a 1bedroom close to hers**

Self explanatory.  She still wants me to be near by.


*Overall, her actions have had a negative effect on me trying to get over her. *




Conclusion:
I will be working during the summer at an internship out of town and I  see this as a break for the both of us.  Should I shut off all contact with her and then continue to pursue her when I get back or should I start seeing other women?  Some of me wants to move on and see other girls but I also feel like if I let her go I will regret it for the rest of my life. I don't think that I am being blinded.  I really feel that she is everything I want in a woman. I am still head over heels in love with this girl.

So, reddit.  What do you think?  Should I?


TLDR version:

Perfect girl breaks up with me after 3 years.  I think she still likes me.  Should I use the summer as a break and try to slowly get back together with her again?

hhtdv,5,2011-05-23,To remember or not to remember...[tl;dr at bottom],youarealwaysthereMD,ForeverAlone,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone/comments/hhtdv/to_remember_or_not_to_remembertldr_at_bottom/,"For most of my youth I was pretty much alone, save a few friends that I barely saw off of the internet.  Senior year of high school I met an amazing (well, amazing then) girl, and after we both worked through our awkwardness we ended up in one of those relationships everyone envies.  But my depression and self-sabotaging tendencies got the worst of me, and slowly but surely our relationship tanked.  I was too good for her (in terms of gifts, willingness, ridiculous personal beliefs), and she was too complacent, too willing to do what I asked.  Eventually she became so ""indebted"" to me things got out of hand.  Add to that the fact that we spent 2/3 of the year apart due to school, things basically fell apart.  When I pushed her too far, she finally cheated on me to escape it all, and that's when she chose to end it (online, after 3 years, what a disrespectful end to rip all of my self-esteem and confidence away from me).  

Needless to say, I spent about a year to this day trying to get over her, and to be honest (and this is the most scary thing I've admitted), I'm still not over her.  I'm still not over that girl whose become a pot-head slut wannabe, who almost failed out of her grade and internship.

Lately I've been doing okay, but I always allow myself to relive all those memories, especially the breakup, right when I need to study for important exams or have projects to do.  This sends me tailspinning.  (Also, pretty sure I just messed up an opportunity to have sex with one of my few girl friends).  

But there were many good memories, those innocent memories. There will always be the memories of those days spent together, the nights spend exploring each other, and those moments when we just sat together, in love, needing nothing but closeness to one another.

So my question to you, FA (and reddit), is should I keep the memories I have of her (conversations, pictures, etc.), or should I finally purge my life of every living memory of her?  Be honest, and spare no judgement.

TL;DR: GF left me a year ago, and to my dismay I'm still trying to get over her and rebuild my life (a life I've spend alone beside from her).  Should I keep my memories of her (physical and emotional) or get rid of everything?  Spare no judgement and be brutally honest."
hhosx,9,2011-05-22,I'm 21 and have never had a real job. How can I get started with an IT career?,wannafixyocomp,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/hhosx/im_21_and_have_never_had_a_real_job_how_can_i_get/,"I'm the stereotypical ""computer kid"". People have paid me to fix their computers and to do things for them in Microsoft Word. At best I've done an unofficial, unpaid internship at a small computer repair shop with the vague promise that I would be hired if I could get my own transportation. I still don't have a car.

I've looked around and read all kinds of mixed up things about getting certification, experience, etc. Some people say that A+ certification is laughable and worthless, while others say it's great for getting my foot in the door. I don't even know, at this point, where to go if I even do get A+. MCITP? Network+? MCSA? Is there a straight path to take, a way to get experience? How do I get educated? How do I get experience?

I'm really at a huge slump in my life too. My parents are pushing me to get a job. I constantly feel like a helpless baby, especially when someone says ""Oh, you're living with your parents?"" I have no real-world experience. I'm scared completely out of my mind, but I want to get out there and try my hand at getting paid for what I know I can be good at. I want to be working for a company while knowing that they actually need me.

I'm not asking for anything except information and advice. Regardless, I have the materials I need to study for the A+ exams and I want to pass them in order to at least feel like I'm doing something worthwhile. That goes a long way, at least for me.

Thanks in advance, reddit. You guys are awesome.

tl;dr I've never had a real job and I want to have an IT career, but I don't know where to go. What certifications can I get, and what paths can I take? How can I set myself apart and compete in the job market?"

himcc,14,2011-05-24,Apple replaced my shattered iPhone 4 today free of charge.,fanel345,iphone,https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/himcc/apple_replaced_my_shattered_iphone_4_today_free/,"So I was taking an intern out to lunch today when on the way back to my car I took out my iPhone to check if it was going to rain anymore. I guess today my fingers must have been made of butter and as I took it out of my pocket I ended up juggling it into the air. Well the juggling didn't make me catch it, instead it ended up going higher into the air until it came down flat on the ground and I heard an audible *POP*. 

Picking it up I knew I was screwed and sure enough the entire front screen was shattered. Even the corners looked like it had been mangled in a losing fight with a lawnmower and it had landed flat on it's face. Fortunately it was still usable even though it had small pieces of glass coming off it when I swiped across it. So I made an appointment at the local genius bar.

When I walked into the genius bar after checking in I had about a 30 minute wait until one of the Apple guys introduced me to a genius and told me he was going to be double tasking me with another person. He asked what was wrong and as soon as I took my iPhone out he cringed. I told him what had happened and before my first attempt at iPhone juggling it was working fine. That's when he told me it was going to be $200 to replace it and that's all they could do for me.

I told him I had to have it replaced as getting small fragments of glass in my finger every time I tried to answer a phone call wasn't an option. That's when he told me to hold on a minute and went into the back. When he came out he asked me if I thought I was lucky. I told him no since my career as an iPhone juggler was quickly coming to an end and that's when he dropped the kicker, he was going to replace my iPhone free of charge. I signed a piece of paper saying he gave me an iPhone and left.

I can't believe it. I don't know if this is Apple policy or the guy just was truly being nice. Whatever the case I know that Apple has cemented my business for future items.

**tl;dr** Dropped my iPhone, went to the Apple store and fessed up that it was my fault, amazingly got a new iPhone 4 free of charge.

Now on to the problem, I've built one or two very successful AMD based builds, using newegg and tigerdirect for parts. I'm looking to completely overhaul my current PC, which to give you an idea, has:

* AMD Phenom II X2 Black Edition CPU
* 2 GB RAM (Can't remember the type as I'm on my laptop)
* ATI 4650 

I built this almost 3 years ago during my WoW era, and as a consequence, it doesn't run (well) a whole lot of newer games I want to play. 

What I would like to do is build a completely new PC, but I'm having a tough time deciding if I want to go the AMD, or the Intel route. 

I was thinking about the i5 2500k, and the HD 6950, but I have little experience with Intel and any mobos that are needed for Intel builds. Can anyone offer any advice?

**edit:**
 My budget is around the $1,200 ballpark, and I don't really need to have it right away. I have an internship this summer that is going to be covering the majority of this build, so at the end of the summer is when I'd really start building.

hihl6,5,2011-05-23,"I see your fired girlfriend and I raise you a fired spouse who engaged in what could be considered an emotional affair with a homeless, mentally ill client.",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/hihl6/i_see_your_fired_girlfriend_and_i_raise_you_a/,"My spouse of five years and I were in charge of running a program for homeless individuals (transitional, long term housing), mainly focusing on mentally ill adults.  I have been in the field for 5 years, working for this particular company for about 4.  My wife came on board nearly 2 years ago on a part time basis.  It is worth noting that while we get along well both professionally and personally, our marriage had been on the rocks basically from the beginning.  In Feb, my wife went to full time to cover me while i pursued an internship for my masters program.  Somewhere around the time that this all went down, she also began wanting to consider divorce.

We had a resident who was our age, intellectually high functioning and likable.  We had both remarked that he could be a friend, in another context.  About three months ago, I started noticing that my wife was treating him differently than other clients and spending exorbitant amounts of time with him.  I, inappropriately, confronted her at home about what I was noticing.  She denied it, said her Methods were clinically justifiable and asked if I was jealous of one of our clients.  I subsequently brought my concerns to our supervisor who shrugged me off, suggesting that my thinking was off due to our increasing marital strife (which I had kept her aware of).  Despite being shut down twice, my suspicions remained (though I felt quite paranoid for it).  I found my wife lying to me regarding being with him at points during the daytime.  I began tracking her with find my iPhone and noticed inconsistencies in where she said she was vs where she actually was.  I never addressed it directly but made passive aggressive attempts to communicate that I was on to her...even though I didn't know what.  My wife is very sharp and I couldn't imagine her actually cheating with a client, despite the fact that tHis was my prevalent fear.  

Everything came to a head when I looked into her personal email, after catching her in a few more lies, and found correspondence between the two of them, including mention of me and my insecurities regarding them.  I saved this info and sent it onto my supervisor, mainly because I didn't know what to do.  I knew my wife would be outraged that I went into her email.  My supervisor attempted to gently address this by issuing a company-wide policy forbidding communication with clients via personal methods and outside of the workplace.  She then specifically addressed this with my wife and this client.  I then began hearing rumors from my other residents that something was going on between my wife and this resident.  This was a few Fridays ago.

Finally, the following Sunday, my wife said she was going to the grocery store.  I was suspicious and checked the location of her phone.  I could see that she was stopping off at our workplace.  I hopped in my car (with our two children) and met her and the client of them in a park where she had taken him.  I took pictures for any potential legal purposes and there was a intense, but not explosive confrontation.  

Later that night she came home and we talked about it.  She informed me that they had not slept together but had kissed that day after the confrontation and said that she loved him.  She also stated that she couldn't say whether she loved me and still didn't want to be with me.  

She lost her job the next day, he lost his housing a few days later.  She still sees him ""as a friend"" sporadically and we are currently taking time to figure out where we go from here.  We have been up and down alot, emotionally, as you can imagine.  I had initially stated that if she wanted to consider staying with me, she needs to commit to working on the relationship and cut him out.  She agreed to this but then backtracked a few times, saying she felt forced into it (with the alternative being that she loses her home and potentially the kids).  We are in a holding pattern because she feels she cannot make any decisions, even regarding him or me, at this point.  We are both in therapy working on the issues that led us to this point.  

She is still very angry at me for invading her personal space and betraying her by sharing it with our supervisor.  I am able to respect and understand that.  She also feels that the company was overly punitive for both her and the client. That one, I'm not so sure about.  She says she connected with him because he listened to her and made her feel okay about various qualities.  Said she could talk to him about anything, that they thought alike and felt he was deep. Said she also related to him in regard to her own ""mental health"". These are certainly things that our marriage was missing and I can freely acknowledge it.  She feels the romance/sexual attraction resulted from the secrecy and hiding.  keep in mind, while I was in the dark about them, she concluded that she was not sexually attracted to me and that I was not deep enough for her.

People she talks to say ""he turned you in?!?"" and people I've talked to seem to think I'm being too passive and that I did exactly what any other guy would've done.  

So, what say you, reddit?  And this can be an AMA as well, I suppose.  In fact, she is a redditor and is considering doing her own AMA.

Tl;dr my wife and I ran a homeless program for mentally ill.  My Erie had an emotional affair to a client and the result of my actions left her unemployed."

Last summer, she was just about to start grad school and then her father passed away so she went back to Japan to take care of her mother for a little while. She was supposed to come back to the US and resume her studies, but now that looks like that isn't happening. See [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/hjdiq/long_distance_relationship_with_girl_from_japan/) for details (Its long...).

Meanwhile, I'm one online class away from graduating with a Computer Science degree, and I'm in a pretty good position in my life to move to her instead. I also studied Japanese (never got a minor or anything, just took language classes) and I've been there a couple times now so its not going to be a giant shock for me to go to move there; I'm sure it will take time to adjust, but I really love learning the language and culture. 

However, I need a job. Specifically, one that will get me a visa so that I can live there. I have about 3 years of experience now working at various internships, and my Japanese ability is probably daily conversational (on a good day). I really don't care what it is- if I have to bite the bullet and teach English or something that would be tolerable- but since I have an actual skill thats in demand, it would be much preferred to do something in the IT industry. I'm hoping to visit her this summer for a few months and look for a job, but until then, I'm stuck here in the US so that probably makes it more difficult as well. 

Does anyone have any suggestions or advice?"

hjvge,5,2011-05-25,Young Engineer: Office Leadership,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/hjvge/young_engineer_office_leadership/,"Hello Everyone! 

I am a mechanical engineering student in my senior year, working my last co-op rotation at a company I would really like to be hired after I graduate next year. I also would like to apply for the company’s career development program which is a fast track to a supervisor/manager role. 

To get into this program the student must have a combination of grades, work experience and extracurricular activities, especially in a leadership role. My grades are average for an engineer and my work experience is very extensive IMO.

This summer I am kind of working with a few freshmen interns. We are not all working on the same exact projects but we are in the same department and all sitting at the same cubes. I feel this is a great opportunity to get some leadership experience and to help the interns out too.

I need your help and ideas to prove to my boss and his boss that I am a capable leader AND this would be a good topic to discuss with the career development committee when they select candidates next year.

What are some ideas to organize and lead the interns?  I just grabbed a big whiteboard and cabinets for the team.

Thanks in advance!

Specialist/some web dev in the Seattle area,LordStandley,forhire,https://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/hjty7/for_hire_it_specialistsome_web_dev_in_the_seattle/,"My wife just accepted a job in Gig Harbor and now I am looking to relocate to the Seattle area in the next couple months. 

I have a bachelors degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Multimedia. 
I have school experience with Java, Python, but have not programmed since leaving school two years ago. Definitely something I could relearn and bring back up to speed if needed.

For the past year and a half I have been working as an I.T. Specialist for an Environmental Saftey consulting firm, doing mainly desktop support, all aspects from hardware and software configuration, Windows OS, Windows Server, Mac OS, Office suites. In addition I do occasionally work with our servers (Dell 710/510) Active Directory, Group Policy, Microsoft Exchange.

In the past I did web design for about 5 years for small clients. Strong skills in HTML, CSS, XHTML, and basic skills in XML, JavaScript, PHP. Something again I can bring up to speed if needed. Just never had the need for any projects I worked on so I never spent much time mastering. 
I also worked on the new US Department of Radiation website during my internship with www.PNNL.gov
I did about 90% of the data migration and formatting of the site content from the old site to the new site, located here. http://lowdose.energy.gov/

I have over 10 years working directly in customer service in the medical environment, and also the retail environment doing sales and as a supervisor. I can assure you that I am a reliable prospect able to jump right in, and I do not look for the easy way out. I have had (aside from one internship right out of school) three jobs, including my current place of employment, in the past 14 years.

I am looking to stay within I.T. But of course would consider other opportunities as well. I really enjoy working with all the hardware and back end equipment and would love to continue that career path. I would also like a permanent position as opposed to contract.
I am looking for a salary in the range of $60,000 to $70,000, but I do not moving up a ladder to that goal either.
I can send resume if interested. 
I'd rather not post all my information online.

Thanks, Jeff"
hjnoc,2,2011-05-25,In college for a ME degree in Texas. Any hope of leaving?,Nathan_BS,IWantOut,https://www.reddit.com/r/IWantOut/comments/hjnoc/in_college_for_a_me_degree_in_texas_any_hope_of/,"So I have finished two semesters at a low-cost college in Texas using the Texas Tomorrow Fund, a college system which allows for somebody's family to make gradual payments into the program, then the kid will use that money to go on to college. The only loans I have accepted were to rent books and to have cash to eat on campus, so I would say that equates to around $1000.  I have finished my Physics portion, two semesters of history, and one ethics course for engineering.
Like many people here, I want out of America. I have yet to decide where to, but really right now I just want out of here before it's too late.  I'm watching our political system run our country into the ground with the help of big corporations which feed off of nothing but profits and practically farm us citizens for cash, at the expense of our well-being. I don't want to fight an inevitable fight. In fact, I don't want to be a part of it at all.
I have decided that my most open option would be Mexico, since I'm in Texas.  Of course, Mexico isn't in such a great shape either.  So if not Mexico, I guess I could flee to Canada? Of course this is a very long trip, so I have calculated that, by driving using stocked-up gas tanks from my city (~3.75 atm), that I would be spending an average of 376.83 when driving my 25 mpg car. Of course I could save some gas by leaving in the winter, but anything could happen in the given time. I will also need money for food, which I guess would be about $100 if I eat sparingly. Then there's the loan I need to pay back, before it starts adding interest. (all subsidized, thankfully) So adding in motel costs, I am looking at, hopefully, only around $1700 in costs to leave by car. Of course I could leave by airplane, but I would be packing a lot. In fact, far too much to actually be worth the cost of shipping. I have a pretty roomy car, so driving looks more attractive.
Of course I don't have $2k stashed in my closet right now, (and screw banks too) so I need to get a decent job and save/raise some cash. I currently work at the Cowboys Stadium, so I don't get much of a paycheck, but I am job searching and hopefully I find something pretty decent. (and legal!) I guess I could also sell some of my unimportant commodies which I have bought over the years? Another delay in the road may be that I might get accepted for an internship at Bell Helicopter (not so much snag, as much as a magnificent blessing involving some patience) where, if I do intern for them, I am obligated to work for their company for two years after graduating.  So here are my current questions:

* What can I expect as far as starting a new life in a Canadian city?
* Should I finish college in Texas, given that I quit taking loans and continue with the Texas Tomorrow Plan?
* Will there be any other sure expenses which I haven't taken into account?
* Should I intern at Bell Helicopter? Will two years of experience + internship with their company look good to Canadian engineer firms?
* Are there any legalities involving leaving the US to Canada? ( I couldn't find any)
* Other places are also in consideration, unless they are within US border. Any closer well-off countries which I have overlooked?
* If I get an friend to save up some cash, would it be a good idea to bring him/her along to help ease the boredom of a multiple-day trip?

Ultimately I think it would be nice to live in Sydney.  The thought of living in Australia has always seemed very cool to me, especially as a kid when I watched The Crocodile Hunter all the time.  Of course I know the very notion of moving to Sydney right out of college is ludicrous, so I am going somewhere somewhat reasonable (Canada?)

Any helpful advise?

EDIT: I have decided that I am waiting until after I finish college to make the big move. In the meanwhile I will be doing research on how to get a visa, and possibly join a program for studying abroad so I can get a feel for another country, possibly across the sea.  I would probably also talk to my family and friends about it first. I see the most resistance with my family though, they have a very pro-american mindset and I need to explain to them why this is such an important choice to me.  Thanks for the help!"
hjmx1,11,2011-05-25,Junior IT Web Position,mattaugamer,brisbane,https://www.reddit.com/r/brisbane/comments/hjmx1/junior_it_web_position/,"I have an IT position available at my day job (quite a few people know my... night job, and I just want to clarify) and I'd rather employ a redditor slash awesome person than trawl through randoms from SEEK, so I figured I might post here, if that's alright?

Here's the position description in general: 

A new IT project is looking for a full time IT Support person and intern, to provide support to the Senior Developer. The role would involve learning a lot of valuable skills, including web development, Salesforce Administration and general IT support.

What we're ideally wanting is someone with as much interest and exposure as possible to a range of IT tasks, including PHP, CSS, MySQL, Email Config, Office, Apple, Windows, cPanel, Reddit...

This position would suit a junior web developer who is willing to take on IT support work, or a skilled IT support person who is willing to learn web development.

Salary will be based on skill and experience, but within a fairly broad range.

SalesForce experience would be super highly regarded, but not an expectation for this role.

As said earlier, this is a full time role, and would not suit a current student.


The position (and also salary) is actually fairly vague in that we'd tailor the position to what we get, rather than looking for a really specific set of skills.

If you are (or know someone who is) a tech supporter with web dev experience, or a starting web developer who knows their stuff outside of the web dev environment (setting up laptops, doing data entry, etc) feel free to PM me.

This is a career starting entry level position in a fun and casual small company, not a step in a career for a proficient developer / programmer, so there's no need for years of experience or super high level skills.

Feel free to PM me (as I said before), or if you want to ask questions, abuse me for random things, or make a series of puns that distract from the point of the post... hey, it's reddit, that's what the comments are for!

Hey guys (and girls).

Myself and some guys have had a version of this site internally in our job for a few years. We decided it was time to let it loose to the world and see what everyone thinks.
Sadly we had to take a large amount of the content off, as it was incriminating to us... and our employer.

Feedback is welcome. Hope you guys like it., Feel free to add to the list we've been making over the last week.

It all started one day as a joke because one intern wasn't doing shit, even though he would tell us otherwise.


We are all serverside developers, so its not pretty. It never was, so we just left it at that.

I’m a little nervous. 

I don’t want to admit that it’s my first time, but it is. I’m nineteen and a bit clumsy; I fumble in my wallet while her eyes stare holes into me. I would be lying if I said I wasn’t a little scared, a little anxious, and a bit excited. There is a line behind me. I have to hurry I tell myself, and I finally find what I’m looking for within my wallet. I slide my trailpass through card reader and move backwards through the bus to find a seat next to a decrepit looking lady who seems either to have several cats, or killed her first husband and locked his mutilated body in the basement freezer. This is my first time on the bus, but it won’t be my last. My internship deep within the confines of Shallcross Bus Depot had just started and I would be making the almost two hour trip, daily, for the next six months.  

It’s November, and I knew I was about to get into it, a bad situation, the shit, nothing good. There are no seats except near the back of the bus where all the high school and remedial school kids sat. My IPod’s batteries died on the subway earlier, but I had learned to stick the ear buds into my ear just in case someone decides that I look like I’m interested in the fact that they used to live in Maryland, but they moved down here in 1995 with their ex husband, and now they work retail at the Franklin Mills Mall, but things are looking up because their youngest son just graduated high school, and their middle daughter is about to leave the correctional facility she was in for assaulting two other women at a corner store because they cut in line. There’s no music playing, but the illusion keeps the crazy away to point.
 
I take a seat behind a group of tattooed African American youth. I know they’re only starting high school or ending middle school because they can’t be much taller than my shoulder. Every one of them has a cacophony of tattoos. From their necks to their hands; stars, names, skulls, skylines, teardrops, chains, and other generally unsettling things I’m not used to seeing on a kids shorter than 5’3”.  At this point I’m feeling a little out of place. My khakis and tucked in Polo clearly mark me as an outsider here. I lack that generally menacing look in my eye, and this probably signals to these kids I’m not from around there. No one seems to mind my presence so far. No comments were made in indecipherable Ebonics in my direction and I took this as a good sign. Like a rabbit that had made a home among wolves I felt a little strange, but it’s either this or standing, and I was much too lazy for that. 

The bus stops. A large black man in hospital scrubs gets on and sits across from me. He ran into the same problem I did with the lack of space. He’s massive. At least 6’3” and severely built, his trapezius muscles look like they are trying to break free of his neck. The short sleeves he wears show off a mosaic. Tattoos that took years to acquire, some fading with age, others standing on edge, like they have just been placed there, years of intertwining ink blending into his skin. I try not to stare.
  
 Crack. Skittle. Skittle. Brush. Then the soft sound of cigar tobacco hitting the floor of the bus, followed by the sweet, sticky, slightly repulsive smell of marijuana. 

“Yo fool, you best roll that blunt right, nigga,” says a voice I’m not supposed to be hearing. 

“Shut up cuz, I got this shit,” replies another voice I’m not listening too. 

“ha ha you nigga’s better not spill any my fucking weed,” chimes in a third. 

“I can’t believe that nigga Trey, fucking bailing on Saturday. I had to run for like four blocks before I lost the cops,” Says another

“You still on that shit, cousin,” says a voice I think I have heard before. 

“Fuck him, If I ever see that nigga again, I’ll get J’s gun and lay that nigga out,” Says a voice I’m definitely not supposed to be hearing. 

“Yo nigga your rolling that jawn too tight!,” Erupts a voice.
“Chill cousin, chill,” soothes another. 

“How we going to fucking sort Trey out man,” inquires one of them. 

“Fuckin’ A, man I’ll swing by J’s and talk to him about a gun,” One of them not quite whispers. 

I’m at the edge of my seat. I’m pretending with all my might that I’m tuning into some music, because I’m clearly not supposed to be hearing this. It clearly sounds like these kids probably all less than 15 years old are planning to kill someone. Someone named Trey, who clearly bailed on Saturday. I try not to laugh at how simply ludicrous this seems. I put all of my effort into becoming scenery.

Then something unexpected happens. My fellow passenger, the man in the scrubs with all the arm tattoos and the bulging trapezius muscles leans forward. He is not wearing headphones. He is not pretending to listen to music. He looks like he has a lot more in common with these kids than I do. The look on his face is stern. As he shifts his massive body towards them, one of them catches his monolithic figure moving slightly towards the posse out of the corner of his eye and prompts the others silently to turn towards him. I catch all of their faces, I’m still wall paper. 

“If you’re going to do some shit like that, you tell no one,” says the man. 

He leans back. He has finished talking. The kids all stare at him for another minute. Some of them have their jaws visibly dropped. The one with the blunt has tucked it behind his ear. 

“Aw, sheet,” is the only thing one of them says as he pulls the line to signal the next stop. 

Then in an almost eerie silence they depart. Some with their heads low, other’s talking about sparking that shit. 

I continue to sit there, I’m still wallpaper. 

Only 45 more minutes to go.

However, I've realized that I have little interest in lab research or going to med school like the vast, vast majority of my peers in my major.

I've always had a love of programming and computers and learned the basics of C back in elementary school, along with several other languages, and now do robotics building at my university. Just how hard would it be for me to get a decent paying job in software development right after graduation? I have no formal CS education, and no time/money to switch my major. However, I'm very knowledgeable about technology, have been writing code for personal use most my life, and am at least competent in a handful of languages. Not to brag, but I have an impressive resume otherwise (full ride scholarship to this top school along with a handful of non-profit social work internships) but relatively no university education/experience outside of AVR programming for the robotics competitions.

Any advice/warnings? Is it even likely I could find a decent paying job fresh out of college without a CS major or will I just be laughed out of interviews? Will I be throwing away anything by not using my (fairly prestigious) neuroscience degree?"

I worked as the Senior Systems/Network Administrator for a company for almost 5 years.  The company had 75 employees and 3 in IT: Director of IT, Me, and the Helpdesk/Configuration Technician (and technically two more IT ""interns"" - one was a web developer and the other was the nephew of the owner).  When I started, there were no Group Policies, no controls on equipment or software installs, and everything was basically an ""honor system"".  I got things locked down without being too intrusive.  Part of my day was testing software and patches before rolling out to the general employees.

The IT force (Director, helpdesk, interns, and myself) would play jokes on one another during absences - if the director would go on vacation we would foil his office, or when the interns would go on vacation we'd change their profiles and passwords etc.  They had never ""gotten"" me.  To make sure my record would stay intact, I installed some encryption software on my workstation PC.

During last year employed there, I requested and was given a 2 week vacation. On my way out the door, the IT director asked for my password and I gave it to him.  Halfway through the vacation - when I was out of the country - I received a phone call asking for the password.  The last day of my vacation I received a call from the owner saying the company was ""moving in a different direction"" and that I would no longer be employed there.

When filling out unemployment benefits, my form was rejected because the company stated I was fired due to violation of the company conduct handbook.  That ""installing encryption software without informing anyone in management of the password"" led to my termination.

Fast forward 18 months - The local police arrested me for Computer Tampering.  Basically the law reads that if you install any software, or alter the computer in any way - without permission - that you're in violation of this law.  I don't disagree that I installed the encryption software.  Apparently I'm allowed to install any number of software titles - and even reformat the workstation several times (XP was on there 3 different times, then Vista a couple times) - but if you encrypt you must be a criminal.

Now when you google for my name you can find ""arrested for computer tampering"" pages.  That'll make finding a new job much more difficult.

So yeah, I was arrested for doing my job and testing software."

I am currently a sophomore Computer Engineering major and am currently debating whether to stay in my major or switch to computer science. This is partially due to my change of interests and concern about my GPA, but I really am not sure what I should do. 

Right now my GPA isn’t so great (2.5). I am also a student athlete in a highly touted program, which takes a lot of my time, but my education is still very important to me. So far I’ve taken mostly core engineering classes, a lot of which are EE classes on circuit theory and analysis, which I really don’t enjoy. My professors haven’t been stellar in those classes, but I am just not enjoying them either (I usually eek out Cs in those).  My computer engineering classes, which have mostly been intro classes and on programming microcontrollers I do enjoy much more (usually Bs). Computer Science has always been my thing, and I find it really easy to understand, so I usually get As in those classes. 

I’ve always had an interest in robotics, and really like programming microcontrollers and working with systems similar to that, which is why I chose Computer Engineering. I’ve had computer science internships for three summers now and enjoy programming.  I am not entirely sure what I want to do when I graduate, but I feel a Comp. Engineering degree gives me more options. My concern is my GPA, and how much that will effect me getting jobs.  Also a Comp. Science degree is a BS, not an engineering degree, which I think will also change job possibilities.  I’m a crossroads and not sure what I should do. Any help is greatly appreciated

Just some quick information: we are both 21 years old (I'm a male) and we have been together for 6 months.

My friend jokingly asked my girlfriend if she's okay with me working abroad after college (I fully intend to do so), which lead to talking about my internship I have to do next year (4 months)

I told my girlfriend I probably won't do it, and stay here for my internship. She then asked why I won't do it abroad

I told her I probably won't get selected either way (my grades aren't all that good), I can't handle it financially (I'm a student living on his own, got kicked out of my parents house/financial support) and that I don't think it's a good thing for our relationship to be apart for such a long time (I wouldn't be able to see her once during those 4 months)

She now keeps telling me I HAVE to do it, that it's an opportunity of a life time, and if she's such a big reason for me to say no, she would even leave me.

This makes me feel really uncomfortable/sad

She is not the main reason (mainly the financial part, I **won't** be able to pay for it) but she's a reason as well

Is there anything I can do?"
hmr0l,1,2011-05-29,Request Advice to Avoid Ending It (wall o' text),kagiri,BreakUps,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/hmr0l/request_advice_to_avoid_ending_it_wall_o_text/,"For the past few months, there's been a definite trend in my relationship with my girlfriend: she has become incredibly distant and without affection, to the point where it's a chore to talk to her at all about anything.

A bit of background: I'm 22, she's 23. We've known each other since 2006, but only in the last 10 months have we been together. Before we finally hooked up and became 'a thing' officially, she had been in nothing but shitty relationships, all of which were degrading to her (a couple even involving verbal abuse against her). Additionally, her life aside from bad boyfriends has been incredibly stressful and painful for her. I was her first ""good relationship"".

As far as me, I've had mostly good, if unremarkable relationships in the past. I'm pretty whitebread, and don't find many insecurities or baggage with myself.

We live in different states.

In the typical honeymoon phase, we got along so well that I could hardly believe what had happened, even despite her past and current troubles. There was an undeniable sense of great love on both of our parts - indeed, she even told me that she'd never said that she loved anyone as quickly as she had with me - and I couldn't believe our compatibility. We loved video games, had similar musical tastes, and could talk about anything and everything for hours, via phone or by texting.

A few months in, she graduated with her bachelor's degree and planned to hop into grad school. This was when she first visited. Every part of those few days was blissful and perfect. When she had to fly back home, we both ended up crying at the airport, and promised we'd visit again soon. In all, she's been over with me once, and I've visited twice, with the last being in January.

The trouble began in March of this year. Her graduate courses began stacking up and overloading her in adjunct with her terrible retail job and chronic illness. I tried to be there all the time, as often as I could, often getting in trouble at my own job for texting her and calling her when I shouldn't have had my phone out. She's a trouper, and made it through just about everything life had been throwing at her, all while maintaining our relationship.

We had an understanding of the importance of school in her life. It was essentially an all-encompassing effort to at the least better her chances of working within her field tenably. She had done so much, in fact, that she began to amplify her illness as a result of the stress. Ulcers, mystery illness, breakouts, near-meltdowns, the works. During all of this, I knew just how fragile she was at this stage in her life and did all I could to support and encourage her, and she continued being as sweet and lovely as she ever was.

Then, gradually, our text conversations shrank in volume and frequency, and began to contain less and less of the same affection there once was. Her sex drive had vanished since the beginning of March. Even still, we got along just about as well as we used to (it took very much rationalizing on my part to not confront her about what I took as a sign of distance). We then had our first real fight when I brought up that distance I felt.

She flipped her shit. Told me I didn't understand what she was going through, how disappointed in me she was because she was convinced that we were okay, and that I knew what she was putting up with. And, knowing how much shit had utterly buried her life, I relented. I agreed with her, asserting that I did understand her workload and that I was only worried about us.

We haven't had a phone call since sometime before that fight (which was expressed through texts). I've tried to initiate them, but every time I call her without us planning it first, she doesn't answer, excusing her way out of it; every time I try to plan with her, she evades it, or doesn't even acknowledge that I mentioned it at all. She never makes calls to me, either.

In the time since then (about the middle of April), she's finished her first semester of grad school, left her old, shit job, and even been accepted at a couple of internships. Life seems to be improving for her. Our relationship has very greatly stagnated, however. We've gone for about 1-2 days at a time without contact at a time. She has little or no apparent affection for me anymore (I haven't been told that she loves me in a week or so). I've lost sleep over it and have become an emotional wreck. I'm afraid to bring anything up with her, because she'll most likely either A) snap at me for not being understanding enough; or B) will completely ignore what I say.

As it is now: we haven't spoken in a day or two, our conversations are comparatively miniscule, and I feel extremely unloved and neglected. I'm torn between wanting to break up with her and move on, and not wanting it to end, but being unable to confront the issue with her since we have only ""spoken"" through texts for months now, and not wanting to lose her more than I've ever wanted not to lose anything in my life.

I'm on the brink, reddit. What can I do? What *should* I do? Thanks for reading.

**UPDORT** 6/4
Finally, after four days of no contact, I texted her again and told her everything that's been troubling me. I asked if she thought the relationship was tenable (she didn't know). I let her know that I felt neglected and that I didn't know if she still loved me. I explained that I understood her priorities, and was willing to work with her to format some sort of schedule so we could stay in contact while still respecting her very busy and demanding schedule.

She refused.

She told me that I was ""demanding everything"" from her, and that I was ""upset and angry"" about how her every waking moment was dedicated to me. After I said that wasn't so, she told me she needed to think and would talk to me later. 

What the fuck do I do, reddit? I want her to be happy, but we loved each other so much. I'm about to cry."

hnh2e,2,2011-05-30,"Want a fresh start, does this make sense at all?",freshstart0530,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/hnh2e/want_a_fresh_start_does_this_make_sense_at_all/,"Hi there.  Last spring, I graduated with an English degree (mistake).  I really didn't apply myself in college, and while I graduated with a decent GPA, I didn't know what I wanted to do while I was in school, and English just worked at the time.  I now know what I want to be doing, and I know that my degree does not prepare me to do it.  I also got a minor in Telecommunications, but again, I didn't take classes that challenged me, and what I learned won't help me in the future.  

I would really like to go into media policy analysis and research.  My undergraduate university has a great public affairs program, solid coursework in Telecom &amp; I believe I could go on to create an individualized concentration for my graduate coursework.  The thing is, even though I know it will be a lot to take on financially, I would like to do it all over again - even the classes I've already taken (if I can improve my grades).  I want to do things 100% this time.  

What I want to do, is go back and get a bachelors in public affairs, re-do my minor in Telecom (with relevant coursework), and go directly into the graduate program from there.  So, I'm looking at about 6-6.5 years before I am done - I am 23 now.  I also believe that I would be more marketable for internships in my field by taking the time to learn the necessary skills.  I would be up for summer coursework, slaving away for my loans, anything, because I know that I would be working towards something I am truly passionate about (my media processes &amp; effects class was one of the few classes I was excited about in all of my undergrad).

In the mean time, I will be living at home and trying to save as much money as I can.  I am potentially looking to move to the state the school is in to work and try and establish residency to help with the cost.

Has anyone done something like this?  I probably sound really crazy, but this is what I am passionate about, and I should have figured it out sooner (I know), but now I want to go back and get started.  Is it even possible to be a freshman again if I already have a degree from the school?  I will be talking to an advisor in the program I want to be in, but I just wanted to bounce some ideas off people.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you!

P.S. the reason for not going directly into a graduate program is because I do not feel that I have the skills or educational background to be successful.  I really want to learn and I feel that ""re-doing"" my undergrad is the best bet for this.

EDIT: TL/DR - I got a degree in something that won't help me do what I want to do, going to grad school now doesn't make sense (I don't have the skills).  I want to ""re-do"" my undergrad &amp; go to grad school from there.  Any advice?"

&gt;(3) Where a person is prevented from resisting by any intoxicating
or anesthetic substance, or any controlled substance, and this
condition was known, or reasonably should have been known by the
accused.

I was attending a local community college after high school, because my grades weren't good enough to get into any schools nearby, and my family is pretty broke. I had 2 classes with this girl Melinda who I had a huge crush on. I'm kind of nerdy and overweight, so I never had the balls to ask her out or even ask to hang out. (Plus this is before I realized she had a boyfriend)

A few weeks into summer I got a job at a Walgreens (It's a drug store for those of you not in the USA) where I worked full time. This girl Melinda came in one day and we bullshitted for a while, and somehow her broken PC got tossed into the conversation. As a nerd, this is one of the few openers that work, so I suggested to fix it. She agreed and we made plans to meet the next night at her house. She offered to pay me, I just said to get me a beer or something.

I went over there the night after the next because she was busy, and I fixed her PC in like 5 minutes because all it was was some simple spyware popup crap. We started drinking and smoking pot and just bullshitting. It was really great because I have NO game. She began going on and on and on about how she was always fighting with her boyfriend and what an asshole he was. I thought ""SCORE!"" We ended up drinking and smoking the entire night, and we ended up cuddling on the couch watching the Wizard of Oz. Up until that point, I hadn't even held hands with a girl.

After a while we started making out, and to my embarrassment I accidentally ejaculated in my pants. A LOT. I was so embarrassed, but she gave me a towel and I removed my pants. I couldn't drive because I was so hammered, so I crashed in her bed with her. A lot of kissing and grinding and such and before I knew it we were having sex.

The next day I heard nothing from her. The day after that she wasn't in class. She didn't answer my calls. I didn't quite understand it. I got home from class, and started getting ready for work. There was a LOUD knock at my door. A police officer asked me to come with them, and they needed to ask me some questions.

Not knowing my rights or anything, I told them the truth. We got drunk, we smoked pot, I stayed there and we had sex. I was arrested. It turns out after I told a few people, it got back to her boyfriend. The boyfriend confronted her, she said she didn't remember because she was so drunk. I could barely remember it either, but I know it had happened. I don't think anything can overwrite the memory of losing your virginity.

I was sentenced October 2004 after about a year of fighting my case. I was released November of 2009. When I was released Jessica's law was still active in California, so I couldn't live with my parents. They had bought me a 1996 Subaru Legacy Wagon, which I lived in slightly on the outskirts of the town I lived. I tried to go back to school, but you have to register as a sex offender at colleges you attend. when I registered the student security intern told a couple of girls he knew, and before I knew it the entire school was harassing me. So I left. I have had 3 jobs since my release. I was fired from all three when someone found my face online. I am currently on Social Security Disability for post traumatic stress disorder. According to my therapist I have it due to my prison experiences. (I saw a man die from a gang beating, I was stabbed [superficially] with a pencil because I'm a rapist)

I'm currently living with my parents again. I haven't gotten back to school, but I'm thinking of taking classes online. I don't know much else to talk about, AMA away. I'll try to keep up with this.

TL;DR I became a rapist when I lost my virginity, lost 5 years of my life, and I'm trying to get my life together.


Edit:
=====================
I have gotten alot of requests for verification of my story. I didn't know that worked until recently. I did however send the following to the mods:
&gt;I have a topic on iama talking about my experiences as someone convicted of rape. This is a throwaway account. I don't know how I can get confirmed or if I can even without exposing my identity. As someone who is a sex offender, what little privacy I have I protect fiercely. I wasn't careful in the past, and I had a few jerks on xbox live that tracked down my information and got my account banned. They also found my facebook and had that banned too, but not before saving all of my photos and posting them on 4chan. So is there any way to confirm myself without exposing myself? I have racked my brain trying to find a way to do so, but short of exposing myself (No pun intended) I have no idea how to do so.
Any suggestions would be wecomed!

I received a reply from a gentleman/woman named ""flyryan:""

&gt;There isn't a way to prove yourself without exposing yourself. As a reminder though, verification is totally optional. It is not a requirement.
So, if you don't to verify, you don't have to. However, if you do, I can promise that we take privacy seriously and anything you send would be kept confidential and used for verification only.

I have decided to not identify myself. I appreciate the curiosity, and I understand the desire to see behind the curtain, but the internet is a very mean and harsh place, and I don't trust people very easily. If you don't believe it, fine. If you do, fine. Whatever. If you don't feel this is authentic no one is forcing you to participate. Thank you"

I'm a new San Franciscan--going to be around for the summer for an internship and might be back in a year and a half for good. I'm trying to figure out transportation.

As it stands right now, I'm in the Mission and my place of work is about five blocks away, so I don't need something immediately. However, good groceries are a bit of a trek, I like being self-sufficient for transportation, and I have friends in North Beach, Oakland, Sonoma County, and will be paying occasional visits to Bolinas, so I need at least *something*. As it stands, I'm divided between a bike and a motorcycle.

I have a pretty good idea what I'm getting into with both--I'm an experienced bike rider (although more rural and mountain biking than urban riding), and have owned bikes before. Similarly, I'm a licensed motorcyclist, have taken MSF courses, have gone riding with my father and friends a few times--but I've never owned one.

They each have their pros and cons (bicycles don't need gas, motorcycles let me go further, I've wanted to ""make good"" on my licensing by getting a motorcycle, bikes are far cheaper (but I do have the money), bikes keep me fit, motorcycles are more fun &amp; more dangerous, etc.) but a pretty big part of it at the end of the day is how receptive the city is. Given that I'm new here, I don't really know the ins and outs--do any of you have any experience with either? Is San Francisco particularly welcoming or unwelcoming to bicyclists or motorcyclists? Have any stories to relate?

On some level, I'd love to have my desire for a motorcycle justified--they're fun, I like them, and I'm young, so it's a pretty good time to have a one-person means of getting around (vs. later when I'll need something more). On the other hand, I understand that a bicycle may make a lot more sense, so I don't want to spit in the face of reason. 

For what it's worth, I have a car on the east coast, where I'm going to school. Come the end of the summer, I can either ship whatever I buy back there, or leave it at my parents' house in Bolinas.

Anything would be helpful. Thanks!"

My lovely girlfriend of two years is having a problem known as ""vaginismus.""  We've always had this problem, but only about nine months ago did we figure out what it was.

I thought the diagnosis alongside knowledge that others suffered with her would help her face the problem, but so far things have become worse.  She curses the disorder and calls herself a freak, and even threatens suicide.  She blames me for not showing enough sexual interest.  Her plan is for me to pretend that things are working to make her feel better in bed, but this causes frustration, painful chafing, and tears.

She tried dialaters for a while, but was unable to insert any, or even a tampon.  She has never been able to touch herself without underwear (I have not been able to do this more than a couple of times).

We are trying to find knowledgeable therapists and resources in the Northern Virginia/Washington D.C. area, but neither of us know where to start, nor whether we can afford them since she is unemployed and I am working at a low-pay internship.  If I can convince her to tell her parents, we may be able to use their health insurance.

I got into journalism by chance, but I enjoyed it and did well enough that I stayed in. Got good grades and great internships, and I'm waiting to hear details of a job offer later this week.

But for about the last year and a half, I've become less satisfied with job prospects in journalism, and more concerned about salary, career growth, and the future of the industry. It's not that I didn't know about all this earlier, but as graduation got closer it all became much more tangible to me. So now I'm considering immediately returning to school for a second bachelor's in something with a better future outlook, likely computer engineering or computer science.

Coincidentally, my parents are moving up to my college town, so I'd be able to live with them and cut down on living expenses, and not have to worry so much about having part-time jobs, etc. My student loan debt is fairly negligible (approx. $17K), and by doing this I figure I would about double it.

Is it a good idea to go back to school for something I think I'll enjoy and that will bring me better job security?"
