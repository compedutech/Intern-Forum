dlhmd,6,2010-10-01,"I've been laid off 4 times in the last 5 years and now employers are looking at my resume as if I'm a ""job hopper"".  What can I do to make my resume more stable?",bluesunshine,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dlhmd/ive_been_laid_off_4_times_in_the_last_5_years_and/,"I started working in IT in 2005 while I was still in college as an intern.  I didn't get the job when the internship was over and I moved on to a large company as a contractor.  After a year (and many attempts to sign on to be a full time employee) I was laid off.  I then went back to the place I interned at (I had a good relationship with the company) for a temporary position until I got a new job.

I got a job at a small company and the job was hell.  After six months I was micromanaged to the point of a nervous breakdown and left the company (the first time I've ever quit a job, ever).  During that time the economy tanked and the only choice I had was to take a temp job at a software company (which was an awesome place to work), and after more attempts to become a full time employee I was part of a mass layoff.  

Now I've been working at a large healthcare company as a contractor for a year and I have no room to grow.  I'm the lowest paid (mostly because I'm the youngest) on my team, I get less PTO then I did working at a grocery store in high school, I've been denied for raises, healthcare is abysmal (ironic isn't it?), and they don't want to promote me because they love my rock bottom salary.

Now that I'm looking for a new, full time job, it seems that HR departments are pegging me as a ""job hopper"".  I've had 2 phone interviews in the last week and they've told me that, ""Well it looks a little strange that you've only been with each company about a year or so"".  Most don't seem to understand that you have to pay dues when you're out of college, how much the economy has changed the job market, and how cut throat companies are when dealing with IT employees.   

So my question is, how should I spruce up my resume to make it look like I'm stable? Also, should I just tell HR flat out that I'm part of a rough market? I was thinking of putting ""temporary"" or ""contract"" next to my positions but I'm not sure how good that will look.  Here's a copy of my resume (I removed all the personal info for privacy and some of the formatting got jacked up, but all the info is there):

dls26,5,2010-10-01,Suggestions for finding and affording an internship?,IntershipsSuck,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dls26/suggestions_for_finding_and_affording_an/,"Hey Reddit - long time lurker first time poster.

So basically I want to know if anyone has any ideas about actually finding and affording internships. To graduate from my school every student in the college has to have at least one summer long internship. The problem is that to get credit for the internship you also have to pay something like $750 for the credit. 

The other problem is most companies that recruit from my school or want my skill set are located in DC or other really expensive areas. I would have to buy a car, pay for local housing, pay for food and all that on top of paying my rent over the summer at school (it's impossible to find subletters in the summer - there's too many places open and my house is a crap-shack). The internships do pay but it wouldn't cover the cost of living and keeping my place here and I'd also be loosing out on saving money over the summer through working a local job.

I'd get an internship at my school but they don't pay, are hard to get, and all my peers would have internships at big companies - Booz Allen, Lockheed, Northrop Grumman, CIA and it puts me at a huge hiring disadvantage. 


Basically, I'm paying for school myself and a summer internship would cost me more money and I wouldn't be able to pay for school myself. Anyone have any ideas? It sucks being at a disadvantage to everyone else who seems to have school paid for them or in's at awesome companies. 

TL;DR: Need internship to graduate, can't afford one - suggestions?"
dmejh,0,2010-10-03,Laptop stolen - Advice on replacement,capitalh,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dmejh/laptop_stolen_advice_on_replacement/,"Greetings,

Long time lurker, first time topic poster.  I was recently visiting the National Aquarium in Baltimore when my car was broken into and my Dell XPS was stolen (among other important things) from the vehicle's trunk.

As a result, I find myself far too analog in this digital world and hope that the fine fellows of reddit can lend some advice in rectifying this.  I am looking for a performance laptop with a good size screen, but can still be considered portable (15"" sounds about right to me).  I do not consider myself a gamer but I do like higher-end graphics and pretty displays.  I probably prefer Windows 7 on the laptop, but I do plan to have it dual boot with Ubuntu.  I have (or... had) a substantial library of music and videos, so the more storage the merrier.  The laptop is used both for these ""recreational"" purposes and as a primary work laptop- I am a researcher/EE phd candidate, so I have (once again... had) a few math programs I'd run such as Mathematica as well as engineering mainstays such as MATLAB.  I have a tendency to multitask like a maniac (Are they known for their multitasking abilities? Perhaps this was a poor simile) so a processor that can handle running a MATLAB code while I review research papers (read: browse reddit) would be fantastic.  I am including my old Dell specs below for reference.  

I figure Reddit knows this stuff as well as anyone, which is why I came to ask the community here first.  I really appreciate any advice you guys have to help me out! This situation SUCKS  

My old lappy specs follow:
15"" XPS purchased late 2008 with Intel Core 2 Duo Processor T8100 (2.1GHz/800Mhz FSB, 3MB Cache)
4GB Shared Dual Channel DDR2 SDRAM at 667MHz (2 Dimms)
High Resolution, glossy widescreen 15.4 inch LED LCD (1440x900) &amp; 2.0 MP webcam (barely used the cam)
128MB NVIDIA® GeForce® 8400M GS
320GB 5400rpm SATA Hard Drive
OS: Vista
Stock DVD/RW drive
6 cell battery

P.S. Is it weird that the first thing I thought upon realizing my laptop, my internship laptop, my ONLY data backup, and my TI-89 from high school were stolen was that my personalized conky file is gone forever?  Don't worry, my attention then turned to the horror of the situation... but conky first.

Last December (Dec. '09), I graduated with a degree in Mathematics, but I was basically an actuarial science major. I would have been an actuarial science major, but I had a poor GPA throughout college, and those three numbers still haunt me today.

Besides my poor GPA, I have no internships under my belt nor do I have any programming skills. If you were to look at my resume, all you would see is a poor GPA at a great university, a layman work history, and minimum computer skills (relative to the actuarial profession).

Since graduation, I've worked hard to pass actuarial exams. I had passed P while in college. Last May I passed FM, and this November I will be taking MFE.

I, myself, know that I am hard-working and that I would succeed given the chance, but that's the catch: given my resume, how do I get my foot in the door?

Who has been in a similar situation and what was the outcome? What advice can you offer to people in my situation?

Spoken by the late Roger Nickles (my grandfather), this idea has been engrained in my mind for the past 21 years of my life. Just think about it for a second… if we are all thinking the same way (doing the same things, following the same trends, committing the same actions, etc.) then no one is really thinking at all. How can people go their whole lives living exactly like everyone else? Wearing the same trends, shopping at the most popular stores, buying what everyone else has, striving to be like “the Jones’”, speaking the way everyone else speaks, traveling to places because they are the “it” spots, teasing people and making fun of them because everyone else does it, etc. How will our country succeed if no one thinks for themselves? Will we always just follow whatever our friends, family members, teachers, co-workers, politicians, etc. tell us to do?

I currently attend Iowa State University in Ames, Iowa majoring in History and minoring in Sociology. When I was younger my family moved around a lot which meant that we became each other’s friends. My brother and I are still close today, even though he is 25 and lives three hours away with his wife, while I also talk to my parents all the time. Through the years of us moving it was always interesting for me to experience all different kinds of people and a new way of life. I always made good friends wherever I moved and I still keep in touch with some of them today. It has also made me a stronger and more independent young woman and helped me cope with the numerous types of people I met while in college. I spent the first three years of college living in the dorms, and that opened my eyes to the lives of young people my age. I grew up in a very family oriented atmosphere where respect was the key to our everyday lives, and I was absolutely appalled by the amount of disrespect from the people around me. This ranged from swearing to drinking to drugs to vandalism to just plain outright disrespect and lack of common courtesy. Now, trust me, I am not naïve to the world around me. Just because I grew up in a well-mannered, respectful, and family oriented atmosphere does not mean that my family did not make sure I knew what the world was like around me. I knew what I was getting into when I came to college, but it still bothered me a lot when I went to school and saw so much disrespect.

I am now in my 4th and final year at school. I have a great group of friends, a demanding yet rewarding internship, and a new outlook on life and my future. I feel like it is finally time to take a stand on what is going on in this country. Our young people are out of control with their amount of disrespect and I want to show them that just because you are young does not make it right. I am 21 and have never used a swear word or an illegal drug and never even tasted a drop of alcohol until weeks after my 21st birthday. Most people are probably reading this and thinking “this girl is crazy”, but I want to show young people that you do not have to drink, do drugs, use profanity, or be disrespectful to go places in this world. I hope that all of you can read this and find encouragement that a young person is standing up and saying something. I am taking a stand and fighting back against the disrespect and lack of manners in this country, and I hope that all of you out there that agree with me will also stand up and not accept what has happened to the world around us.

TL DR: Trying to get the youth of our country to think more about the way they treat others. Please let me know your opinions.

dntnv,11,2010-10-06,I'm a CS Alumni looking for CS/SE/Math interns for Summer 2011 at Boeing in Seattle,BoeKnows,rit,https://www.reddit.com/r/rit/comments/dntnv/im_a_cs_alumni_looking_for_cssemath_interns_for/,"Hi everyone. 

I'm a 2009 CS grad and I've been working at The Boeing Company since graduation.  My boss has asked me to find us an intern for next summer (I did 2 co-op blocks here before joining full time).


I figured I'd come to Reddit first before Job Zone or whatever weird thing they're using now, because I'm more likely to find the kind of people we're looking for here.

So, we're looking for someone studying computer science or software engineering, but math works too if you have good programming skills.  We develop primarily in C++, but I personally do a lot of Python as well (though it's unlikely you'll get to see a lot of Python. Maybe some?).


We do R&amp;D in artificial intelligence/optimization - mostly route planning and decision making tools - a lot of traveling-salesman type problems. You should know some AI, definitely some graph theory, have a good working knowledge of ""big o"" notation, those sorts of things.

You should also have really strong communication skills. Our interns have had a good share of independence (that is: I won't be micromanaging you, though I'm always super happy to help tackle a hard problem), so it'll be crucial that you can explain to me what you've done with the problem we've given you.  I really look for this and I know my manager does too.


A few examples of the kinds of things we do:

* We're going out to Oregon to fly a [ScanEagle UAV](http://i.imgur.com/cs9hs.jpg) with some of the routing software we've written for it
* We're developing some ship routing software for large cargo ships, and we've had to ride the ships with our software while we tested it
* I worked on a smartphone app to help emergency responders deal with large scale disaster scenarios ([I got to ride around on a police boat](http://i.imgur.com/MX2pD.jpg) while we tested it in a mock scenario)


Boeing is an extremely cool company - we do so many more things than just commercial airplanes (in fact, I've never had anything to do with our commercial airplanes... go figure). 
Our internships are excellent - they pay competitively, and they typically pay to help you relocate.

My group is great and I really love what I do - I'm legitimately excited to go to work on most days.

Also, summer in Seattle is the best. It's sunny and 75 degrees every day. I love it here.

So, if you're interested (or know someone who is)... here's the **[job requisition](https://jobs.boeing.com/JobSeeker/JobView?reqcode=10-1016435)**. Ignore the position description because it's just a generic one they make for us. 

**If you're going to apply**, you should PM me your name first so that I can watch for your resume when it comes. If you're uncomfortable giving out your name over Reddit, just create an alt or ask me for my Boeing email address and you can send it there.

If anyone has any questions (about me, the job, Seattle, anything at all), just leave them in the comments or PM me and we can talk more.

Thanks Reddit!


**Edit:** I forgot, one of the cool things I should mention is that I'm actually starting work on my first patent application this month. Boeing definitely encourages that kind of thing (and pays a bonus for it, too :-D )"

I'm having second thoughts...,needadvice88,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/dpggy/did_i_make_the_right_choice_im_having_second/,"Hey everyone, I could really use some advice here, not sure if I made a mistake with my girlfriend... Basically, I am 21, and we have been dating for 6 months, about 3 weeks ago we had a talk on if we should end it or not, we gave it a go for another 3 weeks, and a few days ago we ended it...

Here is the back story: I met this girl through a friend who I thought was cute, although very shy, and I decided to ask my friend her story, and she decided to go out with me. Thing about her is that she's never had a boyfriend before, and I was her first everything (except for sex, that was one of the issues..). We dated for 4 months, and the lack of us doing sexual stuff was a problem, but I was on an internship during this time, so focused on that, that the lack of sex didn't bother me, I was willing to wait at that time. I went off for 2 months and we decided to stay together despite me not being happy about the lack of sex.. We talked a decent amount, but while away for 2 months I really started having doubts, about whether or not we were right for each other... See, the thing is she was raised in a very strict home with religious parents, and while she is religious, she doesn't care that I don't believe in God, she is actually a very smart girl who likes to debate about it with me. She also doesn't drink, which I didn't like at all because I like to go out and have fun once and a while, but I learned to accept it over time... What I did really enjoy about her is that she is a genuinely good person, shy but when it was just me and her we could talk for hours, about random stuff, but still be silly as well. I saw a lot of potential in her, but I felt like I just wasn't 100%. The main thing I think was that I wasn't always crazy about her... There were times when I couldn't wait to see her, and there were times where I wasn't very excited at all, and wondered if I would be better with someone else. When I came back from my two month away time, we got back together, and because she saw that I was willing to wait 2 months for her, she opened up a lot sexually, but without actually having sex (oral and anything else was fine).

At one point, I realized that there were some other girls that I met that I was more into, and that raised alarms for me... enough that it freaked me out enough that I wanted talk to her about whether or not we were right for each other. I just felt like I wasn't having enough fun in the relationship, and being only 21, I wasn't sure if I was ready for such a serious commitment when I felt like in my heart, I wasn't sure... See, she is very serious, and if we were going to have sex, she wanted to be sure that the person she is with is as crazy about her as she is about the person (she told me she loved me, and I'm sure if I said it genuinly back, the sex would not be a problem because we would be having it) But she is such a great girl, she is smart, logical, and we have had some great times in the past. I really truly care about her so much, I was willing to wait this long, but now I was just not sure if I was ready for such a commitment, to make her lost her virginity to me when I wasn't 100% about it... For me, this relationship has just grew progressively, and it came down to a point where sex was going to happen or not happen, and I would have liked it to happen, but knowing that sex would have meant a serious long term commitment really just freaked me out.

See, the thing is that its been bothering me a lot - enough that I feel like it has been effecting school and work. But this breakup hasn't made me better at all, if anything I feel a lot worse... Because I do care about her SO much. 

Reddit, do you think I made a mistake? I feel like there might be a lot I'm missing out here because I feel its pretty complicated, but go ahead and ask any questions you feel you need to ask."

  I'm currently a senior at a liberal arts college; my major is computer science.

I'll try and be as brief and to the point as I can be.

I got into computer science for my love of video games and technology but now realize that a liberal arts college probably wasn't the best place to go because a more specialized school would have given me a much better education (not that the one I'm getting now is bad).

Approaching graduation I'm not sure what to do about grad school because I don't know what I would like to specialize in.

I've had a full-time summer internship as a software engineer since summer of 2008 and got amazing experience there and a taste of the real world. However, I do not believe that is exactly what I would like to do every day in for my career. I was interesting and I learned a ton, but that exact atmosphere might not be my cup of tea.

Many video game design courses I found were part of undergraduate studies (would have been nice 4 years ago &gt;&lt;)...

I want to do something gaming related, so I'd like to maybe shadow people in the New England area who are in the industry or anyone else with a computer sciencey job to hone in on what I would like to do with my life.

I would also love to be something of a gaming journalist for a magazine, but feel like an English major w/ a Communications certificate would have been better suited for that.

Also, I am not so much a lazy person as I am an ""incubator,"" a term I found on reddit that means I procrastinate and think about what I have to do and them pump it out at the last minute with high efficiency. But there is no due date on life!

Any general advice? I have many paths rushing toward me and I'm sort of lost.

First time posting anything like this so any suggestions or questions would also be much appreciated.

Also, Deion Branch is back in New England. Rejoice ^_^

Thanks a lot!

Throwaway account here as my other account is my real name. I'm in the first semester of an MS program, in a field that I really enjoy. However, I'm finding that the school I'm at is not the greatest fit for me. I'm toying with the idea of changing back to the school that I did my undergrad work at for several reasons, specifically, the better reputation, proximity to family, friends that currently attend, and my love of the location.

However, I don't know the best route to take to pursue this. The new program would require me to obtain letters of recommendation. I feel like a letter of recommendation from my current advisor, who I also currently do research with, would carry a lot of weight in my application to the new program. However, I'm afraid that I would permanently burn a bridge with this professor if I expressed a desire to potentially leave this program, especially if I am not accepted to the new program.

As it stands right now, I believe that I can count on solid letters of recommendation from a supervisor from an internship, a supervisor from my first real industry experience, and a professor that worked with me during my capstone project as an undergrad. Do you guys think that I would lose out on too much if I proceeded with these guys, and did not broach the topic with my graduate professor unless I've heard positively from the program I'm applying to?

The other issue I see is a potential waste of a semester. Granted, this will not affect me too much in the long run, but it kinda sucks to put in the work only to lose out on the money, time, and studying that I invested. There's a possibility that I may be able to transfer some credit, but I'm not holding my breath.

Finally, does anyone know how university's feel about this kind of situation? I'd imagine that it reflects poorly on me as a student, but I've written a fairly convincing statement of purpose explaining exactly why I feel that this is right move for my situation.

Any advice on the issue is much appreciated.

First Time:

Started out my church life as a pretty active member in the youth group, at my peak, I was planning a lot of the youth summer trips and preaching on a very regular basis. When my senior year of high school came around I started having an interest in writing satire, I would post them as Facebook notes and tag some friends, it was all in good fun. 

One particular note upset a couple of people, it was dealing with just life and relationships. I shrugged off a lot of the comments seeing as it was a pretty small minority. However, the wife of the youth minister decided to chime in, unfortunately due my laptop breaking, I do not have the note or the comments at my disposal, I might have them in some e-mail correspondance though. She basically insulted my writing ability, my religious views, and just many personal attacks. We never saw eye-to-eye on a lot of things so, like the other comments, I shrugged it off. However, through a weird chain of events, my parents got word of the particular comment (now they have Facebooks, oh well). After chatting up the Minister of Education, it was found out that every primary staff member had a copy of the note on their desk and was planning to hold a staff meeting over it. Needless to say, my parents weren't happy. The main staff had already decided that it wasn't as bad as the youth minister had made it out to be but the damage was already done.

After a couple of meetings, it was clear that the youth minister did not want anything to do with me, he basically said ""In my mind, you've already left us, I don't even see why we are having this conversation."" They actually thought I was trying to overthrow the youth ministry, I don't know how they came to that conclusion though. By this time, word had spread throughout the entire youth group, of course, a lot of it was just conjecture, people's assumptions ranged from drugs to trying to stir a revolution, either way, they made it clear the last time I went for a service that I should pack my bags and move away.

**tl;dr:** Facebook and subsequent rumors got me forced out of a ministry.

Second Time:

Same church, different story (not as much drama).

Up to this point, the old youth minister had tried to reconcile with me (it was obvious that it was a forced attempt). I accepted his apology and even continued to do some behind the scenes work with the ministry, although I never went there again for my time as an actual youth member. However, once I was ineligible to be in the youth, all contact ceased on his part. Shortly after that he was moved to a different ministry of the church and they promoted one of the associate pastors to be the head of the youth ministry.

After my first year in college, I was given the opportunity to become an unpaid intern (which is an important distinction). My job was to mainly form relationships with middle school boys and possibly form a discipleship group, bible studies, etc. I was also going to help with behind the scenes and sharing the preaching duties. 

For the first two weeks, everything was going great, I was forming some relationships, I had already preached on a Wednesday, in my mind, I had gotten out to a pretty good start. Then the first trip of the summer arrived, basic job was to make sure the kids wake up and go to sleep, other than that, myself and the other adults sat around the housing complex and ate food. This is where I really found my stride with some of the less active kids and being the unattainable twenty year old, I was the crush of many middle school girls. Either way, the trip, in my mind was a success. 

When I arrived back home, I had a plethora of plans to help get this ministry moving. The youth minister arranged a meeting with me, this was normal as we had creative meetings every week. However, it was just me and him this time which was strange, to say the least. He sat me down and basically said that my views do not line up with the views of the children's parents, they assumed Libertarian meant Liberal and that Calvinism was of the devil (even though the preacher was a pretty stout five-point Calvinist). A lot of parents thought that I was instilling my beliefs on to their children, I don't know why I would talk about politics and systematic theology with a 13 year old but whatever. 

I was told that I could no longer help with the ministry, I could continue to come but I was to not lead bible studies, discipleship groups, or anything of that nature. It was implied that I shouldn't really even talk to the children. The main thing that got me was the first incident, even when it's almost two years after the fact, there were still rumors and speculations on what happened. 

**tl;dr:** A false perception of my beliefs combined with my previous incident got my forced out of an internship with the same church.

**Why I'm Doing This**

First off, I'm not looking for any sort of pity or sympathy. I appreciate the sentiment though. It is mainly because I'm bored, honestly. However, most of the people who hear the story (it's become kind of a thing when my friends introduce me to someone ""Hey, meet my friend, he got kicked out of a church!!"") are very interested in it and a lot of them sympathize with me. Needless to say, this has altered my faith dramatically, I'm definitely not the same person I was three years ago.

Questions I won't answer would include the name of the church or the name of the people involved.

EDIT: This was meant to be an AMA, I forgot to put it in the title. I guess it's too late for that.

EDIT 2: Albeit, it was meant to be an AMA, I appreciate all the comments, I honestly didn't think it would get this many. I appreciate everyone's encouragement and advice."

Please advise",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/drlcb/female_redditors_my_gf_took_contraceptives_now/,"Disclaimer : I know this looks like it belongs in /r/relationships, but it's actually medical.

So the story is, we're together for almost 3 years. I'm 24, she's 22. Playing it safe, we decided that she will take the pill. After consulting the doctor, who decided everything was fine, she got her perscription, everything was fine for some time. After about a 1,5yr her sex drive went down, down to 0. We lived with it somewhat for a while, then last summer i got a 1yr internship 2000km from home. So we decide that's it's sensless for her to be on the pill during that time, and that it might help get her ""spunk"" back. 3 months pass, she visits me in my new place, sadly, nothing seems to change back :/

Things go bad between us, not only because of the lack of fun in bed, but because for some time now i feel more like a friend, than a SO. I finally make her realize and admit, that she doesn't feel for me anymore, but she still loves on me on some level and doesn't imagine herself without me. I still love her too, and give her another chance. She promises to change. I have my own theory.

I make her go see the gyno, and my suspitions are confirmed - because of the pill, her body stopped producing Estrogen altogether, and her hormonal balance is way off. Today she got a perscription for hormones(cyclo-progynova), and her first evaluation is in 3 months, but the whole curation may last up to a year. She feels really bad about this, saying ""i don't feel like a woman anymore"". I try to be as supportive as i possibly can from a 2000km distance.

My question is : any female redditors here that had the same/similar experience? How did it turn out for you?

**TL;DR** : my girlfriend took contraceptives, then stopped and her estrogen is gone. she feels like shit."
drsst,8,2010-10-15,"Reddit engineers, how did you get your first job? I've been doing everything I can, and I'm osing hope - thinking about completely giving up on this profession  ",stonefall090909090,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/drsst/reddit_engineers_how_did_you_get_your_first_job/,"
I'm going to be honest here because it is my first post, and I don't want anyone to think this is one of those 'I need a job' threads. I'm not here to find work, I'm just looking for some realistic advice - don't be afraid to pour on the negatives, I am tired of false hope.

Here's my story: I have completed 2 University degrees - Communications and Mechanical Engineering . I am not rich, and I have paid myself through everything in my life. After completing my first degree, I realized that there wasn't much work (reputable, career type work) available. So after working in the communications field a few years (with work that I found almost INSTANTLY without ever really trying), I got tired of the monotony and I decided to go back to school for my engineering degree. I saved up a lot of money and worked most of my way through. The problem now, is that I had to quit my job in my last year to complete my engineering degree on the 4 year pace and I can't seem to interest ANY employers in the field (I have however receieved calls from the non-engineering field recruiters). 

I'm very put off, simply because I was naive in believing everyone I  spoke to saying 'there are millions of jobs out there for engineers, just finish your degree"" etc etc. I took this as fact, and I put all my effort into my studies and not nearly as much as I 'should' have for looking for work/connections during my schooling. 

Now I am fed up. It been over 7 months, and I am getting nowhere. I've signed up for all the job sites, I've attended career fairs, I cold call human resources managers for interest/positions, I have had my resume reviewed by many different people in HR fields and I am free to move anywhere that speaks English in the world. I've applied to many graduate programs/paid internships and I don't get considered because my GPA is not over 3.0 (its 2.9 - which I am very happy with considering I worked almost the entire time I was in the program -even though it is apparently not good enough). The only reason I didn't have a better GPA, is because my University was extremely poorly managed, yet was widely considered the 'best' engineering program for all the Univeristies closeby. Many people would cheat, and the people who didn't saw lower marks (I even tattled on them a few times and the school did nothing). Turns out, after calling a few people, that the school's reputation was awful -notorious for breeding 'idiot engineers' and being one of the 'non-idiots' I can tell you 100% employers are right in not hiring these people. However, how do I convince a hiring manager I am not?  By the time I found out all this, I was in my 4th year and it was too late to transfer universities.

The more time I spend in the job mix, the more I realize i have ZERO qualifications to get hired in this field without significant connections. I have about 10-15 connections in the field and they have been helping by asking around etc, but none are powerful enough to actually hire. I'm sure eventually something will come up, but I am competely sick of waiting. 

I am extremely proud of having 2 degrees, since I really did my best to learn the material and enjoy the subjects, so I do not regret going to school in the slightest. What I do regret, is going into engineering instead of medicine, which I could have gotten into as well. I chose engineering for 2 reasons, because I was interested in it more than medicine, and because I was SURE I would NEVER have to spend extended periods of time looking for work. There is NOTHING I HATE MORE than looking for work when I am a qualified candidate. I feel as though my phone should be ringing off the hook with offers since I am qualified but I went with the all out effort to find work anyway because I wanted a REALLY good job in this field. I have not been slacking - I think I've put in more effort into finding work than I did studying during my program. I would understand if I had no education but I have 11 years of failure free post secondary education and no on employers seem to care. 

Anyway, I'm just wondering how long it took everyone else to find work in engineering, and whether it is really worth it to continue looking? Some of my friends who have engineering experience and many don't even like it that much. I was initially VERY excited when I finished my degree and I was hoping to make a difference. Now, I'm thinking about going back to my old degree's field, and giving up engineering for good. I'll never regret learning the material and going back to school, I'll just regret wasting all this time looking for work in a field that will not hire new members. 

TL; DR - Very tired of looking for work in engineering field. Probably going to throw my degree away and look for a different profession that actually hires new graduates."

However, my life in US has been more fulfilling than I could ever imagine. I have good friends here and the future to look forward to.


Only 2 years ago, I moved to US with one suitcase and almost no money on my bank account. All I had was an acceptance and a partial scholarship for one of the most prestigious art colleges in US.


When I think about it now, the decision to come here was foolish. I knew very well that I couldn't afford to pay for the entire studies and I had no idea how to deal with it. Unlike US citizens, I was not eligible for financial aid and I had no one to help me get a loan. So I just decided to make the first step and hope for the best.


In only few months, I got into financial trouble but fortunately, my mother was able to borrow some money and send it to me. All this time I was looking for job opportunities and I worked on my academic goals very hard. I was motivated like never before, but at the same time I was afraid that I might not make it.


After the first quater, I got a part-time job at the college as a web developer. The job paid enough for housing and food. Then, something amazing happened... I got a paid internship with one of the biggest game development companies in the world! Holy shit... that was more than I believed was possible. My motivation exploded and the shit started to develop exponentially! My student work got published in the geekiest magazine! My scholarship was increased! I got another internship at the biggest computer animation studio in the world and several job offers pending for me after I graduate.


As I said... Im not rich and I probably never will be. I have one suitcase more than I had 2 years ago but my head is filled with amazing experiences that exceeded my dreams. I dont know what my future will be, but I feel it can be anything I imagine and more.

ds3vy,8,2010-10-16,Entry Level IT Jobs in Pittsburgh?,harryarei,pittsburgh,https://www.reddit.com/r/pittsburgh/comments/ds3vy/entry_level_it_jobs_in_pittsburgh/,"Hello Pittsburgh!


I'm going to be graduating from Penn State in the spring, and I've been looking for jobs after graduation. Pittsburgh is the city I have always wanted to live in (grew up in Central PA, Altoona area). However, there doesn't seem to be many postings on my schools job board for Pittsburgh area.


At a career fair I talked to UPMC, but they won't be looking to hire until 2 months before I graduate which seems a little late to me considering I have gotten a few interviews from other companies. I may just be being impatient because a few of my other friends have already gotten offers.


Anyway, I was just wondering how people see the IT job market in Pittsburgh. To do a quick summary of my skills, I mostly concentrated in development so most of the classes I took were on Software Engineering, mostly in Java. We went through usability, testing, UML, requirements, and of course coding. However, I have also taken classes in Networking and Network Security, and Databases (MySQL). I also have an internship at Penn State providing technical support for the College of Health and Human Development which covers several networks in several buildings across the campus. I have also developed a few web forms and am competent at HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.


Ok, enough with me pitching myself. If anyone has any hints at companies to apply for that would be wonderful. Also, any advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks guys!

EDIT: Just wanted to say thanks to everyone for the advice and leads. I got a lot of stuff to look into. If anything comes up I'll be sure to post an update. Thanks again!"

When you sit in front of a computer for upwards of eight hours a day, you find the best of the web pretty quickly.

Yesterday, I wandered over to the desk of one of our friendly system administrators, Nate. I wanted to know if he could tell me how many people around the office were surfing Reddit at any given time. Apparently sysadmins are busy guys and all he offered me at first was a death glare, but Nate’s a Redditor and I could tell he was amused by the idea. He told me that six people around the office had visited Reddit in the past half-hour, but it was up to me to find them.

dty6k,47,2010-10-20,"I had my first experience being strong armed by the law today, and I thought I would share it for those who are interested.",[deleted],photography,https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/dty6k/i_had_my_first_experience_being_strong_armed_by/,"I'm a reporter for a local paper in New Jersey. Technically, I'm an intern, but it's really just a title they give to me because they can't afford to pay me a full salary. Anyway, sometimes when the
photographers are tied up they'll send me out on photo assignments.
Today, it happened that they needed me to meet up with one of our
senior reporters who was at a public school waiting for the kids to be
let out. Yesterday, a food fight erupted that turned into a full scale
riot. It appears to have been racially motivated--every cop in Jersey
City responded and several people were taken to the hospital.

Anyhow, I got to the school and met up with my reporter, who was
shooting the shit with one of the city detectives (a really nice guy
who is sympathetic to the press).Cops had the entire school surrounded and were all over the premises in case violence was to erupt again.

Everything was going fine, until the bell rang. Kids started pouring
out of the school, and I stepped up on the sidewalk by the fence to
snap a few pictures. Suddenly, a female security guard starts power
walking towards me shouting that I was breaking the law on school
property.

Obviously, I knew I wasn't, so I tried to explain to her that the
sidewalk is public property that I was well within my rights, but a
statement like that just goes nowhere. She was getting in my face,
trying to force me off the sidewalk, and telling me to give her my
camera (which belongs to me, not the paper). I refused, and she didn't
try anything as I'm a big guy compared to her. I started to think that
maybe I could be wrong, and that I couldn't take pictures on the
sidewalk after all.

At this point I was pretty mad, so I took a step off the curb onto the street and took a picture of her. I don't have to tell you that this angered her. I know I shouldn't have provoked her. But I inherited my dad's temper, and I have this unnaturally strong need to smack the beehive sometimes (I guess I'm a troll).

So she's shrieking at me at this point and gets on her radio to call
the school's administration. I told her that she could go get the
police if she wanted. She did. While she left I used the opportunity
to get my shots, but then was approached by her, a JC cop, and the
school's principal. The cop asked me to leave, and the reporter I was
with (he's older and more experienced, and I'm 24 and graduated from Rutgers with a degree in journalism in May) told him that we would cross the street to be nice, but that the sidewalk was public property.

They were satisfied enough with that. But then, we got what we needed and left, and I noticed that I was being followed by the school's security truck down Montgomery Ave, and they were on the phone presumably feeding information about my car to the police or
something.

I'm not worried about action being taken against me, but it's very
unnerving to be placed in that position against your will--I really
didn't know what I was getting into.

Anyhow, that's my first experience with something like that and it
definitely wasn't fun. I know I would have been arrested had I pursued
my rights on the spot, with no recourse."

I found this subreddit via r/random one day, and I feel like I could use your suggestions right about now.

Here's some background:

I'm an Asian 20F in a respected, Caucasian male-dominated tech school. I can count the number of people I've dated on one hand, and recount every kiss I've ever had. I've honestly never had a boyfriend. While I enjoy being alone, I still love to go out and party with friends - I'm very much in the partying phase of my life. I do wish I had someone to cuddle and hold hands with sometimes.

Anyways, in my freshman year of college, I got involved in one of the clubs on campus. I happened to notice that the club's president (who is a year ahead) was pretty cute. Fast forward to middle of my sophomore year, I got asked by the president (I'll just refer to him as the boy now) himself to join as a club officer, since one of the officers was away on foreign exchange. I accepted, and joined a whole new social circle of friends, all of whom I love to just chill and party with.

A few weeks later (just before this spring), I just upped and asked him out. I knew he was going across the country for half a year for some pretty important internships, and I figured better late than never. He accepted and we had a date, but it was awkward and stiff. He let me know after that he wasn't looking for a relationship at the moment - I was alright with that, and let it go.

A few weeks after that, I was over at his place for an after-party for a concert that happened that night. I had a few friends from another campus with me, and they needed to make a long drive back, but their stuff was in my room. I gave them my keys and partied on - I had the green light to crash on the sofa at the boy's house. A group of us took a stroll later on, and when him and I got back to the house, we realized that the couches already had people passed out on them. Sucking it up, we decided to share the bed. Emboldened by I-don't-even-know-what (and partially sleeplessness), I asked him if he turned me down because he was not interested, or just because he was busy. He said it was because he was busy, and wasn't willing to start a relationship that was long-distance right off the bat. We got talking, and agreed to try and see how it would go in the remaining time we had left together (2-3 weeks approximately?). We ended up hooking up, but didn't go all the way.

After the weekend passed and hearing no word from him, I texted and called him, and received reluctant responses. What probably hurt the most was the feeling of being ignored and avoided, but I didn't want to bother him since I knew he was busy. The day before he was supposed to leave, he went around and visited everybody, including some friends that lived in the same building as me. He knew I lived there, but he didn't visit me.

I eventually managed to corner him, and got an answer I suspected: no, and that he would be back in the winter.

Fast forward to this past weekend - he came back for a short visit, and of course held a party. He's 21, and like myself, also very much into his partying phase of life. I more or less got over him, and just went up, shook his hand, and was like, ""let's be friends."" We were chill and had a great time at the party. Up until this point, very few people knew that we went out before. Partly out of drunkeness and partly out of residual underlying interest, we somehow ended up kissing in front of everyone. No big, the night went on.

A whole group of us went out for pizza with a sober D. Afterwards, we all got dropped off at our respective places. As the boy was exiting, he gave me this look, but I just stared back and ignored it. When I got dropped off at my place, I received a message from him. We talked back and forth, and eventually he walked over to my place to pick me up. Just walking over to his place and holding his hand, I felt like I was on the top of the world. I was vehement that I wasn't into one night stands, and he said the same. I ended up sleeping with him - it was my first time, and I'm near certain it was his as well. I don't regret it at all; the sex wasn't perfect, but it was fun. Were we drunk? Yes. But not enough that we weren't aware of what we were doing.

The next morning, we just lazed about together and slept together again. I left his place mid-afternoon - we both had work to do. I called him the next day and asked if he wanted to meet up again. He said he was going to show up at an event the club was holding, the night before he was going to leave. He showed up late, and talked to a few people. I didn't get more than a passing glance and a ""hi."" I've invited him to hang out with me a few times, but every time he had other plans. It was understandable, since he was here for a very short time and made plans beforehand. Regardless, I felt that he could've spared half an hour to just relax together, work and other people aside.

I'm confused, RA. I feel like I've gone back to being ignored. I'm not sure what he wants from me, and tbh, I'm not sure what I want from him.

I like him, but I'm very much a realist. I can't make him like me, and I can't make him start a relationship with me. In all reality, he comes back to finish school this winter, before he graduates. Then, he'll most likely be back on the other side of the country working, while I still have another year of school to finish. Should I even bother to pursue him when he comes back?

I'm not sure what to do anymore, I feel as if I'm a fish floundering out of water. Help, RA?"

I'm currently a college student (2nd) year.  I don't know whether I am depressed or not (as per formal definitions or compared to others on here), but I do know that I'm perpetually worried, chronically tired, and often feel sad.  I elected to post here versus at /r/depression because I don't know how deep my problems actually are, and I don't want to offend anyone.

None of this has affected my school work, a I am fringing on a 4.0 QPA with nearly 100% in most of my engineering / math classes.  The issue is that my state of well being is so dependent on my grades that a slight stumble can set me into a depression state that lasts for days.  

The issue is that other than grades and internships and such, I have absolutely nothing going on.  I go to class, eat, and then incubate in my dorm room.  I have almost no friends up here, and I hardly have any confidence to leave my room, even to eat.  I haven't had anything close to a girlfriend for almost three years, and most of the very few friends I have up here I knew from high school.  I consider myself adept at conversation, but I cannot approach people.

I am afraid that this feeling of loneliness will evolve into a permanent mental pattern.  I have difficulty projecting myself into a future dominated by a successful career and nothing else (in fact, I worry that my intellectual successes are slowly eroding, which is one of the chief causes of the classroom anxiety described above).  Needless to say, over the last month or so (more than ever), I have felt chronically fatigued and my motivation (other than the motivation to study) in most of my affairs has started to asymptotically level to 0.  On weekends, I leave the room to eat, and that's it.

Please no behaviorist bullshit like: you need to conquer your fears and step out of your comfort zone.  It doesn't work for me, I've really made an effort.  It feels like there is a psychological barrier that is blocking me from getting away from all of this.  "

dvnvc,0,2010-10-24,[request]  Computer/Software Engineering Internship in Europe,Squirrl,Favors,https://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/dvnvc/request_computersoftware_engineering_internship/,"Hey Reddit,

As a long time lurker (on various accounts), I've seen the power of the reddit network and the huge number of obscure connections and coincidences it brings.

I am posting today to try and exercise this network to find a Computer or Software engineering internship / work experience in Europe, from January-May, 2011 - prior to me beginning a Masters degree in August.


-----------------------------


A bit of background on me and my plans:

* I am 23 and an Australian citizen.  I am eligible for any working holiday visas offered to Australians (Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden).  Furthermore, I should not have a problem getting visas for other countries if sponsored - I am single, university educated and I have no criminal record, no medical problems and no dependents.  I will be traveling to Europe on a German working holiday visa, so I can also search for jobs while I am there.

* In three weeks, I am traveling to Europe as part of an Australian sporting team, representing Australia in a world championships sporting event.  If at all possible, I do not intend to return to Australia

* I graduated university at the end of 2009 with the double degree:  BEng(Computer Engineering)(Hons 1C) + BSci(Computer Science)

* I am hoping to start a Masters degree in Europe (location based on which degree I am accepted for).  I am hoping for Zurich or Munich.

* I have worked since the beginning of the year in technology consulting, but did not enjoy it as much as the various research projects that I was involved with during my 5 years at uni.  I am looking to move into the R&amp;D field and am hoping that a masters degree will help me with this.

* I am enthusiastic, independent and very capable of learning new technologies and concepts

* I am a native English speaker and have been learning German at night-school for a year, but having never immersed myself, I would not say I am by any means fluent - I can read and write conversational German with much more confidence than I can speak and understand it - but I am keen to learn and plan to make full use of being surrounded by language and culture!



My current plan, assuming everything works out is:


* Nov: Sport

* Dec: Sport

* Jan: Work

* Feb: Work

* Mar: Work

* Apr: Work

* May: Work, then start to travel towards the end of May

* Jun: Travel

* July: Travel

* Aug: Finish up with travel and start to study

* Onwards:  Masters degree until 2013.




If you are interested in reading more about me, I have uploaded a resume (with most identifying information rescinded) **[here](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/200153/Squirrl%20-%20Resume%20%28blanked%29.pdf)**


**If you are interested in my full resume - PM me and I will link you to my complete resume, contact details and references if required.**




I'm happy to answer any questions you may have, but would prefer not to publicly announce my identity.

Cheers,
Squirrl


-----------------------------


**TL;DR:** As I am over in Europe at the end of 2010 for sport, but do not begin a Masters degree until August, I am hoping to find some computer/software engineering work experience to help pay cost of living and allow me to stay in Europe during this transition time

*EDIT:  Also, if anyone could suggest some other subreddits where I could cross post this, it would be much appreciated.  I thought about /r/Germany and /r/Europe, but they seem to be more news related.*"

will you come to my aid in my struggles to build a new gaming machine?

-----------------------------

**Here's the setup so far:**

* Motherboard: Asus - Socket 1156 - ATX Intel P55 (P7P55D PRO)

* Corsair XMS3 4096MB DDR3 PC3-12800 1600MHz 2X2

* Fractal Design Define R3

* Gigabyte GeForce GTX 460 1GB OC

* Intel Core i5 760 2.80GHz / 8MB / Socket 1156

* OCZ PowerSupply (PSU) 600W ModXStream Pro

* Samsung Spinpoint F3 1TB (7200RPM / 32MB Cache)

* Samsung Intern SATA DVD±RW 22x - Svart (Dual-Layer) (SH-S223C) (Bulk)

-----------------------------

My goal for this machine is to be able to play a variety of games on high or good settings. I care about noise, and also about upgradeability.

-----------------------------

**Here are some questions:**

1.	The reason I'm paying for the “Pro” in the motherboard is that this one supports SLI. Will upgrading (with a second identical GPU) in the future work well with this motherboard and the rest of the machine?

2.	What do you think of the general noisiness of this machine?

3.	I have the option of buying the same thing from another store at a slightly different price with some components changing, do you think these changes would be upgrades or downgrades? The changes would be:

GPU turns into *Gainward GTX 460 1gb Golden Sample* instead of the Gigabyte with the same numbers

PSU turns into *Corsair TX 650W* instead of the OCZ

HD turns into *Western Digital  Caviar Green Power 1TB 3Gb/s 64Mb Cache* instead of the Samsung

dw6va,2,2010-10-25,"Reddit, help me choose a job(Engineering or Consulting)!",FatBabyCat,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dw6va/reddit_help_me_choose_a_jobengineering_or/,"Okay, I am a 21 year old senior in college graduating in may.  

I currently have one job offer for a software engineering role and have two second round interviews coming up with the big 4 for a consulting role where I will most likely get an offer.  

This past summer I did an SE internship in Silicon valley with a large software company. I currently have an offer from them and would be living and working in California where I would be starting off at 76k and a 10k relocation bonus. I may be able to negotiate to 80-85k.
 
This sounds great but I hated my job / company culture at my internship.  Most the engineers were introverted and I had no one to talk to at work.  Most the employees were older and had been working at the company for a while and were never excited about anything.  I also didn't like San Jose that much.

I had an office visit to a big 4 office in NYC and really liked the employees and atmosphere.  However, I am not sure if consulting would be any better.  I would most likely be making less starting at around 60k.  The cost of living in NYC is also a lot higher than California.  In Cali, I could continue to live like a college student and save up 40k in a year.   In NYC, I feel like I would be living paycheck to paycheck.  

Should I make the smart decision and go with the higher paying job where I would make 20k-30k more a year at the company I know I disliked?  Or should I take a risk and accept a Consulting position that pays less and I may dislike just as much?  Consulting would be about (20% travel) and working in forensics(enterprise stuff).  It sounds cool but I am not sure if it is. 


Ideally, I'd like to take a semester off to intern for a start-up before graduating to see how I like it but my dad may be loosing his construction job soon so my parents are pressuring me to graduate on time.

I am sure there a lot of people on reddit who have worked in both roles so give me your ideas.   Has anyone here worked in Penetration Testing or Forensics?  What do you think about it?  

**tldr: Choose high paying Software Engineering job at company I didnt like or go with a lower paying consulting job at Big 4 firm?**

dw7ts,1,2010-10-25,Can't bring myself to hurt her.,sometimesacoward,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dw7ts/cant_bring_myself_to_hurt_her/,"I'm 21, she's 22. We've been together for about a year now, and have been really close, rarely leaving each others side. I stay at her place 6/7 nights a week, we split groceries and all the works. I love being with her, we make each other laugh constantly. I've never had so much fun just hanging out with someone.

On to the bad parts. Sex life sucks. Maybe once a week, and there is no flexibility no blowjobs, no adventures, no regularity. I think it stems from her low self esteem (she is pretty overweight) but it makes things sometimes frustrating for me. We've talked about it and she agrees to work on it, but never with results. Also she is very temperamental and subject to mood swings. I've never been with another girl this seriously so I don't know if it's normal. When I leave she is much less functional and gets depressed. I left for a week to my place to study and she quit attending class. She is very dependant on me. I've been contemplating breaking up with her but have always found the thought of hurting her too revolting. I really do love her.

So I got offered a great internship with a well known company 1000km away. I want to take it, but it'll crush her. She'll fall into a slump if I leave. I have been considering taking a lesser job locally to make her happy. She spent a lot of last night crying, thinking I might be leaving. She can't come because she still attends school for the first 4 months of my job. But it's only an 8 month internship.

Does anyone have any advice for how I can put myself first without feeling shitty for hurting her? I know the right thing to do is break up with her and take the job, but I can't bring myself to put her through that. The thought of making her cry is almost enough for me to lower my career goals and stay here. I just need advice on how to get over it and do the right thing for myself."
dwgeu,8,2010-10-26,Another Question about IT work,burt0n,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/dwgeu/another_question_about_it_work/,"Hey guys I was wondering if you would be able to help me figure out some stuff.  I am  about to complete a degree in Criminal Justice ( i know complete opposite), however I have always had a passion for computers also. I took a computer repair course back in high school (graduated in 05) and been fixing computers for family and friends ever since. I also helped at times testing hardware for a family friends small ebay business.
 

Here is the problem I want to try out IT work seeing as I really like working with computers. Plus the whole criminal justice field is not doing to well unless you want to move to the border in Texas or Arizona. My SO and I rather stay here in Orange County. Every job I have looked at for IT work requires some kind of degree or certs and will not even look at my resume seeing as I have no formal work experience. I have been applying and searching for jobs but they all require experience and it seems no companies will take you without any experience. So i am trying to find some kind of internship or volunteer work. If you guys have any ideas to gain experience for this let me know also please.


So I am looking at getting either an AA degree in Computer Information Systems or some kind of cert such as a the community college has a PC/Networking Hardware Cert. The thing is the AA degree they offer seems to have nothing to do with networking or hardware. The courses include: Access, Excel, Accounting, And word processing. So am i better off with AA in pretty much basic computer skills which i already have or going with an actual Cert. The cert courses include: Operating Systems, PC Hardware Configs, Intro Networking Hardware, Computer Desktop Support, Windows Server Administration. 


So which one do you guys think would be the best to help get my feet into IT/Network door? Eventually I might pursue a computer forensics cert in order to use both computers and criminal justice. 
 

Thanks for the help guys!"

If I can't get anywhere with my portfolio by just working 4 days a week, then perhaps I shouldn't bother going with graphics.   I might go part time if I decide to take my work and become very serious with it and have a clear/certain path in my life.  I don't know why, but your advices simply help me clear up my mind even though I should have been capable of coming up with them on my own.

This is probably not going to be as interesting as other posts you can find here, but I always felt that reddit could come up with some great advice, and I would appreciate even just a few regarding this matter(my first time posting ).  

I majored as an art student(3d animation), and I was pretty ok at it(best on my class, but my school was not as good compared to others - had to learn mostly everything on my own).  Because of some circumstances, I wasn't able to get a job right away, turned down some internships, and eventually had to work as a waiter to help support my parents.  Eventually, I was hired by a company(not related to my studies) that recruits international students, and I am now working full time as a tutor/assistant manager.  The job is easy, but I am not getting anything from it.  I hate dealing with the people at the company and   I am also sick of the kids and tutoring.  The pay is not bad ($40,000), and with the economy the way it is, I am thankful I have it.  
I've been trying to work on my portfolio(my old stuff is outdated, and must update my work) for years and get some stuff done so I could find either an internship or go back to school and get an MFA.  Unfortunately, I've procastinated too much on it, and after a day of work, I just don't want to do anything.
I was told that one of the reasons why I was not inclined to work on my portfolio or to find something better is because I just didn't have time and because I felt comfortable with my job.
Now some of the reasons why I don't want to change the way my life is  because the economy(feel lucky to have an easy job), the uncertainty that even after working on my portfolio maybe I won't be able to find a job(it's hard getting into this industry), and of course I hate change.
 
I know that some people might say that I should follow my dreams, but sometimes I find that type of mindset to be a bit unrealistic. 

Anyway, I have talked to my boss about it, and he has been supportive about it and even gave me fridays off(not much work on fridays anyways) so I could do something with my life, but he said that he still needs me at the company and doesn't want me to go part time.   I am considering just telling him that I want to work about 4 hours a day(tutoring only)instead so I can spend more time on my own work.  This means that I'll be paid only a fraction of what I was getting paid before.  I do have some money saved up, and I should be able to survive for a good 6-8 months or more.

Anyways, depending on the advice I get from you guys,  I will either keep the way things are or take a risk and focus on an uncertain future.

Thanks Reddit."

What now?,throw54321away,relationship_advice,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/dxaju/she_says_she_wishes_shed_met_me_later_in_life/,"I figure I'll just try and write down all the relevant info I can think of here, and I kind of need to get the whole story out there for my own sake, so I apologize in advance for rambling.

I'm 22 and she's 23, and we've been dating for almost exactly 1 year now. When we first met, things were going really well. She was finishing up college (business communication major) and I was in my 1st (and most grueling) year of grad school. She had originally gone to college as part of a specialized acting program, but had dropped out without finishing after feeling fed-up with the people and being concerned about the pragmatics of being a career actress. Before meeting her, I had never had a serious girlfriend but a few flings here and there. To be honest I was a little inexperienced, having lost my virginity only around a year before we met. Either way, we met at a bar and had a great ""official"" first date a few days later. 

Towards the beginning of the summer, she started getting anxious about what she'd do after graduating. She had had a few PR internships, but when we talked about them she seemed unsatisfied. Around that time, I asked her what she'd really truly want to do with her life (ignoring money) and she said she wanted to act, so I encouraged her to follow her passion. For a little while after, she was considering heading to L.A., where she thought she had to be to pursue acting. This would mean essentially breaking up, as I live and go to school on the east coast. We talked seriously about it for weeks, and in the end she decided to stay where she was, and even moved to an apartment in my neighborhood and got a waitressing job there, too. Throughout all of this our relationship remained strong, and I would say it get even stronger with her deciding to move a little closer by. 

Throughout our relationship I feel like I've gone out of my way to be a source of support and advice for this girl. It seems like the majority of our conversations would inevitably turn towards her: her anxieties about her coworkers, her insecurities about acting, etc. Most of the time I was okay with this, seeing as how I was in a relatively stable position in my life (in school) and she was going through this crazy transition. I wanted to be there for her, I sort of felt that it was my duty.  

Anyway, last weekend I went out of state with my mother and sister to visit my grandmother. My granny doesn't have much time left, and I hadn't seen her for too long so I considered it a family obligation. Suffice it to say that this trip was a little depressing for me. Before leaving and during the trip, I noticed that my GF seemed a lot more distant when I talked to her over the phone. I was often bored during the trip, and would call her and not receive a response, or have a brief, rushed conversation with her. When I got back, I noticed that she was still acting like this, so I asked her about it. At first she told me she was just maybe a little depressed and stressed out (she worked hard over the weekend). 

She was still acting this way last night, and so I asked her about it again. I told her she seemed distant and could tell me if there was anything on her mind. She started to cry and told me that she was feeling weird about being in a relationship at this stage of her life. She told me she thought I was perfect, but she gets the feeling sometimes of missing out on life because she's in a serious relationship. She said she wished she had met me later in life when she wouldn't feel this way. 

As you can imagine, hearing this was hard. I told her I'd be lying if I didn't feel the same way sometimes, but the stability of a serious girlfriend was something I'd grown to appreciate. I suggested we consider taking some time away from one another for a little while. She wanted to know what the terms of some ""time away"" would be, and I told her I wasn't sure. We agreed to keep talking about it. 

I'd like to hear an outside perspective on this, reddit. Being that close to somebody for the first time is an eye-opening experience, and I wonder if my willingness to give advice and put her before myself has made me seem weak or dependent. It might sound awful, but I'm afraid of resenting her for all the effort I put into the relationship. 

Whaddyya think?

**Edit:** TL;DR - She says she feels like she's missing out on life because of our serious relationship, but thinks I'm great. I try to be super supportive, and I suggested some time apart. What are your suggestions?"
dxb78,2,2010-10-27,Girlfriend wants to get engaged now.,panzero0,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dxb78/girlfriend_wants_to_get_engaged_now/,"TL;DR - I'm a 25 year old professional and she is a 22 y/o grad student with one semester of school left and a 15 week internship out of town. She wants to get engaged before her internship but I don't want to be engaged and alone for 15 weeks of our engagement.

First of all, I initially didn't want to get engaged for another year but she is pressuring me. I've somewhat given in to her pressure and we've looked at rings, yada yada yada. EDIT: We've been dating for just over a year

Secondly, her internship experience will be much better if it's out of town and her chances of getting a great job are a lot higher if she goes out of town. There are opportunities nearby but they suck and it won't look great on her resume.

I may have an unwarranted fear because my sister tried a long distance engagement and it didn't work out. 

Should I be celebrating time alone? She is normally the one that is so clingy, I just think it would be so strange to be committed to someone that is so intangible, so to speak.

EDIT: It'd be so much easier for us if we just waited until she was done with school. Why can't she wait?

I graduated from college about 2 years ago and I messed around at a couple non-web corporate jobs until I realized that I wanted to focus on web development as a career path.  When applying, I had no agency experience and my portfolio was pretty weak (web development had always been a hobby of mine -- I have only been *paid* by friends/friends-of-friends to make simple static HTML sites...), but I was persistent and somehow convinced the President to bring me on-board.  

I've been here for about 8 months now and things have been going well.  The boss hired me purely because of my interest in the subject and my ability to sell myself -- he didn't really have any idea what he would do with me (My compensation reflects that -- I'm paid like a well-paid intern w/ no benefits).  I've since been involved in almost every aspect of agency life: HTML, CSS, JQuery, Project Management, Production Management, QA, Research/Digital Strategy...I've run client meetings, I've managed a small team of developers, UX designed two small sites...kind of everything.  

I was reviewing a project plan for an upcoming project (I was asked to take a look at the functional requirements) and noticed the rate at which my services were being billed...nearly 5x what I am paid by my agency.  I went back and looked at another project I worked on and my services were billed at the same rate. This stood out as ridiculous to me...they're billing the client the same cost as a person 2-3 levels higher than me in terms of seniority.  Keep in mind, I am still very inexperienced in the agency world and I am the youngest in the office (early twenties), but don't you think an 80% margin on my services is a little bit odd?  I mean, Apple has a 40% margin and that's unheard of.

Is this just one of the ""pay your dues"" things?  Should I say something? Maybe my angst is lingering around from when I was a teenager, but I work a lot longer hours and a lot more projects than most of the people here and seemingly am compensated significantly less.  I don't know what to do.

Maybe I should just relax and enjoy the job that I thought was great until I came across this?

I appreciate the feedback."
dxhop,1,2010-10-27,Need CS Career Advice...,purplegui,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/dxhop/need_cs_career_advice/,"Hi all,

**Background:**
I am currently a senior CS major at a top-tier-ish public university and will graduate next June. I interned this past summer as a software engineer and the position has been extended into a PT position until the end of this calendar year. That, however, is also my first and only internship experience. I have limited research experience, as well (just starting).

What I gathered from my internship experience is this: I am not satisfied with sitting in a cube write code all day. I want to work on challenging problems. I don't want to write bitch code (perhaps part of being an intern?). Also, the experienced affirmed my belief that, in CS, experience trumps education (to a degree). If given the initial opportunity, 4 years of work experience trumps 4 years of college education.

**That said, here's my question:**
I'm now at a time where my decision would most likely affect how the rest of my life plays out.

Should I get a job after getting the B.S.? It seems to me this means getting a job that would be pure coding 24/7. That, of course, could be good or bad, depending on the projects I work on. I would also be able to be independent.

Should I go for an M.S.? An M.S. in Com Sci would give me some boost in salary, but would cost me another year or so of tuition and life. Is it worth it? Does it open that many more doors?

Lastly, the Ph.D. It requires a great amount of dedication. It requires around 4~6 years of my life. However, most colleges pay for your Ph.D. tuition. It doesn't give much of a salary boost compared to an M.S. However, it gives me the opportunity to do research and to teach, which I enjoy vastly.

So, reddit, I am really at a crossroads. I've given many thoughts to this subject and, with the grad school deadlines quickly approaching, I really can't delay this much longer. Your inputs are really appreciated.

Note: This is a throwaway. I don't know why I posted this under a throwaway, really. I'm a pussy?

*edit1:* My current research is in bioinformatics, if that matters."
dxz0p,5,2010-10-28,I would like some feedback from biomedical engineers- is it possible to go to grad school in biomedical engineering with decent (around a 3.1) GPA bachelors in electrical engineering?,chandrax,engineering,https://www.reddit.com/r/engineering/comments/dxz0p/i_would_like_some_feedback_from_biomedical/,"I have one semester left (after this one) and am getting ready to start the grad school application process. Biomedical engineering is what I am interested in. I am passionate about electronics, micro-controllers, and electrical theory but even more than that I am passionate about using what I know to try to help people. 

So far the schools I am looking at are only the University of Madison Wisconsin (the brain-twitter research project was awesome), and Virginia Tech (I had an internship there). 

Is there another way to get into the R and D side of the biomedical industry? I am from Alaska where practically no biomedical engineering research goes on and there are no biomedical engineering companies. 

Last question: What should I do to prepare my background for grad school? Are basic biology classes a requirement (that would be worth extending by graduation date out for in order to get those classes under my belt) or would I be fine just applying with what I have? 

I'm a girl, if it makes any difference (it shouldn't but sometimes it can help one stand out from an application pile of mostly male candidates).

I'd really appreciate any comments, pieces of advice, stories, or even sammich requests (but only if you are prepared for one fitted with electrical gidgets!) :)"

I'm 21, 5'9"" 167 lbs. I'm a college student. In my high school years and the first year of college or so, it seemed I was always moving. I walked almost everywhere I could, I was semi-active, and it never seemed like I needed to worry about my diet at all. Weight was simply a non-issue. 

Flash forward a few years. I did 6 months of internship last year - typical desk job - no movement at all. No exercise, no calorie control, and lots of snacks in my desk, and the 'ol Poptarts for breakfast. I didn't think anything of it. I was back in school this summer and I tried to be more active with my free time...bike riding, hiking...and I think it was enough to maintain my weight and offset my crappy eating.

Skipping to the punchline....
Over the last year, I've gained 12 lbs., from 155 to 167, my blood pressure has gone up, I feel much less in shape. I understand that it's much easier to fix the problem now rather than later.

I'm addicted to food. I loved eating, and unhealthy meals were my way of coping with anxiety. I shoveled in chips and cookies at work when I was bored. Not so good. I've counted my calories, and realized that my diet was *very* high in carbs and sugars, and low in protein. I've been trying to make a few healthy changes....

* If I didn't consciously keep track of my calories, I could shovel in an easy 2300-2400 a day of unhealthy items without thought. Now I've cut back and can do more along the lines of 1800 with some willpower. 

* I've cut out fast food almost completely besides the occasional social outing. I make sure I pack my lunch at work (whole wheat roast beef sandwich with spinach leaves and canola oil mayo) and make sure I have some carrot sticks to nibble on. Oatmeal with dried fruit instead of poptarts. I still have my morning hot chocolate (not so great, but I use lowfat milk and the powder sparingly).

* I've exchanged soda for sparkling fruit juice. Less sugar, real fruit juice. Not ideal, but it's a start.

* I've started doing the P90 (not P90X) workout tapes. I either do that or try to get 30 or 40 minutes of bike riding or walking in each day to at least get started.

* I've tried changing my desserts to better options. A granola bar instead of cookies. Greek yogurt instead of icecream. Simple things like that to move in the right direction. 

Over the last few weeks I've probably dropped a pound or so. My principal complaint so far is I feel hungry without ""unlimited"" food. I assume it's the high carb/high sugar combo. Does anyone have any tips for lowering carbs and sugar and increasing protein to feel fuller?

I realize that 10-12 pounds shouldn't be a daunting task. I'm really hoping I can change my diet to get back into shape as well as drop some weight (it's no fun when your clothes from last year don't fit!). Hopefully soon I won't feel like I need a cardiologist on speed dial during exercise, and I'll start going down in weight instead of creeping up. Your advice, motivation, and tips are appreciated :)
