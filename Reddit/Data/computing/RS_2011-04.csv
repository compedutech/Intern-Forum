Show her some love!",[deleted],reddit.com,https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/ggh81/hey_reddit_my_wife_an_awesome_local_artist_in/,"Hey guys. Here’s the deal:

[This is my wife.](http://imgur.com/vorYr) She’s an intern at a local art gallery in Lansing, MI. The owners told her she could have the month of April to put together an exhibition. She chose to feature her fellow alumni and faculty from the art school she attended. On top of her day job as a middle school art teacher, she poured herself into this project, making phone calls and trips all over the state to pick up pieces to include in the show.

Now, some key people who were *supposed* to help her out have made it clear they don’t believe in her, even telling her not to get too upset if ""nobody comes to your little show."" Let’s prove them wrong!
If you’re in the Lansing area, or know anyone who is, please consider stopping by and showing her some support.

It’s free! And there’ll be food!

Here’s the info:
Sat, April 2 from 6-10pm
Gallery 1212, Turner St, Lansing MI 
(in Old Town)

**Edit:** The quote above isn't meant to encompass the entire situation, of course. This has been an ongoing thing for a few weeks now, and in the meantime they haven't followed through on almost anything she was counting on them to do to make the exhibition successful. Whether you think they're ""real"" haters or not, it's a pretty crappy situation and she could use someone in her corner. Not asking for any nasty emails or anything, just if you happen to be in the area, maybe swing by and take a look."

I am a rising senior at JMU and am currently enrolled in the SMAD program (School of Media Arts and Design) with a converged/interactive media concentration. So far, I have been taught basic css and html, some experience with photoshop and dreamweaver, and that's it. Within my course studies I will touch lightly on Java and flash, but that seems to be all that is covered. It seems to me that every internship, much less job, has a LONG list of programming languages/softwares that I need to learn or be familiar with in order to be considered for a position. I am most interested in the coding side of web design (back end) because I am not a graphic designer. I can set up a nice layout and edit in photoshop but have no artistic talent for graphic design. I get the feeling I should have been a computer science major, but it's too late...or I may have to consider getting a bachelor in science for a cs degree, which would mean starting all over when I only have 1 year left to get my BA double majoring in SMAD and English. I just don't know what to do!

Please, tell me if you know what the best options I have are. The things I'd like to familiarize myself with are:

- HTML 
- CSS 
- PHP 
- Javascript 
- AJAX 
- ASP.NET 
- MySQL 
- Joomla 
- Drupal 
- WordPress 
- Adobe Photoshop 
- Adobe Dreamweaver 
- Adobe Illustrator 
- Adobe InDesign 
- Adobe Fireworks
- Flash
-JQuery
-C++

(this is just a list of what I've seen from internships/jobs. Please also note which ones are most important, etc.)

Also, just to give you a reference of what I can do (not much)...here's the only web site I have designed so far. This should give you an idea of my amateur level of knowledge and help you steer me in the right direction hopefully. And please bear with me, I know it's cringe-worthy...

http://www.countrykids.biz

I just don't know where to get experience with these. I know a lot of it can be self taught, but I do so much better with a structured program. Does anyone know of online courses/distance learning with a good university that could help supplement my BA degree in Media Arts and Design? Or do you have any other suggestions for me? Your help would be greatly appreciated."

Talked to my boss about it, delta was used as the change in time between when a signal was being sent and when a signal was being received.

I am interested in interning at (psychological research organization) over the summer of 2011. I learned of this opportunity through a current research assistant at your organization, Derpela Herpette.

My academic and professional experiences have equipped me with a broad range of expertise in disciplines that closely parallel the requirements of this internship.

A high level of concentration and excellent organizational skills have helped me achieve a strong academic record at HerpaDerpa College which reflects my diligence and commitment to success. Rigorous liberal arts courses and a concentration in psychology—involving in-depth research and analysis—have provided me with sharp analytical, problem-solving, and research skills. I have also developed research skills in a different capacity by compiling and analyzing data in Experimental Psychology and Statistics courses.

Furthermore, my academic career has been complemented by my diverse professional career. My tenures at Herp City Council, Law Office of Attorney Herpen Derpowitz, Derp LLC, and Herp Inc. have required me to interact with people on a day-to-day basis in both formal and informal settings—which has helped me develop strong interpersonal and communication skills.

This internship would provide me with an ideal opportunity to assist your organi­zation, and to expand the breadth of my knowledge and experience. I am confident that I would be a valuable asset to your organization, and I look forward to hearing from you. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

I'm a graduating college senior finishing with an engineering degree and pretty much starting last semester I started to despise my choice in getting an engineering degree.  The only reason I chose engineering was for the job security and I somewhat had an aptitude for math and science but now after some internships I realize that for the next 30-35 years I'm going to be behind a desk, doing shit that I don't enjoy, just so I can have a steady income and because my parents were proud that I chose the career path that I did.  Also, I know as a salaried position you put in more than just a straight 8 hour workday and it pisses me off to know that I won't be able to leave after my 8 hours is done.  Additionally, I've taken a strong interest in the arts whether it's cinema or theatre, since I've been in college, I wondered if it had something to do with an emotional output, but I really didn't know.

I can't help but thinking about Fight Club and Tyler Durden's saying, ""Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need.""  If I could say ""fuck it"" to having a full time job and find something I like I would, but the things I enjoy doing are not profit making activities.  I feel what I ultimately lack is a goal in life.  Every morning I wake up and get out of bed, it's not because I want to, it's because I have to.  

And then there's the problem with attracting the opposite sex.  I feel like when I engage in conversation with a girl,  I can't actively enjoy the conversation without passively thinking ""is there more to this"" or ""should I make a move"".  Whereas  if I talk to a girl with no ulterior motive I enjoy the conversation, but miss an opportunity to possibly make something more than just an acquaintance.  And sometimes I'll think back and remember how the girl I was talking to was really smiling and enjoying what I had to say, I should have gotten her number.  And when I do get a number, there's texts back and forth but when it comes to setting things up, there's always an excuse for why she can't make it out and it's usually multiple times, which I've internalized and stopped pursuing girls.  This inability to just simply connect with people has left me feeling really lonely.  I can have base conversations and idle chit chat with people, but to truly connect doesn't happen, I don't know if this is just due to inexperience or if I'm just being blind and not taking a leap of faith.

I don't want out of a relationship someone simply to answer my problems and take care of me; but for me getting to know someone on an intimate and personal level is what I desire.  I've never had a relationship at all on an intimate level with a girl and as I grow older it's the one thing I truly fear will never happen. "

Right now I am working as a paid SEO intern at a small family run website, www.stretcher.com, we focus on articles that deal with anything from how to cook to finding cheap car insurance, but the main idea behind most of our articles is how you can become more frugal and spend less money. I started working for them about the same time the semester started and I have been trying to help get their site to show up higher in the search results but lately (Partly due to the new “farmer” update) I have found it near impossible to fix the site. 

A little background, I am a college student with an AS who knows almost nothing about SEO, I have been learning what I can from online courses as well as articles/blogs/youtube but I am still very inexperienced when it comes to improving a sites search ranking. Why would I apply for an internship in SEO if I knew nothing about it you ask? Well they kind of asked specifically for someone like me, someone with little to no SEO experience who would, as they put it “Learn on the job”.

The farmer update hit us really hard (We went down 45%), while we have been working to get back to where we used to be, I’m wondering if it’s even possible. 

I think one of our major problems is our high bounce rate, at the moment the average bounce rate is around 85% for the entire site and I am honestly not sure how I could improve it. Right now we are trying to manually add “Related Content” sections to each article that is still doing well after the update, but with over 7500 articles it’s going rather slowly. 

I have also read about how Google (and people) generally don’t like waiting around for a web page to load, and that our long load times (an average of seven seconds per page) might be causing us to lose traffic/be ignored by Googlebot, is this true?

Currently we are working on just putting keywords and re-writing each individual page in an attempt to improve our ranking, but I honestly don’t think that’s our biggest problem. 

If someone could give me some suggestions as to how we could improve our ranking it would be appreciated, I know we could try getting some links into the site but they (the site owners) doubt how effective it would be and would rather have me sit here for hours rewriting articles.

I dated this girl my last year in college for about 9 months. She was like the exact opposite of me - I was liberal, atheist, shy/antisocial; she was conservative, religious, in a sorority. Despite the differences, we were really happy together. Eventually with our graduations looming and mostly my stubbornness, we split up and I took it pretty hard. But I made a promise to myself to become a better person. I started working out, focusing on trying to improve my social/fashion skills, working on being more tolerant/openminded, etc. and to an extremely large extent, I feel I succeeded. One night, I was drunk and facebook messaged her kind of just saying hey and hoping that she was doing better. She ended up coming over and staying the night. Slowly we started talking again via text, pretty much every day. Her texts were always the highlight of my day. I'm working in KS as a chemist, and she's moved to Atlanta, GA for an internship. We start to talk about life goals and how we've changed, etc. and it slowly evolves into a 'hey, you know, we seemed to be much more in line with each other now, maybe there's a possibility this could work this time'. And the sentiment is mutual. I plan a trip to fly down and visit her this past weekend, with the intent of laying the formation for a slow, but potentially great recovery and loving relationship.

Friday night, I get in and we go out drinking. We're being really flirty and having a great time then she just disappears. So now I'm alone in a bar in a foreign land and super confused. After 45 minutes of looking for her, I find her in the backseat of her car with some random guy. She doesn't even know his name, and they're clothed, but I flip out. She says it's not what it looks like, etc etc. We go back to her place, have angry sex, and pass out. In the morning we talk about it; she says she was scared/nervous about me being there, and this is her way of pushing people away when they get close. She says she loves me and wants to be with me, but doesn't think she can offer me what I want/deserve from her. I play the role of the nice guy and say ""alright, well, let's do some sight seeing and rent a movie and take it easy tonight, my flight leaves in the morning."" She thinks that's a great idea and she gets in the shower. While she's showering, I'm laying there and I kind of freak out. I sit up, think to myself ""No, I'm sick of being a good guy and letting girls walk all over me"". So I start to pack my stuff up to head to the airport and leave early. She gets out and asks me what's wrong, and I respectfully let her have it. I tell her that what she did is not okay, and that I came down here with what I felt like was a mutual interest in pursuing a meaningful relationship only to have her pull some insane stunt that hurt me more than I can put into words. She cries and apologizes, and I give her every chance to stop me from leaving, but she doesn't. I walk to the door, without turning to look at her say ""I hope you get everything you want in life"" and walk out. After walking for 45 min trying to figure out where the hell I am to call a cab, I find a McDonalds and start looking up cab numbers on my phone. She calls me. She asks me to come back and talk to her and stay. I comply. We kind of lounge around at her apt for the rest of the day, rent a movie and snuggle and watch it, then go to bed (no sex). We wake up, she takes me to the airport and I leave. She texts me after I leave telling me that she loves me and she's sorry, she just doesn't think she can give me what I want right now, and that she wants to be with me and that she needs me to be a part of her life. I tell her that I wish I could understand that. I tell her that I need some time away from talking to her for a while to try and figure out what I need to do.

I don't know what to do. I feel like my entire motivation to keep waking up and going to work is gone now. I think there's a part of her that wants what I want - the ""well, I'm an adult now and I want to settle down and share my life with someone"" stage but I also think she isn't completely out of that ""I'm young and want to party and meet people and be crazy"" stage either. I don't want to let her go, but I don't want to wait around to be the consolation prize because I might be waiting for nothing. She has always had psychological issues, she's been suicidal/a self mutilator in the past, and I think she's dealing with some of that stuff right now, so I don't want to leave her to deal with that alone, but I can't let myself be dangled along. I guess I just don't know what to do and don't know how to keep on keeping on. I know this was long, but thanks for reading."

I'm not exactly intelligent, so university is a serious struggle and it's difficult to find time to build up a decent portfolio so I'll have something to present to employers when I'm out of there.

Also, the software engineering program I'm in forces us to find internships every once in a while and I'm starting to feel the heat of competition. Employers are going to give me a lot less leeway in terms of how lacking in knowledge I am as I progress through uni.

I want to be a game developer. Though, right now my internship has me managing some CRM apps, which I don't particularly mind either. 
Any developing's good, really, wouldn't mind freelancing and doing whatever oddball job I can find. Gaming's where I'd favour, but isn't really required.

Truth be told, I can honestly say my only real experience in programming languages is (sigh) Visual FoxPro because that's what I've been doing the last three months for my internship. I scraped basic SQL from a QA job I had before, but nothing too advanced. I'm attempting to manage a blog, but my HTML, CSS and PHP skills could use some work so I'm really just stealing off a default skin. University / high school led me through C, C++, Java and Scheme (hah), but for whatever reason, I don't feel like you can understand the ins and outs for each language by only doing incredibly tricky one-shot assignments as opposed to a program to be released for public use.

Enough backstory, into the actual questions.

1. What matters more, the number of projects or the size? In other words, would it be better to do a bunch of small little applications (like a bunch of mini-games) or chart out one big project (like a console-ish game)?

2. For those of you that schedule out your hobby projects, what do you do to help you stick to schedule? (University hogs so much time some days...)

3. Does it matter how many languages you know and what each project is based on? Or would I better my time using what I know instead of picking up new languages and their interesting IDEs?"

gitf9,98,2011-04-04,There's something in Hawaii.,[deleted],nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/gitf9/theres_something_in_hawaii/,"I know it's cheesy to say ""this story is 100% true"", but in this case it is. I'm a regular redditor and you can look at my comment history if you doubt me. 

Last year I did an internship in Hawaii in agroforestry. I lived on a farm on a lava flow on the Big Island; it was a small place, so it was only the farmer, his dog, and myself living there at the time. This part of Hawaii is mostly uninhabitable due to the lava rock, but the farmer had managed to keep a decent forest of fruit trees going with innovative techniques. He was a bit of a nut, living out there all alone, and was really big on sustainability. The place was powered by solar panels, which worked about 60% of the five months I spent there.

One night, I was walking from the main part of the farm back to my yurt, along the main path. It was a moonless night, and I didn't bother bringing my flashlight as I'm really not afraid of the dark. I was able to navigate by looking up to see the trees to either side of me obscure the stars in the sky. Also, the lighthouse to the south would flash a faint bit of light about every 15 seconds, and I could use it to reorient myself when if I got turned around. The total distance was no more than 1/2 a mile, and it usually took me about 15 minutes to walk.

Now, the place I was living has some history. [See here.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kapoho,_Hawai'i) The lava flow made a ring around a 10-acre patch of rainforest, which they called a ""kipuka"". The idea is that Pele, the goddess of fire, spared this patch of forest because it is spiritually sacred. I worked within the forest for several hours every day, and my yurt sat right on its perimeter.

After about 10 minutes, I reached the point where the little path to my place cut off from the main trail. To help me find the path in the dark, I had tied a piece of white cloth onto a tree branch (I had missed it way too many times) so I knew where to turn. The cloth barely registered in my vision on this night, but it was better than nothing.

The secondary path to my yurt was really narrow and overgrown, so I couldn't use the stars to navigate the rest of the way, but rather had to rely on memory and my outstretched arms as a last resort. It was kind of relaxing and exhilarating at the same time. I liked to pretend that I was an original Polynesian settler- before the introduction of electricity and flashlights.

I had just turned onto my path when I heard something crashing through the trees and brush, about 15 feet ahead and to the left. My first thought was pigs, which often came at night to tear up roots and plants, so I froze in place, listening. Before I knew what was happening, the thing came bolting down the path towards me at full speed. It was then I realized that whatever this thing was, it was clearly bipedal. I was paralyzed by fear and bewilderment, and it was still coming. To my amazement, it *sped up* as it passed by me, brushing my upper arm (I'm 6' 2""), and crashed back into the brush behind me and to the right. I was only able to make out a simple form, but it was definitely not any animal found in the entire islands of Hawaii.

As soon as it went crashing into the forest, my paralysis broke, and I broke into a full sprint back the entire 1/2 mile to the main farm. I started yelling the farmer's name, freaking out the dog, and he came running. (Nothing like this had ever happened before.) Between breaths, I told him what happened, and his eyes widened with every detail. Without saying a word, he fished out his .22, got the dog on the leash, and went searching for the intruder. I grabbed my flashlight and followed. The moment we reached the spot of the encounter, the dog flipped out, barking, and tore off into the forest in the same direction the thing went, following a scent trail. After a tense 20 minutes, she finally came back, no sign of anything.

We never figured out what it was. I used my flashlight every night after that."

gl4tl,9,2011-04-07,Struggling college student asking anyone who has been to college for their input. Please.,FavoriteFlatPillow,self,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/gl4tl/struggling_college_student_asking_anyone_who_has/,"I'm currently a junior in college majoring in mechanical engineering. I finally mustered up the courage to write this post in hopes that there would be some people here that can provide some helpful information. I think today was my ""breaking point"" as I just bombed my second introduction to materials engineering exam. 

I am sorry if I am being overdramatic about trivial issues, but this has been a large concern for me for my entire college career. I'm not sure how to piece the ""problems"" together, but I will try to make this as clear as possible. It might be kinda long, but if you're bored, I'd greatly appreciate any feedback. **I bolded the questions that I wanted to ask you guys, so you don't have to waste your time reading this entire thing.**

When I was growing up, I always had an interest in taking things apart, figuring out what made things work, repairing things, etc. My parents noticed this as I grew up and instilled in my mind that I would make a great engineer. Momma always knows best right? I can't say for sure, but maybe this was a wrong move. People have always said to choose your major based on your interests. But at the time, I really did think that engineering would be a great thing. I was involved in an electrical engineering internship my senior year in high school. I made test fixtures that monitored mail sorting devices. I knew that being a high schooler, my tasks would be limited to smaller, easier things. But just sitting in that firm building, with it's dull concrete floor and musty air, I couldn't imagine doing this every day for the rest of my life. Maybe that should've been sign number one. . .

Anyways, I got into college afterwards majoring in electrical engineering as well. Short story short, I switched out after my first semester because I truly believed it was not something I wanted to do. I was never interested in electrical circuits and programming (no offense, I was just extremely terrible at it). After that I have and still continue to pursue an undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering. I am expected to graduate Spring 2012, which is in about a year. 

I have never performed extremely well in my engineering classes. They are a majority C's, with some B's, and one or two A's. Okay, just to put everything into perspective, I have a cumulative GPA of 2.7. Before you sigh and tell me that it's not bad, it's definitely not good either. The reason it is a big deal is because: 1) Scholarships are given here at 3.25 and above, which isn't(for many others) a hard GPA to achieve, 2) I have always been interested in studying abroad, but it requires a 3.0, 3) At resume clinics and workshops, I'm the kid that is told to leave my GPA out, or include ""Financing 100% of education"", and 4) Most employers won't even give you a chance at an interview without a 3.0. This makes me feel like shit. I'm embarrassed and I hate feeling like my best only amounts to mediocrity. Like I'm mentally incapable of handling this material. 

Everyone keeps telling me GPA doesn't matter as much as on-job experience, but I have been getting denied at every single internship I have currently applied to. Many internship postings also require a 3.0 GPA or higher, so my options are constantly limited. In addition, I don't have the money for out of state internships unless they offer relocation and housing assistance, further limiting my options.

Somewhere transitioning from high school to college, I guess I lost my motivation to learn. As much as the topics I'm learning right now are unique and interesting, my only motivation to learn the material is due to the deadlines for homeworks and exams. I don't enjoy learning this material, I only learn it so that I can graduate and get the fuck out of undergraduate school. 

I know that I haven't been working as hard as I could or should be. I know what I am supposed to do, but I just have no motivation to act upon them. It seems like my only motivation at this point is just my fear of failing and letting my parents down. I know my parents will get over it, blahblah, but they gave me the opportunity to pursue my education. I feel like this is something I have to do at this point. It's just stressful when considering the amount of money I might waste just because I did not try hard enough in school. **How am I supposed to study and focus on material that I don't enjoy?** My mentality at this point is, ""I just want to pass these classes."" Of course I always try my best, but the ultimate goal is just to get through the semester without having to retake any courses. So far, I have. . . luckily.

My studying habits are a mess too. My sleeping habits are terrible. I basically live a graveyard shift. I sleep right after class for about 3-4 hours, then I get up around 10-11pm and do the work that is due the next day. I admit, I procrastinate heavily. I don't want to deal with the work until it is necessary. On Mondays and Wednesdays, I have an 8am, and so I usually just stay awake until then. This cycle keeps repeating day after day. I have tried to break it, but even when I do stay awake during the day, I have no motivation to start my work. I guess I'm just terribly lazy when it comes to school.

In terms of examination preparation, I cram study 1-2 nights prior to the exam. I always tell myself that I would start early, work little by little, but it never goes as planned. I've just been so used to pulling 1 or 2 allnighters prior to an exam that it's just been the routine system of studying for me. Also, although I am a sociable person, when it comes to classes and studying, I try to do everything on my own. I know this is a terrible mindset and that my peers would help me out, but I feel the need to be capable and responsible of handling all of this on my own. Obviously at this point it seems like I can't, but I could never study with other students. 

 In the past, my study schedule worked enough. . . I guess. But this semester is by far the hardest one for me. I'm terrified that I'm about to fail 3/5 classes, my engineering courses. It's funny that my other classes, like technical writing, come so easily compared to my major courses. I honestly feel like the idiot of the class. My first exam in my circuits(Ugh) class went terribly. The week following the exam my teacher displayed a grade distribution for the entire course. 88 students. Far left of graph, 30/100, # of students: 1. The next student was at least in the 50s and there were many kids in the upper 80s-100s. I was the worst student in that class after the first exam. I mean, I didn't understand all the material, but I did feel like I could've at least performed at the average grade.

With that said, I'm wondering if you all have **any tips for me when it comes to studying, particularly engineering or computational materials.** The classes I'm taking right now are circuits, materials intro, and fluid mechanics. **If anyone has any good resources available that could assist me, please let me know.** I just recently discovered /r/engineering and found a really good website I wish I found a long time ago. 

Also, **when you study (this is directed more towards computational classes, not memorization and facts) how do you study? Do you even bother reading the book and taking notes? Do you just take notes off the lecture slides? Or do you mostly just solve practice problems? What is the best approach to preparing for an engineering class examination?** Of course I know this all depends on the type of teacher, the quality of the book, and all, but do you think there's one thing that's most important to focus on? Such as either understanding concepts vs. understanding how to actually solve problems.

Goodness, this is very lengthy. I apologize. I'm just looking for some feedback. . . maybe some reassurance if applicable? Haha. . . I'll just list off some of the questions I have for you guys.

**Anyone with a similar experience, how did you deal with it? Did you switch majors? Or did you persevere?**

**Is it best to stay in my major at this point (considering money, happiness, security, etc.) with one year left to go?**

I do have a backup plan to pursue a masters in business/management if my experiences with mechanical engineering remain the same after some actual work.

**Any test-taking skills or tips?**

I am terrible at taking tests. I actually feel decently prepared coming into exams, but once I see the test, I sorta get a test anxiety. My mind races and I can't concentrate because I'm afraid I'm gonna run out of time. So I start one thing, get stuck and freak out, and just skip to another one.

**Anyone with other experiences/insight/realizations, I would enjoy hearing them**

**What would be your first step in my position?**

Again, I apologize for the length. If you read the entire thing, I greatly appreciate it. I'm pretty sure I'm leaving out many questions, but I'll ask them as I remember them. I haven't slept since Tuesday night. . . so please excuse any errors in my writing. I just wanted to submit this before I backed out again. I think I'll take a nap now. 

Thanks again. 

**tl;dr I'm unmotivated, disinterested and failing my major required courses. I'm terrible at taking tests and I have bad studying habits. I'm scared that my future will either be unhappy or unstable. Just want any feedback.**

I was heavy my whole life, I ended up going to independent study my last 2 years of high school because of it. I started staying home all the time, on WoW or reddit, living off mass amounts of poptarts. At 20 years old I was 215-220 pounds, I used to just stare in the mirror and glare at my body, like it was its own fault for being so fat.

My boyfriend went away for an internship for 3 months, and I decided that I would take the time and throw myself into my weight loss. After 3 months I had lost about 30 pounds, and I just kept going. I'll be 21 in less the 2 weeks, and I weigh in at 135.

I just want to thank you internet. I have almost no friends(still working on that.. weight loss doesn't cure awkwardness unfortunately), so /fit (on 4chan) and reddit have been my main support sources. So, thank you all for inspiring me on days I didn't want to ride my stupid stationary bike to exercise. Thank you for motivating me to keep going after I binged and ate that whole large pizza. Thank you for sharing all of your inspiring stories that helped me see that you can change yourself for the better, even if it seems impossible.

Pleasure to meet you all and here we go. 

I've been out of college for about a year and a half and I'm having no luck with the real world. I have applied for many jobs but I haven't even been able to get an interview. 

The core of my issues revolve around my lack experience. I graduated with a good GPA and even completed my undergrad in 3.5 years. Unfortunately, I didn't plan too well for post college life.  
 I took up as a temporary job when I graduated, but  I've been there for so long that I'm now managing the place. While the pay is good enough to support me, the job ultimately drives me crazy. 

I've volunteered at a non-profit historical site to gain some relevant history focused professional experience. Yet, after 4 months at the internship, I realized that any future in this job would require grad school and the market for related jobs were slim to none. 

At this juncture, I tink I have to re-evaluate my career choices, yet I am lacking in experience or direction!

I've been considering teaching abroad just for a change of pace.

If there are any post grad history or liberal arts majors who have shared a smilar experience please tell me about it! I want to move my life forward and I need some sort of outlet!

My ex and i are both 19, we broke up three weeks ago.
We were together for 9 months, and it was amazing. We have the same sense of humor, interests, and we were crazy about eachother. 


Things ended when I realized we both wanted different things out of life, I know that doesn't seem like something to break up over if we are both only 19, but like I said, we were both crazy about eachother and knew we would be together for a very long time. We have different spiritual beliefs, so we worked out every issue we might have because of that before we even started dating, all of our bases were covered. Because of this, we had 0 fights. 


I know that the breakup was for the best. he doesn't want to get married to anyone until he's 35 (the end of his education and internship), and I want to have kids before I'm 30. Like I said, we wanted different things. 


This is my first real heartbreak, I've dated guys and gone through breakups before, but nothing like this. I'm in agony, I even tried to get him to go out with me again the next day, which I understand was very cruel of me.


I've done a lot to help me through this heartbreak. I've started working out more, focused harder in school, taken up hobbies, and even do things like write down how I feel whenever I'm upset to get though this as healthily as possible. I deleted his number off of my phone, but I still have his facebook. Even so, there are days where I can't pick myself off the floor, can't focus, and can't stop bawling my eyes out, hanging onto the hope that maybe he'll call me, and change his mind. 

The problem is, I have all the tools that I seemingly need to get over him, but Im not. Its been three weeks. 
The breakup makes sense, I get that, but I just don't want to be with anyone else, I cant even think of another guy. 
I could really use some advice on how to get through this, I must be missing something. "

My boss really liked me and kept me on over this past school year (I graduate with a degree in Mech Eng in a few weeks). Over that time there was an employee, lets say Tom, who I got along with really well, and liked a a lot. But my boss was always on him about various job performance issues. Some might have been legit, but some seemed ticky tacky, and it almost seemed like my boss was trying to drive him out. Anyways, things finally came to a head, and Tom ended up leaving the company, and filing for unemployment. My boss apparently has decided to fight. This morning I was copied on an email from Tom saying ""You WILL be contacted by OSHA and DOL on claims against the company."" and ""I'm positive after talking with OSHA today about my claim that [Company] will be shut down and [Other company in the same building owned by the landlord] will also be effected.""  Tom had indicated he liked me, and wouldn't do anything to screw me over, but then he goes and does this. 
  
Now I know there were some things we do/did that aren't ""OSHA standards"" but then who does follow all of OSHA's rules. I may be wrong, but I can't think of anything that we've done that would warrant any more than a slap on the wrist, and certainly not ""shut down.""

I'm majoring in Computer Science and am at the point where I need to choose between a BA or BS in Computer Science. I'm comparing and contrasting the two and I am in a quandary. For one, the BS will require a considerable amount more math than the BA degree. I am not very good at math. I struggle through it, and I feel like I may fail some of the math classes that are required in the BS degree plan. (I have a very high GPA and don't want to wreck it with these math classes). But will I have more chances of landing a higher paying job with a BS degree? 

I am going to do an internship at a company called Raytheon this summer, where I will be working on programs for  infra-red systems. If the internship goes well, do you think later on, if I go for the BA degree, that they would still be interested i me? 

My main concern is that I don't want to ""settle"" for a BA degree, if a BS is better, and will get me further. But I also don't want to waste time, and effort on the BS degree if I can do just as much with a BA degree. 

With a BA degree, I will be done with school in ~2 semesters, compared to ~5 semesters with the BS degree. Should this be a factor to consider?

I just feel so reserved I hate putting my self out there. In high school I was always a C or D student I would always just put in just enough effort to get by. I probably wouldn't even be in college if I didn't have a wife that I felt I need to make something of my self for. I feel like I'm so worthless compared to her she works 60 hours a week and is going to school for her masters in biology. She was second in her class in high school. Just really someone who works very hard. Now I'm in college going for Computer Science because I feel like I need to get through a difficult degree to make my self feel like I'm worth something. I'm getting a 2.9 GPA which feels like a huge accomplishment to me. Yet I'm still not doing well enough I should really be above 3.0 GPA to get into any internships and I really feel like this semester of school is not going to help my GPA which is just really bothering me because I want to do well for my wife. I've really been struggling with trying to feel like I'm worth anything. 

My dad died in a car accident in 2004. I struggled with that for a year really not being productive at all. Just trying to get out the depressed rut I was in. After that year my family ends up getting a settlement out of the trucking company of the truck that hit my dad. So I end up getting $300,000. I at 20 years old have $300,000 in my bank account. I really should have handed it over to someone else to take care of for me but no I end up just keeping it cause I am an idiot. Well I end up blowing all the money and loaned my mother (who has less money management skills then I do) $30,000 which was supposed to be paid back to me last year. Nope she filled bankruptcy and I won't be seeing any of it. I know I should not really being looking at money as all my problems but I just keep thinking that way. I am not making any money for my family right now I'm just concentrating on school. While My wife works 2 jobs and is going to school for her masters in biology. I really should get my self at least a part time job but I just can't motivate my self to. 

I know I'm rambling and this article really is to long and probably doesn't make any sense on what my problem really is to sum it up is that I feel like I'm worthless."
gndal,5,2011-04-11,Dimming infrared halogen lamps,MrMountains,AskElectronics,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectronics/comments/gndal/dimming_infrared_halogen_lamps/,"Hello AskElectronics,
I’m a student in an internship. My assignment is to design some extra implementations for an infrared-cabin control panel. One of these implementations is to be able to dim [Dr. Fisher Vitae halogen lamps]( http://www.dr-fischer-gmbh.de/index.php?lang=en&amp;Bereich=8&amp;DBereich=8). The lamps will have a total power of 1200W. This has to be done by pushing on a button on a control panel, so I was thinking of writing a piece of code (which has to be in assembler) to change the duty cycle of a signal and using that signal at the gate of a TRIAC. I was thinking of using [this TRIAC]( http://www.st.com/stonline/products/literature/ds/2936.pdf).
My questions to you now are:

*Is what I’m trying to do possible?

*Can I directly connect this signal to the gate?

*Have I chosen the right TRIAC for the job?

*I’ve read about buzzing of the wire and how it will disrupt radio receivers. How can I avoid this?

I will try and keep an eye on this topic but I’m from Europe and the time difference could be bothersome when trying to give quick responses.

Bob is very humble, kind, and not flirtatious at all. He was genuinely a super nice guy. We hit it off immediately in a very platonic way as we played games together and even shared food. He laughed at the stupid things I would say and we'd even make fun of his friend (in a playful way). Bob's 24M and I'm 18F(both him and his friend agreed I did not seem 18 at all). I was going to ask for some contact info once we got off the plane since we live in different states but we ended up getting separated and I had to catch my next flight.

I know exactly where he works and this summer I have an internship in the same city (The place I'm going to stay at is on the same ave as him interestingly enough). He's such a great guy and I find myself constantly thinking about him! Would it be weird/creepy if I found his number through his work and called him? What would you guys think?

I asked my 23yr old friend and he said it would seem a bit creepy since I would have had to go a lot out of my way to search for his number.. Your guys input?

EDIT: I think ultimately I will try to contact him (he works for a company with more than 100k employees.. I know which office he's at so hopefully it won't require too much work). As you all were saying, I really have nothing to lose! It's a bit nerve racking and if he does end up having a girlfriend, as Stalked_Like_Corn said, I should just play it cool... try hard not to come off as creepy. And if he IS creeped out, I don't have to see him again.

I've been looking for summer internships, and I've had a couple interviews, haven't been turned down yet, but still waiting on responses.  I guess my paranoia is that I end up not getting an internship, working yet another crappy restaurant job, and going into the job market with a low GPA and no real reason for anyone to hire me. I've been told by my dad that his company, when hiring engineers, will throw out resumes if the applicant is under a 3.3, but one of my friends in CS just got an entry-level job with no GPA questions asked.

gpbrx,129,2011-04-13,[FR] A girl at work gave IOIs... I capitalized like a boss (+ deep details &amp; lessons!),acartoontiger,seduction,https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/gpbrx/fr_a_girl_at_work_gave_iois_i_capitalized_like_a/,"Hey everyone, so this happened in the summer before I found Seddit but I just remembered and thought that it would make a good at-work FR.

**Background**
I'm 21, recent college grad.  One of my jobs is an intern post at a small animal park.  I am a physiologist/pre-vet.  I go in once a week to feed animals, do maintenance, pat tigers (yeah, pat tigers.  We have a liger too, she is nice).

**HB7 19years Brunette**
A few days in I notice that HB7 who also interns is giving me *the look*.  You know that look.  Its the *I want you to look back and smile* look.  I do look back and smile.  I see a look in her eyes that is **very** revealing about what she is thinking.  At this moment I have an epiphany... **Girls that are younger than me eat up my minute gaming points like candy**.  At this point we have not yet spoken, so I decide to remedy that and I walk up to her and her friend HB6.  

* Me:  ""So do you give that sexy look to all the new guys or can you just tell that I am one of the good ones?""
* Her: *Obviously surprised that I would say something like that, giggles and smiles*
* Me: ""I'm Felix, whats your name?""
* Her: ""I'm HB7 and this is HB6, do you work here too?""
* Me: ""Yes I come in to play with the animals and charm the employees when I'm not away at school...  Oh wait, I shouldn't be flirting with you, you could be the boss' daughter or something.  I'm so embarrassed"" (smiling)

This exchange results in us chatting for a while and her asking me about myself which I knock out of the park.  She wants to be a vet too but she is a few years behind me in the process and is very impressed by where I go to school.  I am polite to HB6 but eventually I want her gone so I suggest that we go get fruit from the kitchen and hand feed the monkeys.  HB7 says yes enthusiastically and HB6 evaporates (victory).  

**Isolation Lesson:** Acknowledge the fact that you and HB*target* are flirting verbally in front of the obstacle and then find a reason to change locations.  If HB*obstacle* is a good friend she will see that her friend is having fun and make herself scarce.  It worked.

Anyway we feed monkeys and flirt for a while, her buying temperature is extreme.  It sounds cocky, but at this point I could just tell that I had it in the bag and she was hooked (60minutes).  Since we are at work I find it difficult to take her into a closet and fuck her, so I settle for giving her my number and telling her that we will meet up in a day or two outside work.  She runs her hands up my shirt before I leave to go back to my part of Tahoe.  I feel like I left her wanting more (I was right).

She texts me that night like, 6 hours after I left work.  We send a few sex heavy texts back and forth, you get the idea. 

**Insert Tactical Maneuver**  
She eventually says that she wants to see me the next day and I say NO.  I could have just said yes and worked from there but I wanted to make her wait because I was enjoying having her on the hook.  I was also working the next day at my other job (vet practice).  We set a day to go swimming in the lake together.  We teased each other a bit about swimming skills so this was a natural activity.  I grew up in Tahoe, so I know several secluded spots to swim and lie on the rocks.  Perfect

We swim and flirt for a while and the day is beautiful so we lie on a towel on some comfortable rocks.  *She had a towel too but she laid on mine with me*.  This is the last straw, we are alone.  She is laying on her back with eyes closed (totally awake though).  I lean over, place a hand on her waist/stomach and use the other one to gently lift up her chin and kiss her.  **Guys, Do This!**  Its golden and it always gives them an extra boost of being turned on right before you kiss them.  I do it almost all the time, even in my LTR, she loves it.  Anyway, there is rarely any speaking after I make my first kiss and this was no exception.  F close, by the lake.  Very picturesque and she had no inhibitions, totally hot sex.

We swim again and have sex again about an hour later, it was awesome.  I liked this girl, and before we parted at the end of the day she said one of the nicest things to me I've ever been told.

*""You touch me like I'm so beautiful, I love it""*

It stuck with me, and it was a huge confidence boost for my future endeavors.  We have had several ""booty calls"" I guess I would call them since that day.

I know this FR is long and sounds kinda cocky but I don't care.  Shit happened just like this, blew my fucking mind.

**Lessons Learned/Reinforced**

* Flirt with your coworkers, good things happen
* Assume initial attraction, in this case it was totally true
* Friends of HB*target* will get out of your way if you make your intentions clear and they can see that their friend wants it
* Learn to read facial expressions and eye movements.  I can't stress this enough.  Just as it is important to be able to recognize the *save me!* eyes from across a bar, it is important to be able to recognize the *look at me and smile!* eyes everywhere.
* Take bitches swimming and lying in the sun, bitches love swimming and lying in the sun.
* Always go for the kiss if the situation is conducive to passionate sex, its worked out for me many times and its worked out for others many more times.
* Don't be afraid, sometimes they want you more than you want them.  They are just waiting for you to charm their pants off.  Do it!

I wish the best of luck to everyone here, and I really enjoy giving back to the community so I am happy to answer questions and talk game.

*Getting out in the field gets easier and more rewarding every time,*

gp64n,1,2011-04-13,Feel like things are getting worse again...,modestmoose5,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/gp64n/feel_like_things_are_getting_worse_again/,"I've had a fairly long history with depression (never diagnosed, never talked to any sort of professional to be honest). Growing up, my mother was pretty insane. She would flip a shit over really insignificant stuff, basically every memory of christmas or family vacation from my childhood is dominated by her having a crazy episode, many times in public. She was also extremely emotionally abusive and manipulative to my father, who was a complete doormat. I never really realized how bad it was until my early teens. Until I was 14, all I wanted to do was get good grades and make my parents proud. When my parents had a horribly messy divorce right before my freshman year of high school, I stopped caring about, well, just about anything. 

I stopped caring about my grades and started hanging out with a pretty bad crowd. This continued throughout most of high school. I was horribly awkward, never so much as kissed a girl throughout all of hs and kept the same few weird friends the whole time. I only managed to get into a decent college based on an athletic scholarship and good SAT scores.

My first year and a half of college was probably my lowest point. I didn't make any friends at all in school and found myself eventually driving home just about every weekend just to get away from it. I started getting heavily into drinking, weed, psychedelics, pain pills and thought about suicide a lot, as well as other ""existential crisis"" type shit. However, things did get a little better. I eventually started making friends and becoming more social. My senior year I even started dating a few girls and felt like I was really starting to leave my depression behind, but every time I would get dumped due to inexperience/latent depression and attachment issues I had that would eventually arise by me being clingy and dependent. I also had this impending sense that once college ended, I didn't know what I wanted to do with myself.

After college, I lived at home for about 6 months trying to get my shit together while doing some part time work. At this point I have a few really close friends that are actually not losers and that I really enjoy spending time with. However, they're all moving on with their lives and I know that I'm going to have to do the same.  I find an internship in a field I'm interested in in NYC and I just so happen to have a place I can stay for about a month to see if I can start a life for myself.

The first month is great, honestly one of the best times of my life. I immediately start hanging out with a couple people I knew back in high school and I'm doing really well at my internship. I meet a girl that I come to like a lot and we spend the first 4-5 weeks I'm up there sleeping with each other ~4 days a week. My boss at my internship is dropping really obvious hints that I'm going to get a job once my internship is over, and I start planning a life in NYC.

This is when shit starts going sour. Things between me and the girl get really intense for a couple weeks, I think we got too emotionally invested in each other too fast.  I can tell she's having second thoughts, and the more she pulls away, the more my insecurities start to show. This also happens to be at the same point my boss informs me I would not be getting the job. My best friend from home also abruptly stopped contacting me or responding to my calls.  Basically, the stars aligned and a lot of the shit I valued and took for granted in my life went to shit.

This all happened roughly a month ago.  In the ensuing 4 weeks or so, I decided to sublet a place for a couple months and try to find a new job.  I actually have a couple promising leads, but now I'm wondering if I even want to stay up here. I still hang out with those two other people a couple times a week, but the rest of the time I'm basically jobhunting for a few hours every day, then wallowing by myself. I've lost 15 pounds because I can't even make myself eat anymore. The girl I was seeing before hasn't explicitly ended things between us but we've hung out less and less in the last 4 weeks, and I haven't even seen her since two weeks ago saturday. We talked on the phone yesterday for about 5 minutes, and I was almost hoping she would just tell me it was over so I could stop thinking it was even a possibility anymore, but all she said was she's extremely busy with school and work for the next month, and that she'll let me know if we can ever hang out in the mean time.

Sorry for this extremely rambling post, I just don't know what I should even do at this point. I am so moody lately, sometimes I'll think everything's ok but that usually only lasts until I fall asleep.  Every morning I wake up I feel depressed.  I've started sleeping upwards of 10+ hours a night and my sleep is interrupted constantly by weird/scary dreams. I've started thinking about suicide again but honestly I don't think I'd ever have the balls to do it, death scares the shit out of me.  If anything I'll die stupidly getting wasted/taking drugs, which I've been more cavalier with lately as well. I just want to run away and start somewhere new where I don't know anyone, but that's basically what I just did 2 months ago and that didn't work out well at all, so now I have no idea what I should do. 

I really do want to get over my issues but I don't know where to begin. I've never been able to turn to my family for any kind of support other than financial (which I am very appreciative of, if it wasn't for that I don't know where I'd be). Every time I try to talk about my personal life they just change the subject, and that's the way it's always been. I don't think I can afford getting professional help, but honestly I've never even looked into it, I really regret not talking to my school counselors when I had the chance. I don't even know what motivated me to post this, I guess I just hope someone can tell me where to begin getting over this shit for good, because obviously the bootstraps method has done nothing but hide my issues until something shitty happens, then it seems to all come out at once.

What is considered a good starting salary for an entry level position in web development (I live in Cincinnati)?

For anyone who has been in the field for a while, what do you consider to be some of the pitfalls that you can run into? Is there anything specific that you get burnout on doing?

What languages/technologies should I continue to learn in the future? I think html5 is going to huge, but it's going to be a while before it has enough browser support to see wide spread use.

suck it up or change it?",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/gpjbu/reddit_i_hate_my_lucrative_college_major_should_i/,"All right, let me break things down.

Current situation: Junior computer science major at Rice, aiming for a BSCS. So far, I have no student debt thanks to living off campus and being a minority in an engineering field.

However, I'm pretty sure this isn't what I want to do for the rest of my life. I got into it because I was good at writing nifty little Java  programs in high school, I was *excellent* at Calculus, and, of course, the technology industry is booming right now and my parents wanted me to get into something with earning potential. 

But the farther into the curriculum I go, the more I realize that I hate analyzing systems, especially the guts of things like logic circuits or large-scale applications. I can't get interested in the work, and more and more often the assignments are just confusing me. I've failed enough classes that I'd definitely need a fifth year just to satisfy my degree requirements, which would likely mean I'd get financial aid cut off. My GPA is sitting below 2.0, I've made no connections in the department (or to anyone on campus, for that matter), and because of this, I couldn't get an internship if I tried.

So my question, Reddit, is, I've already registered for my Fall semester of senior year, and instead of excitement, all I feel is dread. I don't know what field I'd like to get into yet, but I know it isn't this, and chances are, it won't make as much money as a programming job. I don't want to let down my parents, and I definitely don't want to force them to pay for two or three extra years at such an expensive place. Should I suck it up and slog through the rest of my CS degree, or should I take the hit and try to head in a different direction?

In the building I work, the elevator doors are reflective. A month or so ago I got on the elevator and there was a cute intern in the back. As the doors close, I see a reflection of her looking me up and down.

""It's easier to ask for my name"" I said before I could stop myself. She turns bright red and stares at the floor the rest of the elevator ride. ""Too bad"" I say as I get off at my stop.

A week or so later I see her across the hall and she doesn't break eye contact with me, even though she's engaged in a conversation right next to her. I casually walk over, hand her my business card, smile, and keep going.

At this point, I feel like a BOSS, but acknowledge that from her perspective I'm either A-) Suave, or B-) Creepy as fuck. 

I see elevator girl yesterday and she smiles, waves, and yells ""hi {Verbicide}"". This is not the conclusion of the story....I will nail that intern. But for now, I think I'm clear of the ""creepy"" side.

I found an internship that became a full-time job at a small software company, but they had to let me go a few months ago. 

While I was with them, I interviewed for another position. I didn't write down my GPA on the resume. The position didn't work out, but this company called me again for a new position, and after a few interviews offered me the job. 

I never mentioned and they never brought up my GPA, but the thing is I can't remember if they asked me about it in the first interview way back when. If they did, I might have lied about it (stupid, I know).

So the person that hired me asked me to call HR. I did and she said when the orientation was, asked me to bring proof of eligibility and told me to take a Tuberculosis test as soon as possible (this is at a hospital). I kind of asked ""is there anything else, like a background check or drug test"" and she said ""Nope""., but I'm still worried about it.

So the question is:

1) Would the HR tell me if there was a background check, especially if they told me all the other stuff?
2) If they do a background check, would they check GPA, and would this be shown to anyone if there is no inconsistency with my resume (since it doesn't have my GPA on it)

gr9b6,19,2011-04-16,Busted - Epilogue,cuffd,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/gr9b6/busted_epilogue/,"Ents, I give you now the follow up to my post from some quarter-year ago, [Busted - Moving Forward](http://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/eot6w/busted_moving_forward/)

**Previously on ""Busted""**

Mid-December of 2010, Cuffd was cuffed in his own home, being triumphantly eyed by two officers of the law.  Their modest triumph amounted to just under 1/4 oz., two grinders, a pipe, and a MFLB.  The charge was possession, with another three counts of paraphernalia.  Up to $2,500 in fines and/or a year in jail.

I didn't know if I'd go with the public defender or go in alone.  /r/trees tells me to explore a NORML-affiliated attorney, I do.  My future seems to be slipping away.  My job and life are at risk.

**Desperation**

I settled on the counsel of a criminal defense attorney.  Somewhat high-profile, well connected, and well established.  I had to do the best I could.  His retainer was $2,000.  I figured I'd still end this cheap.

He knows about my prior incident, some two years back.  He's ready to fight in court, that the search was illegal.  But he talks to the state's attorney and he gets me a deal.

**Humility**

My court date is postponed, pending my enrollment in a government-chartered voluntary program.  I'm assigned a caseworker who comments on my maturity, I'm a little bashful.  I have work to deal with, as well as school and a new internship.  I made sure he knew I didn't intend to be slowed down.

The program entails two months of weekly drug testing, a class (originally four classes, but bumped down thanks to my caseworker,) and twenty-four hours of community service with a DOC work crew.  I take my enrollment certificate to the judge at my next court date.  One year from then, so long as I complete the program, I can get the charge expunged.  My future aspirations are secure.

**Hitherto**

The community service is in eight-hour shifts, picking up trash on the side of the road.  The drug testing is straightforward, pissing in a cup.  The class is the usual ""drugs are bad"" routine.

I mold my job, school and internship around it, as much as it pains me to do so.  I have to keep up with all my obligations, no exceptions.

**Now**

Oh, now is the good part.  Sunday is my last day of community service.  Monday is my last drug test.  Monday I get my program certificate and I'm officially done.  I've kept clean and on the straight and narrow.

Ents, you shouldn't be the least bit surprised that anyone can remain capable, efficient, and effective across long periods of smoking and sobriety.  To the untrained eye, nothing has transpired, and that's just the way I'd have it.  My future is secure.

**The World of Tomorrow**

Monday is the 18th, and the end of drug testing.  It's the end of the scrutiny which would be any higher than on the average, law-abiding citizen.

Wednesday is the 20th.  It's 4/20.  I guess it all worked out alright.

I'm no stoner, as much as I love trees and as quickly as I'll once again enjoy them.  I'm a writer.  I can finally relax just a little and believe that I can pursue a career in writing and film.

We all have our dreams, and I'm fortunate enough to be able to chase after mine just a little longer.

I'll smoke one for all of you.  For everyone who has never had to get caught, and can smoke in peace.  For everyone who's been in my place.  For everyone who's seen their life needlessly ruined by these draconian drug laws.  So far as I'm concerned, we're all in it together.

**TL;DR - ** Everything went better than expected."

But I would still like to state the current assistance that I would be needing as it could pave way to my childhood dream of playing cricket (sport) for my country India. 
I am an international student(from India) currently studying computer engineering in a Canadian University. Since the age of 4(when I was introduced to the sport) I wanted to play for India, but my parents wanted me to get an engineering degree first from a reputed university and hence sent me to Waterloo to earn an engineering degree. As I am an international student, the tuition for me is very high (around 13k for 1 term) and therefore most of the money that i had earned in my internship went towards paying my tuition and the rent for next term. Since summer is the only season in Canada to play cricket, I was picked up to play in the southern ontario cricket league by a club, but they require me to pay then $150 as the season player fee. I am not being able to accumulate that much money out of my account for the next term as, if I do that, then I will not have sufficient funds to keep me alive (food) for the next term.
Earlier I decided to not play the league and just train but doing the drills on my own, but then I have not been able to be at peace with this decision and always feel a kind of restlessness that asks me to go for this opportunity as it will keep me alive with the sport and when I return after my graduation to India, I will have good experience from the league.
I am not sure if this is a cause to ask for monetary help, but I think I should at least try and ask for help.I am trying my best to keep alive in the sport and hence would like some assistance in this regard.

I'm a sophomore mechanical/aerospace engineering major with a good GPA and am involved on campus. I really would like an internship in this engineering discipline but almost any engineering internship would be great experience!

I'm also looking for a summer job if I cant land an internship. I can start ASAP so I can save up to pay for rent next year. I can do a lot of different things on the computer and with my hands but I would have to evaluate every job individually.

I'm really a hard working kid and will show up to work on time everyday! I don't like to burn my bridges so know you I'll work my hardest on everything!

Please if any redditors out there could help me out I would GREATLY appreciate it!! love you guys :)"

Specifically I am looking for a summer position with any amount of hours. A part time position under 20 hours a week for next year would be a bonus. If I have to drive from Akron the position will need to be paid. If I can walk from campus I will consider an unpaid internship if it is a quality entry on my resume.

I started my career in desktop support and have had one position as a IT Administrator for a small 100 employee company. I have experience with all sorts of desktop support, both hands on and phone support. I did this for approximately 5 years before choosing to go back to school to learn Cisco equipment and get my Bachelors degree.

I have excellent customer service skills. I am in my 2nd year of school at the University of Akron. My graduation date is approximately 2013. I am finishing up all the classes required to take the ICND 1 exam this year which is the first of two exams for the CCNA certification. I plan to take the ICND 1 exam this summer. I already posses the Comptia A+ certification.

My resume will be submitted upon request. Feel free pm me or email me at rjg33 [at] zips [dot] uakron [dot] edu."

so he started off with the typical question of where do i see myself in 10 years I responded

""I have always been the kid who wanted to start a business as soon as possible, for instance if I had 50,000 dollars I would start various business ventures in the Baltics and Balkans, however in a more realistic perspective 
I see myself working at a company quite like this one and after about 5 years creating my own business and overwhelming the competition."" 
He immediately responded (as if slightly impressed) ""Good Answer""

He then said something that surprised me (after short discussion about my language skills and a little chit chat) He said ""ok well lets skip the bullshit questions, if you had to be the project manager for say, creating a IT room at your school, what would be your process of setting up the project?"" 

After he had to re-ask the question twice (because it wasnt clear how he meant) I said first Analysis (discussed how important it was for a manager to do this properly), then Budget, Then Personnel, figuring out what your boss wants, then testing and delivery. 

I know i was rambling a bit and even said ""ill go through it in a listed order, while i know im being a bit redundant about some of these things"" 
There was another part that caught my ears 

1. He told me he was in AISEC, and i said oh really I am too, he retorted in a happy sounding way ""thats why I have your CV!"" 2.He discussed a lot of specifics with me, 

2. the length i was available. I told him I was only good for 3 months which he responded with ""Ideally I would want YOU (he didnt say SOMEONE) for 5 or 6 months but I can settle with 3"" 

3. He told me I would be paid, but HR was going to tell me about that because it was ""confidential and he doesnt even know"" 

4. *At the end of the interview i asked ""are there any shortcomings you noticed on my resume or anything else I can explain more?"" He instantly said ""No but ill tell you this, you did well and you are definitely on my shortlist, give me a week and ill get back to you because I still have 12 people to interview"" 


5.**He started throwing out extreme specifics. ""I might need you to go to Geneva for another interview, then talk to a guy in NYC and another in Mumbai (with little explanation about either)

I sent this email after the interview, was it too much?

Rent is 500/mo, with utilities/internet/cable/garage parking **included** Let me cut to the chase and give you the specs:

* [Tower at Third](http://tower3rd.com/) is the building, on 302 E. John. It used to be a [HILTON](http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/aceandvis/paris-hilton-001.jpg), so you know you'll be living in style. If you go to U of I, I know you don't need to be sold on the amenities of this building, because they are notoriously good. 

* You'll join the mile-high club on the [nineteenth floor](http://i.imgur.com/VFqYZ.jpg), with a southward-facing view of all Champaign-Urbana

* You'll be in the deluxe apartment, which was just renovated last summer. This means a new [flat-screen TV](http://i.imgur.com/AR7Ql.jpg) mounted on your wall, for your viewing pleasure

* Your summer pad has [a new kitchen](http://i.imgur.com/oDMR7.jpg) so you can get your Rachel Ray on, 24 hours a day

* You've also got a [brand new bathroom](http://i.imgur.com/GAN7M.jpg), so you can get all fresh and clean in style. Also, you'll probably be like the sixth or seventh person ever to take a dump in there.

* The [bedrooms](http://i.imgur.com/Z70nO.jpg) are spacious, with a walk-in closet and newly replaced, cushy full mattresses. 

To reiterate, this is a brand new, laundry/utilities/cable/tv/internet included apartment with a commanding view of your beloved campus. There are 2 workout facilities in the building and an A/C unit that can keep your beer cold for you in the hottest days of summer. We have a lower price than every other offer on Craigslist within the building - *plus* parking is included in the price. One or two bedrooms available, contact here or at RandB1989@gmail.com

You're welcome, reddit. "

I live in Athens currently, but got an internship this summer with the Ohio EPA in downtown Columbus. I am now in search of a place to live this summer. I am looking for basically whatever is cheapest. 

3 girls I'm good friends with offered to let me sleep in their basement on Maynard for $250 a month including utilities, but 1) I don't really want to live with them, and 2) they already have 3 people in their tiny little 2 bedroom duplex, and I don't want to add to the claustrophobia. So basically, this describes what I don't want.

So I'm good to pay anything under $400 a month probably, but am really trying to get as close to $300 a month including utilities as I can. I will only be there June 13th through about 2 weeks before OSU starts classes again.

I am fine living with people I don't know. I get along with everyone I meet and am fine with most people's lifestyles. So ya. 

Anyone got a place in mind for me?"

gtzcs,4,2011-04-19,Why does it seem like restaurants are afraid of hiring me?,blackmagickchick,KitchenConfidential,https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/gtzcs/why_does_it_seem_like_restaurants_are_afraid_of/,"Back during my Sophomore year (Senior now) I worked at a restaurant, moved up from hostess, then busser, then server. I had to leave my job because my school requires a 6 month internship. Mine was across the country and with 50+ work weeks I couldn't transfer to a location there. So I'm trying to get back in the business (any of the three positions I've held are fine with me) but GM seem to be hesitant. I understand  some concerns (because I'm graduating in June they fear they'll train me only to be gone a few months but I plant to stay here in the city and stay with whatever job I have for awhile) but the biggest thing is that I haven't had an industry job in over a year. They question why I would come back (a love of food, great atmosphere/experience, and service) and think it kind of suspicious. They all seem to like me and think I'm very personable but that seems to stop them.

How do I get it across that I actually want to work in this industry still and that even thought I have ""little experience"" I'm very enthusiastic and hard worker without having to repeat it the millions of times I have in interviews?"
gtvao,2,2011-04-19,Need some advice,DepressedDontKnowWhy,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/gtvao/need_some_advice/,"I'm a 24 years old french guy that just got his first job in Paris (I will begin in may) and so will move here soon. This job is relatively well paid and is in the field I studied to work in (computing). So I think I'm supposed to be happy, right ? Problem is I'm not, and in fact I'm completely depressed since a few days, and unable to get over it. I lost a good part of my appetite, I want to cry many times a day or feel like I would like to broke everything near me and then for a few hours it gets better and then it gets worse again (I'm not even able to successfully fap...). I lost interest in everything and without my parents pressuring me to take this job I think maybe I would abandon it.

I'm confused about what exactly makes me sad as there is a lot of thoughts in my head. I think that's mostly fear of future and feelings about missed things I would not be able to do anymore and my generally uninteresting life.

I got treatment for depression a few years back, while I was in the process of choosing which studies I wanted to do. At the moment, the problem was pressure about the urging need to choose what to do with my life. I was anxious as I didn't really know and needed to choose quickly because school year was about to begin. I got something called Venlafaxine as treatment, which I kept for ~3 years, as hopefully It was supposed to also help overcome my shyness, until a few months ago when I decided to stop and decreased the dose from 2*75mg pills per day to currently only one 37.5mg pill every three days. Maybe this treatment was keeping me from depressing and I should not have stopped taking it, but I was never convinced of it's usefullness and anyway I don't think spending my entire life drugged is a solution.

I've always been shy and never really got a *real* friend, nor a girlfriend. Thereis a few people with whom I share interests which I shared some activities with in recent years, but I'm generally not the guy who is considered interesting. I'm not invited at parties or anything, and if I don't make efforts to talk to others, nobody will come talk to me. I I'm not here, it goes unnoticed.

I spent the last three years in some middle-sized french town (Caen) where I was going mostly fine, even if was alone almost every moment spent outside school, I still managed to make some friends or maybe they are just half-friends. Anyway, it improved slowly. I then did an internship for my last school year where I met some people with whom I was able to socialize and even began doing some sport whith them (something I avoided nearly my entire life).

I then graduated and spent a few months searching for work, going back to live with my parents (where I'm still currently until I move to Paris) as with studies ended I get no more aid to pay rent. As my parents really live in the middle of nowhere, I spent the last few months really alone, feeling generally bored, with no contacts with any people of my age outside a few Internet conversations. I thought being independent, finding a job and moving to a new place will improve that.

And now I know I'm going to Paris in two weeks with a job and... I've never felt that bad. I'm going to a place where I don't know anybody, I will not have free time anymore, I feel trapped as I'm almost obliged to take that job now.

I'm not sure anymore I want to work in IT. Well, I was never sure what to do with my life, but stopped thinking about it during my studies. The field now seems boring to me, and I'm thinking I should do something else, maybe artistic or whatever (if only I knew...). But it's too late.

I never really enjoyed my youth, I was just beginning to make friends at the end, and now it seems behind me, while I'm stuck with a boring job that will take all my time.

The few friends I had began to make during the last years, whith great difficulty, are lost and I will now be in this huge frightening town, with not even school to help me meet people of my age.

I know I'm probably exagerating, that things won't go that bad, but I feel lost and anxious and I'm unable to get over it. I feel like an asshole bragging about my life when some others have much more problems than me.

Anyway I feel trapped in my life, I don't control it and it seems it going in some direction which isn't what i wanted and I don't know hat to do.

I've probably forgot many things about my feelings and anyway I'm not sure how I feel myself, but this post is already too long.

(please forgive this long and somewhat unstructured post, my feelings on the subject are not very clear nor organised. please also forgive eventual english errors, I'm not a native english speaker)

gtkt9,14,2011-04-19,Internship dilemma...,tranzue,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/gtkt9/internship_dilemma/,"First time poster here.  

Anyway, I was hoping the more experienced could help out.  I recently got offered an internship at a pretty small company, about 35 employees.  I accepted when they called, as I need an internship this summer.  I was also offered to have a second interview with a place much bigger, with probably better pay.

Here is where the dilemma comes in at.  If I get offered the job with the bigger company, should I accept and just call the smaller company to tell them I can't do it?

EDIT: Thank you all for the responses, it seems that most people say keep the smaller one since I've accepted, and the rest saying take the bigger company.  My interview for the position at the bigger company is coming up, I will still go to it, as I feel like canceling the interview may burn a bridge in itself.  But, if they do offer me the internship, I believe I am going to just stick with the smaller company.

Again, thanks for all the replies! It is a tough situation, and I've seen more than one person be in the same exact position.

gtgx8,15,2011-04-19,Can we have a calm discussion about the psychological and physical effects of cannabis without resorting to exaggeration/hyperbole?,kwood09,trees,https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/gtgx8/can_we_have_a_calm_discussion_about_the/,"After the post warning about daily cannabis use yesterday, and now the parody post about television viewing today, I'm compelled to say this:

Cannabis is a wonderful drug. It can be used safely and responsibly. I don't do it very often these days because I'm very busy, but there was a time when I was a multiple-times-daily smoker, and I definitely think it's a do-able thing. But there are a couple of things to remember:

* As has already been pointed out multiple times, smoking anything will have deleterious effects on your respiratory and cardiovascular systems. Vaping, however, virtually eliminates this risk.

* Let's face it though: the physical side effects of cannabis use are not usually that serious. The real danger is the manner in which you consume it and the effect that has on your mental/social/emotional health.

Let's talk about that second part. In this sense, cannabis is like food. There is nothing physically or inherently dangerous about it. But, used in the wrong way and for the wrong reasons, it can be dangerous. It is certainly not physically addictive. But people can still develop a dependence on it.

I can say that I have been able to jump right in and out of multiple-times-daily smoking on at least three occasions in my life. For me personally, it has never been a problem. When it's been appropriate and desirable in my life, I've smoked like you wouldn't imagine. And when I lost my desire, or when other obligations got in the way, I was able simply to stop. No problems whatsoever.

But this is not the case for everyone. I know people who simply don't do shit because they smoke weed all day. Two guys I know at college got a combined GPA of 0.2 last semester at a $38,000/year college because they just get high and skip class. Now, these guys are also lazy by nature. I'm not *blaming* cannabis for their failure to go to class. I'm simply saying that it's a contributing factor. One of the guys was applying for an internship this summer that was going to be really lucrative. He had all his shit filled out and needed only to take the drug test. Two weeks into his weed break, though, he just said, ""Fuck it,"" and decided to get high. Called up the place the next day and said he found something else. Now he's going back to work at his job at a snow cone stand over the summer.

I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that, but I am saying that he would have had a nice internship if he didn't have the desire to smoke weed so bad. The point is, he couldn't control it. Again, I'm not *blaming* weed or anything like that. I'm simply saying that it's really naive of you guys to treat cannabis as if it's some sort of magical rainbow miracle drug of happiness. You know how when you get really high, you get fucked up? That should tell you that it's pretty serious business. 

I imagine that most of you guys who act like cannabis could not possibly have any ill effects are in one of two categories. (1) you might just be naive. OR (2) you might be like me: very lucky that smoking cannabis has never led to any problems for you.

A lot of us are lucky that we can smoke all the time, float in and out of the lifestyle, and manage all of our affairs without a problem. That's great, and I encourage people to do that if they can do it. But you can't forget that there *are* people taking cannabis inappropriately by using it to escape their emotions, using it as a sort of mental crutch to rationalize not doing anything with their life, or using it in some other way that is detrimental to their mental, emotional, or psychological health.

Listen guys, I fucking love to smoke weed. I encourage ya'll to smoke weed too, if that's what you're down with. But please, you could be sending really wrong signals to people who might not understand that cannabis, while mostly harmless, still is a drug. "

guuom,1,2011-04-20,"Dear Reddit, we need your wise advice about post-college job hunting:",[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/guuom/dear_reddit_we_need_your_wise_advice_about/,"Here's the dilemma.

My boyfriend is 4 months out of Engineering School (graduated Dec. 2010 with his Masters). He has been job hunting since mid-August/September of last year and has landed a handful of interviews. His primary interest is in working with a major defense contractor or government contracted position. He has had a formal interview with one major defense company, which we initially assumed would land him a job and were very surprised when he was not selected. Also (this will be somewhat relevant for my later questions), he is around $7k in debt with school loans presently.

Here's a little of his background before I continue:

He went to a public state University (city university, technically) that used to be one of the more well recognized engineering schools in the country but now ranks significantly lower on the list. He majored in Electrical and Computer Engineering and has specific interest in RF work. He maintained a 3.3 GPA in Graduate School, worked as the project manager of his Capstone design project (which is planned for distribution and was a major project originally started at Vanderbilt). He worked at a city Internet and Cable provider as customer support and interning/shadowing under the Senior Engineer of the office for nearly two years during his college career. He has been a strong support for many peers and individuals at his school program, providing tutoring and mentoring. Many of the positions he has interviewed for have been what he was explicitly trained for and specifically concentrated in college for, however he has not been selected for any of these positions in spite several promising interviews. 

With all of this being said, I have a few questions and would appreciate feedback from the general community on this issue.

First of all, how important would you say that having an education at a recognized school is when trying to be placed with a top defense contractor or specialized government job like he is trying to do? If it is incredibly important, I would like to know what your opinion is on this idea. Many have suggested to him that he should return to complete another degree at a University that has a more recognized name for the sake of having it on his resume. The suggestions have been anywhere from him going and trying to finish another degree and reapplying, to trying to land an internship (which requires you be in school to achieve) while he is pursuing another degree, or to work part time at school and try to continue to apply for positions while doing so. Any suggestions or thoughts on this? I know he is explicitly expressed his concern about becoming more in debt, but I am beginning to wonder if he needs to take the gamble in order to make a more formidable impression on employers that he really wants to work for. My thought is too, that a lot of these employers will pay him to go to school, so if he could land a job while still attending part time, they could pay the remainder of his tuition possibly. I understand this is still a risk, which is why I would like opinions.

What do you think is a suitable alternative? Another thought many have suggested is to get a smaller, more available position and then apply to one of these bigger companies at a later time. The thing that he has expressed as a concern with this however is that he does not want to get caught in a situation where he is stuck in a certain field he did not want to get into, and then find he can't get a job where he really wants to have one later on.

It has been made perfectly clear to everyone who has expressed concern about this that he really wants to work for a bigger defense company as I mentioned above. We are really trying to figure out how to make this possible. It's quickly coming up on 6 months without any sort of luck and no college to fall back on, and I am starting to worry for him and his future. I want him to be happy and successful and I would love any advice you have on this.

Thanks in advance."
gus9b,2,2011-04-20,I want to start a project as a substitute for a summer internship (undergrad CS student),dr_kludge,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/gus9b/i_want_to_start_a_project_as_a_substitute_for_a/,"I'm just wrapping up my first year as a community college CS student who will eventually transfer to a 4-year state university.  I've learned a lot!  I got a late start on school (I'm 22 now) and I had never written any code beyond TI-83 BASIC or HTML until about 10 months ago. 

At this moment I am comfortable starting projects in C, C++, C#, x86 assembly, arduino, and possibly objective-C.  I have not found an internship and due to summer school probably will not continue trying.  Instead I am thinking that I should come up with some sort of 3-month project which can fill the internship void in my resume and experience.  

The idea I came up with so far was to build a rudimentary game engine.  Something that could do sidescrolling platform type games, with some 2.5-D (parallax with background objects for example) elements.  I'd stick with image based sprites to keep most of the work code-related.  I feel like this would be enough work to take 3 months, would be advanced enough to look good later on, but isn't so far above my skill levels as to be unrealistic.  The end result would be both the engine, and a game that uses it. 

From both a programming perspective, and a future employer's perspective how does this all sound?  

I have an engineer friend who I discussed this with as well - he suggested coming up with a game for either iOS or android that utilizes openGL ES.  I'm not against this, but it seems more daunting to me than the idea outlined above.

I'm open to ideas about how to make my project idea better, or maybe a completely different kind of project.  Or maybe I've got this all wrong and should be doing something completely different?"
gunux,3,2011-04-20,"To People in Video Game Industry, what would you want to see as past experience on a new hire's resume?",zoofman,AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/gunux/to_people_in_video_game_industry_what_would_you/,"Hello reddit, this is a bit tldr, I apologize.

I'm a Junior in Computer Science at a fairly high ranked university, and to be perfectly honest, I've had absolutely no luck finding an internship in my past three years here.  This semester alone I've had 10 interviews, and many of them came down to ""it's either you or this other guy, and he's already got a security clearance,"" or ""we want to hire you, but without the defense budget being passed we can't afford an intern.""  Needless to say, I'm kind of depressed - employers always stress that experience is HUGE for them, and I am probably gonna be, at this point, a guy who went through 4 years of Computer Science and never secured an internship.

Now, I do have a saving grace in that all my professors are in the field I'm interested in, Media Computation and HCI, and do multimillion dollar research in it.  I can do research with them instead this summer if an internship doesn't come through, but I'm worried how potential employers would see this on a resume, and if they'd consider me doing research in virtual reality with one of my professors being inferior to an internship.

This came back to another thing though - I really am interested in game development, and I know it's a field that it's difficult to get internships in because of the nature of their development cycle (they bring you in, teach you stuff for 3 months about the project, then you gotta go before you can do anything.)  This is also kind of reflected in that all the companies that come to our school are, for the most part, government contractors (outside of Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Intel and a few others).  

This led me to wonder then, what exactly do companies look for in fresh graduate computer scientists who want to be game developers?  Would they want me to have an actual internship with a company like Booze Allen or something, or prefer to see that I pursued research in something related to HCI?  On one hand, I would have actual professional experience, on the other my research had more applicable results than ""I made email services.""  I'm honestly at a loss as to who to ask about this, because the types of employers who come to our school are so focused on a particular type of software development.

I'd also like to add that by the time I'm applying for full time positions, I will have taken our senior level game design course and computer graphics course, just can't get access to them till senior year due to the complexity.  

Thanks if anyone can help me or took the time required to read this.  "

In the past 3 weeks I've run into 5 or 6 of them. Being a young man, they seem to gravitate towards me. I try to assume the best of people and when they say ""I need money for the bus"" they mean it. However, each time I see them abusing handouts and simply unethical in their persuasiveness and speech. 

On Monday I was walking to my car downtown and for two blocks a man was following me screaming after me. I got to my car, turned around and realized he was trying to get my attention, and told him I had no cash. He insisted he didn't want cash, but instead a dart pass. I said ""Ok, I can help with that"" spent 10 minutes walking with him to the dart station nearby. During this time I thought ""If I get stabbed walking with this man, or he is about to jump me, I will have been injured doing a noble and stupid thing""

We walk up to the dart box and he says ""I really need a month one"" - I look at the screen and it was I *think* $65. I'm a broke college student working an internship and barely making ends meet. I proceeded with just buying a day pass for him for $4 and tell him I only work 20 hours a week and depend on my parents for my survival. He proceeds with looking at the ticket and saying he needed a month one.

I spent a few minutes talking with him hearing about him, where he's from, etc, then say goodbye. He then asks if I could bring him money on Wednesday. I asked him if he's looked up homeless shelters, food kitchens, etc. You know - places that us Dallas citizens pay for and that churches and non-profits pay for. His response was that they taste gross. I tell him that he needs to go to them and they're healthier than any fast food he'll eat.


So, Reddit, please restore my faith in people down on their luck.

I never hear back from companies, and if I do its either ""No thank you,"" or ""You're a good candidate...."" and nothing more. 

What's harder is that ALL of my friends have jobs lined up after college. I'm the last one in our group to get a job, and a lot of my friends are questioning why I can't get one. Yesterday a friend of mine went as far as to jokingly end a sentence with ""...that's probably why you can't get a job"".

Right now I'm thinking about moving to Canada or somewhere very far away and never coming back. At least then I can start over, maybe get a new degree. I don't know anymore.

* Number 1: You must have completed a four-year technical degree from a **real** university, i.e., a Bachelor of Science or Bachelor of Engineering. Chaos Mathematics, Quantum Physics, Computer Science, Software Engineering, Nuclear Engineering, they don't really care, as long as you have a **technical** degree, no Business, Management, Finance, etc., sorry. This is not my requirement, this is an HR requirement so don't hate on me.
* Number 2: You must have an interest in security systems engineering. This is not an anti-virus management role or a firewall management role or a network security role. You will need to be able to analyze security requirements, **develop plans** for meeting those requirements, and build documentation and use cases for implementing and testing those security requirements.
* Number 3: Ideally, you should have at least a couple of years of experience. I think they would be willing to entertain entry level, but you still have to meet 1 and 2. They'd be willing to invest time in mentoring and training, but you will have to be pretty outstanding in all other regards, and have at least a few internships under your belt.
* Number 4: You have to be legally authorized to work in the United States. We can't do any sponsorship for this role, sorry.

If you're interested, message me and I'll give you more details and point you to the formal application process."

gvndk,1,2011-04-23,Am I completely deluded or insane?,Sacoud,depression,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/gvndk/am_i_completely_deluded_or_insane/,"Apologies for the amount of text but I can't explain this without going into detail.

I feel like I'm losing my mind, I have many things going for me, money, a good family, a girlfriend, a summer internship. However I am incredibly lonely and wherever I go I feel completely unwanted. I used to have loads of friends when I was 16 but as we grew older many drifted away however I always thought I was being treated badly people would often call me an idiot (incuding teachers) and not in a joking way ( I am now though doing very well for myself), now I was obese as a young child and was bullied horrifically I'm talking getting punched , spat on , random people coming up to me and making fun of me. I lost the weight now but it still hurts.

So anyway I moved from my town and went to university about 20 miles away, most of my ""friends"" didn't go and stayed in my town. During my first year of university I made quite a few friends I played in a football team and was enjoying myself, I would go back to my town as much as possible to see everyone although I was working so it was hard to get back so I would invite my friends into where I lived to catch up.

During my 2nd year almost every friend I had made dropped out. At this point I was in uni 4 days a week, work experience on the 5th day and a part time job on weekends so getting back was very difficult and so I didn't see many people over this year. I tried to organise events as I wasn't getting invited anywhere but people just weren't interested.

Now.. I hear that my old best friend is moving to Australia and he says that we and everyone should go for a few drinks before he goes. Of course I'm more than happy to do this. So the day comes I tell everyone ""he's going we have to see him off"" I drag everyone out I get him a going away present... 9pm comes and he still isn't here, I ring his house and his Mum answers ""oh he's gone out with X"" 15 years of friendship.. he's moving away and he doesn't see his ""best mate"" before he goes.(we were best friends for about 10 years but sort of drifted apart recently) I was absolutely devastated. I sent him a message telling him how humiliated and sad I felt but I just cut him loose. 

 Another old friend I tried to organise a get together hadn't seen him in 8 months I get people out.. I get a text ""not coming hanging with my work friends"" , this wasn't the first time he had done this and I couldn't take being friends with him as it was making me miserable. I cut him off aswell.

I was getting incrediby lonely at this point and my other friends woudn't come to see me when I tried to organise events. I did however manage to start a 5 a side football team with them, I thought that maybe if we get that team spirit there would be team bonding and we'd all do things together but I couldn't be more wrong.

I organised an event, soccer saturday drinking game one week it was the day before and they all told me they cancelled to go paint balling with another friend so I thought I'd do it another week. So it's Saturday I'm excited, I get the girlfriend to go out for the day, I tidy the apartment, I go out and buy enough beer for everyone... no one shows up... I ask what's going on and well no one really has a reason as to why they've didn't come. At this point I said and I quote ""for fucks sake I turned down football tickets yesterday from my Dad because you guys said you were coming"". I didn't get a single apology and that night they all went out without me. To make it even worse one of them actually replied ""for fucks sake"" as a dig at me when the football centre made a mistake and our game was rearranged for a different time

With the 5 a side football there was no conversation with me and them, for 3 weeks in a row I would walk in and say hi and no one would say a thing.. not even a goodbye when I went. The only thing I would get out of them is ""how much is it then"". After the 3rd time I think I spent the whole of the next day crying and I told them over the internet that I was leaving the team to concentrate on my uni work.. but the truth was I was leaving because I was so depressed I couldn't take it any more.

I spent so much time alone.. a friend in uni asked if I wanted to play 5 a side football with them for a game.. so I did.. it was on the same night as my other ""friends"" they saw me.. first time I'd seen them in 3 months and one of them just gave a dig ""I thought you were too busy"".

I do wonder if I'm the problem or if it's them. But I really do think I'm fun to be around, I know I make people laugh.

A few weeks ago I went to a pub to see another old friendship group ( Like I said I had a huge amount of friends when I was 16) and it was one of the best nights of my life, when I got back home 3 people had their Facebook status with something like "" If you want to have fun when you get drunk *insert my name* is the man to go to"".

Another friend came back from the navy for the weekend, I organised a night out with the above friendship group.. most of them didn't turn up after saying they would... it sucked hard.. my navy friend did organise another night the next night but it was the people in my 5 a side team and other people who were less than nice to me in high school. I was going to come until I found out who was going I then text him saying ""nothing against you but after last nights no show I'm sorry but I can't be arsed"". I'm pretty sure he's pissed off at me. 

I don't think I'd ever do it but suicide comes into my head pretty much every other day.. I am so alone and I talk to almost no one apart from my girlfriend. I don't know if I'm deluded or not as I feel the bullying from my childhood may have affected my judgement.

Am I doomed?,sfkz_,gamedev,https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/gvm2o/rgamedev_im_a_cs_student_looking_to_get_into_the/,"Pretty much what the title says, I'm currently 2/3rds of my way to a Bachelor of Computer Science with the intention of working in the Games Industry as a programmer. My marks aren't that wonderful (I've had 3 failed courses so far, the first one was in my first semester due to totally underestimating the work load, and the other 2 were during the one semester where I suffered two family deaths during the semester which messed with me bigtime, as well as some passes/credits) so I'm starting to feel a bit dejected because I figure that 95% of people wanting my position will have better marks than me

I understand making demos would help boost my chances, but I'm not sure if (in the real world) a good demo outweighs marks (or, at least, balances them out), which is why I've been a bit hesitant. Along with this, I've been reading that internships would also help me greatly, but I'm feeling that, with my marks being not that great, it's pointless because I wouldn't get hired. I understand once I get in there (internship or a full time position) I will work like crazy because it is what I want to do; but I'm just worried that come 1-2 years when I'm done, I won't get anywhere because of a few slip-ups during uni.

I'm sorry if this sounds like a ""woe is me/fml/someone from reddit do something amazing"" post, I don't mean anything like it, I just figure that you guys/girls would have the best idea of what I am to expect in the next few years and would be able to give me some tips."

My questions are as follows:

1. Would I do better to consistently take challenging courses or take the easy road for a GPA boost?

2. How far out of my way should I go to try to get more legal internships?

3. What else can I do beyond GPA and LSAT to be more appealing/distinguish myself?

gw6dg,2,2011-04-24,Dear Reddit Austin: I'm a 17 year old teenager who is fluent in technology and needs a job. Help? (Resume inside),DesperateJobSeeker17,Austin,https://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/gw6dg/dear_reddit_austin_im_a_17_year_old_teenager_who/,"Reddit, I love you. I know you make wonderful things happen and I know that anything is possible with your help. 

Let me explain.

I am about as nerdy as you get without being “nerdy”. I spend my time using Linux, attempting to learn code, migrating to the cloud with my CR-48, editing band videos with Adobe Premiere, and Googling whatever I can't figure out on my own. I'm an Eagle Scout and an executive officer in my high school band. I don't play video games, I don't even own a major console. I lied. I do have a Wii – to which I spent more time installing homebrew on then actually using. I can install a motherboard blindfolded. I have a Power Mac G5 dissembled next to me. I have drawers and shelves full of random pieces of hardware. I am good at putting on a face and interacting with people. I understand hard work. And I need a job.

Ideally I need a job that has something to do with technology. But, alas, who wants to hire a dumb 17 year old? It's easy to look at me on paper and throw me away. I'm sorry that I don't have enough time to get A+ certified. AP classes take up most of my time and whatever money I have left is spent on phone bills, insurance, and gas.

I have applied to Best Buy, a local computer repair shop, and tech support positions. I have called them all back. And all of them have denied me. What did I do to deserve such treatment?

So, Reddit, I come to you in a last ditch attempt before I end up working for McDonalds. Does anyone know a way for me to get a job with technology or have good connections? I could even work as an intern. School is still going on and I wont be able to work full time until the summer, but that's not too far away. I live in Round Rock and would be willing to drive about 20 minutes for a decent paying position.

gw2sj,38,2011-04-23,The Little Girl,lunaris,nosleep,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/gw2sj/the_little_girl/,"One of my coworkers is full of supernatural stories and I thought I might share one that creeped me out. Let's call her Olivia.

Olivia was doing an internship one summer and living in an old apartment she had never been in before. The apartment was set up such that the living room was connected to the bedroom; while lying down in the bed, you could see into the doorway of the next room. Nothing really seemed out of the ordinary, except for when Olivia would constantly and uncharacteristically wake up in the middle of the night. 

One night when she awoke, she could make out the shape of a little girl standing in the threshold between the living room and the bedroom. Olivia told herself over and over again that it was just her imagination. Her glasses weren't on. She had vacuumed earlier. Where had she left it? It was the vaccuum's shadow, not a little girl. It just looked like a humanoid shape. Right? She pulled the covers over her head and turned over so as to not face that direction any more.

Except that it kept happening. Olivia continued to wake up in the middle of the night for seemingly no reason to find little girl standing there, staring directly at her. When Olivia turned the light on, she disappeared. To avoid her, Olivia would go into the living room and watch television until she fell asleep. It was all she could do to keep from being terrified in her own home.

Over the summer, her cousins came to visit her in the apartment. There was a night when she had to be out of town, but the cousins stayed. As she expected, they took her bed. 

When she returned, one of the cousins took her aside. ""Olivia, I need to tell you something. When we were sleeping, I kept waking up. At one point, I could have sworn there was a little girl standing in the doorway."" Olivia was quite taken aback. She hadn't said anything about the little girl to her cousins so they wouldn't be frightened. ""Maybe it was the vaccuum cleaner.""

""We vaccuumed earlier in the day. I left it on the other side of the room. There's no way.""

To extrapolate further: Olivia also told me once she had finished the story that, when she first moved into the apartment, the owner mentioned that a little girl had died there years ago. Another tenant overheard and dismissed the notion immediately. Interesting stuff."

gx1zq,1,2011-04-25,Need help figuring out where to go from here...,Which_Route,relationships,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/gx1zq/need_help_figuring_out_where_to_go_from_here/,"Ok, the numbers and such first:

This is a throwaway account.
I am 28, she is 25.
She has two children. A boy who is 3 and a girl who just turned 7.
  We have officially been together for 10 months but have ""talked"" and had an inappropriate relationship for about 4 years (she was married, husband was verbally, emotionally, and mentally abusive).  

The quandary:

So, we became close while she was still with her husband.  At first we were just friendly and became close enough that I became aware of the situation.  Husband had hit her before and constantly put her down. She was the bread winner while he sat at home and got high and ""watched the kids"".  Nothing was ever done when she got home so she worked 12 hour nursing shifts only to come home and have to do everything around the house.  Obviously she may have been best served to have left sooner, but I can't begin to understand how difficult that decision is.  Eventually we became much closer and an odd sort of ""relationship"" developed.  We convinced ourselves it wasn't a big deal because her relationship with her husband was dead and he was basically a shitty roommate.  Thinking error, I know.  So over that four years there were plenty of good times and bad times.  She was living a hellish life and I was the one she was most comfortable with so I got a lot of flack that wasn't really meant for me.  

August 1, 2010.  She left him. Great on so many levels.  Mostly just for her to begin her adult life again without that burden.  She absolutely adores her kids and bends over backwards to give them what she can afford.  So that's a positive for sure.  

Over the last 5 or so years I have been in regular bi-weekly treatment for extreme depression, some substance abuse (no longer happening), and other issues.  I've also participated in a weekly therapy group for about 4 of those years.  I am in a place now I never thought I would reach.  I am happy, proud, have a 3.94 GPA in college and have an amazing internship this summer.  I am living evidence that no matter how hopeless you feel and it all seems... you can get out of it and become happier and more successful.  I am driven.  I hit the ground running.  I am all about solutions, solutions, solutions.  Now, I was not like this even 2 years ago, but I finally go on the ball and now see how worth it it is to really push yourself to be productive and continue moving forward.  It's GREAT!!  There is a reason I say all this.

She is having a very hard time.  Since she left her husband she has still been extremely depressed.  She's even talked about cutting herself before.  She works the 7pm - 7am hospital shift and then comes home to sleep.  She never gets 8 hours.  6 hours is generally the best she will get.  The husband was part of the equation at first when it came to the kids. He would keep them nights when she worked but she still had to pick them up every day from school, losing sleep in the process.  Now she is working on the divorce and the attorney recommended that we cut off contact until after the divorce.  She said the judge needs to see, if even for 4 months, that she can handle the kids all on her own.  I hate not seeing/talking to her but am more than willing if it means that the kids will not have to be apart of the father's life.  I won't go into how terrible of a father he is, but he is.  She is having an even harder time with this.  She is still calling/texting me and I begin getting upset because I don't want there to be issues when it comes to the judge.  She has been very, very needy of me in general since she left her husband and I get annoyed easily.  I forget that it took me 5 years to get where I am and not am annoyed that she is not just instantly here with me.  Should I be concerned about how much she leans on me and needs me?  Calling me sometimes 8 or 9 times a day, even after I set a boundary of needing to focus on homework?  Being manipulative at times to just find ways to talk to or see me?  Not evil manipulative.. but asking if I can bring her a soda at her house or something at like 10pm when I'm studying for a test.  Or... should I realize that she left a horrible relationship not a year ago, after a crappy childhood, and is probably just in a bad place still?  She is going to therapy biweekly as well.  I just feel like I put up a boundary ""We cannot talk because your lawyer said so"" and she won't respect it. I tell her this and she says she understands and will stop but then calls me a couple days later.  Should I be patient? Annoyed? Concerned? What? I love her to death. I want to be with her and realize somethings take a long time to heal and work on... I just need to know which things I should be concerned about in the present, if any.  So sorry this was so long. Thanks for any help. Any questions are welcome if you need clarification or more info.

TL;DR: Woman was in abusive relationship, we saw each other before she left.  She has been very clingy, needy, depressed since Aug. 1, 2010, when she left.

First, how much weight should I put on the school's focus/specialization/research opportunities? How should the research that I do for my masters translate into what I do for my phd (if I were to continue my education)

Second, I'm interested in a few different things: Malware Analysis, Social Network Manipulation and Content Analysis, User Traceability, and Botnets. Is there anyone else out there who is interested in something similar and really likes the program/research group at their school?

Third (and I hope this doesn't annoy anyone): What tier of schools should I be applying to? The application process seems kind of expensive, and I want to be realistic. I've got a 3.6 GPA (3.8 major), have been involved in a research group related to my interests since sophomore year, have gotten 2 papers published (third author on one, and first author on another), and have held an internship with the DoD for the past 4 summers. Also, I received a sort of undergraduate of the year award for my major. However, this is all at a 50ish ranked state school.

Finally, what can I do to maximize my chances of acceptance? My contributions to open source projects have been fairly weak. Should I attempt to contribute more in the weeks/months before I apply?

AMA",sherlocktheholmes,IAmA,https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/gxvhs/by_request_iama_grad_student_studying_library/,"This AMA was prompted by [these](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/gwz0l/do_the_chinese_get_random_english_quotes_as/c1r0z0l?context=3) posts. People don't seems to realize that to be a librarian (in the US) one must get their Master's from an accredited Master of Library Science Program, so I thought it would be nice to do this AMA to tell people what I'm studying, what I will be doing in my career, and generally talk about what libraries are and what librarians do.

So, to give a bit of an overview: I am in my second semester in my program, which generally runs for two years. I am trying to graduate a semester early (in Dec 2011) by taking what is scientifically known as a 'crap ton' of summer classes.

My first semester I was enrolled in Reference, Collection Development and Management, and Computer-Based Information Tools. Reference was an intro to being a Reference Librarian (shocker). Basically, we learned about various credible resources for finding out information and how best to conduct an interview with a person needing information. (That is, how to find out what a person needs to know in spite of how badly they phrase their request.)

Collection Development and Management was really interesting. As the name implies, we learned what a librarian must do to acquire and maintain a good collection. This involves: 1) Knowing the community and their wants and needs, 2) Assessing how the current collection meets those wants and needs, 3) Determining which materials should be purchased to improve the collection's quality, and 4) Removing them materials which are not an asset. This task is on-going; no collection is ever 'complete'. It is a constant job that requires a vast knowledge of popular and technical literature. For example, when Pluto was recategorized as not a planet, I would have to know that that happened, find all the science books which call it a planet, remove them because they now contain outdated information, and replace the weeded books with new ones which are accurate.

Computer-Based Information Tools was a giant headache to me. We went over simple enough topics like databases, search engines, Excel, etc, but we also did UNIX and HTML which were a challenge.

This semester I'm enrolled in Public Library Management, Cataloging, and International Information Issues. Public Library Management is pretty self-explanatory, we discuss what all must be done by a Library Manager in order to keep the library relevant and well funded. We talk about budgets and funding, issues with patrons (ie what to do when a homeless man bothers other people), privacy issues (fuck the Patriot Act), pornography, etc etc...

Catalogers are the ones who decide how a new material is sorted and labeled so that it can easily be found by anyone who wants to access it. It's a nightmare. My stress level goes through the roof when I do assignments for that class (as I ought to be doing now, final project due Thursday). There has to be a standard, of course, but how do you standardize and sort an author's imagination? or a book about the history of feminism as told by modern-day psychiatrists? It's a tedious process, let me tell you.

International Information Issues is a freakin blast. There are just 13 of us and the prof, so we just sit and chat for 2:45 each week about a variety of topics: international copyright laws, the popularity of smart phones in Sub-Saharan Africa, Wikileaks, the roll of the internet in Egypt's revolution, poverty and illiteracy... I could go on and on. It's always fascinating.

This summer, I'll be doing my internship at my hometown public library, as well as taking two workshops: learning to conserve books and to write grants.

So that's a basic overview of what I've learned and how it will be used in my career. AMA!

TL;DR: Librarians have a huge variety of skills to master in order to be good at their job.

I am a bit stuck, and dont know what to... Some good avice would be more than welcome. So I am really hoping that once again, you guys can deliver.

situation: i am(male) 25 in a couple of days. 
I've been a huge IT guy/nerd since i was twelve. Studied IT and got a bachelor. During my internship, they offered me the job of the previous it manager. Which i took. 

Its been a bit more than a year now, and... I am SO bored. The problem is, its a really good position (head of my departement, etc). THe company is groing (we opened a new sub company and may open a new one in a couple of months). Etc etc. The pay is good and blablabla

For most of my friends, its a dreamjob. And i agree with them. But when i say i am bored, i really mean I AM BORED. Its horible, every day i get up, and i am allready bored of the day thats about to come.

In the begining it was friging awsome, having to take care of a 50man network, the entire IT parc, some devloping projects, etc. But now its always the same... Its a routine...
Once i a while i get a real challenge, like bad computer crash, nasty virus etc... But thats like once every X months. Takes me a couple of hours max to fix, then i am bored again for the coming months.


I really dont know what to do. Should i leave this job? Should i leave IT? Should i stay and be bored for ever?


PS: for the haters, yes, i should stfu and be happy to have a job, etcc. but i am not the kind that settles just because ""it could be worse."" and YES, i am stil imature, thats why I am here.


tl;dr: i am really bored at my current pretty awsome job. what should i do?

I am not socially graceful around people I don't know really well and I am not good at sports or anything else. My mission in life is to be good at my work because that is the only thing that gives me any sort of worth.

This horrible feeling of mediocrity started when I got my SAT scores. I only got in the 80th percentile, so basically it was a miracle that my school even accepted me. Obviously I couldn't get into any of my dream schools.

Right now, I am a senior engineering student at a so-so university. My first year I did horribly - I got several F's and D's and had to drop a class. However, my second year onward I got my act together and did very well, only ever getting A's and B's and getting straight A's for 2 semesters. However, the first year still reflects on my GPA - so much that no good employer will consider me.

I keep seeing my friends around me get hired by Facebook, Microsoft, Google, TI, and other good companies. I know I will never get hired by good companies like those because my GPA is just so lackluster. I have no internship experience because every semester I was either working to get money or taking summer classes to advance my degree.

I had pushed it to the back of my mind until one of my friends heard back from Google. They asked him for his SAT score and a letter of recommendation so they could decide whether to interview him. He said maybe I should apply.

I just felt like bursting into tears - that fucking score taunted me for so long, and I thought I had left it behind me.

I remembered my dreams in high school - I thought I would do something really amazing with my life like make video games or help in feature animations.

I know this may not seem important but please consider that I have nothing else. I am not the favorite child. I have never had a girlfriend, and don't want to because I am not emotionally capable.

I'm not the smartest person in the world, but I'm not stupid either. I can use a computer like a boss, I'm articulate, well groomed and work well with others. I'm outgoing and make new friends with ease.

I've tried applying online at many different businesses, none of them have yielded a response except for a Toyota dealership which is too far away to get to (I don't have a car and it would be over an hour on BART). I have tried walking into businesses, but most of them tell me they aren't hiring or I'll fill out an application and get nowhere. I had an interview at a Starbucks in a nearby city, but when I called back, the manager had no idea who I was and I definitely didn't get the job.

I'm pretty good in Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, etc. and I have a couple of freelance web design jobs lined up, but the pay isn't consistent and isn't enough to be able to sustain myself. I'm still mostly relying on money from my parents, but it isn't enough. I'm 23 and have $5,000 in credit card debt, plus I've been late with my phone bill for the past three months. I need a source of income that doesn't make me feel guilty.

Am I going about this the wrong way? I've only had two other jobs in my past. I did some drafting work for my civil engineer father, and I worked at his friend's gun store on and off for about 5 years. I've never found my own job before except for the freelance design stuff I've been doing which has only made me $350 this semester.

...every time some little thing doesn't go perfectly, I sink down into this crazy depression where I feel like I'm completely useless, can't do anything right, and am a horrible human being. It's like all of my self-worth is tied into achieving perfection and every time I make a mistake, I feel like the scum of the earth. Then, as is usually the case, I spiral down and the accessability of failure makes it even more and more difficult to come out of. Eventually I lose motivation for even trying, simply because I have convinced myself that I will fail no matter what. 

The same thing happens interpersonally. I go out of my way to do nice things for people, to help people when they need it or even appear to want it, and then when I receive a single piece of criticism, all of the good things that I have done or people have said to/about me disappears and all I can do is focus on the negative. 

At other times, I feel like I can accomplish anything and sign up for too many things at a time and end up overloading myself to the point that I crash once again. 

I understand what the problem is, yet I am helpless in actually doing anything about it. It's almost like I watch myself in a movie during my day-to-day life and instead of making my own decisions or actually *doing* things, I just notice myself having done things and watch the experience unfold before me. 

I guess I'm just wondering if anyone else experiences this, and if so, how do you cope? If I focus too much on the positive, I overextend myself and end up failing. When I fail, I lose motivation and give up trying. Vicious cycle."

The problem is I'm really not sure how much I'll be traveling while I'm working. I'd like to visit a number of German cities (Hamburg, Berlin, Dresden, Frankfurt, Köln, maybe München...) as well as Amsterdam, all during the weekends/holidays.  

Should I expect to need the train any more than on these occasions? I really have no idea how often German students use the train - perhaps University of Lüneburg students go to Hamburg every week as it's only a half hour away. In this case I'd probably need an unlimited pass.  

I plan to do some additional traveling after I'm finished with my work assignment. Here is my plan as of now, assuming I don't need an unlimited pass:  
Eurail: Benelux-Germany, 10 days within 2 months ($409) --&gt; For first two months   
Eurail: Select Pass 5 Countries, 10 days within 2 months ($549) --&gt; For last month and change  
          Germany, Austria, Italy, Switzerland, France  

What do you think? Is this a good plan? or should I anticipate needing an unlimited pass? Perhaps I should consider a German Rail Pass (25 or 50?). Also, should I purchase my pass before I leave or once I arrive? (I'm not sure if interning at the University of Lüneburg could get me a better rate).

I'm a 25 year old transfer student (3rd year of 5 working towards a BS in computer science and a BA in theoretical linguistics) who's about to try to apply to some internships over the summer.

Now, I have a resumé already, but it's geared towards 'day job' type things, the stuff I did ages 18-24 (barista, sales rep). Basically, I don't have any work experience in the field that I'm trying to get the internship in; but that's the point, right?

So, my question is: how do I best represent myself in these settings? Mention that I'm a bit older and maybe more mature than the competition? Or does that sort of raise the question of why it took me so long to get my act together and get to school? Mention previous jobs? Or do people in technical fields look down on menial job/service industry stuff enough that it would harm my chances rather than help them?

Is there anything I should know about the process? Any protips from people who have done this before (or even people who hire for this sort of position)?

Thanks in advance for any help!

gy7j2,0,2011-04-26,I’m two years out of college and disillusionment is a brickload on my chest. How do I find a decent employer?,[deleted],AskReddit,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/gy7j2/im_two_years_out_of_college_and_disillusionment/,"I get plenty of interviews and job offers, but every one so far has turned out to be malicious in one way or another. Please advise me.

My backstory: After getting a BA in English --I know, this is where I screwed up. Please spare the obvious-- from Wittenberg University in Ohio, I enrolled in a six-week master’s level program in publishing at the Denver Publishing Institute. After that, I moved to the DC area to live and work close to my sister, who just had a baby. Most of the work around here is through government contractors, and aside from the part-time jobs I took while I was getting on my feet, I’ve been both a proposal writer and a technical writer. I’m good too. I’ll limit my bragging to the fact that during my first six months as a proposal writer, one of my proposals won a 10 million dollar contract and created thirteen jobs.

The big lesson from my proposal writing job was to get a realistic picture of the company's expectations of hours and their feelings on work/life balance up front. In interviews, I ask about the average hours for similar positions and how the company manages comp time. I also try to talk to actual employees whenever possible. Any job that doesn't want you to wander around and talk to the employees after your interview does so for a reason; they don't want the employees scaring you off. And that SHOULD scare you off. The abridged story of that job should explain the justification for these things.

I worked in a back office as a proposal writer for a firm that focused mainly on defense contracts. I thought that I had bombed the interview because I brought in the wrong writing sample, but I got a job offer the next week. That’s when I should’ve known. I started out as an intern and for the most part was limited to forty hours a week. It was obvious the full-time writers stayed much later. The management explained this in the interview: ""There are times when we're busier than others, but there are lulls in between peaks."" I figured that when I started full-time, I'd be working a little later during busy seasons like when proposals peaked.  

A little later? Let’s pause on the hours for a second and consider that I had an hour and a half commute one way to this job.  After they brought me on full-time, I started working ten hour days nearly every day, every week. There was no fluctuation in workload like they'd said; we were busy all the time. I woke up at 5:30 for work and any time I managed to escape work before 5 PM seemed like a jinx that would bring on a night where I didn't leave until 10 or 11.

I tried to tell my bosses I was getting burned out.  I needed a better work/life balance, and they kept promising that they'd try to manage our workloads a little better. I noticed no difference. I was averaging at least fifty hours a week, leaving my house at 6:20 in the morning, every morning, and usually not getting back until 8 or 9 at night. I'd get home, shower, maybe eat, go to sleep, and get up to do the same thing. After a night where I didn't get out of the office until 11:30 and had to still be in by 7 the next day, I started to feel like I was going nuts.

The next week, one of my coworkers was sick. She took Monday off to recover and worked twelve hour days for the rest of the week so that she wouldn't have to use PTO for her sick day. Our boss had said that this was fine; HR had something else to say about it. Even after our boss approved it, they made her take the PTO for that day, disregarding the fact that she'd stayed even later than normal to make up for it. Our boss didn't stick up for her. I quit.

I had to leave that job before finding another because I would have never had time to look for one during my rigorous schedule, much less interview. I had only banked a month’s pay at that point, so I had to move quickly... but it was worth it.

My second foray into the crazy, dishonest world of government contract work was technical writing. The tl;dr on this one: After I scanned over all the documents and emails that I'd kept, trying to find that golden line that stated how long our training and temp status was supposed to be, I found nothing. They had fed us half-truths verbally in the interview and never put any of it in writing. That's the lesson from this job: Get everything that they promise in writing. If it's not in writing, you ain't gettin' it.

I was originally thrilled about this job because I was actually on contract, not in a back office, and was only allowed to work forty hours a week. It seemed like heaven. During the interview, they told me that I'd have to go through a one month training period and that I'd be on temporary status while training. This meant a low hourly rate and no benefits. So I thought, “One month? That's not bad.” When I got to the job site and spoke to the manager, I found out that the training period was actually three months. Ok, so I was less pleased about that, but I'd already accepted the job and figured three months wouldn't kill me. There were four other people hired for the same position, and we were all in the same boat. We’d all heard the same things during the interview process. We kept hearing about this big 90-day review, and connected it to the end of our three month training period. 90 days go by and we hear that a 90-day review is really only for full time employees and that ours would be an informal review to give us some feedback on our work. It was during these interviews that we learned that they had no intention of considering us for full-time positions until they knew if the contract was getting renewed in September. No health insurance. No bump in pay grade. That might change, but there’s no guarantee. They told us that thinking we’d get full time status after 90 days was a “misunderstanding,” but how do five people from five separate interviews all have the same “misunderstanding?”

I'm interviewing for new jobs because there's no way that I can keep putting off my student loans and living like a beggar until September for a job I don't even know I'll get. Last week, I had an interview that turned into a job offer. I had to decline because I noticed some huge red flags:

* They based their salary offer on what I told them I make at my current job, even though their job has a broader scope and more responsibilities.

* They mentioned in the offer letter, but not in the interview, that I’d need security clearance. When I attempted to renegotiate salary based on this, they refused.

* During the interview, they danced around all of my questions about average hours per week and comp time. The emails containing the offer letter and responses to my renegotiation requests were also sent way outside of normal business hours.

It's a shame because this place is a ten minute commute from my apartment, which would have been really nice. That perk, while huge, is negated if I have to work through dinner.

So where are all the good, decent companies that want to keep their employees happy? Are there companies who employ technical writers or proposal writers that don't suffer from high turnover rates? How do I find a company that won’t try to burn me out to make a buck? Thanks to my experience I know a little more about avoiding the bad companies, but I don't want to waste my time in interviews with them. I could sure use a little help and advice."

I have the stupidest problem ever when it comes to internships, two of the three companies I've interviewed with have decided not to offer me an internship, but have offered me full-time positions instead. Sadly, I'm still in university, and I'm not really willing to drop out and move to California permanently.

So about me: I'm a freshman studying CS at University of Washington. I've been writing code for about 8 years on my own, and I have a 4.0 in every programming class I've taken to date as a result. Last year (my senior year in High School) I interned at Microsoft Research, where I published two conference papers (I'm first author on both), and the year before I worked at a [startup near my house](http://www.atigeo.com).

I'm willing to relocate for an internship so long as either the pay is reasonable enough to cover the housing situation, or there's some stipend for that. (Most of the other places I've applied have been in the latter.) Or if this is in the Seattle area, even better :)

If you can do anything, let me know and I'll send over my resume. :D You can email me at tyler@menez.es if you'd prefer.

So needless to say, since I'm a full time student, I've been watching these with some trees the last few weeks.

It seems to me that these shows are most comparable to the  gladiator fights of ancient Rome. I had this original thought reading the IAMA Maury Intern a few days ago. She said that the show isn't so much racially exploitative as much as it is exploitative of our lower social class. She also said the guests get paid a small amount of money ($150) and they are encouraged and amped up to fight before the show.

So, in essence, we are putting our lower class on stage in front of an audience to fight each other; verbally as is most accepted these days, but often they break into the physical. To complete the comparison the audience is constantly booing or clapping in the most basic of reactions to complicated situations, and they seem to follow the gist of whoever is playing the Emperor role (be it Jerry Springer, Maury, or Steve.)

So, someone should make me a picture of Joaquin Phoenix in Gladiator with his thumb in the middle position and put Maury's face on it. It will be a wonderful piece of social commentary, and I think I'd enjoy it in my current state.

Why don't I do it? Too busy with my trees. :)"

I have been getting As on everything till this point, all homework, quizzes and tests have been 90 or greater. My code compiles correctly and I have just one logical error in the code, which has now been fixed. My teacher took off 50% from my midterm grade because of this single error.

I have been fucking livid since I got my grade back, this would never happen on a math test. This takes out 7.5% of the total points for the class. I sent him an email asking if I can fix it and at least get credit for the code after the error. I haven't been sleeping well, I just barely made it to class that day and had a rather huge panic attack during the midterm.

I need some advice on how to handle this situation, I want to stay in the good graces of the faculty since it can get me an internship and I want my grades to be accurate to my abilities.

I am a pretty decent 20m college student.

I couldnt simply uninstall and reinstall due to Adobes DRM so I asked my sister to loan me her Macbook Pro. I used it and got my project done. My sister (Annie) took the computer back. I asked for it again to remove some files I was needing and noticed that my sister just closed out her browser and didnt log out of her gmail.

You see me and my sister are college students. I work as a workstudy on campus making peanuts on the dollar but it does pay for gas and food so no complaints here. My sister informed me that she landed a job as a blogger and was doing fine with the money. I generally believed her due to her writing background in high school. I never investigated the issue. I would periodically run google searches of her name and never brought up anything.

That was until this past Sunday. I admit that I looked through her email. This was not a big problem for me due to one of other sisters (Linda) almost commiting suicide and if it was not for me and Annies investigation the situation would have not turned out well.

I started noticing that Annie was pulling in an amazing amount of money for simply blogging. She would brag about making $800.00 in two weeks and recently made close to $1500.00. This caused me to become even more suspicious about the whole thing. I found out through her emails that my sister is not a blogger. She is a Cam girl. She performs sexual acts on the screen and people pay her for it. From what I figured out she started off striping but has escalated to other acts.

As you can imagine a million different thoughts and emotions have been racing though me. As her big brother I do not approve of what she is doing. I dont know If I should tell my parents or talk to her on my own. I doubt that me talking to her will change her mind. If I tell my parents then that will ruin her relationship with them. She is quite emotional. If I do nothing and if she fully embraces the lifestyle and that leads to porn or other acts I dont know how I could deal with that.

Let me just get a few things straight. Im not jealous. In fact Im rather angry because my sister made up a huge lie a few months ago that she won an internship to Disney and had to go to Orlando for orientation. She an opportunity of a lifetime and threw it away, or it was a fraud and went for some meeting for the company she works for. My mother had loaned her money for the plane ticket. Also when I finally found out about who she works for I went into her chat room. It basically works like this. There is chat room and they all have access to the girls webcamera. Every one in the room can tip her and she can flash or do whatever she wants to get more tips from the chat room participants. I went into her room once I found her user name and she conducts her shows from my mothers house and will talk to and call my mother from her phone while on camera. I see that as very disrespectful. On top of that my mother gives me a hard time cause I cant bank money while my sister can.

I honestly dont know what to do. Im just asking for some advice and if there are any former cam girls offer your advice as well. I understand that its her life and she has the right to do whatever she wants with it. She is 19 years old. I just think that it will lead to a desructive lifestyle and future. She's already hinting that she is not going back to school next semester. We are not poor or have a hard life. She had a full grant to go to college and study anything she wanted. She was living on campus and was doing well her first semester. The thought of fame and fortune have clouded her thoughts. Just looking for your thoughts on the situation. Thanks.

I started noticing that Annie was pulling in an amazing amount of money for simply blogging.  She would brag about making $800.00 in two weeks and recently made close to $1500.00.  This caused me to become even more suspicious about the whole thing. I found out through her emails that my sister is not a blogger.  She is a Cam girl.  She performs sexual acts on the screen and people pay her for it.  From what I figured out she started off striping but has escalated to other acts.

As you can imagine a million different thoughts and emotions have been racing though me.  As her big brother I do not approve of what she is doing.  I dont know If I should tell my parents or talk to her on my own.  I doubt that me talking to her will change her mind. If I tell my parents then that will ruin her relationship with them.  She is quite emotional.  If I do nothing and if she fully embraces the lifestyle and that leads to porn or other acts I dont know how I could deal with that.

Let me just get a few things straight. Im not jealous.  In fact Im rather angry because my sister made up a huge lie a few months ago that she won an internship to Disney and had to go to Orlando for orientation.  She an opportunity of a lifetime and threw it away, or it was a fraud and went for some meeting for the company she works for.  My mother had loaned her money for the plane ticket.  Also when I finally found out about who she works for I went into her chat room.  It basically works like this.  There is chat room and they all have access to the girls webcamera.  Every one in the room can tip her and she can flash or do whatever she wants to get more tips from the chat room participants.  I went into her room once I found her user name and she conducts her shows from my mothers house and will talk to and call my mother from her phone while on camera.  I see that as very disrepectful.  On top of that my mother gives me a hard time cause I cant bank money while my sister can.

I honestly dont know what to do.  Im just asking for some advice and if there are any former cam girls offer your advice as well.  I understand that its her life and she has the right to do whatever she wants with it.  She is 19 years old.  I just think that it will lead to a desructive lifestyle and future.  She's already hinting that she is not going back to school next semester.  We are not poor or have a hard life.  She had a full grant to go to college and study anything she wanted.  She was living on campus and was doing well her first semester.  Fame and fortune have clouded her thoughts.  Just looking for your thoughts on the situation. Thanks.  My apologies on any grammar or spelling errors."
h0kwu,9,2011-04-29,Need advice for systems analysis and information security from experienced programmers please.,call_me_happy,learnprogramming,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/h0kwu/need_advice_for_systems_analysis_and_information/,"So I'm a student at a community college and haven't even gotten into classes for my major but I'd like to start learning now so I don't get in over my head.  I'd like to get a degree in Computer and Information Science and then continue with a Masters degree.  I hope to begin a career in information security whether it's corporate, government, or I've even seen internships available with the FBI, CIA, and NSA.  I have done some programming with C++ and Visual Basic back in high school but this was really simple stuff.  I need suggestions on any books, classes, and other websites that might help prepare me mentally for this field.  I also would GREATLY appreciate advice from any of you that have experience in systems analysis and information security.  I'm particularly interested in what programming languages I should begin familiarizing myself with and how they relate to the previously mentioned fields.  Thanks in advance to all replies.  I look forward to reading them all and hope to respond to all comments."
